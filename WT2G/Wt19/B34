Executive Memorandum #355<BR>

<P>



     The Clinton Administration last week sent legislation to Capitol
Hill to create federal enterprise zones in depressed inner-city and
rural communities. With a record of success in 36 states over the last
decade, and strong bipartisan support for federal legislation,
enterprise zone proponents might have expected a bold measure based
firmly on the key principles of the concept. 
<P>
     But the White House package has little in common with the
enterprise zone idea. It is little wonder that a frustrated Senator
Joseph Lieberman, the Connecticut Democrat who co-sponsored enterprise
zone legislation in the last Congress, felt impelled to take to the
Senate floor to express his disappointment with the Clinton plan.
Lieberman complained that the enterprise zone provisions "show a
fundamental misunderstanding of the enterprise zone concept and the
reasons why so many of America's poorer areas have reached the point
of decay that they now experience." The White House package is, in
fact, just another dose of Washington-directed inner-city industrial
policy -- of the kind that has hastened the decline of America's
cities. The Clinton program actually is worse than nothing, because
state officials will be induced to adopt the Administration's
misguided view of economic development as the price for questionable
benefits.
<P>
     The enterprise zone concept was introduced in 1979 as a radical
alternative to decades of ineffective inner-city programs. These
earlier programs, from "model cities" and "urban renewal" to "urban
development action grants," assumed that Washington knew the solution
to urban decline. Learning from the failure of this earlier approach,
the enterprise zone approach is founded on three central principles:
<P>
Even depressed neighborhoods possess the seeds of economic
     development. The vibrant economic activity which once
     characterized inner cities does not occur today in large part
     because the "entry costs" of opening a legitimate business have
     been increased by heavy taxation and an explosion of federal,
     state, and local regulation. Thus in an enterprise zone, taxes
     and regulation are sharply cut to encourage entrepreneurs to take
     the risk of starting a business in a depressed community.
<P>
Entrepreneurs risking their own money are more likely than a committee
     of government bureaucrats to come up with the right mix of
     ventures to spark economic improvement. Thus the enterprise zone
     concept is the antithesis of government development
     micromanagement. Rather than tear down and replace buildings, or
     pick and choose firms to locate in an area, government would
     remove costly impediments and then allow entrepreneurs the
     maximum freedom to experiment within existing facilities.
<P>
Small, new businesses are the engines of job growth in the economy --
     especially in the inner city. Such businesses are the ideal
     ventures for the uncertain markets and generally less-skilled
     workforce in depressed neighborhoods. The enterprise zone thus
     focuses on reducing the costs and problems of these firms,
     including local regulation and labor taxes, and it provides
     incentives to encourage investors to risk their capital in small,
     new firms.
<P>
     These are the elements undergirding the system of state
enterprise zones now in 36 states, responsible over the last decade
for generating an estimated 250,000 jobs and $28 billion in
investment. Federal legislation has been considered necessary
primarily to deepen the investment incentives in zones, since states
can do relatively little to address taxes on capital.
<P>
     The Clinton Administration's proposal, however, has almost
nothing in common with the enterprise zone concept, or the experience
and needs of the states, or the federal enterprise zone bills
previously introduced. 
<P>
Example: The White House still sees enterprise zones as experimental,
     despite the successes of state zones. Clinton would establish
     just ten "empowerment zones," with only six of these in urban
     areas. One hundred "enterprise communities" also would be
     established, but these would have few enterprise incentives, and
     would seem to be merely targets for a plethora of federal
     spending programs.
<P>
Example: The zones would be micromanaged from Washington. To obtain a
     federal designation (and thus tax incentives) state and local
     officials would have to supply a federal "Enterprise Board" with
     full details of a "coordinated economic, human, community and
     physical development plan" for the zone. This would have to
     contain information on such things as who was involved in the
     planning process, what public and private resources would be
     committed, and precisely what institutions would assist in
     development activities. Washington would then approve or turn
     down the detailed plan. Clinton Administration officials, in
     other words, would force their views on local communities -- the
     very top-down bureaucratic planning the enterprise zone idea was
     meant to end.
<P>
Example: The zone incentives are not right for start-up small firms.
     The Clinton incentives are aimed predominantly at labor costs,
     and generally are useful only to firms with a large income tax
     liability. Even the capital incentives, mainly expensing and
     accelerated depreciation, generally can be used only by
     profitable firms. But new, small firms in a zone usually make no
     profits in their early years, and so cannot use these incentives.
     What they need is investor incentives, such as capital gains
     relief, to encourage others to provide them with seed capital. "I
     cannot adequately stress the importance of capital incentives,"
     said Senator Lieberman in his criticism of the Clinton program,
     "... they must be targeted toward small business."
<P>
     As a presidential candidate, Clinton praised then-Housing and
Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp, and emphasized his support for
Kemp's enterprise zone legislation. As President, however, Clinton's
own legislation discards the bipartisan Kemp approach, except for
borrowing Kemp's terminology. Indeed it stands the whole enterprise
zone idea on its head. Enterprise zones were meant to rid the inner
cities of suffocating bureaucracy and central planning, and instead
give a green light to entrepreneurs with unorthodox ideas. But the
Clinton zones would be shaped by Washington bureaucrats, and
pioneering businessmen and local officials would in effect be forced
to adopt whatever neighborhood development strategies currently were
in vogue in the White House. That is why America's inner cities would
be far better off if Clinton's bizarre vision of enterprise zones
never reached the statute book.

<H2>A Time for Choosing, aka The Speech</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I am going to talk of controversial things. I make no apology
for this.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It's time we asked ourselves if we still know the freedoms intended
for us by the Founding Fathers. James Madison said, &quot;We base
all our experiments on the capacity of mankind for self government.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This idea? that government was beholden to the people, that it
had no other source of power is still the newest, most unique
idea in all the long history of man's relation to man. This is
the issue of this election: Whether we believe in our capacity
for self-government or whether we abandon the American Revolution
and confess that a little intellectual elite in a far-distant
capital can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them
ourselves.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
You and I are told we must choose between a left or right, but
I suggest there is no such thing as a left or right. There is
only an up or down. Up to man's age-old dream-the maximum of individual
freedom consistent with order or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism.
Regardless of their sincerity, their humanitarian motives, those
who would sacrifice freedom for security have embarked on this
downward path. Plutarch warned, &quot;The real destroyer of the
liberties of the people is he who spreads among them bounties,
donations and benefits.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Founding Fathers knew a government can't control the economy
without controlling people. And they knew when a government sets
out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its
purpose. So we have come to a time for choosing.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Public servants say, always with the best of intentions, &quot;What
greater service we could render if only we had a little more money
and a little more power.&quot; But the truth is that outside of
its legitimate function, government does nothing as well or as
economically as the private sector.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Yet any time you and I question the schemes of the do-gooders,
we're denounced as being opposed to their humanitarian goals.
It seems impossible to legitimately debate their solutions with
the assumption that all of us share the desire to help the less
fortunate. They tell us we're always &quot;against,&quot; never
&quot;for&quot; anything.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We are for a provision that destitution should not follow unemployment
by reason of old age, and to that end we have accepted Social
Security as a step toward meeting the problem. However, we are
against those entrusted with this program when they practice deception
regarding its fiscal shortcomings, when they charge that any criticism
of the program means that we want to end payments....
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We are for aiding our allies by sharing our material blessings
with nations which share our fundamental beliefs, but we are against
doling out money government to government, creating bureaucracy,
if not socialism, all over the world.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We need true tax reform that will at least make a start toward
I restoring for our children the American Dream that wealth is
denied to no one, that each individual has the right to fly as
high as his strength and ability will take him.... But we can
not have such reform while our tax policy is engineered by people
who view the tax as a means of achieving changes in our social
structure....
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Have we the courage and the will to face up to the immorality
and discrimination of the progressive tax, and demand a return
to traditional proportionate taxation? . . . Today in our country
the tax collector's share is 37 cents of -very dollar earned.
Freedom has never been so fragile, so close to slipping from our
grasp.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Are you willing to spend time studying the issues, making yourself
aware, and then conveying that information to family and friends?
Will you resist the temptation to get a government handout for
your community? Realize that the doctor's fight against socialized
medicine is your fight. We can't socialize the doctors without
socializing the patients. Recognize that government invasion of
public power is eventually an assault upon your own business.
If some among you fear taking a stand because you are afraid of
reprisals from customers, clients, or even government, recognize
that you are just feeding the crocodile hoping he'll eat you last.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
If all of this seems like a great deal of trouble, think what's
at stake. We are faced with the most evil enemy mankind has known
in his long climb from the swamp to the stars. There can be no
security anywhere in the free world if there is no fiscal and
economic stability within the United States. Those who ask us
to trade our freedom for the soup kitchen of the welfare state
are architects of a policy of accommodation.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
They say the world has become too complex for simple answers.
They are wrong. There are no easy answers, but there are simple
answers. We must have the courage to do what we know is morally
right. Winston Churchill said that &quot;the destiny of man is
not measured by material computation. When great forces are on
the move in the world, we learn we are spirits-not animals.&quot;
And he said, &quot;There is something going on in time and space,
and beyond time and space, which, whether we like it or not, spells
duty.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
You and I have a rendezvous with destiny. We will preserve for
our children this, the last best hope of man on earth, or we will
sentence them to take the first step into a thousand years of
darkness. If we fail, at least let our children and our children's
children say of us we justified our brief moment here. We did
all that could be done.

<H2>President Reagan's Speech at Pointe de Hoc</H2>
<HR>

<P>
Ronald Reagan -- Pointe de Hoc, Normandy, June 6, 1984 (The 40th
anniversary of D-Day) <HR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We're here to mark that day in history when the Allied peoples
joined in battle to reclaim this continent to liberty. For four
long years, much of Europe had been under a terrible shadow. Free
nations had fallen, Jews cried out in the camps, millions cried
out for liberation. Europe was enslaved, and the world prayed
for its rescue. Here in Normandy the rescue began. Here the Allies
stood and fought against tyranny in a giant undertaking unparalleled
in human history.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We stand on a lonely, windswept point on the northern shore of
France. The air is soft, but forty years ago at this moment, the
air was dense with smoke and the cries of men, and the air was
filled with the crack of rifle fire and the roar of cannon. At
dawn, on the morning of the 6th of June 1944, 225 Rangers jumped
off the British landing craft and ran to the bottom of these cliffs.
Their mission was one of the most difficult and daring of the
invasion: to climb these sheer and desolate cliffs and take out
the enemy guns. The Allies had been told that some of the mightiest
of these guns were here and they would be trained on the beaches
to stop the Allied advance.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Rangers looked up and saw the enemy soldiers -- at the edge
of the cliffs shooting down at them with machine-guns and throwing
grenades. And the American Rangers began to climb. They shot rope
ladders over the face of these cliffs and began to pull themselves
up. When one Ranger fell, another would take his place. When one
rope was cut, a Ranger would grab another and begin his climb
again. They climbed, shot back, and held their footing. Soon,
one by one, the Rangers pulled themselves over the top, and in
seizing the firm land at the top of these cliffs, they began to
seize back the continent of Europe. Two hundred and twenty-five
came here. After two days of fighting only ninety could still
bear arms.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Behind me is a memorial that symbolizes the Ranger daggers that
were thrust into the top of these cliffs. And before me are the
men who put them there.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
These are the boys of Pointe du Hoc. These are the men who took
the cliffs. These are the champions who helped free a continent.
These are the heroes who helped end a war.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Gentlemen, I look at you and I think of the words of Stephen Spender's
poem. You are men who in your 'lives fought for life...and left
the vivid air signed with your honor'...
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Forty summers have passed since the battle that you fought here.
You were young the day you took these cliffs; some of you were
hardly more than boys, with the deepest joys of life before you.
Yet you risked everything here. Why? Why did you do it? What impelled
you to put aside the instinct for self-preservation and risk your
lives to take these cliffs? What inspired all the men of the armies
that met here? We look at you, and somehow we know the answer.
It was faith, and belief; it was loyalty and love.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The men of Normandy had faith that what they were doing was right,
faith that they fought for all humanity, faith that a just God
would grant them mercy on this beachhead or on the next. It was
the deep knowledge -- and pray God we have not lost it -- that
there is a profound moral difference between the use of force
for liberation and the use of force for conquest. You were here
to liberate, not to conquer, and so you and those others did not
doubt your cause. And you were right not to doubt.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
You all knew that some things are worth dying for. One's country
is worth dying for, and democracy is worth dying for, because
it's the most deeply honorable form of government ever devised
by man. All of you loved liberty. All of you were willing to fight
tyranny, and you knew the people of your countries were behind
you.

<TITLE>HOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CONTRIBUTES TO POOR QUALITY TV PROGRAMS
 -- Heritage </TITLE>


<CENTER><H3><I>HOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CONTRIBUTES TO POOR QUALITY TV PROGRAMS</I></H3>
<P>

Executive Memorandum #297<BR>
3/4/91<P>
</CENTER><HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>

     American TV viewers often complain about the poor quality of
programs on the three major broadcast networks, ABC, CBS, and NBC.
Much of the blame for this lies in part with rules imposed in 1970 by
the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The Financial Interest
and Syndication Rules, widely known as "Fin-Syn," prohibit the
broadcast networks from acquiring even a share of the programs that
they broadcast, and from sharing in the profits generated by a
program's re-runs or "syndication." Cable TV networks, by contrast,
are free from the Fin-Syn restrictions. The two-decade old rules have
been a bonanza for the large studios that make most of the programs,
yet have penalized American TV viewers. Under these rules, the
networks have little incentive to finance production of high quality
programs that may make money in re-runs but are almost certain to lose
money initially. The Fin-Syn rules have become an anachronism that
prevents the healthy competition which would improve the quality of
TV. The FCC is reviewing these rules, and will make a decision soon.
In a recent letter to Congress on the Fin-Syn rules, White House Chief
of Staff John Sununu reiterated the Administration's "aversion to
unnecessary government interference with private markets" and its
long-standing "opposition to the government's picking winners and
losers." The FCC would do well to be guided by these principles. The
only course of action that will benefit the television-viewing public
and restore competition to the industry is the complete repeal of Fin-
Syn.
<P>
     Good Intentions Backfire. The development of television
programming is expensive and risky. It is very difficult to predict
whether a show will be a hit or a flop, and thus whether it will
generate enough advertising revenue to cover production costs, much
less make a profit. Even many popular TV programs show no profit until
after they have gone into syndication, that is, are re-run off-
network. An independent producer with an idea for a new television
program usually will need to obtain outside financing, either from a
network or from one of the major Hollywood studios.
<P>

     Before 1970, the networks customarily received a percentage of
the syndication profits in return for the funding they provided for
producing a TV program. This seemed fair. After all, the networks in
large part create the syndication market anyway: without first-run
showings, there would be no demand for second-run showings. The FCC,
however, began viewing this practice as inefficient and a lopsided
arrangement which allowed the networks to exploit producers,
especially the small, independent operators. Therefore, in 1970, the
FCC prohibited the networks from acquiring any interest in the
programs whose development they finance.
<P>
     As it has turned out, Fin-Syn does not benefit the small,
independent producers of television programming. By making it
unattractive for the networks to finance productions at small firms,
since the networks cannot earn anything from syndication, Fin-Syn
restrictions force these smaller enterprises to sell the syndication
rights of their programs to major studios. And because the networks
are prevented from competing with the major studios, independent
programming producers have fewer potential sources of finance. The
result: independent producers are at a bargaining disadvantage, and
hence they must give up to the studios an even larger share of future
program profits to obtain studio funding.
<P>
     Protecting Goliath against David. When the Fin-Syn restrictions
were adopted, the networks had about 90 percent of the prime-time
television market. With the emergence of competing technologies, such
as cable TV, satellites, and video rentals, however, the clout of the
networks has eroded. Today the networks' share of prime-time viewing
is only about 60 percent or so, with no one network having more than
about 20 percent. At the same time, the share of prime-time
programming provided by the eight largest Hollywood studios has soared
from 39 percent in 1970 to over 70 percent today. Thus, while the FCC
may have thought it was protecting David against Goliath when it sided
with the studios against the networks, just the opposite turned out to
be the case.
<P>
     Another major beneficiary of the Fin-Syn restrictions is the
large independent producers. Because the rules make it hard for new
producers to enter the market, existing producers face less
competition and hence enjoy greater profits and power. Before the Fin-
Syn restrictions were adopted, there were 52 independent production
companies supplying series to the networks; in 1980 there were 26.
Today there are nine. Many small producers are employed by big
studios. It comes as no surprise that this handful of remaining
producers support Fin-Syn, for the FCC rule keeps potential upstart
competitors out of the market.
<P>
     The Fin-Syn restrictions do not apply to cable TV. Thus, cable
networks can purchase and own programs and movies, and afford to pay
more for a new program because their ability to recoup their
investment and eventually make a profit is not restricted. This means
they can obtain the programs while the three broadcast networks have
their hands tied. 
<P>
      The ultimate victim of the Fin-Syn restrictions is the viewing
public. Because the networks find it unprofitable or too risky to
finance high-quality programs that might not make money before they
run in syndication, the supply of such programs is artificially
restricted. The result: reduced quality and diversity of programs for
viewers to choose from. 
<P>
      Restoring Networks' Freedom. The 1970 Fin-Syn rules have not
served the public interest. They have reduced competition rather than
expanded it, and have helped large firms rather than small. For these
reasons, the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division and the
Federal Trade Commission, the two federal agencies responsible for
protecting competition and consumers, both strongly oppose keeping
Fin-Syn restrictions in any form. As the Department of Justice stated
in comments it filed with the FCC, "the major effect of the Fin-Syn
rules today is to hinder the efficient operation of the free market."
The Federal Trade Commission, the Justice Department and the White
House are right. Consumers of TV programs would be better off if the
FCC would revoke the harmful and failed Financial Interest and
Syndication rules and restore the TV networks' freedom to contract for
programs on any terms acceptable to them and the programs' producers.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	While Members of Congress try to reform Medicare and reduce the paperwork burden on doctors and patients, they also should realize that doctors' medical laboratories are caught in a web of government red tape that adds billions of dollars to America's health care costs. This misguided regulatory intervention is based on faulty data; has caused the loss of private, physician-based laboratory testing by thousands of doctors throughout the United States; and has compromised patient access to timely, high quality care for millions of Americans. To eliminate unnecessary regulation of the health care sector of the economy and improve both the productivity and efficiency of patient care, Congress should eliminate the burdens imposed on doctors by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988. This can be done easily within the broader context of Medicare reform.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) constitute the nation's most sweeping regulation of physician-based laboratories. Under CLIA, doctors must submit to regulatory requirements for the simplest and most common tests used in the routine treatment of patients, including tests for pregnancy and strep infections. According to the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) agency that administers Medicare, Medicaid, and CLIA, implementation of CLIA adds between $1.2 billion and $2.1 billion annually to the cost of performing clinical laboratory tests in doctors' offices.<sup>2</sup> To the extent that they are aware of them at all, most taxpayers probably think laboratory regulations affect research centers, hospitals, or other facilities staffed by white-coated researchers in sterile rooms filled with exotic equipment. CLIA applies to these entities, but it also reaches into the two-room doctor's office in New York's central Harlem and the private practice of an internist in Ames, Iowa. As Representative Bill Archer (R-TX), Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has noted:
<blockquote>
	The CLIA restrictions have caused thousands of physicians to discontinue all or some portion of essential clinical laboratory testing in their offices. This creates a barrier to patient compliance with diagnostic treatment protocols and causes patient inconvenience. For example, for many tests a patient must be referred to an outside laboratory to have a specimen taken and tested. This poses a substantial hardship for many patients, most notably the elderly, the disabled and families who live in underserved areas. Often times, these patients cannot travel or find someone to take them to these facilities. The result is that they do not obtain the necessary testing.<sup>3</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Doctors and hospitals must struggle with mountains of government-generated paperwork to comply with thousands of pages of rules, regulations, and guidelines promulgated by the Health Care Financing Administration.<sup>4</sup> As Congress debates Medicare's future, particularly how to ensure its financial solvency and stability, it also must address the impact of these rules and regulations on doctors, hospitals, and private medical practice. Though responsible for only a part of this paperwork burden, CLIA's impact on private medical practice has been significant. Not only is it costly; it has lowered the quality of patient care by causing unnecessary changes in office practice:  inconvenience for doctors and patients alike, decreased patient access, and diagnostic delays.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In recent years, Members of Congress have begun to rethink CLIA. For example, Representative Archer and Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) have introduced legislation to correct CLIA's excesses. Representative Archer's Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act Amendments of 1995 (H.R. 1386) would exempt physicians' office laboratories from CLIA rules. Senator Hutchison has introduced similar legislation (S. 877). To reform the American health care system, especially the bureaucracy that runs federal health programs, Congress should lift this unnecessary burden on the expeditious delivery of high-quality health care.
<p>

<b>THE ROOTS OF LAB REGULATION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	CLIA is rooted in congressional deliberations almost thirty years ago. When Wilbur Cohen, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW), and Dr. D.J. Sencer, Director of the U.S. Public Health Service's Communicable Disease Center, appeared before the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce on May 2, 1967, they testified that the error rate in laboratory testing was as high as 25 percent. Secretary Cohen's testimony also included a sensational case of a woman who lost her breast because of a lab error that occurred in 1936.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Dr. F. William Sunderman, noted pathologist and father of the quality control methodology known as proficiency testing,<sup>5</sup> challenged Dr. Sencer's testimony. Along with other noted pathologists, Dr. Sunderman questioned the statement that "erroneous results are obtained in more than 25 percent of all tests analyzed."  Dr. Sencer responded but included no timely supporting data, except for the results of analyses done by Dr. Sunderman himself 22 years earlier in 1945,<sup>6</sup> before the laboratory profession voluntarily began to conduct proficiency testing.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Based on the archaic data presented by HEW (predecessor of today's HHS) and fueled by the political intervention of Senator Jacob Javits (R-NY) and a front-page story in <I>The New York Times</I>, Congress passed the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment of 1967. Members of the professional medical community protested. Twenty-two pathologists submitted refuting testimony, delineating numerous technical errors in previous HEW testimony, but to no avail.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In 1980, Dr. Joseph Boutwell, Deputy Director of CDC's Bureau of Laboratories, charged that there was a 14 percent error rate in some of the most commonly performed medical tests. Dr. Boutwell eventually admitted his estimates were much too high,<sup>8</sup> but no anxious reporters were waiting to publish the CDC's retraction of the misleading data. The damage had been done. Boutwell's error laid the foundation for a governmental grip on laboratory and medical practice that became increasingly stifling as the 1980s came to a close.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Twenty years after CLIA '67, in 1987 and 1988, federal regulation of laboratories again surfaced with naive and sometimes sensational articles in the <I>Wall Street Journal, New York Times,</I> and <I>Ladies Home Journal</I>. A February 1987 <I>Wall Street Journal</I> article, "False Negative:  Medical Labs, Trusted as Largely Error-Free, Are Far from Infallible," by Walter Bogdanich began, "It was 4:30 a.m. when cancer finally choked the last breath of life from Janice Johnson. She was 34 and the mother of two, and she died never knowing why her disease had been so unforgiving."  Describing this and several other negative outcomes of laboratory error, the story railed against the lack of government regulation of laboratories, focusing on Pap Smears and shopping mall cholesterol screening. Members of Congress held a frenzy of media-oriented hearings. Senator Brock Adams (D-WA) called as a witness a woman who had cancer of the cervix, but an expert reviewer of a preceding malpractice suit indicated that no laboratory error was involved.<sup>9</sup> Unfortunately, no HCFA or CDC witness ever acknowledged that "not only did they already have jurisdiction over the so-called Pap mills, which they did under CLIA '67, but also that they could have closed any one of them at any time if they elected to do so."<sup>10</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The federal regulatory locomotive steamed along with unrelenting speed, and Congress passed CLIA '88. Pamela Nash, Director of Governmental Affairs for the American Association of Clinical Chemists, called it "legislation by anecdote, not by overwhelming evidence, and not by an understanding of this very complex and technical field."<sup>11</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The scope of CLIA '88 is daunting. It includes not only the 13,000 laboratories regulated by CLIA '67, but also an estimated 100,000 to 150,000 physician office labs. CLIA's real significance, however, lies not in its numerical reach, but in its jurisdictional impact. For the first time, Congress established federal authority to regulate the practice of medicine, and the regulatory regime expanded dramatically. Sponsored by Representative John Dingell (D-MI), the eight-page bill led to 1,600 pages of bureaucratic regulation after a three-and-a-half year gestation period.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Congress gave the Department of Health and Human Services the authority, under CLIA, to regulate laboratory testing tools and procedures employed in a physician's office. The agency responsible for drafting the regulations was HHS's Health Care Financing Administration. Despite the fact that many simple and accurate technologies would qualify for a certificate of waiver because so many of these tests "have an insignificant risk of an erroneous result" or "pose no reasonable risk of harm to the patient if performed incorrectly,"<sup>12</sup> only nine tests were exempt. Moreover, HCFA has not proven to be a model of flexibility in granting waivers. As a result, the same paperwork that is required of the megalabs is required of individual physicians.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Physician laboratories that perform only an occasional test for mononucleosis now must conduct two additional control specimens, tripling the cost of the test. Proficiency testing<sup>13</sup> is required for all tests regardless of where they are performed. The list of regulatory requirements is considerable and has prompted a cottage industry of physician office lab consultants. As Michael Jahn, senior editor of the <I>Medical Laboratory Observer</I>, has noted, "With or without extra schooling, CLIA is providing a sizable number of laboratorians with new career options. Nearly one-third of respondents (30%) report that they or a colleague in their laboratory have begun acting as a consultant to POL's (physician office labs) as a result of CLIA."<sup>14</sup>  Few busy physicians could keep up with the reams of regulations and the frequent revisions and additions generated by regulators. In a letter to the White House shortly after the regulations were issued, an Iowa doctor poignantly described his dilemma:  "I have taken what little time I have and consulted laboratory personnel, laboratory directors in larger hospitals, paid and sent for materials explaining the standards, and spent several thousand dollars in equipping and changing our laboratory to meet many of the regulations that are impacting our office at this time."<sup>15</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The final HHS regulations, drafted by HCFA officials, became effective at the end of 1992. In 1993, however, it appeared that even members of the Clinton Administration recognized that CLIA was an unnecessary burden. Initial drafts of Hillary Clinton's health care reform proposal, leaked in September 1993, would have provided substantial "CLIA relief."  But as the health care reform debate intensified, concessions to powerful liberals in Congress led to the unraveling of any CLIA reform efforts on the part of the Administration.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In the meantime, thousands of physicians have closed their simple labs; numerous on-site testing kits and devices, once in the pipeline, have been scrapped; and countless patients have fallen victim to diagnostic delays or, in some areas, to complete lack of access to simple, on-site diagnostic technology. Ironically, though CLIA '88 mandated on-site proficiency testing for technicians interpreting Pap smears -- the very problem that generated the legislation -- this testing still has not been implemented.
<p>



<b>A LAW IN SEARCH OF A PROBLEM</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


	A Personal Observation. One day, after an extended weekend vacation, I returned to my office a little early, knowing that I would be facing a five-day pile of mail. While sifting through test results that had been returned, I came across a positive strep screen. The patient's throat had been only slightly infected, and I had performed a throat culture that was sent out to the reference lab. Had this been 1991, I would have performed a simple strep screen, realized treatment was needed, and sent her on her way, prescription in hand. She had gone untreated for five days, but had not developed rheumatic fever. She was lucky, and I was relieved. Months earlier, we had been advised by hospital laboratory consultants that it would be better to eliminate any test that the CLIA bureaucrats considered "moderately complex" because the cost of complying would be too high. Since we served the poor and the Medicaid population, we knew the projected threefold price increase for doing strep screens under CLIA would be prohibitive. I thought back to my experience in Africa several years earlier. My patients there had access to more on-site testing than patients in my inner-city clinic in 1995. Moreover, my practice was not unique. A January 1994 article in the <I>Journal of the American Medical Association</I> indicated that because of CLIA, almost a quarter of all pediatricians had stopped or had planned to stop office testing for strep infections.<sup>16</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The 1988 legislation mandated that five studies relating to the relevance and impact of CLIA be conducted by 1990,<sup>17</sup> two years before the final regulations were issued. One mandate required HHS to examine the validity, reliability, and accuracy of proficiency testing, something physicians' office labs now must perform three times a year, and at considerable cost, for each non-waived test they conduct on-site. Today, proficiency testing is a multimillion-dollar business, with most of the testing performed by the College of American Pathologists. Another mandate required an examination of the "extent and nature of problems in the diagnosis and treatment of patients caused by inaccurate laboratory test results."<sup>18</sup>  By the time the final regulations were published in 1992, not one of these studies had even been initiated; HHS officials complained no funds had been allocated. Federal bureaucrats were unwilling or unable to spend a few million dollars to conduct research that might have guided the regulatory pen. Nonetheless, HHS officials had no hesitancy about charging ahead with a final regulation that would cost consumers billions of dollars.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In 1992, after issuance of the final regulation, the <I>Archives of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine</I> conducted a literature search to determine the impact of laboratory errors. The "bottom line" question was whether testing errors that occurred in physicians' offices before CLIA '88 resulted in negative health outcomes for patients. The question could not be answered because the data did not exist. Only one hospital-based study even examined the impact of testing errors. Of the 328 patients involved in those incidents, not one was "harmed."<sup>19</sup>  No true outcomes data existed for physicians' offices.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In other words, there are no data showing that patients are harmed as a result of testing in the physician's office as opposed to a reference lab. In fact, recent evidence collected by the Ambulatory Sentinel Practice Network (ASPN) suggests that sending specimens off-site for analysis may increase the likelihood of lab error.<sup>20</sup> Consistent with earlier research, the ASPN found that 83.4 percent of lab test-related problems occurred before or after actual performance of the test itself (pre- or post-analytical); 75 percent of all identified problems occurred in tests referred to an outside laboratory. Of the ten problems judged to have a significant impact on patient care, half occurred because specimens were delayed or lost -- hazards related to transporting specimens to outside labs. The logical interpretation:  Because fewer tests are performed on site, more negative outcomes are likely.
<p>
<b>RISING COSTS</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


	CLIA was not supposed to add to America's tax burden, but recent HHS budgets have seen millions of dollars allocated to various agencies for CLIA-related costs. Because physicians and laboratories must assume the many extra costs attached to CLIA, charges are likely to be passed on to working families, adding to the health care cost-shifting they already experience from Medicare and Medicaid. Of course, HCFA officials know this:  "The final rule will significantly increase the operating expenses of the nation's laboratory industry -- perhaps by as much as 6% per year. Most laboratories will successfully pass on these cost increases to patients and other consumers of their services."<sup>21</sup>  Officials felt they could even predict how "willing" the public was to pay the extra costs:  "We project that non-poor American households may be willing to pay anywhere from 5 percent to 25 percent more for laboratory services.... "<sup>22</sup> At the same time, however, "many physician offices may see their laboratory costs increase by 10 percent or more--and the cost of an average test rise in excess of a dollar."<sup>23</sup>  HCFA's glib analysis reflects government's failure to understand "real world America."  With medical overhead costs already running over 60 percent and tens of millions of uninsured unable to pay for basic health care, CLIA has forced tens of thousands of physicians' office labs to curtail their operations or shut down altogether.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Though HCFA officials acknowledged that CLIA would add $1.2 billion to $2.1 billion to America's health care cost burden in 1994 alone, and even more in later years,<sup>24</sup> they failed to account for many other cost factors:<ul>

<p><li>Abrupt changes in practice patterns and the number of POLs that would cease operation;

<p><li>The cost of return visits to have test results, previously often available at the time of the initial visit, explained and a treatment regimen advanced or initiated;

<p><li>Unnecessary hospitalizations and emergency room visits when a physician cannot perform certain tests in the office because of excessive administrative and regulatory costs;

<p><li>Increased morbidity and complication rates from diagnostic delays and difficulties in notifying patients of serious problems because tests now are sent out and the results not returned until at least the next day; and

<p><li>The dramatic market shift that would make this new technology inaccessible.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Yet these officials did not hesitate to impose a multibillion-dollar regulatory burden even though "These cost increases may reduce the ability of certain already-financially burdened providers to deliver services, and of the poor, uninsured, and underinsured to obtain needed care."<sup>25</sup>  And they showed no hesitation over imposing substantial administrative "hassles" even though "there exists no irrefutable evidence demonstrating that the clinical laboratories or public health status will improve tangibly under our regulation."<sup>26</sup>  Even HCFA officials concede that CLIA rules are expensive. But, given the dramatic change in physician office labs and the testing device industry, it may be impossible to quantify their broad financial impact.

<p>
<b>ADDITIONAL PAPERWORK FOR DOCTORS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	An ancillary benefit of the national debate on the future of Medicare, the huge and financially troubled government insurance program that covers approximately 38 million elderly and disabled Americans, is that taxpayers finally are learning about the mountain of paperwork generated by this bureaucratic system. According to Nancy Dickey, M.D., a practicing family physician and Vice Chair of the Board of Trustees of the American Medical Association (AMA), "It has been estimated that physicians now spend over 25 percent of their time processing paperwork and complying with the technical requirements of an unending blizzard of Medicare regulations. This is time that could be used more productively treating patients."<sup>27</sup>  This burden has been growing without interruption for many years. In a survey conducted by Louis Harris and Associates on behalf of the Physician Payment Review Commission (PPRC), an independent panel that advises Congress on physician payment in the Medicare program, seven out of ten physicians expressed deep concern over administrative "hassles" and further expressed the view that "red tape" is worse in Medicare than in any other insurance plan, including managed care plans and Medicaid.<sup>28</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	CLIA's regulations are making matters even worse, yet there is no evidence additional lab regulations, paperwork requirements, costs, inspections, and proficiency testing improve the quality of medical care. The Texas Medical Association surveyed Texas physicians in 1994 to determine whether they felt CLIA improved quality. Sixty-eight percent said "no," and only 7 percent responded affirmatively. An American Association of Dermatology survey yielded even more striking results:  97 percent of respondents saying CLIA did not improve accuracy and 82 percent expressing the opinion that CLIA "reduced the overall quality of care."  These sentiments are not confined to doctors. According to a 1994 survey published in <I>Medical Laboratory Observer,</I> "Roughly two out of three laboratorians feel CLIA has failed to improve the quality of patient care and has adversely affected the clinical laboratory profession."<sup>29</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Some professional medical organizations have attempted to help physicians comply with CLIA rules by publishing "How To" manuals. These manuals, often inches thick, describe the tedious documentation required under CLIA. Keeping up can be a full-time job. HCFA's voluminous regulations constantly germinate and spawn revisions, retractions, and additions. The Texas Medical Association analyzed the labor and administrative overhead resulting from implementation of CLIA and discovered that added costs average $10,000 per year per physician office lab site, with one three-person practice running additional costs of $36,000.<sup>30</sup>
<p>

<b>CLIA'S IMPACT ON MEDICAL PRACTICE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Taxpayers should realize that, in principle, CLIA '88 represents a profound change in federal policy. It is the first time the government has succeeded in planting its foot in the physician's office to regulate the everyday practice of medicine. This forerunner of government-run medicine should not be dismissed lightly.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Physicians consider testing devices "tools of the trade" in much the same sense as a stethoscope, blood pressure cuff, or thermometer. They use laboratory tests to confirm what they already expect as a result of their clinical judgment. An ophthalmoscope is an instrument a physician uses to look at the back of a patient's eyeball. What the doctor sees there can reveal many things about the patient. In principle, a physician's use of a microscope to look at blood from that same patient should be regulated no more than his use of an ophthalmosscope or a stethoscope. All are tools that allow the physician to develop a more complete picture of the patient. The ironies are innumerable. A dermatologist may inspect a skin lesion with a magnifying glass or under a special fluorescent light (Wood's lamp), but scraping off a few flakes of skin to examine under a microscope is a federally regulated lab activity. But most patient laboratory testing errors are not caused by the testing device or procedure itself (7.3 percent); they are attributable to events occurring before (preanalytic, 45.5 percent) or after (postanalytic, 47.2 percent) the test itself was performed.<sup>31</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Lab Closures. It is estimated that 50 percent of all laboratory testing occurs on an outpatient basis. Before CLIA '88, physician office laboratories were the most rapidly expanding segment of the laboratory industry, representing about half of all outpatient lab testing in 1986.<sup>32</sup> The projected annual growth rate for this sector was about 16 percent through 1990.<sup>33</sup> According to recent CDC data, of an annual total of 4.2 billion tests, physicians' offices now perform 294 million per year, or only 7 percent of the total.<sup>34</sup> Pre-CLIA projections were for 2.7 billion tests performed in physicians' offices.<sup>35</sup> By all estimates,<sup>36</sup> the 1994 CDC data represent a dramatic departure from predictions just a few years earlier and have stunning implications for the future of the market. The American Academy of Family Physicians noticed a particularly steep drop. When asked, "Do you perform <I>any</I> clinical laboratory tests in your office?"  only 78.9 percent responded that they did. A few years earlier, the same question elicited a 93 percent affirmative response.<sup>37</sup>

	The 1994 Texas Medical Association study found that CLIA's impact was greatest among the primary care specialties. Thirty percent of Texas family physicians and general practitioners, 19 percent of pediatricians, and 20 percent of OB/GYNs have closed their labs because of CLIA,<sup>38</sup> while 57 percent of OB/GYNs, family physicians, and GPs and 59 percent of pediatricians have stopped doing some tests because of CLIA. The American Academy of Dermatology found the same thing when it surveyed its members at a February 1995 conference:  75 percent of dermatologists had eliminated testing altogether or cut the number of tests they did in their offices, while 82 percent felt CLIA led to a reduction in the overall quality of care.<sup>39</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	  Factors other than CLIA, such as the growth of managed care, are often cited as responsible for this shift in practice patterns. However, in a survey of family physicians, among those who felt their in-office testing capabilities were insufficient to meet the needs of their patients, "too much government red tape" was mentioned by over 90 percent as the main reason.<sup>40</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Advances in lab technology were promising before CLIA '88. The development of highly accurate test kits and devices, as simple to use as home pregnancy testing devices and home blood sugar monitors, was skyrocketing. These testing devices were subject to rigorous FDA approval standards. But with imposition of CLIA '88, potential markets for the promising new technology quickly disappeared. Some large companies abruptly changed course. Some persevered, finding new markets for their on-site diagnostic tests in European and Third World countries.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Consider the computer industry. In the beginning, there were the big mainframes. Giant computer "brains" were needed to store masses of data that now can be stored in a small shoe box-size container that fits comfortably beneath a desk. Data entry was tedious and depended on keypunch operators and stacks of manila cards with various patterns of rectangular holes. Extracting and manipulating data was equally challenging, requiring a sophisticated understanding of computer language. Problems were common. Computers required a special expertise. Over the past two-and-a-half decades, however, computers have become efficient, "user friendly," and relatively problem free. Even children have become computer literate, fail-safe systems have eliminated data loss crises, and machines that once required moving vans can be tucked away in the side compartment of a carry-on bag.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	But imagine that as the technology improved, as it became smaller and simpler to use, as it became available to the average person, the federal government required all purchasers and users of the new laptops to purchase and possess a license to use them, to keep log-in records, and to be inspected and tested on their ability to use correctly each item of software they loaded onto their hard drives. That, in effect, is what CLIA '88 has done to the clinical laboratory community. As the technology has become more accurate, user friendly, and available to the primary care physician, costly regulations and red tape have caused tens of thousands of physicians to lock up their labs.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Not all lab tests are subject to the rigors of CLIA. Nine are "waived."  Three of these are available to the public for home use, three were invented before World War II, and the urine dipstick test has been available for well over three decades. CLIA's "Complexity Model" indicates that the new technology is what should worry Americans.<sup>41</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	  Strep throat screens, for example, have been labeled "moderately complex" even though they are as simple to perform as home pregnancy tests. A 1992 study published in the <I>Journal of the American Medical Association</I> found that sixth and seventh grade students in the Augusta, Georgia, public schools were able to perform this test with 95 to 100 percent accuracy on their first attempt after reading the directions.<sup>42</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	  Because their performance was so successful on the first try, the study was unable to demonstrate a learning curve. CDC's "moderate complexity" ranking, for this test and for others using the same technique, has resulted in abandonment of on-site labs in thousands of physicians' offices across the United States.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Such results and incongruities call CDC's entire complexity model into question. This model depends on subjective ratings of testing devices against several arbitrary criteria. Despite its far-reaching impact, however, federal bureaucrats never tested its real-world validity and reliability before it was imposed on the testing device marketplace and physicians' offices.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The CLIA Police. The CLIA police were out in force this past year. Thousands of physicians' offices were cited for violations, the vast majority of which were procedural and paperwork irregularities irrelevant to patient care. Penalties for noncompliance can be as high as $10,000 a day. While the fines on doctors can be onerous, in many cases the inspectors themselves do not know the first thing about patient care. A New York dermatologist, for example, was surprised to find that he was being inspected by a former patient who had been an unemployed engineer.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Unquestionably, the federal regulatory police did find deficiencies in the labs. But the vast majority were classic bureaucratic transgressions related to neglected paperwork and documentation errors:  a missing signature, for example, or the lack of procedure manuals (which no one consults anyway). Just as CLIA regulatory policy promotes the "dark ages" of testing techniques, it also represents a throwback to the dark ages of quality management. Modern quality management addresses outcomes. In not one instance can CDC officials say with certainty that adhering to any aspect of this strangulating body of regulation improves the outcome for the patient.

<p>
<b>REGULATING WITHOUT SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Within the scientific community, a great deal of discord exists regarding CLIA. In the multimillion-dollar proficiency testing business, for example, manufacturers of laboratory "instruments and reagent systems design and then manage and control the manufacturing process to ensure consistent results on fresh, human specimens."  But there are a number of flaws in the proficiency testing program. One is that materials sent to physicians' offices to test the accuracy of their results frequently are taken from chickens or cows, often are frozen and thawed numerous times, and frequently have to be reconstituted when received.<sup>43</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	  Even the founder of proficiency testing, Dr. F. William Sunderman, opposes using it as a regulatory device.<sup>44</sup>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Proficiency testing was never intended to be a regulatory tool. No existing studies link better scores on proficiency testing to improved patient outcomes. Many scientists have raised questions about the very nature of proficiency testing specimens (analytes). Proficiency testing specimens that are accurate for one type of machine often are not appropriate for another. Often, these analytes are non-human materials. For example, measuring a physician's ability to perform accurate testing on chicken blood has become the important regulatory measure of excellence, but medical device manufacturers sought to develop on-site testing devices that would perform best on fresh human serum. Now promotion of their products depends more on passing proficiency tests on chicken sera than on accuracy in testing human blood.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Cutting Services. CLIA 1988 unquestionably has dampened and even deadened on-site laboratory testing and the promise it held. Because of the formidable regulatory costs and the realization that patients and the health care system cannot afford any additional financial burden, physicians have closed and cut back on many services they once offered their patients, in many cases for free or at "break even" rates. Testing devices are relegated to dark corners on storage shelves, and microscopes have been boxed. To escape CLIA's costly embrace, and to be classified as a "waivered" lab, doctors often have traded 1990s' technology for pre-World War II models like copper sulfate hemoglobin analyses and centrifuge-generated hematocrits.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	But patients are the real losers. The ultimate financial burden generated by the additional costs of paying for cholesterols and strep cultures performed in outside laboratories rests with them. They must endure the unavoidable delays that result from sending specimens off site, or the preanalytic and postanalytic errors that make up the bulk of laboratory testing problems. They have to take more time off from work. They have to pay "Elderbus" fares for return visits that now have to be scheduled to discuss test results after they have come back from outside labs.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	But no data show, and no scientific research confirms, that a major national problem ever existed. The inconsistencies in the federal "complexity models" and "quality standards" are apparent. A 20 percent failure rate is acceptable in screening for cervical cancer, but an elevated cholesterol level must be more accurate than most physicians feel is necessary to make treatment decisions. Even worse, the problem that initiated this federal fiasco -- erroneously read Pap Smears -- still has not been addressed. Despite the specific attention given to this problem in the original legislation, on-site proficiency testing for this cytology test has not even been started.
<p>
<b>THE BUREAUCRACY'S EXCUSES</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The office of the HHS Inspector General (IG) recently conducted a study to determine whether CLIA resulted in laboratory availability problems for Medicare patients. The conclusion:  "The CLIA appears not to have affected physician ability to secure laboratory services for their patients."<sup>45</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	  This report represents a stunning lack of understanding of the important issues surrounding CLIA. Instead of addressing the effects of CLIA, its conclusion deals with physicians' efforts, despite regulatory obstacles, to secure needed health services for their patients. But the lack of availability of tests was never the issue. No one said patients would not be able to obtain tests; Americans no longer depend on the pony express, and medical tests can be sent to, or performed at, reference laboratories. The issues that were not addressed are precisely the ones that should have been:  issues that relate to increased inconvenience, increased costs, lack of immediate access to test results, consequent treatment delays and the need for follow-up visits, and -- most important -- the inevitably decreased quality of care and increased morbidity.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In other words, the IG's study failed to address the very issue -- quality of care -- that formed the impetus for the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. It also failed to analyze CLIA's impact on physician practice patterns after the final regulations took effect. Surveys by professional organizations indicate that CLIA's major impact on physician practice occurred after the final regulation took effect in late 1992.<sup>46</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	  Hence, the data regarding the impact on physician office practice prior to that time are irrelevant.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The IG did find that "CLIA appears to have some effect on the volume and types of tests being billed by POLs. Shifts from moderate and high complexity to waived testing procedures are evident.... "<sup>47</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	 But that finding is, in effect, an admission that physicians have returned to pre-World War II technologies. Most of the highly accurate, new on-site tests are out of reach for the "waivered" site.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Consider what would happen if the HHS bureaucacy's reasoning were applied in any other sector of the national economy. Suppose, for example, that a large plant employing two thousand workers closes down because the owners cannot afford to comply with regulations requiring them to remove asbestos from sealed encasements and inside walls. No scientific study has shown that encased asbestos poses any harm to humans, but publicity related to deaths among asbestos-exposed shipyard workers spills over to cause a rash of regulations not supported by fact. Two thousand workers lose their jobs, but a government study determines that the regulation has had no significant impact because 95 percent of these displaced laborers find work within two years. The lesson is simple:  Those who ask the wrong questions get irrelevant answers.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


	Congress can return to reason in regulating clinical labs. Already, new Members are rethinking how federal regulation has been implemented in the past. Cost-benefit analyses are being considered before any new layers of regulation are imposed. Existing regulations are being reexamined for reasonableness and scrutinized for need. The fact that hundreds of billions of dollars are taken from hard-working consumers because of regulatory costs added to the price of goods and services finally is being taken seriously.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Fortunately, CLIA's regulatory burdens on doctors and impact on patients have attracted attention in both the House and Senate. In the House, Bill Archer and dozens of his colleagues are leading the effort to reintroduce some sense and sanity to this issue. Representative Archer has introduced H.R. 1386, the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act Amendments of 1995, and Kay Bailey Hutchison and colleagues are sponsoring a similar bill, S. 877, in the Senate. Congress can release the physician's office from a set of costly and unnecessarily restrictive rules that amount to regulation in search of a problem. By changing policy, Congress can change the environment in a way that benefits both doctor and patient.<p><b>ENDNOTES</b><p>

    George Bush was correct on January 28 to declare a 90-day
moratorium on new federal regulations and to instruct federal agencies
to assess the harm done by existing regulations to the American
economy. But Attorney General William Barr now has violated the spirit
if not the letter of this ban. Last week he changed the Justice
Department's enforcement guidelines to extend the reach of United
States antitrust laws, which restrict business cooperation, to foreign
companies in foreign countries.
<P>
    Attempting to enforce antitrust laws overseas is a bad policy on
its merits. These laws make American firms less competitive. Trying to
enforce them beyond America's borders invites retaliation from trading
partners. But as bad as that is, worse is the appearance that Bush is
not in control of his own cabinet. If he wishes to shed the label of
the "reregulatory President" that he so far has earned, he must
instruct Barr to reverse this decision and instruct all federal
officials to abide rigorously by his moratorium and to review
regulations thoroughly as a prelude to a major deregulation effort to
make America more competitive.
<P>
         Antitrust laws allow the federal government to prevent
cooperation between businesses that it believes will unduly restrict
competition. Justice Department guidelines have allowed enforcement of
these laws against foreign companies operating in their own countries
only if American consumers are harmed by such collusion. But there are
rarely overseas applications of these laws since American consumers
usually gain better quality products at low prices from cooperation
between foreign firms. Barr now has eliminated this "American
consumer" provision, thus opening the door for more extensive Justice
Department action against foreign firms.
<P>
    To begin with, antitrust laws are of questionable economic
benefit. The premise behind these laws is that close cooperation
between businesses will result in monopolies which restrict
competition and force consumers to pay higher prices for goods and
services. Even if this is sometimes true, cooperation often allows
businesses to turn out better quality products at lower prices. By
stifling even beneficial cooperation, America's antitrust laws all too
often make American firms less able to compete against foreign
competitors that are not subject to such harmful laws by their own
governments.
<P>
    Legally Dubious. An attempt by the U.S. to apply its antitrust
laws to foreign companies operating in their own countries in
accordance with their countries' laws is legally dubious. As the U.S.
Supreme Court emphasized in the 1986 case of Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corporation, the cartelization of a
foreign market cannot violate U.S. antitrust laws, "because American
antitrust laws do not regulate the competitive conditions of other
nations' economies." While a case under the new Justice Department
guidelines might raise somewhat different issues, the basic issue
would be the same, and the Court might well strike down these
guidelines.
<P>
    An attempt to enforce American antitrust laws overseas also would
be impractical. The Justice Department would have to act against an
American-based subsidiary of the foreign firm. The subsidiary would be
required to defend itself in a U.S. court for the actions of a parent
company, franchiser, or partner. In such prosecutions the U.S.
government would not be able to provide due process of law for the
accused. How exactly, for example, would the Justice Department
accumulate evidence, since its agents generally cannot operate legally
in foreign countries? How would the Justice Department subpoena
evidence from overseas firms, since its jurisdiction does not extend
to foreign countries? 
<P>
    Invitation to Retaliation. An attempt by the Justice Department
to enforce American antitrust laws overseas invites retaliation. The
European Community (EC), for example, might prosecute America's Ford
Motor Company's European subsidiary because workers in a Ford factory
in Michigan are not accorded the benefits mandated by EC labor laws.
The EC could claim that lower benefit levels for Ford workers in the
U.S. are a form of "unfair" competition against European auto
manufacturers. The EC would not accept as a defense that Ford's
European factory treats its workers according to EC laws. In such a
case the American government and people correctly would consider the
EC's behavior an unjustified attempt to meddle in U.S. internal
economic and political matters.
<P>
    Although the Justice Department insists that the new policy is
not aimed at any one country, Barr's change in antitrust enforcement
guidelines seems to be aimed mainly at Japanese companies that often
operate in strategic alliances called "keiretsus." But if the Justice
Department targets Japanese firms, it is likely to hit American firms
as well. American companies now are breaking into the Japanese market
by joining in such strategic alliances. Example: Last October the
Aluminum Company of America and Japan's Kobe Steel established an
alliance to produce tubing for photocopiers. Example: Last December
America's International Business Machine Corporation and Japan's Canon
Ltd. announced plans for joint production of notebook computers.
Example: In January of this year American Telephone and Telegraph and
Nippon Electric Company agreed to manufacture jointly dynamic random
access memory chips. As American firms use such alliances to become
more competitive and to penetrate foreign markets, they could find the
U.S. Justice Department frustrating their efforts in an attempt to
apply America's antitrust laws overseas.
<P>
    With his announcement of a 90-day moratorium on new government
regulations, Bush acknowledges that federal regulations often do more
harm to the economy than good, crippling American firms in their
ongoing contest with foreign competitors. A so-called "level playing
field" should not consist of applying the same destructive regulations
to overseas firms, crippling them as well.
<P>
    Freeing Business. If the Bush Administration is serious about
freeing American enterprise from the burden of regulations, the
President must get control of his own officials and demand that they
obey his 90-day moratorium. To untie the hands of American business,
the Administration should seek to amend U.S. antitrust laws to make it
easier for American firms to form joint ventures, both with one
another and with foreign firms. And as a first step in this effort,
the President should instruct Attorney General Barr to abandon any
attempt to apply American antitrust laws to acts taken by foreign
firms on foreign soil.

<h3> THE ENTERPRISE RESOURCE BANK ACT: MOVING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION </h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/barry.html">John S. Barry</a><br>

Executive Memorandum No. 451<br>

<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Representative Richard Baker (R-LA) recently introduced legislation to reform the Federal Home Loan Banking System. One day after Congressman Baker and 13 co-sponsors introduced the Enterprise Resource Bank Act of 1996 (H.R. 3167), the measure was approved unanimously by the House Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities, and Government-Sponsored Enterprises. The full House Banking Committee mark-up is expected soon. But although the problems of the Federal Home Loan Banking System need to be addressed, H.R. 3167 is a serious step in the wrong direction.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The structure of the Federal Home Loan Banking System, created in 1932, is similar to that of the Federal Reserve System. The 12 regional home loan banks (FHL Banks) provide long-term loans (known as "advances") to member savings institutions, which are required to collateralize the advances with residential mortgages. The purpose of the Federal Home Loan Bank System has been to provide a ready source of long-term mortgages to home buyers. While privately owned and operated, the FHL Banks are considered government-sponsored enterprises because of their federal origin and public responsibilities, and because their obligations are considered implicitly guaranteed by the federal government.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
While this system made sense many years ago, the creation and subsequent growth of a secondary mortgage market, along with the emergence of the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), has made the mission of the FHL Banks obsolete. As a result, the FHL Banks increasingly have begun to move into new activities, including the purchase of securitized mortgages (often from the other government-sponsored enterprises).

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
H.R. 3167 would give the FHL Banks a new and questionable mission. They would be renamed Enterprise Resource Banks, but would continue to operate largely within the same regulatory structure as the one within which the FHL Banks now operate. However, the new banks would enjoy a greatly expanded scope of operation. The newly constituted Enterprise Resource Banks would not be limited to mortgage-collateralized advances. They also could provide advances for small business loans, economic development project loans, and rural development project loans.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Although well-intentioned, H.R. 3167 is the wrong way to reform the FHLB System. Among the problems:<ul>

<p><li>Enterprise Resource Banks would enjoy an unfair advantage over their private counterparts. It is widely held that bonds issued by FHL Banks are insured by the federal government. This is because the FHL Banks serve a perceived public interest, and taxpayers likely would be required to foot the bill were the banks to default on their loan obligations. This implicit guarantee allows FHL Banks to raise funds in the capital markets at a lower cost than private companies. Currently, this advantage is limited to the mortgage lending market. However, H.R. 3167 would expand the FHL Banks' advantage into other markets. In fact, some analysts believe the only market prohibited by the bill to Enterprise Resource Banks would be large commercial loans to suburban businesses.<sup>1</sup>  Private financial service companies in every other market would be faced with increased competition from advantaged, publicly supported Enterprise Resource Bank members.

<p><li>H.R. 3167 would create an increasingly powerful and deleterious government presence in the capital markets. The FHL Banks already are the third-largest borrowers in the nation, trailing only the Department of the Treasury and Fannie Mae. By enlarging the theater of FHL Bank operations, H.R. 3167 would increase the share of the capital market effectively controlled by the federal government. As Enterprise Resource Banks moved into new markets, they might be able to dominate those markets easily because of their advantageous position, granted by implicit federal guarantee against default. They would quickly become the "800 pound gorilla" of the capital markets. Thus, federal statutes and regulations, rather than the free market, increasingly would determine the allocation of credit.

<p><li>Federal Home Loan Banks are not experienced in the proposed new areas of responsibility. FHL Banks have been limited to mortgage-collateralized advances for the past 60 years. Moreover, until 1989 FHL Banks were limited to serving savings and loans. It was only with passage of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 that other financial institutions were able to apply for FHLB advances. H.R. 3167 would expand the nature of advances that Enterprise Resource Banks could make, as well as the structure of financial institutions that could apply for these advances. But such a broad step is like allowing an airline pilot to navigate a cruise ship. FHL Banks simply do not have the experience to advance broadly collateralized funds to various financial service providers, and H.R. 3167 does not give them specific guidance in these matters. Moreover, many of the new responsibilities, such as providing small business and community development loans, already are carried out by other federal programs. The new responsibilities of the Enterprise Resource Banks would duplicate these programs, most of which are themselves in need of serious reform.

<p><li>Taxpayers would incur increased risk. These problems would increase taxpayer exposure to risk if the new Enterprise Resource system were to fail. Because the system would remain a government-sponsored enterprise providing some public services, it is unlikely that the federal government would allow the Enterprise Resource Banks to fail. Taxpayers would be forced to pay the bill in the event of such a failure. Increasing the scope of the system's operations increases not only the potential size of such a bailout, but also its likelihood.</ul>

Instead of finding new and duplicative responsibilities for the FHL Banks, Congress and the President should privatize the banks and allow them to restructure as necessary, outside the umbrella of taxpayer protection. Privatization of the FHL Banks has broad support from experts, the banking industry, and the Administration. Indeed, in a letter to Representative Jim Leach (R-IA), chairman of the House Banking Committee, the Treasury Department's Under Secretary for Domestic Finance, John D. Hawke, states that privatization is a better answer to the problems of the FHL Banks than increasing their theater of operations.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
If Congress truly wants to help distressed areas and increase the availability of credit, it should act to modernize the financial services sector by deregulating it. Representative Baker already has introduced legislation (H.R. 814) that would begin to do this. Allowing commercial banks to affiliate with investment banks and other commercial and financial companies would increase the availability of credit for consumers and the investment opportunities for all businesses, including those in distressed areas. On the other hand, H.R. 3167 would raise the level of government involvement in the credit markets. Rather than help distressed areas, this would place taxpayers of all income levels at a greater risk.

<P>

     Legislation currently is before Congress that would reinstate a
federal communications policy known as the "fairness doctrine." The
legislation, entitled the "Fairness in Broadcasting Act of 1993," is
sponsored in the Senate (S. 333) by Ernest Hollings, the South
Carolina Democrat, and in the House (H.R. 1985) by Bill Hefner, the
North Carolina Democrat. It would codify a 1949 Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) regulation that once required broadcasters to "afford
reasonable opportunity for the discussion of conflicting views of
public importance." The fairness doctrine was overturned by the FCC in
1987. The FCC discarded the rule because, contrary to its purpose, it
failed to encourage the discussion of more controversial issues. There
were also concerns that it was in violation of First Amendment free
speech principles. The legislation now before Congress would enshrine
the fairness doctrine into law. 
<P>
     The doctrine's supporters seem not to appreciate just how much
the broadcast world has changed since 1949. With the proliferation of
informational resources and technology, the number of broadcast
outlets available to the public has increased steadily. In such an
environment, it is hard to understand why the federal government must
police the airwaves to ensure that differing views are heard. The
result of a reinstituted fairness doctrine would not be fair at all.
In practice, much controversial speech heard today would be stifled as
the threat of random investigations and warnings discouraged
broadcasters from airing what FCC bureaucrats might refer to as
"unbalanced" views.
<P>
     Tested in Court. The fairness doctrine's constitutionality was
tested and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in a landmark 1969 case,
Red Lion Broadcasting v. FCC (395 U.S. 367). Although the Court then
ruled that it did not violate a broadcaster's First Amendment rights,
the Court cautioned that if the doctrine ever began to restrain
speech, then the rule's constitutionality should be reconsidered. Just
five years later, without ruling the doctrine unconstitutional, the
Court concluded in another case that the doctrine "inescapably dampens
the vigor and limits the variety of public debate" (Miami Herald
Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241). In 1984, the Court
concluded that the scarcity rationale underlying the doctrine was
flawed and that the doctrine was limiting the breadth of public debate
(FCC v. League of Women Voters, 468 U.S. 364). This ruling set the
stage for the FCC's action in 1987. An attempt by Congress to
reinstate the rule by statute was vetoed by President Ronald Reagan in
1987, and later attempts failed even to pass Congress. 
<P>
     As an independent regulatory agency, the FCC has the power to
reimpose the doctrine without congressional or executive action. So
far, the Commission has taken no position on the Hollings-Hefner
legislation or expressed an interest in reregulating on its own.
Current FCC Chairman James Quello, though, has stated that, "The
fairness doctrine doesn't belong in a country that's dedicated to
freedom of the press and freedom of speech." (Doug Halonen, "Twelve to
Watch in 1993," Electronic Media, January 25, 1993, p. 66.) The
Clinton Administration has not taken an official position on the
legislation.
<P>
     Supporters of reviving the fairness doctrine base their argument
on the very same three faulty premises that the FCC and most judicial
rulings have rejected.
<P>
Faulty Premise #1: The "scarce" amount of spectrum space requires
oversight by federal regulators.
<P>
Reality: Although the spectrum is limited, the number of broadcasters
in America has continuously increased.
<P>
     Supporters of the fairness doctrine argue that because the
airwaves are a scarce resource, they should be policed by federal
bureaucrats to ensure that all viewpoints are heard. Yet, just because
the spectrum within which broadcast frequencies are found has
boundaries, it does not mean that there is a practical shortage of
views being heard over the airwaves. When the fairness doctrine was
first conceived, only 2,881 radio and 98 television stations existed.
By 1960, there were 4,309 radio and 569 television stations. By 1989,
these numbers grew to over 10,000 radio stations and close to 1,400
television stations. Likewise, the number of radios in use jumped from
85.2 million in 1950 to 527.4 million by 1988, and televisions in use
went from 4 million to 175.5 million during that period. ("The
Fairness Doctrine," National Association of Broadcasters, Backgrounder
(1989).) 
<P>
     Even if it may once have been possible to monopolize the
airwaves, and to deny access to certain viewpoints, that is impossible
today. A wide variety of opinions is available to the public through
radios, cable channels, and even computers. With America on the verge
of information superhighways and 500-channel televisions, there is
little prospect of speech being stifled.
<P>
Faulty Premise #2: "Fairness" or "fair access" is best determined by
FCC authorities.
<P>
Reality: FCC bureaucrats can neither determine what is "fair" nor
enforce it.
<P>
     The second fallacy upon which the doctrine rests concerns the
idea of "fairness" itself. As defined by proponents of the doctrine,
"fairness" apparently means that each broadcaster must offer air time
to anyone with a controversial view. Since it is impossible for every
station to be monitored constantly, FCC regulators would arbitrarily
determine what "fair access" is, and who is entitled to it, through
selective enforcement. This, of course, puts immense power into the
hands of federal regulators. And in fact, the fairness doctrine was
used by both the Kennedy and Nixon Administrations to limit political
opposition. Telecommunications scholar Thomas W. Hazlett notes that
under the Nixon Administration, "License harassment of stations
considered unfriendly to the Administration became a regular item on
the agenda at White House policy meetings." (Thomas W. Hazlett, "The
Fairness Doctrine and the First Amendment," The Public Interest,
Summer 1989, p. 105.) As one former Kennedy Administration official,
Bill Ruder, has said, "We had a massive strategy to use the fairness
doctrine to challenge and harass the right-wing broadcasters, and hope
the challenge would be so costly to them that they would be inhibited
and decide it was too expensive to continue." (Tony Snow, "Return of
the Fairness Demon," The Washington Times, September 5, 1993, p. B3.) 
<P>
Faulty Premise #3: The fairness doctrine guarantees that more opinions
will be aired.
<P>
Reality: Arbitrary enforcement of the fairness doctrine will diminish
vigorous debate.
<P>
     Of all arguments for the reinstitution of the fairness doctrine,
the most inaccurate and insidious is that it will permit a greater
diversity of opinion to be heard. By requiring, under threat of
arbitrary legal penalty, that broadcasters "fairly" represent both
sides of a given issue, advocates of the doctrine believe that more
views will be aired while the editorial content of the station can
remain unaltered. But with the threat of potential FCC retaliation for
perceived lack of compliance, most broadcasters would be more
reluctant to air their own opinions because it might require them to
air alternative perspectives that their audience does not want to
hear. 
<P>
     Thus, the result of the fairness doctrine in many cases would be
to stifle the growth of disseminating views and, in effect, make free
speech less free. This is exactly what led the FCC to repeal the rule
in 1987. FCC officials found that the doctrine "had the net effect of
reducing, rather than enhancing, the discussion of controversial
issues of public importance," and therefore was in violation of
constitutional principles. ("FCC Ends Enforcement of Fairness
Doctrine," Federal Communications Commission News, Report No. MM-263,
August 4, 1987.) Even liberal New York Governor Mario Cuomo has argued
that, "Precisely because radio and TV have become our principal
sources of news and information, we should accord broadcasters the
utmost freedom in order to insure a truly free press." (Mario Cuomo,
"The Unfairness Doctrine," The New York Times, September 20, 1993, p.
A19.)
<P>
     Simple Solution. If the fairness standard is reinstituted, the
result will not be easier access for controversial views. It will
instead be self-censorship, as stations seek to avoid requirements
that they broadcast specific opposing views. With the wide diversity
of views available today in the expanding broadcast system, there is a
simple solution for any family seeking an alternative viewpoint or for
any lawmaker irritated by a pugnacious talk-show host. Turn the dial.

<h3> CRIME, POVERTY, AND THE FAMILY </h3>
<b>By The Honorable William P. Barr </b>
<P> <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>July 29, 1992.
<P>

            

      I don't have to tell you that things are at a critical juncture
in our country when it comes to violent crime. We find violence now
running at intolerably high levels. The heyday of violent crime was
actually in the 1960s and 1970s, and I will describe it in more detail
later. It peaked in 1980. It started going downward for a few years
and now it is picking back up again. It has since 1986 drifted back up
again, although the victimization rates today are still significantly
lower than they were at its peak in 1980 and 1981. 
<P>
      I think the trend we are seeing in violent crime is driven
basically by three factors. First, the crack epidemic that started in
about 1986 has led to a high degree of violence. Second, we are seeing
the results of some of the family policies of the 1960s and 1970s --
the breakdown of the family -- and we are starting to pay the price
for that with a surge in juvenile crime and the emergence of gangs.
And third, we are seeing the saturation of the criminal justice
systems in the states and the states relapsing to revolving door
justice as prisoners are serving less and less of their sentences and
are being prematurely released. I think those are the main factors in
this upward trend of violence. 
<P>
      Now, in public discourse about how to deal with this violence,
we generally see two competing views. One is the traditional law
enforcement approach, which says crime is caused by criminals and the
way we deal with crime is to use aggressive enforcement policies and
to deter or incapacitate criminals through incarceration. On the other
hand, I think we see a lot said about what I call the social
rehabilitation response to violent crime. That approach tends to see
crime as caused by societal ills and seeks to deal with crime by
remedying these ills through social programs. Proponents of this
approach say that you can't really deal with violent crime by
suppression, you have to attack it at its root causes. 
<P>
      Combined Approach. I think we need both approaches, properly
understood, acting together. We do have to take aggressive steps today
to deal with the criminals of today. But, we also have to take steps
and we do need programs to prevent, as best we can, the youth of today
from becoming the chronic offenders of tomorrow.
<P>
      I think too many advocates of the root causes approach, however,
give short shrift to the need for tough law enforcement. They just
can't bring themselves to deal with criminals decisively and they tend
to dismiss reliance on police and prosecutors and prisons as
unenlightened. Many times I hear it said that we should be spending
money on schools and housing and so forth rather than on police and
prosecutors and prisons. 
<P>
      Well, today I want to make three points. First, I want to
explain why I think a strong law enforcement approach has to be
paramount. Second, I want to discuss what I think we in law
enforcement can do to have an impact. And third, I want to spend a
little time talking about social programs and the root causes approach
to dealing with violent crime and what I think we have to do there.
<P>
      Basic Reality. So, let us turn first to the issue of why law
enforcement must be paramount today. I think those that would give
short shrift to suppression of crime through strong law enforcement
measures, but would instead rely upon dealing with root causes, are
missing a basic point -- the basic reality that we see today -- and
that is, that in this pervasive atmosphere of fear and violence that
we see in the inner cities particularly, even the best designed social
programs cannot take root. The problem is that our efforts to deal
with underlying social maladies are being strangled by crime itself.
And I think it is increasingly clear that suppression of crime is a
prerequisite for any of our social programs to be successful. 
<P>
      What good is it to build a housing project to see it taken over
by drug traffickers and used as a stash house? Or what good is it to
invest as much as we do in education and build model schools, only to
see those schools become battlegrounds for gangs? The Green Housing
Project in Chicago is a project where the federal government has spent
a lot of money and has many innovative programs underway. But the
principal concern of the mothers in that housing project is the safety
of their children. They put their children to sleep in the bathtubs
because of the bullets flying around, starting Thursday night and
running through the weekend. So we have gotten to the age of armored
cribs in the inner city. 
<P>
      I was down at the Prince Garden Apartments Project in Fort
Worth. It had just been swept by the police, and the tenants of those
apartments came out applauding the police. They held a barbecue for
the police, pleading with them not to leave their housing project. One
old lady came out and told me that she had been sleeping on the floor
under her bed for months because of the bullets flying around the
courtyard in the housing project. 
<P>
      Crime Causing Poverty. It was once a shibboleth that poverty
causes crime, but today I think it is clear that crime is causing
poverty. Businesses are driven from crime-ridden neighborhoods, taking
jobs and opportunities with them. Potential investors and would-be
employers are scared away. Existing owners are deterred from making
improvements on their property, and as property values go down, owners
disinvest in their property. I know a small contractor who tried to
rehabilitate inner-city housing for low-income tenants. He had to give
up because drug addicts would break in, rip out his improvements, and
sell them for drug money. They would even come in regularly and take
out all of the piping in the building and sell it for scrap. This
contractor obviously couldn't continue like that, and like many others
has just stopped his efforts to rehabilitate housing. 
<P>
      I think that what we saw in Los Angeles shows the difficulty we
are going to have in rebuilding those communities. It shows the impact
of crime on a community in fast motion, fast forward. But that same
process is occurring around the country at a more deliberate speed.
<P>
      So in short, I don't think you can have progress amid chaos. And
the fact is that no urban program can arrest the decline in our inner
cities, and no anti-poverty programs are going to take hold unless
they are combined with and founded upon strong law enforcement
measures that suppress violent crime.
<P>
      That brings me to my second point, which I am going to dwell on
at length: What do we do on the law enforcement side to suppress
violent crime? How do we actually make reductions in violent crime? In
my view, the evidence is absolutely clear that the vast bulk of
violent crime is committed by a very small group of chronic offenders.
Study after study shows that this tiny fraction of incorrigible,
habitual offenders is responsible for hundreds and hundreds of crimes
each while they are out on the street. A well known study in 1980,
which followed 240 criminals, found that in an eleven-year period they
committed over 500,000 crimes -- an average of 190 crimes a year. And
that corresponds to numerous other studies that show that kind of
criminality. Another study of various state prisoners found that 25
percent of them committed 135 crimes a year; 10 percent of them
committed 600 crimes a year. Every study shows a tiny cohort is
responsible disproportionately for the vast amount of predatory
violence.
<P>
      We know the profile of these criminals. They start committing
crimes as juveniles. They go right on committing crimes. They commit
crimes as adults; they commit crimes when they are on parole,
probation, or bail. With this type of habitual offender, the only time
they are not committing crimes, at least prior to their fortieth
birthday, is when they are in prison. 
<P>
      Today's Conflagration. And I think that in combatting violent
crime, we in the criminal justice system must make it our primary goal
to identify, to target, and to incarcerate this hard core element of
chronic offenders. They should be incapacitated in custody for the
time dictated by the public's safety, and not by other artificial
restraints like prison space. I think this is the only approach in law
enforcement that has any prospect for reducing levels of violent
crime. No matter how well we tinker with and perfect our social
rehabilitation programs, they are not going to take hold for decades
and decades. We have crime on the streets right now. We have to put
out the fire today. Yes, we can redesign houses so they are more
fireproof in the future, but right now we have a conflagration and we
have to deal with it. 
<P>
      I think the history of the last thirty years shows that this
policy of incarceration works. The 1960s and 1970s, as you know, were
the era of permissiveness in law enforcement. Fewer people were locked
up. The people we put away did not serve long sentences. The
incarceration rates dropped. At the end of the 1960s we had fewer
people in prison than we did when the decade started. In the 1980s, we
started turning things around. We built prisons at the federal level
and the state level. We toughened up our criminal justice system. We
started putting tougher federal judges on the bench. And during the
1980s we turned around the incarceration rates. We started out with
300,000 prisoners in state prisons at the beginning of the decade and
we ended it with 800,000. The spiraling violent crime rate of the
1960s and 1970s came to an abrupt halt and plateaued out. But now it
is going up again.
<P>
      I think if we are going to reduce violent crime we have to
finish the job we began in the 1980s and get those violent offenders
off the street. Unfortunately, I think a lot of states are relapsing
back to the 1960s and 1970s-style revolving door system. Today,
prisoners on the average are serving only 37 percent of their
sentences. In some states, like Texas, they say it is 22 days for
every one year of sentence. In Florida, it is 18 percent of sentence
served. That is because of prison capacity. Prisoners are being
recycled back out onto the streets, after a very short period of time
in prison, simply to make room for the next wave. The average sentence
given for rape in this country, for example, is eight years; the
average sentence served is three years. Three years is the average
price of a rape. In many larger states, it is much lower than that. At
least 30 percent of the murders in this country are committed by
people who are on probation, parole, or bail at the time of murder.
So, 6,500 of our fellow citizens are slaughtered each year by people
who have been caught and then prematurely released back onto the
streets.
<P>
      I think stopping the revolving door is going to require three
things. It is going to require more resources at both the federal and
state level. It is going to require legal reform at both the federal
and state level. And it is going to require an unprecedented degree of
cooperation -- the federal government, the state government, local
enforcement working together to target the hardest core offenders so
we get the most bang for the bucks. 
<P>
      The President has put substantial resources both into the
federal effort and into state law enforcement, substantially
increasing assistance to the states -- notwithstanding some erroneous
information handed out last week by political opponents -- and
substantially increasing the Justice Department budget over 60 percent
in three years. And he has done this against the Congress that has
been cutting back on his law enforcement requests. I think we are
going to have to see the states also make that kind of commitment. My
own view is that we are not spending enough on state and local law
enforcement. 
<P>
      We have to get back to basics during times of tight budgets and
spend money on things that count. We have to recall that protecting
the public security is the first duty of government. That is why we
submit ourselves to government in the first place, because of the
security. The government has an obligation to perform that function,
and right now they are not putting in the kind of investment that is
needed.
<P>
      Astronomical Costs. In fact, we are being penny wise and pound
foolish, because the cost of not investing in law enforcement is much
higher than the cost of investing. The cost of crime -- just the
economic cost -- is $92 billion a year. That doesn't count lives lost.
It is lost to the criminal justice system in revolving doors -- we
just keep on spending our resources, spinning our wheels, essentially.
There is the cost of private security. We spend astronomical amounts
of money in private security in this country. We don't put the bars up
around the prisoners, people who deserve to be behind bars, and
private citizens pay to put bars up between themselves and prisoners,
and they become the prisoners. And that is exactly what is happening.
And there are a lot of other economic costs -- lost sales, lost
revenues, and so forth.
<P>
      When you total it all up, it is clear that the cost of spending
on an effective criminal justice system is far lower. There is one ATF
study that crystallizes this. It costs an average of $25,000 a year to
keep someone in a prison cell. The ATF study of chronic firearms
offenders in the federal system came up with the figure of over
$300,000 for each year those people were out on the street and the
crimes they committed. So, I think that law enforcement is an
investment well worth making in these tight budget times.
<P>
      On the reform level, you are all aware that we accomplished a
lot in the 1980s. We abolished parole at the federal level and gave
strong minimum sentences and so forth. We had an unfinished agenda --
the death penalty, habeas corpus reform, expansion of the good faith
exception to the exclusionary rule -- and those were in the federal
crime bill that the President is pushing. But 95 percent of violent
crime is at the state level. That, I think is where the real battle
is. Unless we reform the state systems in the 1990s, as we did with
the federal system in the 1980s, we are not going to make much
progress in dealing with violent crime.
<P>
      And so, reform is critical. Yesterday we issued a report with 24
specific recommendations on how state criminal justice systems can be
improved. That report has wide backing in the law enforcement
community and among victims' groups. I am optimistic that is going to
be helpful to groups that are seeking improvement in the criminal
justice systems in their states.
<P>
      Targeting Chronic Offenders. I mentioned corporation and
targeting our resources on the most hard-core offenders. We have an
aggressive program in several areas where we are trying to do that.
For example, the program that I just released our first report on
today -- our first annual report -- is a trickle off program where we
work with a combination of state and local enforcement to use tough
firearms laws to take out chronic offenders. By giving them tough
federal penalties without probation or parole we keep them off the
streets. Over the past year, for example, we have prosecuted over
6,400 individuals; we are achieving an over 90 percent conviction
rate. The average sentence without parole is seven years for these
firearms offenders -- I am talking about felons who use firearms.
Three-time losers, people with three prior offenses, are averaging
eighteen years without parole in the federal system. These are the
worst of the worst -- chronic offenders with extensive criminal
history records who are caught in possession of a firearm.
<P>
      That is just one example of targeting our resources to the
chronic offender. We have similar programs underway against gangs
across the country, and I think in the months ahead you will start to
see more gangs being taken down in Philadelphia. In our pilot project
and violent traffickers program, which we did in conjunction with the
Philadelphia police department, a three-year program, we destroyed 38
gangs, 600 gang members. The leaders of those gangs are serving time
in federal penitentiaries right now without parole or probation. We
also have similar operations going on with respect to chronic offender
fugitives and with respect to criminal aliens. 
<P>
      Root Causes. What this all means is, if we put in sufficient
resources and target our efforts at incapacitating prime offenders, if
we put in more resources and we accomplish needed reform, and if we
work together in joint programs that target our limited resources at
the hardest core element, then I think we can have an impact on
violent crime. I think we can provide a foundation upon which our
efforts at social rehabilitation can be successful. 
<P>
      And that brings me to my third and final point. As I said at the
outset, I think strong law enforcement ultimately should be combined
with economic and social and moral rehabilitation of our communities,
particularly in our inner-city neighborhoods. How do you go about the
task of revitalizing them? What are the root causes of crime and what
do you have to do to address them? What kind of social programs should
we be pursuing? Now there are some who say that what we need is
another massive round of spending on social welfare programs. And I
think that is a mistaken view. We have poured trillions of dollars
into social welfare programs over the last 25 years. The root-cause
strategy is not something new. The root-cause strategy is precisely
what we have been pursuing for 25 years.
<P>
      Today, the government is spending, just on means-tested anti-
poverty programs, record amounts -- $280 billion a year. This is up
from $9.6 billion in 1965 at the start of the Great Society. It is up
from $106 billion in 1980 and it has gone up significantly in real
terms during President Bush's Administration. A record 4.77 percent of
GDP now goes into means-tested programs. And that comes down to $3,111
for every taxpayer -- $3,111 goes into anti-poverty spending. That
doesn't take into account non-means tested root-cause programs. And
what have we gotten for this investment? I think that any fair-minded
observer would have to say that the overall results of this 25-year
war on poverty have been disappointing. Certainly the track record of
these programs in fighting poverty has been less than impressive.
<P>
      Now frankly, I think the argument that poverty causes crime is
too much overstated. I think poverty is probably a contributing factor
toward crime. But standing alone, the correlation between poverty as a
causal factor in crime is very weak. In 1950, for example, the poverty
rate was about 32 percent; today, it is 13.5 percent. And yet in 1950
crime rates were much lower than they are today. And in the Great
Depression, when about half of this nation's population lived below
the poverty line, as today defined, crime was more lower than it is
today. When you look at our cities on a grid basis, neighborhood by
neighborhood, the fact is that some of our poorest neighborhoods have
relatively low crime rates.
<P>
      But even accepting poverty as a contributing factor to crime,
the fact is that, despite our massive spending programs, hard-core
poverty seems as stubborn as ever. The fact of the matter is, more
progress was made on reducing poverty levels in the seven years
preceding the Great Society than has been made since the Great
Society. And most of the progress in reducing poverty levels was made
in the years immediately following 1965 and during the early years of
the Reagan revolution. Otherwise, results have been very
disappointing. There seems to be a persistent class of about 10-15
million Americans for whom poverty and dependency is long term and
even inter-generational. Our anti-poverty programs have made virtually
no headway against this hard-core group.
<P>
      But more significantly, the policies of the past 25 years have
contributed directly to the breakdown of the family, particularly in
the inner cities. Now, before the Los Angeles riots I said on the
David Brinkley show that we were witnessing in inner-city crime the
grim harvest of the Great Society. Senator Moynihan said that this was
the most depraved statement he had ever heard from anybody. I stand by
what I said. 
<P>
      The welfare policies we have been pursuing since 1965 contain
perverse incentives that have contributed to the breakdown of the
family by rewarding and promoting non-marriage and illegitimacy. The
numbers are truly staggering. The illegitimacy rate started to
escalate rapidly after 1965. In 1965, 7.7 percent of American children
were born to unwed mothers. Today the rate is 27 percent. For black
children it has climbed to 65 percent, and in many inner-city areas it
is over 80 percent. And this has been compounded by the skyrocketing
divorce rates in our society. The number of divorces per year has
tripled since 1960.
<P>
      Disintegration of the Family. This family breakdown is a social
and a moral catastrophe and is at the root of so many of the problems
that beset out nation. In my view, the root cause of both crime and
poverty is precisely this unraveling of the family. I think the
evidence is clear that children from single-parent homes use drugs
more heavily and commit more crimes throughout their lives than
children from two-parent homes. Studies show that most gang members
come from single-parent homes. Some 70 percent of juvenile delinquents
in state reform institutions lived in single-parent homes or with
someone other than their natural parents. One study found that 75
percent of adolescent murderers came from single-parent homes. Recent
research by June O'Neill, formerly of the Urban Institute, finds that
a black child in a single-parent home is more than twice as likely to
engage in criminal activities as a black child from a two-parent home.
Moreover, when that child is in a neighborhood where there are many
other single-parent families, the child becomes three times more
likely to engage in criminal activity. A 1988 study published in the
Journal of Research on Crime and Delinquencies found that the rates of
violent crime in a community correlated directly with the proportion
of single-parent households in the community, but not the poverty or
racial composition apart from family structure. In other words, they
found that neither poverty nor race were significantly correlated to
crime when family structure is taken into account.
<P>
      Moreover, the disintegration of the family is the basic cause of
long-term poverty and dependency in America today. Almost 70 percent
of single-parent families with children and 80 percent of never-
married mothers receive some form of government assistance. The
poverty rate for female-headed households with children is at 44.5
percent, compared to 7.8 percent for married couples with children.
Single-parent families account for 65 percent of poor families with
children, and over half of all poor families. Studies show that it is
primarily this group among the poor who remain mired in poverty and
dependency over the long term.
<P>
      So, that is the track record of the policies that we have been
pursuing for 25 years -- little headway against hard-core poverty and
the contribution to the breakdown of the family, which in turn, spawns
crime and further poverty. The idea that if we just increase our
record spending levels by a few more tens of billions of dollars we
will somehow achieve a breakthrough is, in my view, incredible.
<P>
      Reform Agenda. The solution is not in the scale of the programs
we have been pursuing, it is in their structure. We have to be a lot
smarter about the kinds of growth that we pursue. And in this regard,
from the very beginning of the Administration, this President has been
pursuing a reform agenda -- a set of new ideas, not business as usual,
not pouring money into these discredited programs. His efforts seem to
avoid the mistakes of the past. So rather than blindly following those
programs that foster dependency and contain incentives that reward
non-work and non-marriage and illegitimacy, the President has proposed
programs that promote bottom-up growth and give real opportunity. And
that is why he is proposing enterprise zones to bring jobs and
investment into the inner cities and why he is proposing to give
public housing residents the opportunity to purchase their homes. That
is why he has been urging welfare reform to turn around the current
system that rewards non-marriage and illegitimacy and to promote
stable family life. Strong families in the long run will be more
effective than big bureaucracies in revitalizing our inner-city
communities. And he has been seeking to empower grass roots
institutions, not bureaucracies. I think the best hope for genuine
community renewal lies in fostering the rebirth of those traditional
institutions which emerge from the communities themselves and are the
best institutions for the moral formation of children -- the family
and the church and community groups. 
<P>
      Today many of the social experts who brought us the 1960s and
1970s, and are largely responsible for the fix we are in, are
promoting a further set of half-baked solutions to our problems that,
I think, send the wrong moral message and are equally
counterproductive -- like handing out needles to addicts and condoms
to the kids in high school, and even below high school level. 
<P>
      Sending the Right Message. Our social programs, I think, have to
send the right message if we want to turn around behavior. Now law
enforcement sends a clear message about right and wrong, about
personal responsibility, and about what a just society expects of its
citizens. Our social programs must reinforce that message.
<P>
      So, my message today really is threefold. First, social programs
can't be pursued at the expense of, or in lieu of, tough law
enforcement policies. On the contrary, law enforcement is the
foundation upon which all else must be built and is an absolute
prerequisite for social programs to be successful.
<P>
      Second, the only way to reduce violent crime is to target and
incapacitate chronic violent offenders through the tough policy of
incarceration. While this Administration has acted vigorously at the
federal level to help states deal with violent crime, the long-term
solution is for the states to toughen up their own criminal justice
systems and make adequate investments in them.
<P>
      And third, pouring money into a new round of social welfare
programs is not the answer. Instead, we have to be smarter about the
way we pursue social welfare programs. We need programs that foster
opportunity and not dependency, strengthen not undermine the family,
and that sends the right not the wrong message. 
<P>
      These are difficult problems that grew up over decades. And now
the people who helped contribute to the problems are holding stop
watches on the solutions. The problems will not be solved overnight;
it is going to be a long-run proposition. But I think that if we
follow this agenda -- the President's agenda -- then we can make a
real impact and make this a safer and more just society.<P>

INTRODUCTION   
<P>
     With the release last month of the final report of the National
Commission to Ensure a Strong Competitive Airline Industry, a verdict
has been entered against government re-regulation and in favor of
economic competition. The way to strengthen the United States airline
industry, the Commission says, is to spur greater flexibility and
international competition in the industry, not to turn back the clock
to regulation.
<P>
     The Airline Commission was created by Congress in 1992 in
response to the financial problems plaguing the airline industry. The
Commission was charged with making policy recommendations about the
"financial health and future competitiveness of the U.S. airline and
aerospace industries."
<P>
     Although there were worries that the Airline Commission would
recommend a government bailout of the industry and a rollback of
airline deregulation, the Commission report avoids these pitfalls and
makes several valuable recommendations that will improve the
efficiency and competitiveness of the U.S. airline industry. Among the
most important recommendations:
<P>
The FAA should be "reinvented" and restructured as an independent
     federal corporate entity, to permit much-needed technological
     modernization of the air traffic control system.
<P>
The current system still suffers from excessive regulation, which
     imposes unneeded costs on the industry. The report recommends a
     new, more objective system of cost-benefit analysis as a basis
     for decisions on regulation, with the use of outside expertise
     and cost impact data from the airline industry early in the
     regulatory process. And total regulatory costs to the industry
     would be constrained within an annual regulatory budget.
<P>
The current international system, based on bilateral national
     agreements, should be entirely renegotiated. The aim of the
     renegotiation should be to further deregulate international
     routes and to make it easier for foreign and U.S. airlines to
     invest jointly in multinational air service. Carriers should be
     free to make business decisions to serve cities internationally
     with many fewer governmental restrictions on landing rights on
     the basis of nationality alone.
<P>
     The bipartisan Airline Commission has firmly rejected calls to
reregulate the airline industry, and it has offered generally sound
proposals to strengthen the industry. Congress and the Administration
would be wise to move ahead swiftly to implement these
recommendations.
<P>

THE GENESIS OF THE COMMISSION
<P>
     With the effects of the 1990-1991 recession lingering into 1992,
the U.S. airline industry experienced severe financial problems. The
airlines suffered heavy losses. Many of the old criticisms of free
markets were raised in favor of renewed government involvement. Cut-
throat competition is unfair or even dangerous, it was said, because
the travelling public is put at risk when airlines must "cut corners"
to make a profit in a highly competitive industry. Moreover, charged
critics, industries with high fixed costs need the stability of
central planning, or regulation, if they are to survive.
<P>
     Although the Airline Commission reached a sensible conclusion
about re-regulation, there should have been no need for a
congressionally mandated, presidentially appointed panel to reach that
conclusion. The 1990-1991 economic downturn affected more sectors of
the economy than air travel; major corporations such as General Motors
and IBM have undergone significant reorganizations without calls for a
presidentially appointed commission. The airlines themselves have
experienced several episodes of significant financial difficulty in
previous recessions -- and the existence of fare and route regulation
before 1978 did not prevent financial losses. In a market economy,
industries often face severe changes. Business planning should be left
to business management and their staff economists, not to ad hoc study
commissions.
<P>
     Congress established the Airline Commission under Section 204 of
the Airport and Airway Safety, Capacity, Noise Improvement and
Intermodal Transportation Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-581). President
Clinton appointed fifteen voting members in 1993. (Heritage Foundation
Visiting Fellow John Robson, a member of the Airline Commission,
discussed the Commission's findings with the author.  This study's
analysis and conclusions, however, are entirely the author's. ) In
addition, five Senators, five Congressmen, and the Chairman of the
President's Council of Economic Advisers served as non-voting members.
The statute instructed the Commission to investigate a comprehensive
range of concerns:<P>

Can the industry continue to provide fast and efficient domestic
transportation?
<P>
How can the financial solvency of carriers be improved and can the
number of bankruptcies be reduced?
<P>
Will the industry be likely to share profits or losses over the next
five years and does it appear that any carriers will go under during
that period?
<P>
Why has there been a declining number of competitors and increased
concentration of market share among the largest carriers?
<P>
Do competitors have enough capital to purchase the equipment required
to continually improve the safety and quality of air travel?
<P>
Can the industry remain competitive globally?
<P>
Can the industry accommodate growing aviation traffic?
<P>
Are airlines providing the highest quality of service at the most
competitive price?
<P>
Can noise be further abated around airports without substantially
damaging the competitive positions of carriers?
<P>
Are there legal impediments to improved competition within the
industry?
<P>
     To be sure, the airline industry has encountered severe financial
problems over the past three years. And the industry saw some
spectacular bankruptcies in the 1980s, including Pan Am, Eastern, and
Continental, due in part to the use of excessive debt financing to
fund rapid growth. Nevertheless, the concern in Congress about the
condition of the airline industry, as illustrated by the findings in
the Airline Commission's authorizing legislation, stands in curious
juxtaposition to the clear benefits that have accrued during the
fifteen years of growth under deregulation. Among these: (John Stoner,
"Commission on Airline Industry Urges Lower Taxes, Streamlining FAA,"
U.S.  Senate Republican Policy Committee Regulation Watch, July 20,
1993.)
<P>
Airline deregulation has created jobs; salaries are higher and fares
     are lower. Airline industry employees numbered 540,412 in 1992,
     up from 330,495 in 1982 (a 64 percent increase). Employment in
     1992 was down slightly from the 1990 record level of 545,809, but
     still far above the number during the era of regulation. Overall,
     industry salaries and wages in 1992 were 5.4 percent higher than
     in 1991, and up 34 percent since 1982 in nominal dollars. Despite
     the record losses between 1990 and 1992, average airline employee
     salaries rose over 4 percent in real terms between 1982 and 1992.
     Since airline deregulation, overall airfares have declined,
     adjusted for inflation.
<P>
More Americans are flying. Air carriers recorded a total of 474.6
     billion revenue passenger miles in 1992, an increase of 6.2
     percent over 1991. Industry forecasts expect gains of between 
     4 percent and 6 percent over 1991.
<P>
Airplane load factors are up. In 1992, the industry's average aircraft
     load factor was 63.8 percent, a new industry record, beating the
     former high mark of 63.2 percent in 1979. Low ticket prices have
     stabilized passenger load factors in a range of 60.3 percent to
     63.8 percent over the past eight years, despite the large number
     of new aircraft placed in service.
<P>
There is increased competition and wider choice for passengers.
     Researchers Steven A. Morrison and Clifford M. Winston, in a
     Brookings Institution paper, note that, "Route selection is
     greater than it was under regulation. Today only 3 percent of
     passengers fly on routes served by only one airline, down from 9
     percent in 1978." ("The Evolution of the Airline Industry" (work
     in progress).)
<P>
     Despite the clear improvement in air service for customers, of
course, there are groups in the industry who are less well off -- a
typical result of tighter competition. Organized labor, in particular,
is in a worse position now than fifteen years ago. John F. Peterpaul,
a commissioner and Vice President for Transportation of the
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers,
strongly opposed the conclusions of the majority. His dissenting
opinion was published as a 22-page monograph by the IAM&AW. "Airline
industry workers," writes Peterpaul, "should have the right to follow
their work to a company acquiring part or all of the assets of their
former employer.... and new provisions should be enacted to guarantee
that any airline employee who is laid-off at one company has an
enforceable priority for hiring at any other carrier....  The U.S.
government, and specifically the FAA, must take action to maintain
high-skill, high-wage employment in the U.S. and provide jobs for
American mechanics, technicians, and managers.... " (Dissenting
Opinion by Commissioner John F.  Peterpaul to the Report of the
National Commission to Ensure a Strong Competitive Airline Industry,
August 2, 1993.)
<P>
     Some major air carriers, which grew up in a cozy, regulated
environment, have faced wrenching changes. These older airlines
operated for decades with rigid work rules, and thus higher labor
costs than the newer startup airlines, and so have been at a
competitive disadvantage. In an attempt to ease some of these
problems, the Airline Commission recommended several changes in
pension law that would permit more employee ownership and distribution
of shares to employees' retirement plans. Among other advantages,
these measures would help to bring more labor-management flexibility
to some of the airline companies.
<P>

THE COMMISSION REPORT
<P>
     The Airline Commission issued its final report in August.
Unfortunately, most media coverage of the report tended to focus on a
few questions of particular concern to interested groups, such as the
competitive practices of bankrupt airlines. Problems of more general
significance, therefore, were not well spotlighted.
<P>
     The Commission's main proposals:
<P>
1)   Modernizing the Air Traffic Control System
<P>
     The recently announced decision by President Clinton to rehire
former air traffic controllers fired in 1981 for striking illegally
underscores the political nature of an essentially commercial activity
conducted by the government. Significantly, the Commission's first
conclusion is that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), as a
government agency, is unable to modernize and fully adapt to the
technological needs of air travel. The Commission does not call for
total privatization of the FAA. Instead, it says, "The FAA must be
reinvented." Vice President Al Gore's task force on government
reorganization has embraced this proposal.
<P>
     The FAA is an agency of the U.S. Department of Transportation.
The report calls for the FAA to become instead "an independent federal
corporate entity," with its expenditures and revenues removed from the
federal budget. The new body would be exempt from the rigidities of
government procurement and personnel rules, and maintain accounting
practices "consistent with best practices in the private sector." It
would also be granted the right to raise capital in the manner of a
private firm by issuing long-term bonds.
<P>
     Essentially the Airline Commission makes a distinction between
operating the air traffic control system, which the government does
poorly, and setting standards for safety and national defense needs,
which is a more reasonable role for government. The report tells of
the delays and costs in implementing the Aviation System Capital
Investment Plan, and it notes the startling fact that the U.S.
aviation system has not permitted air traffic control to use the
existing satellite navigation system that is available to ships and
other surface transportation. Integrating this available technology
into air traffic control would vastly improve efficiency and safety,
and eliminate costly delays.
<P>
     One of the difficulties faced by the FAA under its current
structure and governmental budgeting rules is that the Airport and
Airway Trust Fund's budget surplus is used to mask the federal
government's general deficit (in the same way the Social Security
surplus is used), rather than being available to support air travel.
The reason is that the "unified budget" concept forces all government
fiscal operations to share a common bottom line, and so encourages the
reduction of services and capital spending throughout government
whenever other, unrelated agencies have cost overruns. Privatizing, or
"reinventing," the FAA's air traffic control system would solve many
of these problems.
<P>
2)   Reducing the Burden of Regulation
<P>
     While acknowledging the government's role in regulating safety
and establishing standards, the Airline Commission strongly criticizes
the way the FAA has carried out this function. Adopting a more
coherent approach to safety regulation, it says, would produce
sizeable cost savings to the industry and to the public. The
Commission cites several examples of the FAA's over-zealous approach
to regulation -- and abuse of cost-benefit estimates to minimize the
appearance of error. 
<P>
     Despite the industry's favorable safety record, billions of
dollars in new regulatory costs have been imposed on the airlines. The
FAA's $4.5 billion estimate of these costs does not include more than
$4 billion the airlines must spend to phase out older, noisier
aircraft. The real costs faced by industry probably are more than
double that amount. And in addition to the cost of meeting regulatory
mandates, the FAA imposes a paperwork burden on the industry
equivalent to 6,900 employees working full time, over 14 million hours
annually, according to the Office of Management and Budget's Office of
Information and Regulatory Affairs.
<P>
     Safety is an unambiguous concern of most regulations, but the FAA
has done little to assure its mandates actually improve safety or do
it in a cost-effective way. For example, the Department of
Transportation in 1990 began to require a random drug testing rate of
50 percent of all employees. In the three years the program has been
in place, less than one-half of one percent of airline employees have
tested positive. According to analysis conducted for the Air Transport
Association by the Philadelphia-based WEFA Group of econometric
forecasters, the regulatory burden could be reduced by $90 million
over five years without threatening safety by reducing the level of
random testing to 10 percent. ("The Potential Impact of Selected
Airline Tax and Regulatory Changes on the U.S.  Economy," The WEFA
Group, May 1992, p.  E-12.) The Airline Commission recommends dropping
the test rate to 25 percent immediately and dropping it even further
if analysis shows there will be no detrimental effects on safety. The
Department of Transportation has already established a test rate of 25
percent for its own safety-related employees.
<P>
     The FAA's interpretation of its regulatory duty to assure safety
may be overreaching as well. An ongoing labor dispute regarding flight
time limitations for flight attendants, for example, is the subject of
a new regulatory proposal. The FAA has the statutory authority to
establish such limitations when necessary for flight safety. It is
unclear, however, how flight attendant duty scheduling decisions
reduce safety.
<P>
     There is also a serious question whether the FAA performs cost-
benefit studies as a genuine economic inquiry into the wisdom of a
regulation or as a post facto rationale. A wide gap is often found
between cost estimates used by the FAA and those performed by non-
governmental economists. For example, in 1992 the FAA issued
regulations for emergency exits to allow smoother passenger evacuation
in the event of a crash. American Airlines told the Airline Commission
that its costs alone would be $16.6 million due to this rule. The
original proposed rule would have cost the industry more than $32
million to make the change, according to American, and over $1 billion
in lost revenue because of seating modifications. The rule was
modified after strong protests from air carriers, and then the FAA
estimated it would then cost only $4.3 million per year. (Submission
to the National Commission to Ensure a Strong Competitive Airline
Industry, American Airlines, Inc., June 16, 1993, p.  II-3.)
<P>
     The FAA often underestimates the costs that a regulation actually
imposes. Pending requirements for alcohol testing beyond the current
mandate for drug testing, for instance, would require all job
applicants and 50 percent of all current employees to be tested each
year. Although the government claims the cost would be only $66.6
million over ten years, industry estimates suggest the actual costs
would be closer to $1.4 billion over the ten-year period. And when the
FAA issued a rule to increase the restrictions on access to secured
areas of airports, its cost estimate was $168 million. Since the rule
went into effect in 1989, air carriers report they have spent more
than $500 million to comply. Moreover, the rule is still not fully
implemented. The final cost could be up to $1 billion. (Ibid., p. 
I-1.)
<P>
     The Airline Commission cites the FAA's own estimates that more
than $3.5 billion has been added to airline costs since 1984 as a
result of an attempt by regulators to achieve small, incremental
improvements in safety through the imposition of new rules and
procedures, and suggests an inadequate assessment of the gains
relative to the compliance burden. 
<P>
     The Airline Commission recommends an annual regulatory cost
budget, except for emergency safety regulations, to force more careful
consideration by the government of costs and benefits. Such a
budgetary frame of reference would compel regulators to consider the
overall cost picture as they look at individual regulatory issues.
This proposal is innovative and is supplemented by the suggestion that
the FAA be required annually to inform Congress and the Department of
Transportation of the costs of their own proposals.
<P>
3)   Reducing the Tax Burden
<P>
     The Commission report makes the point that financial weakness in
the airline industry is primarily a self-inflicted wound. Although the
1990-1991 recession was a major factor, the report notes the heavy
debt burdens taken on during the long 1983-1989 growth cycle set up
the industry for its current financial weakness. Significantly, the
Commission roundly rejects any notions of government route or price
controls to bolster the balance sheets of air carriers.
<P>
     Nevertheless, the Commission attacks the perverse way in which
federal taxes compound these problems. Taxes can seriously weaken a
capital-intensive industry, such as the airlines. From 1990 to 1992,
the airline industry lost $10 billion, yet paid $670 million in
corporate taxes. "We believe those [tax] provisions violate reasonable
principles of common sense and good public policy," the Commission
concludes. The Alternative Minimum Tax, the ticket tax and cargo
waybill tax, transportation fuel taxes, and a host of other charges
add up to more than $5 billion annually in taxes paid by an industry
that only once in the past quarter century has achieved the average
profit margin for U.S. industry.
<P>
     Just as the FAA's modernization needs have been sacrificed to
other demands in the federal budget, federal tax policy hits
passengers and shippers of air freight disproportionately. As part of
the disastrous 1990 budget agreement, these taxes were increased by 25
percent, yet none of the new revenue was used to modernize or improve
the safety of air travel. Implementing the Airline Commission's
proposal to remove the FAA from the unified budget process would
permit the rollback of these taxes as well, saving passengers,
shippers, and the airlines over $900 million per year.
<P>
4)   Moving Beyond Nationalism in Air Service
<P>
     The international air traffic system, put in place in 1944, now
consists of 1,200 bilateral agreements among governments covering
landing rights and overflight privileges for each other's airlines.
Because these arrangements are not multilateral and regulated by a
regime such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), with
general rules applying to all trading partners, governments commonly
play favorites and abuse the highly structured system. France and
Germany, for instance, currently discriminate against U.S. air
carriers, and the Commission cites studies indicating that passengers
to both Canada and Japan could enjoy a huge expansion in service from
the United States if the bilateral agreement system were changed.
<P>
     The Airline Commission report recommends that the United States
work to create a multinational system both for air services and for
ownership of air carriers. The United States is the largest single
market and has the most efficient air transportation industry. But
under the existing fifty-year-old treaty regime a legal advantage
accrues to the rest of the world in serving the U.S. market, holding
back the generally more efficient U.S. airlines. 
<P>
     The bilateral system tends to exacerbate the perception of a
zero-sum situation, in which every concession a foreign government
might grant for increased service by a U.S. air carrier looks like a
slice of the market taken away from its own air carriers. In truth,
the air service market has demonstrated, through the U.S. domestic
example, the same potential to expand through lower costs and scale
efficiencies as every other kind of service.
<P>
     The Commission suggests negotiating regional multinational
agreements first, then expanding negotiations to a worldwide basis. It
urges the President to appoint an experienced aviation professional to
lead these international negotiations, with the rank of ambassador at
large.
<P>
     Just as important as market access, the Commission recommends a
major change in the rules governing ownership of U.S. airlines.
Specifically, it urges that:

     <UL>The Federal Aviation Act be amended to allow the U.S. to
     negotiate bilateral agreements that permit foreign investors
     to hold up to 49 percent voting equity in U.S. airlines,
     providing those bilateral agreements are liberal and contain
     equivalent opportunities for U.S. airlines; the foreign
     investor is not government-owned; there are reciprocal
     investment rights for U.S. airlines, and the investment will
     advance the national interest and the development of a
     liberal global regime for air services.</UL>
<P>
     Current law limits foreign ownership in domestic airlines to 25
percent of voting stock. Senator John Danforth, the Missouri
Republican, who served as a non-voting member of the Airline
Commission, has introduced a bill (S. 771) similar to the Commission's
proposal. However, the proposal does not go far enough, because there
still would be a cap of 49 percent on the equity share of non-U.S.
citizens. There is no reason for this percentage cap. Foreign
investors are hardly enemy foreign agents and there is no legitimate
reason to limit foreign ownership in airlines any more than the U.S.
limits foreign investment in other industries.
<P>
5)   Declining production of general aviation aircraft.     
<P>
     Whereas sales of small piston-engine airplanes averaged 13,000
per year from 1965 through 1982, product liability insurance costs,
among other factors, have reduced this to barely 500 per year today.
Over 100,000 jobs have been lost in manufacturing, sales, service, and
related industries. The Airline Commission recommends enactment by
Congress of a "statute of repose." This would bar claims against
small-aircraft manufacturers for defective designs on aircraft more
than fifteen years old. Senator Nancy Kassebaum, the Kansas
Republican, has introduced legislation (S. 67) addressing this
concern, among others.
<P>
6)   Airlines in Financial Distress. 
<P>
     The report also calls for the creation of a presidentially
appointed airline financial advisory committee to advise the Secretary
of Transportation when an airline's financial condition poses risks to
the public or to the industry. 
<P>
     While that recommendation may seem sensible or innocuous, there
would be many dangers inherent in a new regulatory panel with special
access to the Secretary of Transportation. In particular, such a body
could become a powerful advocate of re-regulation during periods of
economic recession. (Commissioner John E.  Robson entered a strong
dissent to the proposal for a presidentially appointed financial
advisory board:  "In fact," notes Robson, "it looks dangerously like
what the now-defunct Civil Aeronautics Board used to do back when the
airline industry was regulated.")

     <P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
     The National Commission to Ensure a Strong Competitive Airline
Industry has published an exemplary report that should dispel any
remaining doubts about the wisdom of deregulating the airlines in
1978. If enacted, the proposals to reduce taxes, rationalize the
system of safety regulation, and examine the benefits and costs of
regulation within a budgeted framework will strengthen the financial
condition of the airline industry. Putting the air traffic control
system on a commercial basis, with a normal, private-sector capital
budgeting system, will permit air travel to stay abreast of
communications, navigation, and safety technology -- a most important
responsibility that the FAA demonstrates cannot be done as well as it
should be in the context of the current government bureaucracy.
<P>
     The need to achieve a truly global air service industry is
perhaps the most important conclusion of the Commission, yet at the
same time it recognizes the tremendous obstacles that would have to be
overcome to attain that goal. Encouraging private, multinational
ownership of a few dozen globe-spanning airline corporations, in place
of today's politically dominated structure is a subtle and wise step.
Cross ownership may represent a "people-to-people" strategy that can
break down political rigidities and protectionism.
<P>
     Congress and the Clinton Administration should take the
Commission's recommendations to heart. If they are implemented, the
U.S. airline industry can look forward to a more profitable future,
and passengers will enjoy even better and more economical travel.<P>

<h3>THE QUEST FOR JUSTICE: NATURAL RIGHTS AND THE FUTURE OF PUBLIC INTEREST LAW</h3><P>
<b>By William H. Mellor III and Clint Bolick </b><br>
September 10, 1991<br>

<P>
<B> CLINT BOLICK</B>:   I'm excited to be here with my partner, Chip Mellor,
to announce the opening of the Institute for Justice.  I will leave
largely to him the task and pleasure of sharing with you our vision
for shaping American jurisprudence in the coming years.  By way of
brief introduction to Chip's more extended remarks, I'd like to
reflect a bit on some of the events of the past few years, to survey
the much-changed landscape that this new enterprise will encounter, to
celebrate some of those changes, and to take stock of the sobering
challenges that lay ahead.
<P>
      Three and a half years ago, I launched with Landmark Legal
Foundation an effort to transform the terms of the debate in the area
of civil rights.  All of us involved in the effort wondered whether it
was possible to make inroads on issues utterly dominated by the Left. 
We wondered if we possibly could reclaim the moral high ground
abdicated long ago.  Working with allies such as The Heritage
Foundation, the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise -- and to
an encouraging extent, the Bush Administration -- we helped to fashion
a new agenda, based on the traditional principles of civil rights, in
an effort to replace a divisive and demoralizing policy of rampant
social engineering with one based on equal opportunity and individual
empowerment.
<P>
      I don't think any of us could have predicted, in our wildest
optimism, how dramatic a change would take place in the next three
years.  By exposing the true nature of the Left's civil rights agenda,
we were able to derail, at least thus far, legislation that would make
racial classifications a permanent feature of the American landscape,
but would do nothing to solve the serious problems facing the most
disadvantaged members of our society.  And what the events of the last
three years have demonstrated about the civil rights establishment is
that the emperor has no clothes.  Weighted down by its special
interest group entanglements and by the patronizing attitudes of its
leadership elite, the civil rights establishment increasingly has lost
sight of the needs of its constituency and the principles that fueled
its past success.  Nowhere is this more apparent than in the battle
over the confirmation of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court, in
which the civil rights establishment seems determined to prove just
how irrelevant it is to the realities facing America in the 1990s.
<P>
      Sharing the American Dream.  More important, we recently have
begun refocusing the debate on removing barriers to opportunity and
helping low-income people earn their share of the American Dream.  For
my part, what has been most gratifying about the past three years is
the people I have encountered in these efforts.  People like Ego Brown
and the homeless entrepreneurs who, freed from arbitrary economic
regulations, are lifting themselves by their own bootstraps.  Kimi
Gray, Bertha Gilkey, Doretha Gayden, and other public housing tenants,
who are reclaiming their communities and gaining a stake in the
ownership of property.  Little Devon Williams, who was able to escape
the cesspool of the Milwaukee Public Schools and instead get a good
education in an excellent neighborhood private school, thanks to the
nation's first real parental choice program.  I tell you, the
inspiration, the look of joy and optimism on their faces, speak
volumes to the fact that we are right, and that we must persevere in
these efforts that are only barely begun.
<P>
      But for all our triumphs, we have very far to go.  Perhaps never
was this more painfully clear to me than in the recent case of Junie
Allick.  Junie is a native of the United States Virgin Islands.  Like
his grandfather and his father before him, Junie earns his living from
the sea.  For many years, he and other native Islanders operated
successful businesses by sailing tourists to Buck Island to enjoy its
beautiful coral reefs.  It made a wonderful living for Junie, who
welcomed newcomers to the business and even taught some of them how to
sail the waters of St.  Croix.
<P>
      Vicious Process. But in the late 1970s, the National Park
Service, which had assumed ownership of Buck Island, instituted a
highly complex licensing process for charter boat operations to Buck
Island, and imposed a so-called "attrition policy" designed to reduce
the number of boats; not for ecological or safety reasons, but rather,
in the words of one Park Service official, to halt "predatory price
cutting" among boat operators.  Unfortunately, Junie and several other
skilled sailors were not so adept at navigating the sea of
bureaucracy.  Junie, who operated the only antique native-built sloop
in the Virgin Islands, lost his permit for taking his boat out of
commission to repair a broken mast longer than the Park Service
allowed; and even though he consistently had received the highest
ratings from the Park Service, the agency refused to grant him a new
permit.  Over the course of ten years, the attrition policy reduced
the number of charter boat operators from 22 to seven, and the number
of native Islanders to zero.  Through its vicious and arbitrary
licensing process, the government had systematically destroyed a
flourishing native business.
<P>
      I met Junie a few years ago.  He took me sailing, and I was awed
by his skill, and by the esteem in which he obviously is held by other
sailors.  I saw my first dolphin swimming alongside the boat.  And
even though I cautioned that the odds were against us if we sued the
government, Junie told me, "I know it will work out, Clint.  This is
America."
<P>
      We filed a lawsuit challenging the Park Service attrition
policy, arguing that if the government deprives a person of the
opportunity to earn a living in his or her chosen profession, it must
demonstrate its policy serves a legitimate purpose in a rational way. 
But a few months ago, the federal district court here in Washington
ruled against Junie Allick.  Judge Charles Richey was incredulous that
someone would sue the government over a business that generated less
than $20,000 in annual income.  Junie Allick, in the words of Judge
Richey, was merely a "frustrated government contractor," with no
constitutional rights in this matter.  And in no less summary fashion
than that did the court dispense with Junie's hopes, his livelihood,
maybe even his future.  Junie may never sail to Buck Island again.
<P>
      Fundamental Rights. One point that the great civil rights
leaders from William Lloyd Garrison to Martin Luther King emphasized
was the universality of rights.  Each of us possesses fundamental
rights that no government may take away.  If any of us loses our
rights, we all lose our rights.  And if Junie Allick does not have
liberty, then none of us has liberty.  We have so much work to do.
<P>
      There is no aspect of the mission ahead that encourages me more
than to be reunited with my partner, Chip Mellor, who is the
Institute's president and general counsel.  I began my legal career
with Chip in 1982, when he was acting president of Mountain States
Legal Foundation in Denver.  We have collaborated often since that
time, most recently during his tenure as president of Pacific Research
Institute, which developed the litigation blueprints that will guide
the Institute for Justice.  Of course, anyone who would leave San
Francisco and move to Washington, D.C.  -- especially during August --
has got to be committed to the mission.  I am so pleased to welcome
back to Washington, and to introduce to you, Chip Mellor.
<P>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>
<B> WILLIAM H. MELLOR III</B>:    I would like to express my appreciation to
The Heritage Foundation for all it has done to help us launch our new
endeavor.  It is a pleasure and an honor to announce the creation of
the Institute for Justice at a Heritage lecture.  While the Institute
is brand new, the idea for it has been germinating for quite some
time.  It is the culmination of the work and faith of many people over
the last decade, so we are especially grateful for the opportunity and
challenge of launching this new enterprise.
<P>
      Eight years ago, in the shade of my Denver backyard, Clint
Bolick and I vowed that one day we would join forces to pursue a
vision of public interest advocacy devoted to individual rights and
economic liberty.  We had witnessed first hand the graphic difference
between pro-business and pro-free enterprise litigation.  We saw the
tragic consequences of expedient, ad hoc case selection covered with a
public interest veneer.  Clint and I concluded that a very different
approach was necessary -- a long-term, philosophically and tactically
consistent litigation program based on natural rights and the
Constitution.  We believed this new approach was essential if the
courts were to play their designated role as guarantors of liberty. 
The rule of law so necessary to a free society was too often twisted
into a force that destroyed not only isolated individuals, but also
the very fabric of community upon which our society is based.  Court-
ordered busing as neighborhood schools failed, open-ended protection
of criminals while the pain of crime victims was ignored, expansion of
welfare entitlements while government closed avenues for initiative
and upward mobility -- all these and more were among the policies that
our legal system fostered and protected.
<P>
      But the time was not then ripe to launch a counteroffensive. 
The courts were hostile and the political terrain was in transition. 
Clint and I each decided to contribute our talents to the Reagan
Administration.
<P>
      Judicial Touchstone.  It was a time of both idealism and heated
debate.  One of the most passionately debated issues at that time, of
course, was the proper role of the judiciary.  The theory of judicial
restraint, that is, the notion that judges are to apply the written
law and not attempt to create it, was the jurisprudential touchstone
of the Reagan Administration.  Conservatives vehemently opposed
judicial activism that led to sweeping changes wrought by judges
accountable to no one.  Such egregious practices as expansive
application of environmental laws and the creation of new welfare
"rights" came to symbolize for conservatives all that was wrong with
the way courts functioned under the influence of judicial activism. 
The debate became so polarized that allegiance to judicial restraint
became a requirement for conservative legitimacy in certain circles. 
And it remains so today.
<P>
      Yet, as we observed this process, it was apparent to us that
these two opposing approaches to jurisprudence lost sight of
legitimate, indeed vital, concerns that did not fit neatly into the
respective paradigms.  While abhorring many results of liberal
judicial activism, we believed that emphasis on judicial restraint as
an end in itself gave insufficient hope for protecting crucial rights. 
And for those rights already emasculated by judicial edict, judicial
restraint simply enshrines bad law.
<P>
      For example, the Constitution states that private property shall
be protected from government expropriation.  Yet decades of court-made
law removed much of this protection.  Is one wrong in calling for
judicial activism that urges courts to strike down wrongful government
takings?  The Constitution protects economic liberty, but this right
was nullified through a single Supreme Court case a hundred years ago. 
Is one a proponent of improper judicial activism in calling for the
reversal of such intolerable precedent?  Of course not.  The common
assumption that judges are bound by precedent or stare decisis does
not mean that we are stuck with the tyranny of the status quo.  When
presented with compelling arguments, courts can and should reverse
prior decisions.  Reversal of prior decisions is not uncommon, even at
the Supreme Court.  The overarching rationale behind this practice is
in line with C.S.  Lewis's admonition:  "When you are on the wrong
road, progress means doing an about-turn and walking back to the right
road " (C.S.  Lewis, Mere Christianity (New York:  Collier Books,
1953), p.  22.)
<P>
      Temptation to Deny Rights.  Questions such as these are all the
more pertinent because neither the legislative nor the executive
branch of government has a record of consistent support for precious
rights and liberties.  Indeed, examples of legislative and executive
excess are all too common.  And the option of simply allowing the
legal system to operate in an ad hoc fashion gives absolutely no
solace.  We know that skilled advocacy by those who favor greater
government involvement in economic and private affairs continually
pushes court decisions farther to the left.  But even more important,
the legal system itself, through its complex web of procedures,
statutes, and incentives provides a relentless temptation to expand
government and deny rights.  As Friedrich Hayek recognized nearly
twenty years ago, "We live in such a period of transformation of the
law by inner forces...  that, if the principles which at present guide
that process are allowed to work themselves out to their logical
consequences, law as we know it as the chief protection of the freedom
of the individual is bound to disappear." (Friedrich Hayek, Law,
Legislation and Liberty, vol.  1 (Chicago:  University of Chicago
Press, 1973), p.  66-67.)
<P>
      Faced with this stark reality, we believe it is proper, indeed
imperative, that there be skilled advocates for liberty, armed with
philosophically and tactically consistent strategies for restoring a
rule of law based on natural rights and the Constitution.
<P>
      The opportunity to pursue such a course reflects the maturing of
the pro-free enterprise public interest movement, whose vigil in the
courts has been a lonely one.  We owe a debt to those who have fought
in the legal trenches.  Groups such as the Washington Legal
Foundation, and more recently the Center for Individual Rights have
been tenacious in their efforts.  Notable successes of the Pacific
Legal Foundation and the Competitive Enterprise Institute in the field
of property rights and of the Landmark Legal Foundation in the area of
civil rights were achieved precisely because they arose through
litigation designed to vindicate clear principles.  These victories,
achieved after years of hard work, are an important beginning.  Just
imagine how much farther along we would be today if we had been able
to develop and implement a long range litigation and education
strategy ten years ago.
<P>
      Manifesto for Empowerment. Fortunately, we approach this task
with the strategies developed during the past several years by the
Center for Applied Jurisprudence of the Pacific Research Institute. 
At the Center for Applied Jurisprudence, task forces of the nation's
leading practitioners and scholars of law, such as Richard Epstein,
Nathan Glazer, Michael McConnell, Randy Barnett, Chuck Cooper, William
Allen, and others, helped us develop and refine strategies.  Out of
this effort came, among other things, Clint's book, Unfinished
Business:  A Civil Rights Strategy for America's Third Century, which
the Wall Street Journal called the "legal manifesto for empowerment,"
and Freedom, Technology and the First Amendment, by Jonathan Emord,
which Michael McConnell hailed as the most successful work ever "in
explaining how the free speech principles of the American Founding can
be faithfully applied to the communications technologies of today." 
Emord joins the Institute in October as our senior litigation counsel.
<P>
      Our mission is to advance natural rights jurisprudence through
precedent setting cases and the development of a bank of talented law
students, lawyers, and policy analysts skilled in public interest
advocacy.  This makes the Institute for Justice unique. 
<P>
       Although our enterprise is new, jurisprudence fundamentally
based on rights, rather than policy or profit, is not.  Natural rights
theories profoundly influenced the framers of the Constitution.  While
the overall influence of natural rights can be debated, it is quite
clear that key provisions of the Constitution are derived from natural
rights.  Unfortunately, such basic beliefs fell out of favor with the
rise of legal positivism and utilitarianism. 
<P>
       During the 1970s a resurgence of interest in rights from a
variety of perspectives was created by influential scholars such as
John Rawls (John Rawls, A Theory of Justice (Cambridge, Massachusetts: 
Harvard University Press, 1971).), Ronald Dworkin (Ronald Dworkin,
Taking Rights Seriously (Cambridge, Massachusetts:  Harvard University
Press, 1977).), and Robert Nozick. (Robert Nozick, Anarchy, State and
Utopia (New York:  Basic Books, 1974).)  Yet this interest is to this
day not manifest in applied jurisprudence, much less in the day-to-day
practice of the law.  In part this is because of the continuing
philosophical arguments over the meaning of rights and their origin. 
Then too a guiding philosophy of rights has been so alien to judicial
decision-making for so long that it has been deemed archaic and
irrelevant.  Moreover, proponents of natural rights often fail to move
beyond basic premises and solve real world problems.
<P>
      Guiding Principles.  The Institute for Justice will meet this
challenge head on through systematic litigation designed to take us,
step by step, closer to a modern jurisprudence based on natural
rights.  In doing so we will be guided by two overriding principles. 
First, a recognition that our system of law is based upon inalienable
individual rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
Second, a belief that in every instance where government activity
adversely affects these rights a court should begin its inquiry with a
presumption in favor of liberty.  This presumption should only give
way upon a showing that a law is actually necessary and proper to the
exercise of a Constitutionally delegated power.  These two principles
are crucial because they recognize and seek to restore the fundamental
relationship of the individual to the state envisioned by the
Founders.
<P>
      Our litigation agenda can be characterized as broadly seeking to
enable individuals to take control of their own destinies as free and
responsible members of society, and to form voluntary communities
based on common interests and aspirations.  When we file an economic
liberty case to strike down government-created barriers to
entrepreneurial activity, we will work to create a system in which
productive lives are not arbitrarily restricted.  When we fight for
educational choice and challenge the public school monopoly, we will
seek to ensure that children of this country have that most important
tool for intellectual growth and economic well-being:  a quality
education.  When we sue for a uniform First Amendment standard for all
media, regardless of the technology involved, we will seek the
unfettered flow of information that people need to exercise political
freedom and to participate in a thriving market economy.  In every
case, we will advance our cause in the courts of law and the courts of
public opinion.
<P>
      Too often today a legal education means learning how to
manipulate an increasingly prescriptive and complicated system for the
narrow benefit of a particular client.  Even the most fundamental law,
Constitutional law, is frequently used as a tool to serve either the
partisan end of a particular client or the political ends of the
welfare state.  Many graduates quickly become technocrats with little
time, interest, or opportunity for public interest work.  However, a
small but growing number of law students and lawyers are not satisfied
with such a fate.  The Federalist Society and the Institute for Humane
Studies are finding impressive young people who want to pursue legal
careers dedicated to conservative and libertarian principles.  We will
teach such people how to apply their talent and idealism in the real
world of litigation, media relations, and public debate.  We will
conduct intensive seminars in public interest advocacy so that whether
they go into private practice, government, or academia, these crucial
individuals will know how to recognize opportunities and effectively
advance rights-based jurisprudence. 
<P>
       At the state and local level, grassroots organizations struggle
valiantly for important causes, ranging from educational choice to
term limitation.  In the heat of their respective efforts, few have
time or expertise to consider the ways in which strategic litigation
could complement and enhance these organizations' efforts.  Our
seminars will train grassroots activists so that they can incorporate
legal strategies into their efforts from the outset.  Equally
important, they will help us identify prospective plaintiffs and
mobilize community interest and support.  Currently there exists no
opportunity for these people to learn the theory and application of
natural law as part of a comprehensive and intensive program to
recapture rights taken by government action or lost through judicial
inaction. 
<P>
       Representing the Powerless.  But the question remains:  Who
will we represent in court?  At a time when there is more litigation
than ever before, increasing numbers of Americans are shut out of the
legal system.  They have no recourse for many legitimate grievances
because of the cost and delays involved in litigation.  They must
stand by while the government's presence in their lives grows
relentlessly.  They are increasingly powerless to control their own
destinies, to provide for their families, or to enjoy the benefits of
liberty. 
<P>
       These are the people we will represent.  We will represent the
entry-level entrepreneur in his quest to strike down arbitrary
barriers to opportunity and thereby earn a share of the American
Dream.  We will aid parents who are striving to rescue their children
from the fate assigned to them by the failing public school monopoly
in the inner city.  We will represent people whose right to enjoy the
fruits of their labor -- their property -- has been taken from them by
oppressive government regulation and outright expropriation. And we
will fight for the producers and consumers of information in their
efforts to resist government control over the most precious of
markets:  the marketplace of ideas.
<P>
      In sum, our efforts are about rights, but more important, they
are about the people who possess these rights.  For too long we have
talked in abstractions and theories.  But as our movement has matured,
we now have the opportunity to move from academic debate into the real
world, and to address the vital concerns of real people.  For these
people yearn only for what Thomas Jefferson referred to in his first
Inaugural Address -- to be left "free to regulate their own pursuits
of industry and improvement."
<P>
      These are the people we will represent. 
<P>
       And, after all, we really are only helping them reclaim what
has been rightfully theirs all along.
<P>
      Justice indeed.

INTRODUCTION<p>
<P>  Legislation now in Congress would add another layer of
regulation and significantly expand the enforcement authority of the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the federal agency that approves
drugs for safety and effectiveness. This legislation would slow down
the pace of approvals, increase consumer costs, and add reams of
unnecessary paperwork. Yet it would provide little or no benefit to
Americans. Meanwhile the Bush Administration, through the Council on
Competitiveness, has been taking administrative action to attempt to
streamline the regulatory process and speed up approval of new drugs
to treat such deadly diseases as AIDS, cancer, and cystic fibrosis. 

<P>The FDA is a division of the Public Health Service, itself an
agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). It
is the largest consumer protection agency in the world, with
regulatory authority over food, drugs, cosmetics, and medical devices.
In fact, the FDA's vast authority covers approximately one-third of
all items consumed in the United States. Some 25 cents out of every
dollar spent in America is spent on products regulated by the FDA.

<P>The FDA is also a law enforcement agency. It is responsible for
enforcing the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and several other
statutes regarding foods, drugs, and medical devices. These include
the Biologics Act, the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990, the Fair
Packaging and Labeling Act, and parts of many other statutes. (Peter
Barton Hutt and Richard A. Merrill, Food and Drug Law (Westbury, New
York: The Foundation Press, 1991), Appendix B.) One of the FDA's key
responsibilities is certifying prescription drugs as safe and
effective. 

<P>This April, Vice President Dan Quayle and HHS Secretary Louis
Sullivan announced reforms in the FDA regulatory process to speed up
the availability of new drugs, especially to patients who are
desperately ill. The reforms were generated by the President's Council
on Competitiveness, chaired by Quayle, and are part of the
Administration's strategy to ease burdensome regulation. The FDA
reforms include "accelerated approval" of new "breakthrough drugs" for
patients with life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, Alzheimer's
disease, and cystic fibrosis. Under the new rules, for instance, AIDS
patients have the freedom to use experimental drugs outside of the
normal process of controlled clinical studies used to test a drug's
safety and effectiveness. The Bush Administration also has ordered the
FDA to rely upon outside experts, under contract, to review
applications for new drug approvals. It has ordered the agency to use
scientific data validating the safety of drugs from Japan and member
nations of the European Community as a basis for drug approval in the
United States. According to HHS Secretary Sullivan, these initiatives
are designed to save lives, cut the time required to bring new drugs
into the market, and enhance the competitiveness of American
pharmaceutical companies while retaining "rigorous" FDA oversight.
(HHS News, April 9, 1992.) While these reforms are well intentioned,
they must be administered by the FDA bureaucracy, and therefore their
impact is likely to be limited.

<P>While the Bush Administration is going ahead with regulatory
relief, Congress is considering the "Food, Drug, Cosmetic and Device
Enforcement Amendments of 1991" (H.R. 3642). (A word regarding
notation. A bill with the same title and with only slight
modifications was previously considered as H.R. 2597. Much of the
published analysis of the bill refers to "H.R. 2597." For consistency,
I will generally use H.R. 3642 in discussing this bill. Whenever a
direct quotation refers to "H.R. 2597," I will refer to [H.R. 3642].)
This would give the FDA sweeping new regulatory powers. The
legislation is sponsored by Representative Henry Waxman, the
California Democrat, and cosponsored by John Dingell, the Michigan
Democrat and Chairman of the powerful House Committee on Energy and
Commerce. 

<P>Some of the powers the bill confers on the agency are to:
administratively recall products with no court hearing; seize or
embargo products if an officer or employee of the FDA believes that a
product is in violation of the Act, with no requirement that the
violation be safety related, and no requirement of proof; subpoena
company records, including trade secrets and names of individuals in
medical files; and levy large fines. The Bush Administration is
opposed to the bill in its current form, but still might agree to some
form of the legislation. If some version of this bill becomes law,
costs of prescription drugs would rise and consumer health might well
suffer. 

<P>While the proposed increased enforcement authority will add to
manufacturers' costs, there is no reason to believe that the agency's
enhanced powers will have any beneficial effect in improving health.
For example, the FDA recently raised concerns about the safety of
silicone breast implants. But the FDA already has sufficient
administrative discretion to essentially ban breast implants under
current law without any new powers. Indeed, in the wake of the breast
implant episode, FDA is increasing regulation of all medical devices,
and is able to do so under current law. (Philip J. Hilts, "U.S. Cracks
Down on Health Devices Made Before 1976," The New York Times, February
24, 1992, p. 1; Bruce Ingersoll, "Changes Vowed for Reviewing Medical
Devices," The Wall Street Journal, March 26, 1992, p. A3.) Thus, even
if breast implants are determined to be unsafe, current law provides
adequate remedies. 

<P>There is no good case for the strengthened FDA enforcement
powers included in H.R.3642. Among the reasons:


<P>The FDA already has substantial enforcement authority. The agency has
a wide variety of powerful legal tools at its disposal, including
injunctions against food and drug firms, and recalls and seizures of
food and drug products. It also has powerful criminal sanctions. And
since the FDA regulates virtually all aspects of many food and drug
firms' business, it can use these powers to influence a firm's
commercial activities. 

<P>There is no evidence that current FDA enforcement policies are
harming consumers through ill-considered approvals or lax enforcement
of the law. Supporters of the bill have not presented convincing
evidence that consumers are harmed by lax enforcement. Advocates of
stronger enforcement authority focus on narrow bureaucratic
justifications for the proposed statute, such as consistency of
enforcement powers across all products the agency regulates.

<P>Congress already is concerned that FDA is not using its current
regulatory authority in a responsible fashion. For example,
Congressman Dingell, a strong supporter and co-sponsor of H.R. 3642,
has also recently criticized the FDA for abuse of the powers it
already possesses. The FDA is threatening to close Barr Laboratories,
a maker of generic drugs, which was the "whistleblower" regarding
misconduct at the FDA. Chairman Dingell is obviously aware that the
agency already has awesome power and that an abuse of that power is a
real danger. (Milt Freudenheim, "FDA Moves to Shut Drug Maker
Queried," The New York Times, November 7, 1991, p. C6.)

<P>Provisions of proposed legislation could be harmful to consumers.
H.R.3642, for example, increases FDA's powers to issue subpoenas,
demand record-keeping and inspections, issue recalls and embargoes,
and levy fines. All of these powers would lead to increased costs of
doing business for firms regulated by the FDA, which would be passed
on to consumers. But even more important, the threat of FDA
intervention and the increased risk of loss of trade-secret protection
would discourage firms from developing and marketing new products,
denying these to American consumers who could be helped by them.


<P>While strengthening FDA's enforcement authority may be
unnecessary, Congress should support genuine reforms that benefit
consumers, such as the Bush Administration's initiative to assure more
rapid drug approval procedures, allowing new drugs to become available
much more quickly to Americans who can benefit from them. Taking swift
action to approve a drug may mean that some drugs will reach the
market that pose some risks to patients. But painstaking certification
procedures also may pose risks, because a drug that may cure a
patient's illness is held back until every conceivable risk or side-
effect is checked out. Wisely, the Bush Administration realizes that
these risks should be weighed against potential consumer benefits.
Abundant statistical analysis, moreover, indicates that traditionally
the FDA has placed much more weight on the risk of action than of
inaction. By streamlining drug approval, rather than making the
process more lengthy and cumbersome, consumers will benefit. 

<P>The FDA now spends about one-half of its resources on
enforcement. (Alan L. Hoeting, "The FDA's Philosophy of Enforcement,"
Food Drug Cosmetic Law Journal, Vol. 46, No. 2 (1991), p. 269.) But
the health of Americans has been suffering from delays in the approval
of new drugs, not from the inadequate inspection of foods and drugs.
For example, 204 new drugs were introduced in the U.S. from 1977 to
1987; of these, 114 were first available in Great Britain, and had
been available for an average of five years. Only 41 drugs approved in
Britain during this period were available in the U.S. first, and then
only for an average of two-and-a-half years, not five. (Sam Kazman,
"Deadly Overcaution: FDA's Drug Approval Process," Journal of
Regulation and Social Costs, Vol. 1, No. 1 (September 1990), p. 40.)
The health of Americans will be improved by shifting FDA resources to
drug approval procedures, thus speeding up the approval of new drugs.
Instead of focussing on greater enforcement authority, Congress also
can amend the laws to make it even easier for the FDA to spend more on
drug approvals. (The argument is as follows: As of now, no consumer is
harmed from inadequate inspection but many consumers are harmed from
delays in drug approval. If the amount spent on inspection is
marginally reduced, some harm might begin to occur, but for small
shifts this harm would be small. On the other hand, shifting resources
towards faster drug approval would definitely provide large benefits
to consumers. Resources should be incrementally moved from enforcement
to approval until, at the margin, benefits to consumers from each
activity are equal.) Rather than simply adding another layer of
regulations, Congress could re-evaluate current FDA authorities and
clarify FDA's authority to protect commerce.  

<P>According to one source, "FDA lacks the resources to implement
all of the missions delegated to it by Congress." (Hutt and Merrill,
Food and Drug Law, pp. 1240.) The agency openly admits that it does
not enforce "economic" provisions of its statute. (Hutt and Merrill,
Food and Drug Law, p. 1056.) In effect, FDA already chooses to enforce
some laws but not others, and to enforce some laws more stringently
than others. In the meantime, it clearly has the power to shift
resources to drug approval from enforcement if it so desires. Such a
shift would greatly benefit the public health. 

<P>Congress appears to be going in another direction. By giving the
FDA greater regulatory power, proponents of H.R. 3642 would encourage
the agency to spend more resources on enforcement and therefore less
on drug approval. Thus, the incentives in this bill would move the
agency further away from efficiency, and would inadvertently lead to
greater health risks. 

<P>Congressional supporters of increased FDA enforcement powers
seem mainly concerned with bureaucratic consistency and avoiding bad
publicity for the agency if it fails to stop the marketing of a
product which carries minor risks -- even if that product could bring
benefits to millions. In fact, consistency could as easily be obtained
by streamlining the regulatory powers associated with some products as
by making the overview of less-regulated products more stringent. In
any case, bureaucratic consistency is a weak reed on which to hang a
major policy revision, particularly one which will impose substantial
costs and seems unlikely to provide any benefits other than
bureaucratic consistency.
<P>

THE FDA'S MASSIVE REGULATORY AUTHORITY<P>
Proponents of increased FDA enforcement authority argue that the
agency now has insufficient regulatory authority. Yet nothing is
further from the truth. The agency has enormous regulatory authority.
According to Alan L. Hoeting, the Director of the FDA's Office of
Enforcement, the FDA already has at its disposal 26 possible
enforcement tools. ( Hoeting, op. cit., p. 269.) The agency can, for
instance:

<P> Inspect pharmaceutical factories without warrant;
<BR>Seize batches of a product if the batch is adulterated 
or mislabeled;
<BR> Carry out multiple seizures, effectively eliminating a
product (or a company) from the market;
<BR> Avoid paying compensation if perishable products are
ruined pursuant to a seizure, even if the seizure turns
out to be groundless. 

<P>Indeed, says Hoeting, the agency is "vulnerable to criticisms of
untimely action" because it "has many internal discussions on the
selection of the proper regulatory tool." ( Ibid. Apparently
representatives of at least four types of offices (field office,
Center, General Counsel, Enforcement) must decide on which of the 26
available tools to use in a given instance.) Thus the FDA,
paradoxically, may be too slow in some instances in taking action,
precisely because it already has so many enforcement tools that it
cannot easily decide which to use. Such an agency does not need
additional regulatory powers.

<P>The agency can also inspect all food handling establishments.
FDA agents, for instance, can enter these businesses without notice
and spend as much time as they wish monitoring compliance with the
Food and Drug Act. (Statement of Peter Barton Hutt on behalf of the
Grocery Manufacturers of America, Inc., regarding [H.R. 3642], June
27, 1991, p. 5.) In 1990, the FDA conducted approximately 20,000 such
inspections and analyzed about 29,500 samples. On a typical day, about
6,000 import entries into the U.S. are subject to review, and an
average of 100 entries, worth in total an average of $4,500,000, are
detained. (Hoeting, p. 268.)

<P>The FDA in addition has the authority to send warning letters to
companies. If these firms fail to convince FDA that its assessment of
the firm's products is incorrect, or fail to comply with its
directives, these companies may be subject to criminal prosecution.
(Hutt statement, pp. 8-9.) The FDA is clearly quite prepared to use
this power. (Steven M. Kowal, "Defending Food and Drug Criminal Cases
in a New Era of Criminal Enforcement," Food Drug Cosmetic Law Journal,
Vol. 46, No. 2, pp. 273-309.) In fact, over 10 percent of cases
referred by the FDA to the Department of Justice have been criminal.
(Kowal, p. 274.) In most cases the FDA alleges crimes in addition to
violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. These include false
statements, mail and wire fraud, obstruction of justice, and
conspiracy. (Kowal, p. 276.) Under the 1984 Sentencing Reform Act,
which since 1987 has set sentencing guidelines for federal judges, the
size of a fine the FDA can levy has greatly increased. (Kowal, pp.
304-308.) Fines are now some multiple of the actual harm caused by the
offense, and can in principle be open-ended. It is now more likely
that officers of a firm who run afoul of the FDA will serve time in
prison. (Kowal, p. 273.)

<P>The FDA has perhaps the most sweeping powers of any regulatory
agency to impose criminal penalties on American citizens. Americans
can even be made subject to criminal sanctions without having known of
or participated in the conduct deemed illegal by the FDA. (Kowal, at
291.) According to Peter Barton Hutt, a former General Counsel of the
FDA, "It is easier for FDA to convict a food company or its officials
of a violation of the FD&C [the Food, Drug and Cosmetic] Act than it
is for the Drug Enforcement Agency to convict a cocaine dealer of a
violation of the Controlled Substances Act." (Hutt statement, pp.
7-8.)
<P>

The FDA's Informal Powers<P>
<P>Beyond its formal, legal authority, the FDA has substantial
informal coercive powers. One major power is simply publicity.
Official press releases containing negative information can discourage
consumers and impose tremendous costs on a firm. While the financial
impact of a FDA press statement can be devastating, the FDA makes
clear it will use the power of the press when it feels that this is
appropriate. (Hoeting, p. 270.)

<P>Publicity alone is a powerful tool. Adverse publicity can result
in substantial loss of reputation for a firm accused of making an
unsafe product. Johnson and Johnson, for example, lost an estimated $1
billion in the value of its reputation from the Tylenol poisonings,
even though the company was in no way culpable. (Mark Mitchell, "The
Impact of External Parties on Brand-Name Capital: The 1982 Tylenol
Poisonings and Subsequent Cases," Economic Inquiry, Vol. 27 (October
1989), pp. 601-618.)

<P>There are similar losses from government-mandated recalls.
Studies examining safety-related product recalls show that for
products recalled by the FDA and the Consumer Product Safety
Commission (CPSC), there is a substantial impact on the stock value of
the firms involved, even though many of the risks that trigger the
recalls are
 quite small. (Sam Peltzman and Gregg Jarrell "The Impact of Product
Recalls on the Wealth of Sellers," Journal of Political Economy, Vol.
93 (June 1985), pp. 512-536; Paul H. Rubin, R. Dennis Murphy, and
Gregg Jarrell, "Risky Products, Risky Stocks," Regulation, No.1
(19880, pp. 35-39.) There are of course direct costs of recalls, but
the loss in firm value caused by FDA-mandated recalls is much greater
than this direct cost, and larger than any potential product liability
exposure as well. The additional loss in firm value is the loss in the
value of the reputation of the firm. For both FDA and CPSC recalls,
the average loss in value as a result of a recall is about 6 percent
of the value of the firm, as measured by stock value. (Peltzman and
Jarrell; Rubin et al.) Thus, adverse FDA publicity can impose
substantial costs on firms.
<P>Beyond recalls, any publicized concern relating to safety can
inflict large costs on a firm. Charges of product tampering, for
example, can seriously damage a firm's reputation, even though there
may be no realistic way in which a firm could have prevented the
tampering, and even if the potential risk due to tampering is
minuscule. (Mitchell, op. cit.) News stories on product-liability
suits, which indicate safety problems with products, can also lead to
significant losses in the value of a firm. (W. Kip Viscusi and Joni
Hersch, "The Market Response to Product Safety Litigation," Journal of
Regulatory Economics, Vol. 2 (1990), pp. 215-230.) And if the FDA
should indicate that it is concerned with the safety of some product,
this can have a similar impact on the firm. 

<P>The FDA can informally affect the food and drug producers in
other ways, sometimes to the detriment of consumers. For example, a
1988 study indicated the beneficial effects of aspirin in preventing
heart attacks. This study found that the risk for male physicians over
fifty was reduced by almost 50 percent. (Steering Committee of the
Physician's Health Study Research Group, "Preliminary Report: Findings
From the Aspirin Component of the Ongoing Physician's Health Study,
New England Journal of Medicine, Vol. 318, No. 4 (January 28, 1988),
pp. 262-264.) Some manufacturers of aspirin understandably began
advertising the results of the research. One producer even began
selling aspirin in a "one-a-day" package, presumably for this use. But
the FDA in July 1989 told manufacturers that they must not advertise
the benefits of aspirin in reducing the chances of a heart attack. 

<P>The FDA had the power to do this in part because aspirin is not
labeled as a preventative for heart attacks, so any advertising of
this property would be contrary to the previously approved label, a
practice which the FDA has the power to forbid. Apparently Frank
Young, Commissioner of the FDA during the Reagan Administration,
believed that consumers should obtain this information only from
physicians. Manufacturers of aspirin were unwilling to contest the
issue with the FDA because of the agency's general power. (This
meeting and the rationale behind the FDA's decision are discussed in
Charles C. Mann and Mark L. Plummer, The Aspirin Wars New York: Alfred
A. Knopf, 1991), pp. 3-10.) This decision was an administrative ruling
by the FDA: there were no hearings and no litigation. The FDA simply
used its informal powers, and the threat of further actions was enough
to block the efforts of firms to publicize the aspirin study's
findings.

<P>With this arsenal of legal enforcement devices, the FDA already
has an enormous impact on the behavior of firms. It is hard to see
what case there could be for increasing the enforcement authority of
the agency.
<P>
THE LOST GOAL OF CONSUMER BENEFIT<P>
<P>If FDA enforcement regulations without question benefitted
consumers, then even draconian regulatory power might in principle be
justified. But this is not the case. The FDA is an inefficient
regulator, and in many instances actually causes harm to consumers
rather than helping them. One example, of course, has been FDA's
notorious delays in approving new drugs. The FDA has also denied
consumers valuable information about drugs and about the health
properties of foods.
<P>

New Drug Approvals
<P>There is always risk associated with introducing a new drug.
This presents the FDA with a problem. It can approve the drug swiftly,
or it can withhold approval, pending further testing and information.
Either decision might be erroneous. (There will always be such
uncertainty; it is never possible to have enough information to be
absolutely certain about the costs and benefits of a drug. Indeed, one
potential costly error is to delay approval while seeking new
information because some will suffer and even die while awaiting new
information.) If the agency approves a drug which later turns out to
be harmful, officials will be attacked for their lack of thoroughness.
On the other hand, if the agency demands exhaustive evidence that a
drug is safe and effective, some Americans might suffer or die while
FDA is gathering and evaluating information about the drug.

<P>In fact, the FDA has been sufficiently cautious that there are
no examples of major disasters from excessively lenient approval of a
new drug. Thalidomide is the classic example of a harmful drug which
was approved for sale -- but never in the U.S. The laws on the books
in 1960 were sufficiently stringent so that this drug was never sold
here. What is surprising is that as a result of the thalidomide
episode, U.S. laws were strengthened and a proof of efficacy was
required for new drugs to be sold in the U.S., even though thalidomide
was never sold in America and even though the problem with thalidomide
was safety, not efficacy. In any case, a thalidomide-like event would
be the worst possible occurrence if the FDA were to err and be too lax
in drug approval. Sam Peltzman, the first scholar to point out the
problems of drug approval, has indicated, based on the thalidomide
episode, that the strongest possible argument in favor of the FDA's
current powers would be that it could prevent "... something like
10,000 deaths or serious disabilities and an economic loss of
something like $300 million perhaps once per decade.... " (Sam
Peltzman, "Statement Before the Subcommittee on Monopoly of the Senate
Small Business Committee," 1973, quoted in Hutt and Merrill, Food and
Drug Law, p. 582.)

<P>Note that this statement was made in 1973. Since that time,
there has never been a major problem with too-easy drug approval
anywhere in the world, even though the U.S. has much more stringent
standards than any other country. In twenty years there has nowhere
been a thalidomide-like episode, so it is clear that Peltzman was
overly pessimistic in estimating the potential harm from reduced
enforcement. If traditional FDA policies have had any beneficial
impact, it has been smaller than Peltzman predicted in his worst-case
estimate. 

<P>Against this hypothetical loss must be counted the real and
measurable costs of the injuries which FDA-delayed drug approvals have
caused. A major example is the class of drugs known as beta-blockers,
which are aimed at reducing heart attack risks. These drugs were
unavailable in the U.S. from 1967 to 1976 as a result of FDA policies.
It is estimated that this delay cost 10,000 lives per year, or a total
of 100,000 needless deaths. (Kazman, op. cit.) This is but one example
of a real cost of FDA delay in drug approval, and for this one drug
alone, costs are greater than any possible estimate of the benefits of
reduced harm from prematurely approved drugs. 

<P>The public interest is best served if the FDA strikes a
reasonable balance between these risks. Traditionally, the agency has
not balanced these risks. In practice, it has placed a much greater
weight on the risk of approving a drug which will ultimately be
harmful than on denying approval of a beneficial drug. (The original
research demonstrating this point was by Sam Peltzman, "An Evaluation
of Consumer Protection Legislation: The 1962 Drug Amendments," Journal
of Political Economy, Vol. 81 (September 1973), pp. 1049-1091. A
summary of the literature appears in William S. Comanor, "The
Political Economy of the Pharmaceutical Industry," Journal of Economic
Literature, Vol. 24 (1986), pp. 1178-1217. For a recent discussion,
see Kazman, op. cit. The issue is also discussed in Hutt and Merrill,
Food and Drug Law, pp. 580-583.) The result has been that far more
Americans have died from a lack of drugs to treat their disease than
would have died from drug reactions if the FDA had approved drugs more
easily.

<P>It is not surprising that the FDA has erred on the side of
excessive caution. Public outrage is swift when the FDA is deemed to
be responsible for allowing a dangerous drug to reach the market. By
contrast, consumers suffering from a disease which would be treatable
if some new drug were approved often are unaware that FDA delays are
the cause of their suffering. Congress has behaved in a similar way.
Officials at the FDA have rarely been accused at congressional
hearings of excessive delays in approving new drugs. But officials
have on many occasions been accused of wrongly approving drugs which
subsequently turned out to be harmful. (According to a former
Commissioner of Foods and Drugs: "In all of our history, we are unable
to find one instance where a Congressional hearing investigated the
failure of FDA to approve a new drug. The occasions on which hearings
have been held to criticize approval of a new drug have been so
frequent in the past ten years that we have not even attempted to
count them." Statement of Alexander M. Schmidt in Senate Hearings,
1974, quoted in Hutt and Merrill, Food and Drug Law, p. 1318.)

<P>When potential beneficiaries of drugs have identified themselves
in advance, the situation changed radically. For example, AIDS
sufferers could identify themselves, and thus knew that the FDA failed
to approve a new drug which would prolong their lives. Therefore it
has not been surprising that the FDA made special efforts to rapidly
approve AIDS drugs. Because victims of AIDS were articulate and were
able to organize themselves into a powerful lobbying group, the FDA
accelerated approval of drugs to fight this disease, and relaxed
normal standards for proofs of safety and efficacy. (This is discussed
in Hutt and Merrill, Food and Drug Law, pp. 552-566.) 

  <P>The Bush Administration's recent regulatory initiatives would
speed up the approval of "breakthrough" drugs for Americans suffering
from deadly diseases such as cancer. The Administration action could
save lives and improve the health of millions of Americans. But,
although such reforms are desirable, the bureaucrats at the FDA are
opposed (For example, 81 percent of FDA officials "disagreed" or
"strongly disagreed" with proposals to privatize new drug application
reviews. See Sidney M. Wolfe, "FDA Physicians Oppose White House Plan
Which Will Endanger Millions of Americans By Weakening the Drug
Approval Process," Public Citizen Health Research Group, Washington,
December 19, 1991.) and likely will do all they can to sabotage them.

<P>The Administration's reforms would, among other things: 


<P>Accelerate approvals. In approving new "breakthrough" drugs for
patients with life-threatening or serious illness, such as cancer or
Alzheimer's disease the FDA will use "surrogate endpoints," a
technical term meaning to rely upon earlier indicators of improved
health, such as changes in blood cholesterol, rather than more
comprehensive testing and analysis as a condition for expeditious
approval. In the meantime, FDA may require additional and more
comprehensive testing of the drug for its effectiveness after
expedited approval, plus provisions for quick withdrawal of the drug
if the FDA conditions are not met.

<P>Adopt parallel track rules for use. Under new FDA guidelines,
"investigational" drugs, or drugs not yet finally approved by FDA for
safety and effectiveness, can be made more readily available to AIDS
patients. The idea is to allow AIDS patients to use such experimental
drugs even if these patients are not participating in the "ongoing
controlled clinical studies" required by FDA. Sponsors of experimental
drugs can submit alternative testing proposals to the FDA or the
Public Health Service to test drugs' safety and effectiveness. Through
these alternative programs, more patients can receive promising
therapies more quickly. While this "parallel track" regulatory reform
is directed toward speeding up drug availability for AIDS patients,
the Bush Administration is also considering this approach for other
serious diseases such as cancer.

<P>Use overseas safety data. Safety data for drugs developed from
animal testing in European countries and Japan can be used in the
United States. FDA will establish standards for expediting the use of
such foreign studies in the drug approval process. By using this data,
drug sponsors will not be required to repeat animal studies and thus
will reduce the time for drug development by as much as six months,
according to FDA authorities.

<P>Use outside experts. The FDA is also beginning to contract with
qualified outside experts, seeking competitive bids to review
applications for new drugs. This measure is designed to reduce the
backlog of applications for new drugs, particularly anti-infective,
anti-inflammatory, and analgesic drugs. While FDA will supervise
contractors and retain final authority on drug approval, contacting
out is also expected to expedite the drug approval process. 

<P>

Consumer Information
<P>The FDA also harms consumers by denying them useful information.
For example, it sharply limits advertising by manufacturers of
prescription drugs. (Paul H. Rubin, "The FDA's Prescription for
Consumer Ignorance," Journal of Regulation and Social Costs, November
1991, pp. 5-25; Alison Masson and Paul H. Rubin, "Matching
Prescription Drugs and Consumers," The New England Journal of
Medicine, August 22, 1985, p. 513; Alison Masson, "Direct To Consumer
Advertising," in Robert N. Mayer, ed., Enhancing Consumer Choice,
American Council on Consumer Interests, Columbia, Missouri, 1991 (in
press); Paul H. Rubin, "Economics of Prescription Drug Advertising,"
Journal of Research In Pharmaceutical Economics, Vol. 3, No. 4 (1991),
pp. 29-40.) In most cases, advertising to consumers is burdened by
requiring companies to include what the FDA terms a brief summary of
side effects and contraindications. (A "contraindication" is a
condition which makes use of some drug undesirable. For example, some
pharmaceuticals should not be taken by a pregnant woman, so that for
these products, pregnancy is a contraindication.) This brief summary,
however, typically is a full page of small print. This requirement
increases the cost of print advertisements and makes television
advertising of prescription drugs virtually impossible. Advertising
could better convey vital health information if it were less heavily
restricted. Moreover, increased advertising is likely to lead to price
reductions for drugs. (Lee Benham, "The Effect of Advertising on the
Price of Eyeglasses," Journal of Law and Economics, Vol. 15 (1972), p.
337; Robert Steiner, "Does Advertising Lower Consumer Prices?,"
Journal of Marketing, Vol. 37 (1973), p. 19; Howard Marvel, "The
Economics of Information and Retail Gasoline Price Behavior," Journal
of Political Economy, Vol. 84 (October 1976), p. 1033; John Kwoka,
"Advertising and the Price and Quality of Optometric Services,"
American Economic Review, Vol. 74 (1984), p. 211; Deborah Haas-Wilson,
"The Effect of Commercial Practice Restrictions: The Case of
Optometry," Journal of Law and Economics, Vol. 29 (April 1986), p.
165; Paul Farris and Mark Albion, "The Impact of Advertising on the
Price of Consumer Products," Journal of Marketing, Vol. 44 (Summer
1980), p. 17; Mark Albion and Paul W. Farris, The Advertising
Controversy: Evidence on the Economic Effects of Advertising (Boston:
Auburn House, 1981).) Since prescription drugs cannot be purchased
without the help of an informed intermediary -- a physician -- there
is less chance for deception and confusion in this market than in
almost any other. Nonetheless, the FDA continues to restrict
advertising of the beneficial effects of prescription drugs. The FDA
ban on advertising the benefits of aspirin in preventing heart attacks
is one example. 

<P>More recently, the FDA has begun to restrict excessively
advertising of pharmaceuticals even to physicians. (John E. Calfee,
"The FDA: Moving Toward a Black Market in Information," The American
Enterprise, March/April 1992, pp. 34-41.) Many drugs are approved and
labeled for one use, but turn out to be useful for other conditions.
This is particularly true of drugs useful for cancer treatment. A
common pattern is for a drug to be approved for one cancer's treatment
and then tested for additional forms of cancer. If the tests are
successful, an article is published in a medical journal. The
manufacturer of the product will then publicize this new use by
sending copies of the medical journal article to interested physicians
and by sponsoring seminars and symposia where physicians can learn of
the drug's new use. The FDA is now stopping companies from publicizing
results showing that drugs are useful in unapproved applications. 

<P>Even if a drug is approved for one use, it must additionally be
approved for any new uses if these uses are to be put on the drug
label; physicians, however, are free to prescribe an approved drug for
any purpose, even if the purpose is not mentioned on the label.
Approval for additional uses can take longer than the original
approval, since new supplemental approvals have lower priority than
original approvals. (Hutt and Merrill, Food and Drug Law, p. 535.)
Moreover, since these drugs already are on the market when a
supplemental approval is requested, future patent life is shorter, and
new approvals are less valuable to a manufacturer. The new FDA policy
limiting promotion of drugs for unapproved uses, therefore, often will
mean that drugs will not be used for these purposes, and the result
will again be reduced health of consumers. 

<P>The FDA similarly places restrictions on advertising the health
benefits of foods. Again, this policy harms consumers. (Richard M.
Cooper, Richard L. Frank and Michael J. O'Flaherty, "History of Health
Claims Regulations," Food Drug Cosmetic Law Journal, Vol. 45, No. 6
(1990), pp. 655-691. Note that this finding of excessive regulation
was before Dr. Kessler began his current crusade to increase such
regulation.) Such advertising would be beneficial. For example,
advertising of higher fiber content in cereals has been shown to have
caused greatly increased level of fiber. (Pauline M. Ippolito and Alan
D. Mathios, "Information, Advertising and Health Choices: A Study of
the Cereal Market," The Rand Journal of Economics Vol. 21, No. 3
(Autumn 1990), pp. 459-480.) This kind of advertising is generally
against FDA policy, and was allowed only because the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) intervened and suggested that the FDA allow the
advertising. By excessively restricting such advertising, the FDA
denies valuable health information to consumers.

<P>Dr. David Kessler, the Commissioner of the FDA, appointed in
1991 by President Bush, seems to be even more restrictive than his
predecessors in his attitude to such advertising. (See remarks by Dr.
David Kessler at the 20th Anniversary Conference, Center for Science
in the Public Interest, Washington, D.C., June 6, 1991.) While no
evidence of any harmful health effect of current advertising and
promotion policies has been shown, Kessler nevertheless is increasing
the staff devoted to enforcing regulations limiting advertising. These
resources could better be devoted to ensuring the success of the
Administration's effort to secure more rapid drug approval.

<P>While the Administration's political leadership, including Vice
President Quayle and Secretary Sullivan, are committed to cutting red
tape and streamlining FDA's regulatory processes to make it easier for
companies to develop and market life-saving drugs, within the FDA
bureaucracy the institutional philosophy is quite different. 



<P>The institutional regulatory spirit at FDA has perhaps best been
expressed by Kenneth Feather, head of the Drug Surveillance Branch of
the FDA, and a regulator of advertising for prescription drugs:
<P>
   <UL> The old way is over. We used to say that if a company 
    made certain changes, then we would probably not take 
    any action. Now, we won't. Now, even if they make the
    changes, they might end up in court. We want to say to 
    these companies that you don't know when or how we'll
    strike. We want to eliminate predictability. (Quoted in 
    The Washington Times, September 12, 1991.)</UL>

<P>FDA staff, in short, favor adding to the financial risk firms
face in introducing new drugs by adding a stiff dose of regulatory
uncertainty and arbitrary retribution for actions that anger FDA
bureaucrats. The result: Fewer therapeutic drugs and less information
about them for Americans. Reversing the agency's current institutional
biases in favor of excessive regulation is a genuine management
challenge for the Bush Administration.
<P>
H.R. 3642: A PRESCRIPTION FOR MORE POWER (The exact terms of the bill
are apparently changing as various amendments and redraftings occur. I
am relying on the October 7, 1991 "Section-By-Section Analysis"; on
the comments of various parties from the July 17, 1991 Hearings; and
on the October 24, 1991 draft of H.R. 3642. (There are slight changes
from 2597 to 3642.) In general, I attempt to discuss the broad nature
of the provisions, rather than the particular details, so that these
comments will apply even if the bill is modified further.)


<P>Although the FDA already has more than adequate enforcement
powers, some members of Congress want to increase the agency's
enforcement authority. H.R.3642, the Food, Drug, Cosmetic and Device
Enforcement Amendments of 1991, is the leading measure to do this. The
bill does this in two basic ways.

 <P>  First, it gives the FDA authority to take many actions
administratively, without obtaining judicial review. Although the FDA
can now undertake some actions without any judicial review, for others
a court order is needed. H.R. 3642 would expand the number of
regulatory activities for which a review is not needed. This gives
agency employees even wider discretion than they now have. (See the
Testimony of Edward Dunkelberger, General Counsel for the National
Food Processors Association, on [H.R. 3642], July 17, 1991.)

<P>In most cases, firms voluntarily comply with FDA requests. But
the FDA itself is tempered in what it asks of firms because it
realizes that a firm does have the option of going to court and
seeking judicial review if it believes that an order is unreasonable,
or that the terms of an order are excessively onerous. Under the
proposed legislation, the FDA would no longer be subject to the
discipline of a potential court review, and the result would be
increased bureaucratic arbitrariness. As indicated earlier, for
example, FDA officials are now attempting to put Barr Laboratories out
of business because this firm has been a whistleblower with respect to
FDA misconduct in approving generic drugs. If H.R. 3642 were now law,
the FDA could administratively eliminate this company by, for example,
indiscriminately seizing or recalling products of the company. 

<P>Second, the bill would impose new costs on manufacturers, which
would increase prices to the consumer. The bill would lead to such
increased regulation and costs primarily because of changes in the law
affecting recalls, subpoenas, and new civil penalties.
More Costly Recalls. H.R. 3642 would strengthen the FDA's power to
order recalls. Today most recalls technically are voluntary. But few
if any firms resist FDA recall requests. If a firm does resist, the
agency has various tools for enforcing recalls; it can seek an
injunction from a court against a firm, or permission from a court to
order a seizure. Criminal prosecution is also possible. The FDA also
can publicize the refusal of a firm to recall its products. Such
publicity can be very damaging financially to a firm. In 1989, for
example, there were 2,183 recalls by the FDA, (Hutt and Merrill, Food
and Drug Law, p. 1205.) so the agency is apparently not now hampered
in its ability to convince firms to undertake recalls which it feels
are justified. In 1937, even before the advent of modern
communications technology, a recall of a truly toxic drug, elixir
sulfanilamide, which caused 100 deaths, accounted for 99.2 percent of
the product. (Hutt and Merrill, Food and Drug Law, p. 1178.) So there
is no reason to believe that any product which truly presents a hazard
would be a problem with respect to a recall. 

<P>Although firms generally comply with FDA recall requests, there
is still room for negotiation. For example, firms may negotiate over
the "depth" of the recall, the level of product distribution to which
a recall will apply. Recalls may be at the consumer level, the retail
level, or the wholesale level. (Hutt and Merrill, Food and Drug Law,
p. 1185.) Empirical evidence indicates that recalls at the consumer
level are generally ineffective, (R. Dennis Murphy and Paul H. Rubin,
"Determinants of Recall Success Rates," Journal of Products Liability
Vol. 11 (1988), pp. 17-28, show that for recalls ordered by the
Consumer Product Safety Commission, for products in the hands of
consumers, only about 7 percent are returned even if the recall occurs
immediately after sale. Since FDA products are more perishable than
CPSC products, one would expect the return rate to be even lower.) but
these recalls impose substantial losses in reputation capital. (Rubin,
Jarrell and Murphy; Peltzman and Jarrell.) Thus, a firm might
rationally suggest a recall only at the wholesale or wholesale and
retail level if the danger from the product is not substantial. Today,
the FDA would be likely to comply with this request because the firm
could threaten litigation if the FDA went farther. But if H.R. 3642
were passed into law the FDA could simply order a recall at the
consumer level, even if this were unlikely to provide any additional
benefits. 

<P>Greater Subpoena and Records Inspection Powers. Current law
allows the FDA to inspect "'records, files, papers, processes,
controls, and facilities' except for 'financial data, sales data other
than shipment data, pricing data, personnel data... and research data'
for prescription drugs and restricted devices." (Hutt and Merrill,
Food and Drug Law, p. 1111.) The bill would grant subpoena powers to
the FDA for all documents, including those classes of documents not
now subject to examination.

<P>The FDA can already examine records related to health or safety,
and it can examine all products directly. This is adequate to detect
any safety concerns with the product. Economic data, such as sales
data, are not needed for determining the safety of a product, and is
valuable competitive information. In this area then, current law
strikes a balance between safety requirements and competitive
protection. The subpoena authority in H.R. 3642 would destroy that
balance and place competitively valuable materials at risk. (The bill
attempts to protect such information by requiring that the
Commissioner himself must make a finding about information regarding
trade secrets and names of individual research subjects, and
forbidding the Commissioner from delegating this authority. In
practice, this will simply mean that the Commissioner will be required
to sign such orders, not a particularly onerous restriction.)

<P>The bill also authorizes the taking of photographs during plant
inspections. Under current law, inspectors generally have the right to
take photographs, and will sometimes obtain court orders for this
purpose. (Hutt and Merrill, Food and Drug Law, p. 1117.) Thus, the
bill will have a relatively small effect on this practice.
Nonetheless, it will make it somewhat easier for inspectors to take
photographs, and in some cases could lead to additional photographs.
Photographs are particularly likely to show trade secrets, because
competitors can learn about secret manufacturing processes and
techniques from such photographs. Currently, if a photograph would be
particularly harmful to a firm for competitive reasons and if it is of
relatively little value to the FDA, the inspector might choose not to
take the photo. Under the new law, he is much more likely to ignore
the firm's requests for secrecy. 

<P>Giving the FDA greater access to business records increases the
risk that a firm's confidential business data or commercial secrets
will be revealed to its competitors. While the FDA no doubt would
attempt to protect such documents, there is no guarantee that it could
do so successfully. Corporate attorney Marvin Frank complains that
"While the majority of the (record) requests are benign, every time
the FDA takes a piece of information from company files, it should be
assumed that the documents will eventually be available to competitors
and adversaries." (Marvin R. Frank, Assistant General Counsel,
Assistant Secretary, Pfizer, Inc. "FDA Inspections: A Practical
Corporate Response," Food Drug Cosmetic Law Journal, Vol. 46, No. 1
(January 1991), p. 73. Note that this analysis was prepared in
connection with existing FDA authority; it was not written with H.R.
3642 in mind.)

<P>Document requests also can be quite costly for a firm, simply in
the time it takes to comply. One heavy cost is the internal corporate
review necessary before the release of a document. As Frank explains,
"No document of this type should be provided without prior review by a
company's own attorney." (Frank, p. 76.) The FDA is aware of the costs
of document requests, and Alan Hoeting of FDA's Office of Enforcement
admits that "some of the congressional requests for information
[Congress' equivalent of a document subpoena] may best be described as
onerous." (Hoeting, p. 268.)

<P>Another legitimate concern of firms is that greater FDA power to
obtain internal documents can mean unfair accusations of corporate
malfeasance. Low-level company employees may write innocent statements
which do not in any way reflect the company position, or which may be
based on misinformation. Nonetheless, if quoted out of context, such
statements may cause the company great embarrassment. Example: A
safety issue may be raised in writing but answered orally; in such a
case, a subpoena would show only the written question. The lack of a
written answer might imply that a reasonable employee concern had been
ignored or covered up. That, in turn, could be used against the
company in regulatory proceedings or in litigation. Example: In the
breast implant matter, it appears that certain memos written by
salesmen have been interpreted as indicating that the company had
safety concerns with the product, even though the memos were not
written by technical experts. A law making such memos easily
accessible to the FDA would lead to additional litigation and would
ultimately lead companies to greatly restrict the information
employees were allowed to put in writing. 

<P>If additional classes of documents are made subject to subpoena
or inspection, one rational corporate response would be simply to
create fewer documents. For example, according to court
interpretations, any contaminant found in a food is a violation of the
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. (Statement of Jerome J. Kozak, Vice
President, International Dairy Foods Association, regarding [H.R.
3642], July 17, 1991, p. 5.) If a company conducts thorough quality
control, and its records indicate some contamination, the firm has
technically created a record of a law violation. This means that the
firms with the best quality control records run the greatest risk of
self-incrimination. Thus, one counterproductive incentive created
under H.R. 3642 would be for companies to reduce their quality control
record keeping. (It might appear that this could be prohibited by
requiring the company to retain such records. However, it is difficult
to see how all companies which now undertake quality control
inspections could be ordered to continue, and difficult to see how
companies could be ordered to keep "high quality" records. Moreover,
there is no such requirement in H.R. 3642.) From the standpoint of
protecting the public, this outcome clearly is absurd.

<P>Civil Penalties. H.R. 3642 gives the FDA power to levy civil
penalties of up to $5,000,000. Under current law, there are only a
small number of instances in which the agency can levy civil
penalties, and amounts are limited. (Discussed in Hutt and Merrill,
Food and Drug Law, pp. 1171-1175.) This bill would greatly expand this
authority. 

<P>The Congressional Staff Analysis of [H.R. 3642] notes that "...
it is expected that in its prosecutorial discretion the FDA would not
impose civil penalties for insignificant or minor violations, just as
today it does not pursue criminal penalties for such types of
violations of the Act." (Section-By-Section Analysis of Substitute
Amendment to H.R. 2597, October 7, 1991, p. 7.) It is unusual,
however, for a prosecutorial body to be given authority to assess
fines of up to $5,000,000 with no limits except its own "prosecutorial
discretion." Moreover, the agency would be more likely to use this
discretion in criminal cases, where it knows that it must be able to
prove allegations "beyond a reasonable doubt," than in civil
proceedings, where it is more likely to win because of the lower
standard of proof -- a "preponderance of the evidence" -- required in
civil actions. It also appears that FDA Commissioner Kessler views his
job as enforcing the law independently of any measure of costs or
benefits. He is conspicuously not using, or is misusing, prosecutorial
discretion in his enforcement of advertising restrictions in cases
where no consumer harm has been demonstrated or even alleged, as
discussed previously.

<P>But even if the FDA does not misuse its civil penalty authority,
firms will be wary of this power and will react accordingly if the
bill becomes law. Because penalties will be possible for even minor
technical violations of the law, companies will greatly increase the
amount they spend to avoid such violations. The results will be higher
costs and higher prices to consumers. The threat of seeking civil
penalties will also serve as a weapon to force individuals -- who can
be fined up to $250,000 -- and firms to accede to other FDA requests,
even if these are unjustified. 


<P>
THE WEAK CASE FOR STRONGER FDA ENFORCEMENT
<P>The FDA's job is to protect the health and safety of Americans.
To make the case that the FDA should have increased enforcement powers
to discharge its responsibility, it is logically necessary for
proponents to show that current FDA powers are insufficient. Advocates
must link laxity or weakness in FDA enforcement to reduced health and
higher risks for consumers. And if such a link can indeed be shown,
they must show that the proposed enforcement strategy would correct
these problems and lead to improved health among consumers.

 <P>But advocates of H.R. 3642 have forged neither link: They have
not shown that the FDA's current powers are insufficient to protect
the health of Americans, nor have they shown that the bill will
improve the health status of Americans. Most of the arguments advanced
for increasing FDA enforcement authority center instead on the alleged
virtues of bureaucratic consistency.

<P>The bill was introduced by Representative Henry Waxman, who is
Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Health and the Environment. In
his opening statement introducing the bill, Congressman Waxman nowhere
mentions health. His main argument is that "... the [existing] statute
is inconsistent," adding that "Other comparable agencies also have
these authorities." (Opening Statement of Representative Henry A.
Waxman, at the Hearing on H. R. 2597, The Food, Drug, Cosmetic and
Device Enforcement Amendments of 1991, July 17, 1991.) Representative
John Dingell, who is a cosponsor of the bill, seems to agree: "As
matters now stand, the Agency is operating under enforcement tools and
procedures enacted 50 years ago. Its regulatory authority differs from
one product category to the next." (Statement by Representative John
Dingell on H.R. 2597, July 17, 1991, p.2.) Neither of these arguments,
however, indicate any national health problems stemming from current
FDA enforcement.

<P>The staff of the House Subcommittee on Health and the
Environment, in an analysis supporting an earlier version of the bill,
refers at one point to health, pointing out that "... between 6.5
million and 33 million people become sick from microbiological
contamination of food, 9,000 of whom die." (Section-By-Section
Analysis of Substitute Amendment to H.R.2597, October 7, 1991.) These
data were derived from a U.S. Department of Agriculture study. (Tanya
Roberts and Eileen van Ravenswaay, "The Economics of Safeguarding the
U.S. Food Supply," United States Department of Agriculture, Economic
Research Service, Agriculture Information Bulletin No. 566, July
1989.) However, the analysis on which this study is based, (Tanya
Roberts, "Human Illness Costs of Foodborne Bacteria," American Journal
of Agricultural Economics, Vol. 71, No. 2 (May 1989), pp. 468-474.)
and discussions with the author, indicate that the analysis applies to
contamination from foods which are subject to Department of
Agriculture but not FDA inspection. This would not be changed by the
bill. Thus, the original congressional staff analysis does not provide
any evidence for adverse health outcomes due to current FDA
enforcement efforts. It does not even claim that the proposed
legislation would affect the illnesses that it asserts occur from
microbiological contamination. 


<P>The only other reference to health is on page 8 of the
congressional staff analysis in connection with recalls, which states:

<P>
   <UL> Ordinarily, where the FDA discovers a serious defect 
    with respect to one of the products it regulates, the
    responsible company voluntarily recalls the product.
    Unfortunately, there have been a significant number of
    instances where the responsible company has refused to
    cooperate, which has led to serious risks to the public
    health. </UL>

<P>No data are given, so it is impossible to determine how
significant this problem is, if it indeed exists. In today's world of
product-liability litigation, it is unlikely that many companies would
resist recalls if the relevant products truly represented safety
risks. Moreover, if a firm does resist, the FDA has the power to seize
the product, enjoin its sale, or institute criminal prosecution. 

<P>The other justifications in this document are remarkably
bureaucratic, rather than substantive. For example, the staff report
states, "The main thrust of [H.R. 3642] is to give the FDA the same
enforcement tools for all the products that it regulates" and
"Although the FDA does not currently have subpoena authority... there
are more than 200 federal statutes giving subpoena authority to other
federal agencies." (Section-By-Section Analysis, p. 2.)

<P>Another source of support for H.R. 3642 is the Final Report of
the Advisory Committee on the Food and Drug Administration, which
spent some time studying the FDA. This committee, appointed by HHS
Secretary Louis Sullivan, refers in its final report to problems with
generic drug approval, and with bribes accepted by some FDA employees
for rapid approval of certain generic drugs. (Final Report, pp. 25 and
30-31.) It does not, however, refer to any adverse health outcomes
from the alleged deficiencies in the generic drug approval or
inspection process. It is not at all clear from the final report that
the relevant generic drugs themselves were inferior or caused adverse
health outcomes, although some of the data used in their approval
apparently were fraudulent. While bribery of FDA employees is and
should be a genuine concern, H.R. 3642's combination of greater FDA
authority to levy fines and increased discretion for FDA employees
could exacerbate this problem. 

<P>The authors of the final report do not provide any basis for the
argument that the FDA's current enforcement powers are inadequate. In
fact, the report actually bolsters the arguments of the critics of
increased FDA powers, who maintain that the agency has more than
enough authority, but is not using it carefully or rationally. Notes
the report, it is "... difficult to speak confidently about the extent
to which FDA's current enforcement efforts are adequate in magnitude
or appropriately targeted." ( Final Report, p. 26.) This is a
disturbing conclusion about the powers of a major regulatory agency
whose decisions affect 25 percent of all expenditures in the U.S.
economy. Yet despite the absence of evidence of effectiveness, the
final report argues that "The Agency should be armed with the same
tools for all the products that it regulates." ( Final Report, p. 29.)
So the public gets another bureaucratic plea for bureaucratic
consistency.

<P>
RECOMMENDATIONS
<P>Since the FDA has tended consistently to err on the side of
withholding approval of new drugs rather than making them available to
patients, and since the agency's sweeping powers in many instances
have counterproductive results, the best way to enhance the health of
Americans would be to streamline the FDA's regulatory process, not add
to its powers. The Bush Administration has greatly advanced this goal
by issuing new regulatory guidelines designed to speed up drug
approval. 

<P>Beyond the Bush Administration's reforms, the FDA's service to
consumers could be further enhanced. Four reforms in particular would
improve consumer health. Of these, the first two could be implemented
relatively easily; the last two would require major legislative
changes, although they would provide substantial benefits. 
<P>

Reform #1: Shift resources from enforcement to drug approval. 
<P>While the Bush Administration initiatives rightly emphasize
expeditious drug approval, this shift would give budgetary substance
to the Administration's reforms. Good intentions and good policy
should be backed up with staff and dollar shifts.

<P>
Reform #2: Base current and future FDA enforcement efforts on likely
health impact.
<P>The FDA should attempt to measure the health impact of its
policies and to allocate its resources so as to maximize the health
benefits of its actions. As mentioned above, one major study of the
FDA found that it is difficult to tell if the agency now appropriately
allocates its enforcement resources. To do so, it should use
quantitative measures and economic analysis, such as cost-benefit or
risk-benefit analysis, on a much more formal basis than it does today.
<P>
Reform #3: Repeal the efficacy requirement for prescription drug
approval.
<P>Before 1962, drugs were approved on the basis of safety. But in
that year, the law was amended to require proof of efficacy as well as
safety. The result: Fewer new drugs are approved; approvals involve
long delays and drugs often are approved for use in other countries
long before they are available in the U.S. This can mean thousands of
Americans die unnecessarily because new drugs are unavailable. For
example, as already discussed, as many as 100,000 Americans needlessly
may have died of heart disease as a result of the ten-year delay in
approving beta-blockers for use in the U.S. ( Discussed in Kazman, op.
cit., pp. 42-43.) The Bush Administration's regulatory change, which
would allow the use of safety data from animal testing in other
countries, is a step in the right direction. Repealing the efficacy
requirement altogether would be a more decisive step.

<P>
Reform #4: Change FDA approval to certification.
 <P>  Physicians should be allowed to prescribe unapproved drugs as
long as the drugs clearly indicate that they are not approved. In this
way, the costs of the excessive delay in drug approval could be
reduced and the drugs made available to Americans who face severe
health problems without them. The FDA could serve a useful function by
testing and certifying new drugs, but those physicians (and their
patients) who prefer to be able to use newer drugs could satisfy that
preference. Short of this, drugs which have been approved in another
major country could be sold in the U.S. with the caveat they are not
yet FDA approved.

<P>

CONCLUSION
<P>Some federal policy makers in the Congress want to invest the
FDA with greater authority. They want the FDA to have more power to
seize and recall products, to subpoena company records, including
trade secrets, and to levy huge fines on companies. In many cases,
these policy makers want the FDA to have these powers without judicial
review or oversight.

<P>But the FDA already has immense power, sufficient to accomplish
almost all of its goals. If the FDA can convince a judge that its
proposed action is meritorious and deals with a genuine safety
concern, it can force companies to comply. It can back up its demands
with powerful criminal sanctions, even for violations committed
unknowingly, and it can cost a firm its reputation by indicating in
public that it has compromised safety. 

<P>Supporters of legislation to expand FDA's enforcement authority
have made no credible case that such increased authority will lead to
increased public health. Most of the arguments for the bill are
bureaucratic, not substantive; they refer to "consistency" in
regulatory powers across products, not to health outcomes. If
consistency is a goal, it can just as easily be achieved by weakening
the FDA's regulatory powers. Congress could examine instances where
FDA has abused its regulatory authority or acted with excessive zeal
at the expense of innocent companies. 

<P>The only demonstrated harm to safety associated with the FDA is
the harm it has caused by excessively delaying the approval of new
drugs. The Bush Administration's reforms of the FDA drug approval
process would enable the agency to more rapidly approve drugs. The
health of Americans would be improved if these Administration reforms
were effected, and if FDA resources were shifted away from enforcement
and used to speed up drug approval. H.R. 3642, by giving additional
enforcement power to the FDA, would likely result in more resources
being devoted to enforcement, and would therefore exacerbate the
health problems caused by the FDA through preventing Americans from
purchasing useful and beneficial therapies.

<TITLE>MUZZLING OIRA: AN ATTEMPT TO THWART BUSH'S WAR ON REGULATIONS -- Heritage </TITLE>

<CENTER><H3><I>MUZZLING OIRA: AN ATTEMPT TO THWART BUSH'S WAR ON REGULATIONS</I></H3>
<P>
By William G. Laffer III<br>
Executive Memorandum #304<BR>
7/15/91<P>
</CENTER><HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>

     George Bush's commitment to reducing the federal regulatory
burdens on business is being put to the test. At issue is an important
but little-known division within the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB). It is the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA)
-- pronounced oh-EYE-rah -- and was created by the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980 to minimize federal paperwork requirements. Later it was
tasked to head off regulations promulgated by the Executive Branch
when alternatives are available that are less costly to the economy. 
<P>
     OIRA's ability to be a whistle-blower on regulatory excess is now
in jeopardy. Senator John Glenn, the Ohio Democrat, has introduced
legislation (S. 1044) that would weaken the ability of OMB and OIRA to
halt unjustified paperwork requirements. In addition, this legislation
would saddle OIRA with massive extra paperwork, reporting
responsibilities, red tape, and crippling restrictions. It also would
impose on OIRA public disclosure requirements that Congress does not
apply to itself or to the agencies OIRA oversees. The reason,
apparently, is to destroy OIRA's independence and make it more
responsive to the special interest concerns of individual Congressmen
and Senators. In the process the Glenn bill will impair OIRA's ability
to act and thus the President's ability as chief executive to control
the regulatory process in the agencies for which he is responsible.
Bush should resist these attempts to limit the office in the Executive
Branch that is doing the most to free American businesses of red tape.
If OIRA is bound and gagged, American goods and services will become
more costly, jobs will be destroyed and the economy weakened and made
less competitive.
<P>
     Crushing Burden. Federal government "information collection
requests," that is, paperwork and red tape, impose a crushing burden
on American enterprise. Estimates of the total annual cost to
businesses of filling out federal government forms run as high as $330
billion, with $100 billion falling on small businesses that have the
least resources for handling federal paperwork. OIRA's original job
was to control and limit such "information collection requests," and
in particular to eliminate those which are unnecessary or which
duplicate other requests. OIRA has reduced the time spent filling out
government paperwork by almost 600 million man-hours per year since
1981, generating total annual savings to the economy of at least $6
billion.
<P>
     Ronald Reagan, in a 1981 executive order, gave OIRA
responsibility for reviewing all regulations promulgated by Executive
Branch departments and agencies to minimize the costs of such
regulations, and head off regulations whose costs would exceed
potential benefits. Usually OIRA simply reviews regulations to insure
that they use the least costly means of achieving statutory goals.
Sometimes, however, when regulations serve no real function, OIRA
blocks them altogether. 
<P>
Example: OIRA prevented the Occupational Safety and Health
     Administration (OSHA) from requiring all hard hats worn at
     industrial sites to be disinfected, at a cost to businesses of
     some $60 million a year. OSHA has demanded this even though hard
     hats have never been known to transmit diseases.
<P>
Example: OIRA changed an OSHA regulation that would have applied the
     complex, step-by-step safety standards followed by workers
     repairing large industrial machinery to a mechanic opening the
     hood of a car or to an electrician unplugging a lamp.
<P>
Example: OIRA headed off a Department of Housing and Urban Development
     regulation that would have required all balconies in multi-
     housing units to be flush with the inside floor level. This would
     have caused the units to flood whenever it rained.
<P>
     Despite OIRA's fine record, Glenn and other members of Congress
want to restrict its power to review regulations promulgated by the
agency and department heads who are subordinate to the President.
These Congressmen would prefer that these agencies and departments,
whose staffs consist mostly of career bureaucrats who often are more
responsive to Congress than to the President, be able to promulgate
burdensome new regulations on their own, free of presidential
interference.
<P>
     Many other members of Congress, however, understand the need to
continue freeing American entrepreneurs from the burdens of
unnecessary government red tape and regulations. A bipartisan
coalition of Senators, including Democrats Sam Nunn of Georgia and
Dale Bumpers of Arkansas, and Republican Robert Kasten of Wisconsin,
has introduced the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1991 (S. 1139) to
strengthen OIRA. 
<P>
     This legislation would reauthorize OIRA for five years. It also
would close a loophole in OIRA's jurisdiction. Under current law, as
interpreted by the Supreme Court last year in Dole v. United
Steelworkers of America, OIRA has authority only to review "requests"
that call on individuals and business to provide information directly
to government agencies. Yet some one-third to one-half of the
paperwork burden on businesses is imposed by agency regulations that
"request" businesses to provide information to third parties, such as
employees or customers. These requests are not covered by the 1980
Paperwork Reduction Act. The Nunn bill would close this loophole,
making clear that the Paperwork Reduction Act applies to indirect as
well as direct paperwork requirements. The Glenn bill would leave the
loophole intact.
    <P>                      ****************

     Freeing American Businesses. As Vice President, George Bush led a
Task Force on Regulatory Relief and has often expressed his personal
commitment to lifting unnecessary regulatory burdens off the backs of
businesses. Now as President, Bush must protect the gains of the past,
and must also protect the legitimate constitutional powers of his
office. To help free American businesses from unneeded paperwork and
costly regulations, and to preserve the President's ability to control
the agencies and departments he oversees, OIRA must be left free to
carry out its responsibilities.

INTRODUCTION
<P>
     After Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell in September
announced his decision to abandon health care reform legislation for
the 103rd Congress, attention shifted immediately to efforts at the
state level. Since then, few state reform efforts have received as
much attention as the referendum on the November ballot in California.
"Proposition 186, the California Health Security Act" would expand
insurance coverage to California residents by creating a single-payer
system much like the one currently in place in Canada. A state-run
health care system, with an elected Health Commissioner exercising
oversight and control over virtually the entire system, would be
financed by new payroll taxes on California employers and workers and
a new surtax on tobacco products.
 <P>    If passed, Proposition 186 would become the law. It would lead to
full state government regulation and control of health care delivery
to all California residents. It would create additional state
bureaucracies, essentially eliminate the health insurance sector in
California, and significantly alter the way in which health care is
provided to Californians. Much like the Canadian system of federal
oversight and control of how health care services are provided,
Proposition 186 would lead to rationing, a black market for health
services, and higher labor costs that would encourage businesses to
move to more "business friendly" nearby states such as Arizona,
Colorado, and Oregon. 
  <P>   Many working lower- and middle-income families will experience
significant tax increases under Proposition 186. While the various
versions of the Clinton plan in Congress sought to disguise the taxes
businesses would pay, Proposition 186 makes a clear statement: Every
Californian and every employer in the state will pay increased taxes.
To help contain costs, the bill calls for strict price controls, a
prescription drug formulary list which will deny millions of
Californians medications available in other states, a global budget or
ceiling for health expenditures, and -- if necessary -- even rationing
of medical services. 
 <P>    For many Californians the term "single-payer" has a certain
appeal, suggesting that the state government will eliminate the need
for much paperwork and be able to get the best value per dollar from
the health care industry. But this is very simplistic. Californians
should remember, for instance, that health care will be run by the
same state government charged with administering other much-criticized
services, such as education and the welfare system. 
  <P>   The most significant provisions in Proposition 186 would:
Create a new position of "Health Commissioner," with general oversight
of the new state-run and state-administered program.
<P>
Establish a "one-size-fits-all" state-established and state-approved
standardized benefits package which would determine the services all
Californians receive.
<P>
Create new commissions, sub-agencies, and programs to assist the
Health Commissioner.
<P>
Impose new taxes on every resident and business in California.
<P>
     While proponents of Proposition 186 paint a very simplistic and
superficial picture of a single-payer system in which the "government
will take care of everything," close scrutiny reveals the
complications and problems inherent in such a scheme. Approximately 32
million residents, legal and undocumented, live within California's
borders. It has been reported that an estimated 6 million do not have
any form of health insurance and are not eligible to receive Medicare
or Medicaid benefits. (Carol Brydolf, "Proposition 186, Health
Services, Taxes," California Journal, Vol. 25, No. 9 (September 1994),
p. 8.) Assuming this figure to be accurate, several questions arise.
<P>
Does dealing with the problems of the 6 million Californians currently
without coverage really require forcing the other 26 million -- who
are insured and satisfied with their coverage -- into a state-run
single-payer system?
<P>
Does every Californian want or need the prescribed government-approved
standard benefits package? A single-payer system means choice of
benefits is sharply reduced.
<P>
How much will California businesses have to pay in additional taxes?
Private businesses in California will be forced to pay an additional
$28.8 billion in new payroll taxes in 1998. Since most payroll taxes
"paid for" by employees show up on paychecks as reduced cash earnings,
a portion should be added to the extra income taxes paid directly by
workers. Heritage Foundation Senior Fellow David Winston calculates
this "pass through" means private sector workers will lose $25.4
billion in reduced earnings in 1998 on top of the $9.7 billion
collected in direct personal taxes. And that assumes the new taxes are
sufficient to pay for the new benefits. Analysis by Winston shows that
even if there is a shortfall equal to the lower amount cited in recent
estimates ($32.5 billion), Californians could have to pay on average
an additional $2,213 in state income taxes on top of the $813
envisioned in Proposition 186. This would triple the state tax rate
paid by the average Californian.
<P>
Given the current economic status of California, can residents and
businesses afford to finance such a system? With escalating payroll
costs, many businesses would lay off workers and slow future job
growth or leave the state.
<P>
What will happen to federal programs such as the Veterans
Administration, Indian Health, and Medicaid? Proponents want to use
the funds now going to these programs to fund the new system. But it
seems most unlikely that Congress will approve all the sweeping
changes even though, without this money, the system would be severely
underfunded.
<P>
     Before Californians vote on Proposition 186, they must know the
answers to these questions. Millions of Californians are frustrated
with the current health insurance system, but they need to consider
very carefully the full implications of moving to a government-run
system.
<P>
THE UNIFORM STATE STANDARD BENEFITS PACKAGE
   <P>  Much like the ill-fated Clinton plan, Proposition 186 includes a
major provision dictating the type of benefits all Californians will
have unless they are prepared to pay for additional or different
services out of their own pockets. Chapter 4 of Proposition 186
details not only the benefits Californians would be eligible to
receive, but the scope of coverage as well. ("California Health
Security Act, Proposition 186," Chapter 4, Benefits, pp. 10-17.) 
   <P>  Proposition 186 empowers the California State Health Commissioner
to "Adopt annually a benefits package for consumers which meets or
exceeds the minimums required by law." ("California Health Security
Act, Proposition 186," Chapter 5, Governance and Administration, p.
18.) The benefits every Californian must have are as follows:
Inpatient and outpatient health facility or clinic services other than
long-term care services as defined in Section 25025(a);
<P>
Inpatient and outpatient professional provider services, including eye
care and home health care;
<P>
Diagnostic imaging, laboratory services, and other diagnostic and
evaluative services;
<P>
Prenatal, perinatal, and maternity care;
<P>
Durable medical equipment and appliances, including prosthetics,
eyeglasses, and hearing aids, as determined by the Commissioner;
<P>
Podiatry services;
<P>
Chiropractic services;
<P>
Kidney dialysis;
<P>
Emergency transportation and necessary transportation for health care
services for the disabled, as determined by the Commissioner;
<P>
Rehabilitative care;
<P>
Language interpretation for health care services, including sign
language, for those unable to speak, hear, or understand English and
for the hearing impaired;
<P>
Blood;
<P>
Outreach, education, and screening services, including but not limited
to:
<P>
(a) Children's preventive care, well-child care, immunizations,
screening, outreach, and education;
<P>
(b) Adult preventive care, including mammograms, Pap smears and other
screening, outreach, and educational services.
<P>
Prescription drugs subject to approval by the Health Commissioner and
placed on the formulary list;
<P>
Long-term care services for the physical health, mental health,
social, and personal needs of individuals with limited self-care
capabilities, including:
<P>
(1) Institutional and residential care, including Alzheimer's Disease
units;
<P>
(2) Home health care;
<P>
(3) Hospice care;
<P>
(4) Home and community-based services, including personal assistance
and attendant care;
<P>
(5) Appropriate access to specialty consultation within long-term care
settings;
<P>
(6) Reassessment of an individual's need for long-term services,
conducted at appropriate intervals, but not less than once a year.
Mental health care benefits when determined to be medically
appropriate by the Health Commissioner:
<P>
(1)Crisis intervention, including assessment, diagnosis, brief
emergency treatment, and referral;
<P>
(2)Outpatient services, including but not limited to adult day care,
detoxification services, home health care, psycho-social
rehabilitation, and professionally sponsored and professionally
supervised self-help and peer-support programs approved by the
Commissioner;
<P>
(3)Intermediate-level care, including but not limited to intensive day
and evening programs and institutional and residential services.
<P>
(4)Inpatient health facility services as approved by the Commissioner
based on the recommendations of the Advisory Board;
<P>
(5)Professional provider services at outpatient, intermediate, and
inpatient levels of care, including but not limited to individual,
family, and group psychotherapy, medical management, psychological
testing and mental health case management, and coordination of care;
<P>
(6)Diagnostic imaging, laboratory services, and other diagnostic and
evaluative services; 
<P>
(7)Prescription drugs.
<P>
Dental benefits;
<P>
Emergency benefits.
<P>
     Even such a comprehensive package, of course, does not take into
account the different needs and desires of individuals and families.
Furthermore, all Californians need to understand that if they suffer
from a particular ailment that is not covered in the standard benefits
package, or for which coverage is available only after joining a
waiting list, they will be denied the necessary medical treatment --
or denied it until they have waited in line -- unless they can come up
with the necessary funds to pay for it themselves. To be sure, the
proposition provides that "The Commissioner may expand benefits beyond
the minimum benefits described in this Chapter when expansion meets
the intent of this Division and there are sufficient funds to cover
the expansion." ("California Health Security Act, Proposition 186,"
Chapter 4, Benefits, p. 16.) But, as will be explained later, there is
little likelihood that sufficient funds will be available to cover
additional benefits for 32 million people.
     As the debate over a standardized plan in Congress made clear,
moreover, Californians can expect special-interest health care
provider lobbying of the Health Commissioner and the advisory boards
and councils. The aim will be to include particular benefits or
services in the fine print of the standard benefits package. If the
lobby is influential enough, the benefit will be added by the
Commissioner. However, the more benefits that are added to the
original package, the higher the price tag. This means higher taxes on
Californians and businesses -- or cutbacks to reduce the costs of
other services.
     <P>
NEW BUREAUCRATS AND BUREAUCRACIES
 <P>    Under Proposition 186, the Office of the California State Health
Commissioner is to be created as an agency of the State of California.
The first Health Commissioner is to be appointed by the Governor and
confirmed by the California legislature. Thereafter, the Commissioner
will stand for election at the same time and in the same manner as the
Governor. Also created within the Office of the State Health
Commissioner is a Deputy Health Commissioner, appointed by the State
Health Commissioner, whose duties include assuming the
responsibilities of the State Health Commissioner should he or she
become unable to perform the duties of office.
 <P>    The powers and responsibilities of the State Health Commissioner
are very broad: "The Commissioner's powers include any and all powers
necessary and proper to implement this Act, and to promote its
underlying aims and purposes. These broad powers include, but are not
limited to, the power to set rates and promulgate generally binding
regulations on any and all matters relating to the implementation of
this Act and its purposes." ("California Health Security Act,
Proposition 186," Chapter 6, Governance and Administration, Article 2,
Sec. 25063, p. 18.) 
 <P>    In other words, one individual will run and administer a new
health care system for 32 million Californians. The Commissioner will
adopt a standardized benefits package for the entire state population
each year, ensure that all health care providers are paid in a timely
fashion, take bids for prescription drug contracts under a state-run
drug formulary, and negotiate or set rates, fees, and prices involving
any aspect of the Health Security System.
  <P>   These responsibilities are unprecedented in scope. To assist in
implementing them, the Commissioner is given power to establish,
appoint, and fund:
<P>
A Health Policy Advisory Board;
<P>
A Regional Administrator with appropriate staff for each System
Region; 
<P>
A Regional Consumer Advocate with appropriate staff for each System
Region.
<P>
The Health Policy Advisory Board
<P>     The Health Policy Advisory Board is to consist of health care and
public health professionals who are salaried and compensated in other
manners as determined by the Commissioner. Proposition 186 does not
specify the number of members who will serve on this newly created
board. While this issue may seem trivial now, such an advisory board
could expand to accommodate many of the special-interest groups which
can be expected to lobby the Commissioner for representation on the
board. Depending on who is appointed, there could be serious doubts
about the objectivity of board recommendations. 
  <P>   
     According to section 25070, the Advisory Board shall:
<P>
Make policy recommendations on medical issues, population-based public
health issues, research priorities, scope of services, and expanding
access to care and Health Security System evaluation;
<P>
Recommend expert task forces, including an expert formulary (drug)
committee, to be appointed by the Commissioner to study and make
recommendations on specialized areas of medical policy and
effectiveness.
<P>
     Californians have great reason to be cautious of this seemingly
innocent provision. The "expert formulary committee" in particular
will have an impact on every resident, especially the poor. A "drug
formulary" is a restricted list of approved prescription drugs that a
program will cover. In the context of Proposition 186, a formulary
committee most likely would monitor the prices of prescription drugs
and determine whether they are "reasonable." It would then make a list
of recommendations to the Health Commissioner stating which
prescription drugs met certain criteria and should be placed on the
formulary list. While the bill does not detail or mention the
criteria, current state policy includes factors such as economies of
scale and presumed therapeutic benefit. If the formulary committee
thinks a price for a drug is "unreasonable," the Commissioner likely
would exclude that particular medication from the formulary list.
Thus, Californians could face a situation in which the drug
recommended by their physician is not available under the system.
  <P>   While a formulary list will affect every Californian's ability to
gain access to the latest drug breakthroughs and medicines, it will
have an especially adverse effect on elderly, poor, and minority
patients. Middle-income and wealthy patients will still be able to
purchase medically necessary drugs out of their own pocket, even if
these drugs have not been approved by the Health Commissioner.
However, current Medicaid recipients and the working poor not eligible
for Medicaid effectively will be denied access to these treatments.
Testifying before Congress against formularies, Hispanic leader
Suleika Cabrera-Drinane pointed out the implications of this for
minorities: "If this plan becomes law, Latinos would once again be
relegated to the status of second class citizens. We would again be
denied equality of treatment under the law. Formularies mean that
people will get sick and die because they couldn't get the medicines
their doctors said they needed." (Suleika Cabrera-Drinane, Founding
Executive Director of the Institute for Puerto Rican/Hispanic Elderly,
testimony before Congress, cited by Pharmaceutical Manufacturers
Association, The Case for the Pharmaceutical Industry, 1993-1994, p.
10.2.) The Hispanic-American community makes up approximately 26
percent of the state's population. It is very likely that this
particular minority will bear a disproportionate share of the adverse
consequences of drug formularies.
  <P>   Given the troublesome history of Medicaid formularies throughout
the states, it is ironic that the largest state in the union might
adopt such a problematic scheme for its entire population.
     
<P>
Regional Administrators
  <P>   Proposition 186 creates what appears to be a mid-level
bureaucratic position of "Regional Administrator" to oversee newly
designed "System Regions." Each Regional Administrator is charged with
such duties as the following:
<P>
Negotiating service contracts;
<P>
Preparing budgets;
<P>
Approving and funding of capital expense projects of health facilities
and clinics in the region;
<P>
Following guidelines and formulas determined by the Commissioner.
<P>
     Essentially, each Regional Administrator will have the power to
negotiate prices for physician, hospital, medical equipment, and
prescription drug reimbursement. He or she will then forward these
prices and further recommendations to the State Health Commissioner,
who must coordinate these figures with the projected expenditures from
other Regional Administrators.
 <P>   In addition to a Regional Administrator, each System Region is
staffed by a Consumer Advocate appointed by the State Health
Commissioner. The Consumer Advocates are charged with, but not limited
to, examining the following:
<P>
Complaints and suggestions from the public;
Proposals to be considered by the Commissioner in the future;
<P>

The Commissioner's plans for changes in resource allocation;
<P>
The extent to which individual health facilities and clinics in a
System Region meet the needs of    the community in which they are
located;
<P>
Any other factor bearing on the effectiveness of the Health Security
System.
<P>
     Proposition 186 is not explicit as to how or by whom the System
Regions are to be designed. It is reasonable to assume the state
legislature will have a role in this process. Should that be the case,
it will be a political nightmare. The reason: each state legislator
will want to craft the System Regions so that each is in a strong
economic position to shoulder the new taxes and administrative
burdens. But more affluent regions will want to avoid inclusion in
regions that are disproportionately poor. Gerrymandering disputes
could tie up the state court system for years.
<P>
THE COST TO CALIFORNIANS AND EMPLOYERS, AND ITS EFFECT ON EMPLOYMENT
  <P>   Proponents of Proposition 186 constantly tout the "savings" they
will achieve by eliminating "excessive administrative costs" in the
private insurance market. Not only is it highly questionable whether
government control would bring sharp improvements in efficiency, but
seemingly overlooked is the indirect regulatory cost of the new
bureaucracies, commissions, and agencies that would be created. Even
without these indirect costs, however, the system would be extremely
expensive -- and there is good reason to assume that the sponsors'
optimistic budget forecasts mask a huge problem of underfunding.
  <P>  Proposition 186 relies mainly upon three new taxes to help
finance the new health system: a business payroll tax, a personal
income tax surcharge, and an increased cigarette tax. 
 Payroll Tax. The payroll tax is to be levied upon every employer
within the state. Self-employed individuals are exempt from the
payroll tax but not from the income tax. Proponents of Proposition 186
claim that every employer will be required to pay the payroll tax.
They therefore assume that the current exemption for self-insured
employers will no longer apply to the state of California -- but
according to top congressional staffers, this is not necessarily a
valid assumption. The payroll tax is structured as follows: 
 If Proposition 186 were to pass, estimates the Palo Alto, California,
econometrics firm of Spectrum Economics, Inc., approximately 300,000
jobs would be lost by 1998. (Spectrum Economics, "Economic Impacts:
1994 California Health Initiative," June 28, 1994, p. 5.) Short-term
job loss in the insurance sector alone is estimated to be 40,000.
Spectrum also forecasts that the wage tax will be passed on in the
form of lower wages in future years. As noted by the Congressional
Budget Office, "An often overlooked point is that the employer share
of the cost of 'employer provided' health insurance is ultimately
passed on to workers in the form of lower wages and reductions in
fringe benefits other than health insurance...." (Congressional Budget
Office, "The Tax Treatment of Employment Based Health Insurance,"
March 1994, Introduction.)
   <P>  A new payroll tax on employers to help pay for the new health
care system will add significantly to the labor costs of firms
currently not offering health insurance. For firms currently providing
health benefits that are not as expensive as the tax cost of the
package mandated in the bill, labor costs also will increase. In
addition to wage reductions that will tend to follow as firms struggle
to offset these costs, some costs also will be passed on in higher
prices for consumers, which in turn leads to fewer purchases of non-
medical goods and services, ultimately resulting in lower employment
in those industries. (Spectrum Economics, "Economic Impacts: 1994
California Health Initiative," p. 5.) Depending on the size and
financial condition of the firms, the job loss will be felt either
immediately or gradually over several years. 
  <P>   It is estimated by Dwayne Banks of the University of California
that the new wage tax would generate $42.1 billion of new revenue in
1998. (Dwayne A. Banks, "The California Single-Payer Initiative:
Revenue and Expenditure Projections, 1996-2000," Graduate School of
Public Policy, University of California, July 1994, p. 27.) However,
economics and common business practice suggest that this may be
difficult to achieve. First, many employers would reduce their tax
liability by downsizing their firms or restructure their organizations
by shutting down in-house departments and then creating subsidiaries.
Second, employers who find it economically feasible to self-insure
instead of paying the wage tax will do so, thereby avoiding the new
tax entirely. As mentioned earlier, proponents also are banking on
Congress to waive the ERISA law as it applies to self-insured
employers in California, thereby subjecting these firms to the
proposed payroll tax. If they fail to achieve a sweeping waiver, as
seems likely, revenues will be reduced.
Income Tax. Proposition 186 places an additional 2.5 percent income
tax surcharge on Californians of all income ranges. Residents who earn
more than $250,000 per annum are responsible for an additional 2.5
percent surtax on top of the original 2.5 percent increase. The state
of California already has one of the highest personal income tax rates
in the country.
<P>
 Spectrum Economics estimates that this new income tax will generate
$12.5 billion of new revenue in 1998. However, this new tax structure
and benefits system will have certain direct and indirect costs. For
one thing, some Californians will decide to relocate in other states
to reduce their taxes. For another, the new tax policy and benefit
system will attract three population groups to the state who are
likely to take advantage of a single-payer system: uninsured people
needing high-cost health care, early retirees without health
insurance, and those in need of long-term care and nursing homes.
(Spectrum Economics, "Economic Impacts: 1994 California Health
Initiative," p. 7.)
<P>
     Heritage Foundation Senior Fellow David Winston has conducted an
analysis of Proposition 186 to estimate the tax implications for
Californians working in the private sector. Using a slightly different
methodology from that used by Spectrum, he estimates that the new
income tax will raise $9.7 billion in 1998 directly from Californians
in higher personal income tax payments. But there are other effects.
Businesses will face new payroll taxes amounting to a projected $28.8
billion in 1998. The economic literature indicates that when a payroll
tax is imposed on an employer, an average of 88 percent of the cost is
"passed through" to employees in the form of lower wages (usually
reduced raises). The rest of the payroll tax takes the form of higher
prices or reduced profits. (John C. Liu, "What the CBO Says About the
Tax Treatment of Employment-Based Health Insurance," Heritage
Foundation F.Y.I., No. 16, May 25, 1994, p. 4.) 
<P>     The Heritage study suggests that the combined cost (taxes plus
wage effects) to Californians employed in the private sector will be
$34.8 billion in 1998, or an average of $2,823 per employee. To be
sure, this cost is for certain benefits available under the program,
and many businesses will be paying the new payroll tax instead of
providing benefits. Thus, the net impact on each employee will depend
on the current cost (and its wage effect) of the worker's employer-
provided benefits -- if any.
  <P>   Two important caveats apply to this comparison, however. The
first is that the Heritage calculation takes at face value the claim
of proponents that the new taxes in Proposition 186 are sufficient to
cover the promised benefits. This is very doubtful, for reasons
explained elsewhere. If there were a shortfall, and yet benefit levels
were retained, it would be necessary to raise additional revenue,
probably through increased tax rates. The possible level of these new
revenues is cited later in this analysis, based on the anticipated
shortfall.
  <P>   The second, related to this, is that it is difficult to predict
how people, including residents of other states, will react to passage
of the California proposition. One reaction may be the movement of
some taxpayers and businesses out of the state. Another unanticipated
effect could be the movement of other people into the state to take
advantage of the new program, pushing up costs without producing much
new revenue. Consider, for instance, the proposed long-term care
benefits. Since the legislative language only requires individuals to
reside in California and pay income taxes for a minimum of two years
in order to be eligible for long-term care benefits, younger and
healthier long-term residents will end up subsidizing the costs of
early retirees moving to California. Despite the requirement to pay
income taxes in order to be eligible for long-term care and nursing
home services, the revenue collected by the state is not likely to
cover the prohibitively expensive costs associated with providing such
care. According to the latest U.S. Census data, California already has
3.1 million residents over the age of 65, or approximately 11 percent
of the state's population. (Congressional Quarterly's Politics in
America, 1994, 103rd Congress, (Washington, D.C., Congressional
Quarterly, 1993), p. 97.) With such low eligibility requirements for
long-term care and nursing home services, it will be very attractive
for early retirees not now receiving such generous health benefits to
migrate to California.
<P>
The Numbers in Proposition 186 Don't Add Up
  <P>   Even under the most optimistic scenario, in which all new taxes
and savings yield the amounts assumed under Proposition 186,
expenditures are likely to exceed revenue by a significant margin. A
study performed by Dwayne A. Banks of the Berkeley Institute for
Research on Policy Solutions (BIRPS) concludes that Proposition 186
would run deficits at least between 1996 and 2000. (Banks, "The
California Single-Payer Initiative: Revenue and Expenditure
Projections," p. 27.) The assumptions in this study are based upon
those used by the Congressional Budget Office, the same agency which
forecasts the costs of federal programs as envisioned by the U.S.
Congress. CBO assumptions regarding likely consumer and provider
reaction to a new single-payer-type system were reflected in the BIRPS
study. (Congressional Budget Office, "Behavioral Assumptions for
Estimating the Effects of Health Care Proposals," November 1993,
Appendix F.)
  <P>   According to the BIRPS study, the demand for existing health care
services will increase for two reasons. First, out-of-pocket
expenditures are virtually zero under the single-payer system, which
means that consumers who are currently insured will increase their
demand for certain services (such as chiropractic, substance abuse,
and dental services) for which they generally now must pay themselves.
Second, those who are currently uninsured will have access to services
to which they traditionally have not had access, and this will lead to
an even greater increase in the overall demand for services. (Banks,
"The California Single-Payer Initiative," p. 38; citing CBO,
"Behavioral Assumptions for Estimating the Effects of Health Care
Proposals." )
   <P>  Even under optimistic assumptions, the BIRPS study estimates that
Proposition 186 will cost $135.1 billion in 1998. This is the
projected cost of providing the guaranteed benefits to every eligible
California resident, legal and illegal. Revenue estimates which
include the three major taxes (personal, payroll, cigarette), the
federal money gained by the state from taking over Medicare, Medicaid,
Worker's Compensation, alcohol and drug abuse services, mental health
services, public health services, and indigent care services, together
with the projected administrative savings, equals $101.1 billion in
1998. With respect to the ERISA exemption issue, Spectrum estimates
that the cost of care for ERISA-exempt workers would roughly equal the
payroll tax, thus having little effect on Proposition 186's expected
deficit. (Spectrum Economics, "Proposition 186: Alternative Estimates
of Cost and Revenues," August 15, 1994, p. 2.) This presents the
California State Health Commissioner with a $34 billion deficit in
1998, (Ibid.; Banks, "The California Single-Payer Initiative," Table
1a, p. 27.) leaving the Commissioner with one, or a combination, of
the following possibilities to address the deficit: implement stricter
cost control mechanisms, request additional funds from the state
legislature (that is, higher taxes), or establish co-payments or
exclusions on certain services that had been fully covered.
<P>
Proposition 186 Relies Too Heavily on Assumptions Based on Fantasy
 <P>    Proponents of Proposition 186 apparently overestimate the
influence of California's congressional delegation in the House and
Senate. While California is fortunate to have two House Members as
chairmen of powerful committees, (Henry Waxman is a 10-term
Representative from Los Angeles who chairs the powerful House Energy
and Commerce Subcommittee on Health and Environment, which has
extensive jurisdiction over public health programs, Medicaid, and
prescription drug pricing formulas. Fortney (Pete) Stark is an 11-term
Representative from Hayward who chairs the influential House Ways and
Means Subcommittee on Health, which has jurisdiction over Medicare and
Social Security programs.) their positions on certain health programs
are not always supported by a majority of their colleagues. The reason
is very simple: Certain changes in the Medicaid and Medicare program
which will benefit health care providers and their constituents in
Beverly Hills and the San Francisco Bay Area may not be as attractive
to a Member of Congress who represents a poor inner-city neighborhood
or a rural area.
  <P>   Furthermore, California's congressional delegation is not known
for its ability to cross political party lines and work together on
projects portrayed as beneficial to the state. It is surprising that
proponents place complete faith and confidence in their
Representatives' ability to obtain the federal waivers that are needed
for Proposition 186 to function effectively.
 <P>    One mistake is to assume that Congress will continue to make
federal payments currently going towards the Medicare and Medicaid
programs in California with minimal oversight. The two primary
committees with jurisdiction over these programs are Ways and Means
and Energy and Commerce. These two committees have 82 members, of
which California provides only 8. A majority of members on each
committee already have stated publicly their opposition to a single-
payer system as envisioned in Proposition 186. Thus, it seems unlikely
that these committees will act to grant California the right to use
federal Medicare and Medicaid payments to help finance the new state
system.
  <P>   Proponents also assume that the federal government will continue
its payments to Sacramento toward all programs such as the Veterans
Administration, Indian Health Services, and armed forces while current
beneficiaries of these programs will be folded into the new state
program. Proposition 186 assumes that California will continue to
administer current medical and public health programs run by the
state. Proponents of Proposition 186 thus assume that California will
be allowed to combine projected expenditures for these programs with
anticipated federal revenues and that this will be the "new revenue"
sufficient for running a new health care system. 
   <P>  The problem is that these projected new revenues -- even if they
do all materialize -- appear to be well short of the amount needed to
finance the promised benefits. The BIRPS study, by Dwayne Banks,
estimates that the state of California could expect to receive $38.1
billion in combined revenue from existing state and federal programs,
leaving a shortfall in 1998 of $32.5 billion for covering workers in
the private sector. (Banks, "The California Single-Payer Initiative,"
p. 15. The $32.5 billion shortfall is a (reduced) estimate calculated
by Banks in October.)
  <P>   Heritage Foundation Senior Fellow David Winston has estimated the
possible tax impact of a shortfall of $32.5 billion in 1998, as well
as the $50.7 billion shortfall envisioned by Spectrum. Assuming no
benefits are cut from the program because of any shortfall, and
assuming California is successful in gaining the waivers it needs to
generate certain revenues from business (which is far from likely),
Winston calculated the new taxes necessary to cover a 1998 shortfall.
He calculated the impact under two specific scenarios:
<P>
SCENARIO 1: 
  <P>   The entire shortfall is recouped through higher payroll taxes on
employers. According to the Heritage analysis, and assuming a
shortfall of $32.5 billion, California businesses would be hit with a
payroll tax of about double the rate envisioned in Proposition 186, if
the program is to be fully funded.
<P>
SCENARIO 2: 
 <P>    The entire shortfall is recouped through higher individual income
taxes. The Heritage analysis indicates that if Californians have to
shoulder a $32.5 billion shortfall by an increase in their state tax
rates, the average Californian would not have to pay the $813
envisioned by Proposition 186 (a 2.5 percent additional tax rate), but
$3,026 (or a 9.3 percent additional tax rate). Thus average
Californians would see their state individual tax rates triple. And
this does not even include the "pass through" wage effect discussed
earlier.
<P>
GLOBAL BUDGETS, PRICE CONTROLS, AND RATIONING
   <P>  Chapter 7 of Proposition 186 is entitled "Appropriations,
Budgeting, and Expenditures." A more accurate title would be "Global
Budgets, Price Controls, and Rationing." Proposition 186 calls for
"Expenditure Limits" complemented by a "Global Budget." ("California
Health Security Act, Proposition 186," Chapter 7, Article 1, sec.
25150, and Article 2, sec. 25158.) According to section 25150, "It is
the intent of the people that expenditures under this Act not exceed
in any year expenditures for the prior year adjusted for changes in
the state's gross domestic product and population." Hence, the central
cost containment mechanism is not competition and consumer preference,
but a fixed system of caps on health care spending.
  <P>   Proponents of Proposition 186 envision a system in which most
health spending in the state of California would be fixed by a
government "global budget" and budgets enforced with spending caps.
Californians who wanted to purchase insurance for a medical service
not covered in the state-approved standardized benefit package, or of
a better quality, could do so with their own resources. Proposition
186 thus would change dramatically the way in which Californians
receive medical care. Since spending on health care at the System
Regions level will be fixed according to regional targets and
allotments based on the state budget, patients and physicians will
have to compete against each other for a fixed quantity of medical
services. 
   <P>  The result would be limits in the availability of services for
Californians now used to obtaining the services their physicians
recommend. (John C. Liu, "Clinton Heavy: The Kennedy Bill," Heritage
Foundation Issue Bulletin No. 197, July 21, 1994, p. 15.) In an effort
to stay within the expenditure limits imposed by the bill while trying
to maintain the level of services demanded, price controls would have
to be applied throughout the health care system. These controls would
have to be severe, since the growth of health care spending in
California would have to be reduced more rapidly than has been
possible so far in most industrialized nations -- including those with
government controls on health care spending (see Table 1). To place
such a tight limitation on expenditures would dramatically alter the
quality and availability of health care to which Californians have
become accustomed.<P>

<P>
     To keep within the expenditure limits, the State Health
Commissioner would have an incentive to reduce reimbursements to
physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, and medical equipment
manufacturers. If this fails, the Commissioner or the state
legislature would be forced to intervene and implement stricter price
controls. But price controls always result in unintended consequences.
They lead to such things as shortages in the latest medical technology
(medical equipment, pharmaceutical drugs, and biotechnology
breakthroughs) and a black market which benefits well-connected and
wealthy consumers at the expense of others. (Edmund F. Haislmaier,
"Why Global Budgets and Price Controls Will Not Curb Health Costs,"
Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 929, March 8, 1993, p. 3.)
Californians should consider the average waits Canadians have had to
endure under a single-payer system controlled by their government.

<P>

     The alternative to price controls in Proposition 186 doubtless
would be equally offensive to Californians: stripping benefits and
services from the package. Article 8, section 25226 allows the State
Health Commissioner to "Identify and eliminate wasteful and
unnecessary care that is of no benefit to patients receiving that
care." A more realistic interpretation perhaps should read: "If the
State Health Commissioner realizes that the package is too expensive
and that the price controls embodied in the new system won't hold down
costs as envisioned, benefits will be struck publicly from the state
benefits package."
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
     In light of the 103rd Congress's inability to pass a health care
reform proposal, it is understandable that Californians are frustrated
and feel the need to take the initiative on their own. However, reform
at the state level needs to be considered carefully.
  <P>   Proposition 186 places heavy new payroll taxes on every employer
in the state, which in turn would inevitably mean lower wages and job
losses in many industries. Like the Clinton plan, which was rejected
overwhelmingly by the American public, Proposition 186 would force 32
million Californians into a state government-designed standardized
benefits package. Global budgets and price controls inevitably would
reduce the quality and quantity of health care for millions of
Californians. And like that of the rejected Clinton plan, the
financing scheme in Proposition 186 appears to be completely
inadequate to fund its promised benefits.
  <P>   Proponents of Proposition 186 envision a sharply reduced pattern
in the growth of future health expenditures, combined with a dramatic
improvement in efficiency, if complete control of California's health
care system is handed over to the state government. Californians
should consider carefully the likelihood of this -- and the
implications if this rosy scenario does not materialize. Are they
prepared to accept the waiting periods experienced throughout the
provinces in the Canadian system? Are they prepared to accept the wage
reductions and job losses that would accompany increased payroll
taxes? Are they comfortable with the idea of a powerful state
commissioner determining the details of their coverage? It is these
fundamental questions that Californians must consider when they cast
their ballots on Proposition 186.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
	Facing a crowded legislative calendar, the Senate this week is rushing to complete work on landmark legislation that will reframe the process and analytical criteria that federal agencies must follow to issue regulations. For example, the bill includes a requirement that agencies should consider the costs and benefits of their regulatory actions. Remarkably, this common sense way of making a decision, used by people to make decisions in their personal lives, has been deemed too radical for the federal government to use regularly in making decisions about how to protect public health, safety, and the environment. 
<p>
	 Federal regulatory agencies are out of control, and Congress must impose discipline on the regulatory process. Today, agencies are interpreting regulatory statutes in ways that Congress never intended. If Congress understood in advance how much some of these regulations would cost to implement, many lawmakers would never have voted for them. Presidents also have tried but failed to rein in agencies. Every President since Richard Nixon has required this kind of cost-benefit analysis by executive order,1 but agencies have paid only lip service to the orders. Unlike the Reagan and Bush Administrations, the Clinton Administration has further weakened this effort because it actually uses Executive Order 12866 to appear to support sensible, rational rulemaking while doing little in reality to accomplish that objective. Indeed, the Clinton Administration seems to believe that federal regulatory agencies have done a fine job and should be left alone to continue to exercise discretion that thwarts the will of Congress and costs the American economy billions of dollars.
<p>
	Congress must give federal regulatory agencies a rulemaking road map that includes well defined, analytical standards that all rules must meet. Abuse of agency discretion is the heart of the problem that Congress is being asked to solve. Leaving the door wide open for agencies to continue business as usual is not acceptable.
<p>
	Unfortunately, the leading Senate bill, a compromise drawn up by Senators Robert Dole (R-KS) and J. Bennett Johnston (D-LA), is seriously -- and perhaps even fatally -- flawed. The goal of the bill should be to achieve real reform. But, as Senator Johnston recently explained, "this is a huge and vitally important bill where each word carries tremendous meaning.... "2 Senator Johnston understands this well because he has worked tirelessly on behalf of the Clinton Administration to introduce technical language to weaken the key provisions of Senator Dole's original bill,      S. 343, The Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act of 1995, through important word changes.
<p>
	The problem now is that these seemingly arcane choices of language so severely change the legislative effect of the bill that its intent will not be achieved. Indeed, such a law might actually give individual regulatory agencies greater statutory protection from citizen and even Executive Branch efforts to end ineffective or burdensome regulation. The bill contains some useful reforms. But thanks to the careful    inclusion of certain language by those who generally do not support regulatory relief, the bill as it now stands could turn out to be a setback for regulatory reform. 

<p>
<b> THE DOS AND DON'TS OF EFFECTIVE REGULATORY REFORM</b>
<p>
	The current process for making regulatory decisions does not work. It allows agencies routinely to promulgate expensive rules, where the cost to individuals and businesses far outweighs the benefits. The time is ripe for legislation to make sure that regulatory policies in the future are based on sound data and analysis of the costs, benefits, and risks of regulation and create regulatory decisionmaking processes that are more open and accountable to the American people.
<p>
	To achieve this objective, legislation would need to incorporate certain key elements. But it would also need to avoid certain other seeming "reforms" which would actually make the regulations more burdensome and bureaucratic. In order for legislation to achieve reform, it must include strong provisions that:
<p><ul>
<li>Require agencies to use sound data and analysis on the costs, benefits, and risks of regulation and then apply effective criteria to this information to make sound regulatory decisions; 

<li>Enhance public involvement by empowering citizens to petition agencies to review rules to see whether they meet these tests; and 

<li>Hold agencies accountable for their actions by subjecting their actions to judicial review.
</ul><p>
	Specifically, regulatory reform would be characterized by the following "Dos" and "Don'ts" (section references are to the bill as published in the June 21, 1995, Congressional Record).

<p>
<b>1) DECISIONAL CRITERIA</b> (Section 624)
<p>
	DO require that benefits "outweigh" or "exceed" the costs. This key element of reform would force agencies to place the appropriate emphasis on developing unbiased or expected value estimates of both the costs and benefits. Neither costs nor benefits can be known with certainty, particularly in a regulatory context where agencies are, in effect, forecasting or predicting future events involving risk. However, agencies should have to place a value on these costs and benefits that can then be reviewed.
<p>
	DON'T allow agencies simply to contend that benefits "justify" the costs. The use of the word "justify" by agencies today to finesse the process of weighing the costs and benefits is largely subjective. Agencies simply declare that according to their own value criteria the benefits are greater than the costs. But the whole purpose of establishing a cost-benefit standard should be to create a more <i>objectively</i> based, fairly balanced evaluation of all the competing interests involved. Legislation must do this.
<p>
	DO require that agencies choose the regulatory alternative that will "maximize net benefits."  This is perhaps the most critical element of the regulatory reform discussion. A "net benefit" standard is far superior to a "least cost" standard. Even the Clinton Administration, in Executive Order 12866, includes among its principles that an agency "maximizes net benefits... unless a statute requires another regulatory approach."3  Only if the statute does not allow a rule to satisfy the "net benefit" standard should the agency be permitted to select the "least cost" alternative.
<p>
	When an agency is allowed or required to choose the least cost alternative, it may do so without ever stopping to consider whether the regulatory action is worth taking or maximizes benefits. 
<p>

	The table above (not available) illustrates what could be an undesirable regulatory outcome from applying the "least cost" standard. Alternative One is the lowest cost option, but actually costs more per life saved than Alternative Two. However, the agency must choose Alternative One over Alternative Two at a cost of an additional 80 lives per year. In this case, the agency should be allowed to select Alternative Two, the more expensive rule which has the greater "net benefits."  The "least cost" standard precludes this. In addition, if an agency has no idea of what the benefits are or is disinclined to calculate them, it can still promulgate a rule because the least cost standard merely requires it to pick the cheapest rule. There is no need to ask whether there are any benefits from taking the action at all. But a maximizing net benefits approach forces the agency to examine the cost-benefit rationale for its proposed rule.
<p>
	DON'T allow agencies to get away with issuing rules based on mere assertions of benefits. Agencies often cite tremendous uncertainty about the benefits of the regulations they propose. Unfortunately, a least cost standard allows agencies to get away with this. Consequently, agencies just assert that there are difficult-to-qualify benefits and they "justify" the costs of an action. Agencies must be required to use the best data available in performing an analysis of a rule's benefits and costs. 
<p>
 	DON'T let the agency loopholes be bigger than the loop. Lawmakers should not be fooled into believing there are cost-benefit decisional criteria in a statute if the legislation also gives agencies ample exemptions from using them. Agencies already argue that there are uncertainties or benefits that are nonquantifiable. A least cost approach gives them the incentive to continue doing so. Thus, regulators generally are comfortable with a least cost approach because it allows them to escape any requirement rather than attempt to determine seriously what the benefits of their action would be and compare them with the cost.
<p>


<b>WHAT DOLE/JOHNSTON WOULD DO</b>
<p>
	Section 624 of the bill unfortunately establishes extremely weak criteria that agencies must use in making regulatory decisions. The provisions are so full of exceptions that an agency could justify almost anything it wanted to. The bill requires an agency merely to show that a rule's benefits "justify" costs. In addition, the rule the agency adopts must be the "least cost" alternative of the reasonable alternatives considered, and even what alternatives are considered appears subject to agency discretion.
<p>
	Even these two troublesome criteria are further weakened because the bill allows agencies to adopt more costly rules when there are "scientific, technical, or economic uncertainties or nonquantifiable benefits to health, safety or the environment...."  This plays completely into the hands of regulators, since agencies and the Clinton Administration routinely claim that benefits are often nonquantifiable. So this provision would allow agencies essentially to be able to justify whatever alternative they want, even if it is very costly and even if there are no benefits.
<p>
	If a statute precludes an agency (or the agency interprets the statute to preclude it) from weighing costs and benefits, then in reality it need only meet the other criteria established. The fact that an agency must "clearly articulate" its evaluation of the relationship of costs to benefits will have little value if a particular law or the agency's interpretation of that law does not require such a relationship even to be established.
<p>
<b>2) COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS</b> (Section 621)
<p>
	DO require agencies to look at "incremental" costs and "incremental" benefits. "Incremental" is another key term in regulation. There may be diminishing returns in taking a regulatory action. Analyzing the "incremental" effect would require agencies to apply cost-benefit analysis to assess the utility of each further increment of control or action. For example, EPA should not be able to develop a new clean air rule and simply state that the rule achieves the desired benefit. There are lots of things that help make the air cleaner. What EPA should be forced to show is that the additional improvements in clean air are directly attributable to the rule with the additional cost. That makes it more difficult for an agency to choose actions that have very high incremental costs but little added benefit.
<p>
	DO require agencies to analyze clearly for the public record what they consider to be the nonquantifiable costs and benefits. The American people have a right to know what value judgments federal bureaucrats have made on their behalf. In particular, agencies must be able to show some reasoning behind their selection of nonquantifiable costs and benefits.
<p>
	DON'T let agencies off the hook from explaining to the public the relationship between benefits and costs, both quantifiable and nonquantifiable. This is particularly important if, as the Clinton Administration has argued, cost-benefit analysis is a necessary mix of scientific and value judgments. In the period for reviewing and commenting on proposed regulations, the American people have a right to know what the relationships are between the quantifiable and <i>non-quantifiable</i> costs and benefits and the importance the agency has given to each of them.
<p>
	DO require agencies to include the analysis of a range of alternatives that can educate Congress and the public about regulation and its consequences. Such a provision in reform legislation becomes even more important if the law unwisely requires a least cost standard, because the consequences of the rule must be fully understood. Agencies should be required to include a discussion of the costs and benefits of a range of regulatory alternatives, even if the underlying statute may preclude the adoption of one or more of the alternatives. Some of the overzealous and expensive regulatory actions taken by agencies are done because Congress has prescribed it in law -- with lawmakers often unaware of the alternatives at the time. Unless Congress takes the position that it always has the best information available when it makes these kinds of decisions, agencies should be required to provide information to Congress and the public about regulatory alternatives that may be preferable to what is prescribed in law. That would allow Congress the option of modifying the law.
<p>
	DO require agencies to assess the cumulative burden of a rule and the burden on small business. Agencies must be required to assess the cumulative burden of their regulatory actions and the burden on small businesses. The Clinton Administration wisely considered these important enough to include this item in the regulatory principles of E.O. 12866.4 Unfortunately, agencies routinely ignore the Regulatory Flexibility Act, which requires agencies to assess specifically the impact of their regulations on small business. As the Clinton Administration puts it, regulatory agencies "still tend to draft one-size-fits-all" regulations.5 Small businesses are extremely vulnerable to heavy regulatory compliance costs. Congress thus must require agencies to be flexible in crafting rules to minimize the burden on smaller firms.
<p>


<b>WHAT DOLE/JOHNSTON WOULD DO </b>
<p>
	Unfortunately, rather than require agencies to focus on the incremental costs or benefits, the definitions in the bill appear to allow an agency to attribute almost any benefits to a rule that may not, in reality, be the result of that rule but of some other "agency action."  True, an agency is allowed to do the same for "cost," but regulators have no incentive to do so. What this means is that agencies have wide freedom to find unrelated benefits to justify the costs of a rule.
<p>
	Section 622 of this bill does require agencies to include cost-benefit analysis as part the proposed and final rulemaking processes. It restricts an agency's discussion of reasonable alternatives solely to those the agency has the authority to consider. In addition, the bill appears to limit further the benefits of examining reasonable alternatives by allowing an agency to choose which alternatives it will consider rather than all of them (as specified in the bill). There appears to be no requirement that an agency must include in its cost-benefit analysis either an assessment of the cumulative impact or the impact on small business.
<p>
	Agencies are allowed, under the bill, to issue a major rule for effect without the cost-benefit analysis if the agency "for good cause finds that conducting the cost-benefit analysis is impracticable due to an emergency or health or safety threat that is likely to result in significant harm to the public or natural resources."  This is an extremely broad exemption, which may even be broader than what is currently permissible under the Administrative Procedures Act. How broadly can agencies interpret "health or safety threat"?  Can a regulatory action designed to save one hypothetical life be justified here?  This exemption should be exercised only rarely, or it would become a huge loophole. This weak provision can be strengthened by requiring the agency head to make the "good cause" determination only in emergencies and to justify it directly to Congress.
<p>
<b>3) RISK ASSESSMENT</b>
<p>
	DO require agencies to generate and disclose central tendency estimates of risk. Some agencies focus entirely on "worst-case," "upper-bound," or "high-end" estimates of risk. These estimates are not necessarily wrong or always inappropriate for decisionmaking. However, they are always wrong, inappropriate, and misleading when they are provided as estimates of "the" risk. Further, such estimates cannot be properly used in cost-benefit analysis -- except where an agency seeks to show that, under even the most favorable circumstances, the benefits of a proposed regulation do not justify the costs. Where they are proposing to regulate, agencies should be prohibited from providing estimates only of the "worst-case," the "upper-bound," or the "high-end."
<p>
	DO encourage agencies to generate as much of the full risk distribution as possible. Risks are never uniform across the population, and all risk estimates suffer from considerable uncertainty. Most risk experts agree that it is better to ascertain the entire risk distribution rather than to rely on single-valued point estimates. While it is not possible to do this perfectly, every effort ought to be devoted to doing it as well as possible. Legislation should provide incentives that encourage both regulatory agencies and regulated entities to estimate more the risk distribution than just the central tendency.
<p>
	DO require agencies to disclose fully the assumptions, data, models, and inferences that underlie their risk assessments. The public cannot be expected to comment intelligently upon (or successfully challenge) agency risk assessments that are cryptic or inadequately documented. Risk experts agree that transparency is key to effective review and oversight. Only those who fear being held accountable oppose consistent, firm, and unyielding demands for full disclosure.
<p>
	DON'T allow agencies to get out of performing risk assessments for major rules by asserting vague claims of impending health, safety, or environmental catastrophe. Such claims are implausible on their face without a credible risk assessment, for how would an agency head know that a catastrophe lurks without scientific evidence?  It is important to permit agencies to respond to real emergencies without first performing a sound risk assessment because time is of the essence. However, once this response is in place, there is no legitimate reason for waiving normal analytic requirements. Emergency action promulgated without risk assessment (or cost-benefit analysis) should automatically sunset when agencies fail to fulfill their analytic and procedural requirements in a timely fashion.
<p>


<b>WHAT DOLE/JOHNSTON WOULD DO </b>
<p>
	The discussion draft incorporates many important principles for risk assessment and risk characterization, and risk assessments performed in accordance with its spirit will be better than current practice. Unfortunately, the draft falters in too many places where reasonable performance standards could easily be articulated and may provide loopholes that are too numerous and too large.
<p>
	Section 633(f)(1) directs agency heads to express risk estimates in terms of ranges or distributions, but fails to express a preference for the latter. Ranges are not nearly as useful as distributions, and in many instances they will be highly misleading.
<p>
	Section 632(c)(1)(A) allows agencies to evade the risk assessment requirements entirely by asserting vague "health or safety threat[s]... likely to result in significant harm."  Regulations imposing billions of dollars in cost and preventing a mere handful of hypothetical cancer cases have nevertheless been issued on the ground that such risks are "significant."  With this history, it is hard to be optimistic about agencies' willingness to foreswear this huge loophole.
<p>
<b>4) JUDICIAL REVIEW</b> (Sections 553, 706)
<p>
	DO include a strong judicial review provision that makes agencies accountable to the public. The only way agencies will perform the analyses required by a strong standard for cost-benefit and decisional criteria is if the courts can check them. The courts must be allowed to consider whether or not the agency followed the legal procedures for public notice and comment and the extent to which the analyses required by the regulatory reform legislation relate to the agencies' decisional responsibilities as specified in the law.
<p>
	A strong judicial review provision is needed to force agencies to comply more strictly with a reform statute. But such a provision means little if the cost-benefit standard and decisional criteria are weak, for an agency can happily comply with legislation with a weak standard. 
<p>
	 The Administration and Senate Democrats, who generally have supported the aggressive use of regulation, understandably do not want strong judicial review. But they also know that they can weaken the effect of judicial review by watering down the cost-benefit standard and the decisional criteria. In doing so, the courts will have a hard time finding fault with an agency's chosen action.
<p>


<b>WHAT DOLE/JOHNSTON WOULD DO </b>
<p>
	The standards for review in Section 625 allow courts to set aside an action which is "arbitrary and capricious or an abuse of discretion (or unsupported by substantial evidence where the standard is otherwise provided by law)."  The problem is that, given the weak nature of other provisions of the bill, there will be very few cases where the courts will be able to set aside an agency rule on these grounds. Indeed, the bill seems to enhance -- rather than control -- an agency's ability to exercise its discretion, and the public will have difficulty challenging it in court.
<p>
<b>5) ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES</b> (Section 553)
<p>
	DON'T let agencies off the hook easily for providing public notice and disclosure and following public procedures. Exemptions from such requirements should be the exception, not the norm. Today, agencies continue to stretch compliance with requirements of the Administrative Procedures Act. Agencies must recognize that the public has a right to this information and the fact that it is perhaps inconvenient or takes time to provide it is not an acceptable excuse from doing it. Demonstrating that the public notice and procedures are "contrary to the public interest" appears to be a sufficient standard.  If an agency feels that is compelled to circumvent public notice and comment and/or cost-benefit analysis, this choice must be made at the highest levels of the agency and only for true "good cause."  In addition, if an agency uses the exemption, it should be required to go back later and follow the appropriate public procedures. Even the Paperwork Reduction Act requires agencies that have sought emergency exemptions from OMB review to go back and submit a proper request for approval and make any changes required based on public comment and OMB review. Regulations should be held to at least the same, if not a higher, standard than paperwork.
<p>
	DON'T allow agencies to issue conflicting or duplicative rules. Agencies should be expected before issuing a final rule, to the extent permitted by law, to make sure it is not incompatible with or duplicative of any other rules already in force. Agencies are notoriously bad at coordinating their regulatory actions. OIRA has played a critical role in doing this for them. However, it is not without a tremendous amount of effort. Again, even the Clinton Administration in E.O. 12866 includes among its regulatory principles instructions to agencies "to avoid regulations that are inconsistent, incompatible or duplicative with other regulations or those of other federal agencies."6  At a minimum, an agency should explain in its proposed and final rules what steps it has taken to work with other agencies to resolve conflicting policies or duplicative efforts.
<p>


<b>WHAT DOLE/JOHNSTON WOULD DO</b>
<P>
	Section 553 addresses the administrative procedures agencies must use to promulgate rules. It outlines what agencies must include in their proposed and final rules, and the ways in which agencies may go about gathering information about a proposed action. These changes are important because agencies are required to disclose to the public important information, including information regarding any cost-benefit analysis, and alternative methods of compliance. However, there is a "good cause" exemption, and it does not appear to require an agency that has an exemption to go back later, follow public procedures, and make any necessary changes. 
<p>
	 Section 553 also gives interested persons the right to petition for the "issuance, amendment or repeal of a rule."  The petition process for major rules is further addressed in Section 623(j).
<p>
<b>6) PETITIONS</b> (Section 623)
<p>
	DO require a strong public petition process and keep it separate from the agency's "look-back" timetable. The public should be given the right to demand that an agency reexamine any aspect of a "major" rule after it has gone into effect, including the underlying cost-benefit analysis or risk assessment. Today, the public can comment on a rule only before it is promulgated. Affected individuals and industry should have the ability to petition agencies and/or the President to reexamine regulations, to the extent permitted by law. This should include petitions targeted at specific types of regulations, to repeal agency guidance enforced as regulation, to examine alternative methods of compliance or waive compliance with rules, or to reexamine the risk assessment or cost-benefit analyses performed. However finely the petition process is structured, it should include:  1) an advisory committee of experts in the agency's area of responsibilities to help review and advise the agency; 2) clear deadlines for when an agency must respond to petitions; and 3) a prohibition on the consideration of additional similar petitions for a reasonable period once a decision is made.
<p>
	Until an agency makes a decision regarding an existing rule in response to petitions submitted, the agency should not limit the number of petitions submitted. The petition process should be seen as operating for existing rules in a manner similar to the way in which the public comment process works for proposed future rules. An agency may receive hundreds or thousands of public comments on a regulation during the proposed rule stage. Today, an agency cannot limit the number of comments it receives on a proposed rule because there might be too many. That is the whole point of the public comment process; people have a right to participate in regulatory decisions that affect them. Similarly, an agency should not limit the number of petitions submitted for fear of getting too many. The fact that there might be 1,000 identical petitions filed should be a message to the agency that there is a serious problem that deserves its attention and soon. There is a frightening arrogance in taking the position that the government does not have to be responsive to the needs of the people because it will make too much work for government bureaucrats.
<p>
	The right to force a reexamination by petition should not depend on the agency's timetable for reviewing its own rules (the "look-back" process). Linking the petition and look-back process would give agencies ample opportunity to avoid or delay addressing petitions or reviewing rules in a timely manner. 


<p>
<b> WHAT DOLE/JOHNSTON WOULD DO</b>
<p>
	While Section 553 gives the public the right to petition for "the issuance, amendment or repeal of a rule," Section 623 appears to undermine seriously the effectiveness of this petition process. Under this Section, one of the reasons a petition to amend or repeal a major rule would be rejected is if the rule has already been included as part of the agency's final review of rules schedule.
<p>
		So if an agency has already decided that a major rule will not be reviewed for, say, another ten years, the petition will not be granted. The only recourse the affected party has is then to petition to change the priority the agency has assigned to the review of the rule. But that agency petition review process alone could take anywhere from 18 to 36 months without anything being done to change the schedule for reviewing the rule, let alone changing the rule itself. The same procedures would apply to petitions to review interpretive rules, general statement of policy, and guidance. These provisions thus appear to allow agency bureaucracy to thwart providing any kind of timely regulatory relief for the most expensive, burdensome rules.
<p>
<b>7) AGENCY REVIEW OF RULES</b> (Section 623)
<p>
	DO require agencies periodically to review existing regulations and do it frequently.  In E.O. 12866, the Clinton Administration included a "look-back" mechanism.7 To date, the success of this effort has been limited. Agencies should be required by statute to work in conjunction with OIRA to establish schedules for the review of major rules. Some proposals have suggested that agencies should wait ten or more years to review rules. This makes no sense. These federal regulatory agencies have tens of thousands of employees who handle these program rules every day:  they, as well as the public, know what rules do not work. The Vice President's "reinventing regulation" reports have begun to ask them. The American people should not have to wait more than ten years to change or eliminate rules that the federal government itself has already decided are unwise. Thus, while regulatory reform legislation should improve standards for future rulemakings, it also should provide a more timely mechanism for reassessing existing regulations. 

<p>
<b> WHAT DOLE/JOHNSTON WOULD DO</b>
<p>
	Section 623 gives federal agencies, rather than the affected public, the ability to determine when burdensome regulations will be reviewed and perhaps changed. This provision appears to allow agencies to take as long as 14 years to revise a regulation. Thus, under the bill, agencies possibly could be allowed to take until 2010 even to consider changing rules that the Clinton Administration already may have identified as ineffective or excessive through its "reinventing government" efforts. 
<p>
	 Specifically, agencies are required by the bill to solicit comment on a preliminary schedule of review of rules they have identified within one year (and every subsequent five years) after enactment of this law. Interpretive rules and guidance, which may have the force and effect of rules and can be used to get around rulemaking requirements, also can be added to the list. A final schedule must be published a year later, addressing public comment. This final schedule can be revised if the agency grants a petition requesting a change in the priority of a rule or to amend or repeal a major rule. The deadline for the review of any rule cannot be longer than ten years from the date of the initial publication of the final schedule. However, the agency head can extend the deadline for review of any rule by up to two additional years (i.e., total agency review time alone can be 12 years). Two years before the deadline for review, the agency must notify the public and solicit comments on the rule and address these comments in a published notice within a year before the deadline. The agency still has two years after the deadline for review to promulgate a revised rule if that is the action that the agency chooses to take. If no action is taken within the two years, the rule would expire. 
<p>
	 Opponents of "look-back" provisions argue that it would be a cumbersome, costly process for agencies. Unfortunately, Section 623 adds a provision that requires the President's budget for each agency to "identify as a separate sum" the amount requested to implement the section. If an agency does not want to carry out this provision of the law, it may fail to request money for implementation, which the President and Congress may support. This provision -- at the heart of regulatory relief -- is seriously weakened by allowing it to be undermined through the budget process.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
	For regulatory reform legislation to be effective, it must force regulatory agencies to behave differently. It must force them to base their regulatory decisions on costs, benefits, and actual risks faced by Americans and force them to use sound data to make these calculations and state clearly what non-measurable factors shaped the design of the regulation. Once a regulation is promulgated, reform legislation must give the public much greater power to force reviews of existing rules that do not meet these tests. And legislation must hold agencies accountable, under judicial review, for their regulatory actions.
<p>
	Senator Dole was doing regulatory reform the right way before the Senate Democrats and the Clinton Administration got in the way. While the intent of most sponsors of the current Senate draft is a bill that would achieve the objectives of real reform, the language of the bill itself is so flawed that it would not achieve these intentions. Indeed, in many areas the language actually would insulate agencies further from proper accountability. The Dole/Johnston bill as currently drafted could be a setback for regulatory reform.

<p>
A generation has passed since the Nixon administration established racial quotas in hiring, promotion, college admissions, and government contracting. Affirmative-action policies, both public and private, have opened many economic and educational opportunities for Afri-can Americans, and have played an important role in one of the most encouraging developments of recent decades: the emergence of a large and growing black middle class. But supporters of government-mandated racial preferences have always been uncomfortable about policies that judge Americans by the color of their skin, not the content of their characterthe opposite of Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream. Even if racial preferences have been justified on a temporary basis, they surely cannot be justified for more than a generation.<p>
Citizens and politicians are beginning to roll quotas back. Senators Bob Dole and Phil Gramm both have promised that, if elected president, they would repeal President Nixon's executive order requiring all government contractors to submit detailed "goals and timetables" for the hiring and promotion of minorities and women. Governor Pete Wilson has abolished some racial hiring quotas established by California law. Even President Clinton is reviewing the issue. <p>
Perhaps the most dramatic movement is the California Civil Rights Initiative, which will be on the ballot next year and enjoys overwhelming support in public-opinion polls. The brainchild of two scholars, Glynn Custred and Thomas Wood, the initiative is based on the color-blind language of the Civil Rights Act of 1964: "Neither the State of California nor any of its political subdivisions or agents shall use race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin as a criterion for either discriminating against, or granting preferential treatment to, any individual or group in the operation of the State's system of public employment, public education or public contracting."<p><center><b>Gaining Ground</center></b>
<p>
There are six reasons why the repeal of government-mandated racial quotas is gaining the support of the American people:<ul>
<li>
Racial preferences are discriminatory. It is just as wrong for the government to discriminate in favor of blacks and other minorities as it is to discriminate against them. Preferring one race to another is a violation of the Declaration of Independence, which holds that all men are created equal; of the 14th Amendment, which guarantees all citizens the equal protection of the laws; and of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which explicitly forbids government-mandated reverse discrimination. This discrimination has real victims, such as the Asians denied admission to the University of California in spite of spectacular records, and would-be policemen and firemen who lose jobs to applicants who are substantially less qualified.<li>
Racial preferences violate the principles of American citizenship. Americans come from all races, all religions, all nationalities. What unites us as a nation is not a common origin, but a common commitment to our political institutions: the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; the Constitution; a self-governing republic. Martin Luther King Jr. brought Americans togetherby speaking of what Americans have in common, by showing how the civil-rights movement fit into the American political tradition. Racial preferences do the opposite; they balkanize our country by emphasizing our differences.<li>
Racial preferences foster dependency on government. Ronald Reagan used to say that "the success of welfare should be judged by how many of its recipients become independent of welfare." So, too, the success of affirmative action should be judged by how many businesses become independent of set-asides, by how many individuals become independent of quotas in promotion and hiring. Unfortunately, all too many businesses have become part of a permanent affirmative-action industry.<li>
Racial preferences restrict freedom. Much of the creativity of a market economy comes from the freedom that individuals and businesses have to discover and use information. Bureaucratic, highly regulated affirmative-action policies endanger this creativity by denying businesses the freedom to hire and fire whomever they wish, and, in the case of employment tests that are forbidden because they have a disparate impact on races, by interfering with the free flow of information.<li>
Racial preferences fail to address the central challenge facing black America today: integrating poor black males into the American mainstream. The number of black men in college has fallen behind even as affirmative-action preferences in college admissions have intensified: There are now only 540,000 African-American men in college, compared with 830,000 black women. The explosion of violent crime by young black men wasn't supposed to happen with affirmative action. Something drastically different must be done instead of racial preferences, or a generation of black men will be destroyed.<li>
Most perniciously, racial preferences lower standards and expectations. When African Americans and Hispanics are held to a lower standard than members of other groups, the implicit message is patronizing, even racist. The signal sent by different treatment is that African Americans and Hispanics cannot compete on their own, unless they are given a special handicap. To make matters worse, the very idea of standards is devalued in the culture of affirmative action, where a test is considered discriminatory if blacks and Hispanics don't score well. </ul>
<p>
It is no accident that the two institutions in which blacks have advanced the most rapidly in America, the military and athletics, are meritocracies with clear performance standards. Colin Powell did not become the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and one of the outstanding generals in American history by receiving special treatment in his performance reviews. The military, it is frequently said, is the only institution in America in whichblacks regularly give orders to whites. This is because blackss in the armed forces have been given standards to aspire to, and the opportunity to achieve them.<p>
By contrast, public schools in America set tragically low academic expectations for poor children, especially for blacks and Hispanics. The culture of affirmative action reinforces these low expectations, with a defeatist message that minorities can't make the grade, and that standards don't even really matter. The sad fact is that on average blacks and Hispanics do score poorly on standardized academic tests. But that isn't an indictment of the tests; it's an indictment of the school system and surrounding culture that discourage kids from achieving.<p>
The literature of education is filled with stories of rapid academic advances by blacks and Hispanics in the face of higher expectations. Over the objections of fellow teachers and guidance counselors who said "these kids can't learn," Jaime Escalante turned Garfield High School, located in a working-class Mexican-American neighborhood of East Los Angeles, into one of the country's top advanced-placement calculus schools. Black and Hispanic freshmen in Georgia Tech's engineering program outperform whites, thanks to a rigorous orientation program based on immersion in math and chemistry.<p>
In New York City, the number of black ninth-graders passing the New York State Regents' science exam doubled from 6,000 in 1994 to nearly 13,000 in 1995, while the number of Hispanics passing the test tripled from 3,000 to over 10,000. The difference? In 1995, at the insistence of New York City School Chancellor Ramon Cortines, black and Hispanic students were expected to take Regents-level science courses and succeed in them. Prior to that, they were expected to fail.<p>
Expectations make all the difference for modest levels of achievement as well. During the early 1980s, Florida established a functional literacy test as a criterion of high-school graduation. Florida schools now give diplomas only to students who pass a test measuring whether they can fill out basic job application forms, do basic kinds of comparison shopping, balance check books, and otherwise participate in a modern society. At first, 80 to 90 percent of black 12th-graders failed. The test was challenged in court by the Legal Services Corp. on the grounds that it was discriminatory. But Florida gives students five chances to sit for the exam, and 90 percent of black 12th-graders now get passing scores. Those graduates are much better off for being forced to achieve a minimum level of competency.<p><b><center>The Best Affirmative Action</b></center>
<p>
The best affirmative action offers opportunities to outsiders without lowering standards and expectations. This means holding the members of all races to the same high standard and, if necessary, giving people the extra training they need to make the grade. It means not reserving particular jobs for blacks. It means making a genuine effort to find African Americansand other Americans of all raceswho might be overlooked but who have the capacity to excel. This is frequently a judgment call, for the capacity to excel is determined by leadership ability, strength of character, intellectual creativity, and other attributes that can't be easily measured by standardized tests. Precisely because it is a judgment call, it does not lend itself to bureaucratic oversight in the form of quotas, goals, or timetables.<p>
The nomination of Clarence Thomas as associate justice of the Supreme Court is a wonderful example of this judgment. President Bush and his advisers sensed that Thomas, though he did not yet have much judicial experience, had the constitutional understanding, the moral courage, and the intellect to become a distinguished judgeand also to become a national hero among conservative blacks in the way that Justice Thurgood Marshall was a national hero among liberals. As a result of Thomas's race, President Bush may have looked at his qualities more closely than he otherwise would have at that stage in the judge's career. But it was Thomas's qualities, not his race, that led to the nomination. There was no lowering of standards. On the contrary, the  Thomas nomination is now seen, at least by conservatives, as Bush's most significant enduring domestic-policy achievement.<p>
Americans of all races can take pride in the growing leadership of African Americans in political, economic, and cultural life. It is one of the great success stories of American history, rivaling the stories of the pioneers, of immigrants, of inventors and entrepreneurs. It is a quintessential American story of determined people overcoming hardship to make the most of our blessings of liberty.<p>
Government-imposed racial preferences played an important part in this story, by smashing through the institutional barriers to black advancement that were the legacy of centuries of discrimination. But reverse discrimination was always a questionable remedy to earlier prejudice. By failing now to offer opportunity to poor black males, racial preferences have outlived whatever usefulness they may have had. It is time for them to go.

<h3>ON THE FIRING LINE: CLINTON'S CRIME BILL</h3><P>
<b>By David B. Kopel</b><br>
Associate Policy Analyst, Cato Institute<br>
September 24, 1993<br>
<P>

What a thrill to be invited to speak at the Heritage
Foundation. I still remember that December day in 1979 when I saw
a little boxed ad for Policy Review tucked in one of the back pages
of Commentary. I asked my parents to buy me a subscription as a
Christmas present. The magazine had a profound effect on my
thinking, even as I was a Congressional intern for Representative
Pat Schroeder. 
<P>
     President Clinton was elected partly because he sold himself
as a New Democrat who was tough on crime. Almost everyone in
this room considers himself or herself to be tough on crime, as
a former New York prosecutor, I certainly share that viewpoint. So
is there anything that we can find to like in the proposed Clinton
crime bill. While the bill has a few virtues, it is on the whole
dangerous to public safety, both in the short and the long term.
<P>
Prior Restraint on Self-Defense. Let's start with the Brady Bill. Other than professional employees of the gun control lobby and New York City Mayor David Dinkins, I don't know anyone who seriously thinks this proposal is going to have a major impact on crime. I doubt thateven President Clinton expects it to have much of an effect. Accordingly, the fact that the Brady
Bill stands as the centerpiece of the Clinton crime bill is one indication that the bill is more aboutpolitics than about crime control.
<P>
     Here's how the Brady Bill works, in its present draft. When a person wishes to buy a handgun from a gun dealer, the dealer sends a notification to the local police. The local police have the option of conducting a background check of any type on the buyer, but there is no requirement for any background. After five government working days have elapsed, the dealer
may sell the handgun if the police have not vetoed the sale.
<P>
     As a practical matter of course, the dealer won't release the gun until he receives positive authorization from the police, even if the authorization takes months to come through. The risk of tort liability is simply too high. As a result, we can expect to see situations similar to that in New Jersey, where the statutory 30-day waiting period currently lasts for  several months, or New York City, where the statutory 6 month waiting period lasts nearly a year.
<P>
     If, rather than failing to act, the police simply veto the sale, the buyer has no legal recourse. If the sale was vetoed because the buyer was incorrectly mistaken for a person with the same last name who has a criminal record, or the sale was vetoed because the police chief doesn't like racial minorities, or because the police chief doesn't like anybody owning handguns, there is no legal recourse. There is no appeal from the police decision, and lawsuits based on the police decision are specifically forbidden.  In Maryland, where an appeals process exists, the
police are overruled on 78% of appeals.
<P>
     This practice of Handgun Control, Incorporated -- of repeatedly placing such clauses in legislation which appears relatively mild on the surface -- suggests that the group has more on its hidden agenda than moderate controls on handguns. In New Jersey, for example, the ban on so-called assault weapons even outlawed BB guns. 
<P>
     The real point of the Brady Bill is not that it has anything to do with crime control. Rather, it is accurately described by proponents and opponents alike as the first step towards much more restrictive gun controls. In a recent issue of the New York Times, Mrs. Brady explained that she expects the Brady Bill to pave the way for a need-based gun licensing system. By federal law, every transfer of every gun of any type, including the gift of a  old .22 single-shot rifle from father-in-law to son-in-law, would be permitted only if the local police determined that the recipient needed the particular gun. Based on the policies that Handgun Control, Inc. has supported in cities such as Washington and New York, if the police administration decided that nobody needed a gun for protection, or that nobody needed a handgun for any purpose, or that nobody needed a shotgun which could hold more than two shells, the police would have absolute discretion to prohibit the gun transfer.
<P>
     That gun prohibition advocates would support that Brady Bill component of the President's crime bill is not surprising. What is more disturbing is the support that the bill often receives from conservatives. For example, William F. Buckley suggests that the Brady Bill be enacted as a national gesture of our concern about violent crime. But of course one of the reasons
we have so much violent crime is that our political culture has tolerated and our politicians have readily indulged in empty, symbolic gestures, rather than genuine crime control.
<P>
     Some conservatives suggest that the Brady Bill be enacted because the public wants it, or because police lobbyists want it,  as if police or public sentiment could ever justify the infringement of Constitutional rights. And besides, the only polls that show support for the Brady
Bill are those that don't compare the Brady Bill with the NRA alternative. When people  compare the Brady Bill ( a waiting period with no background check) to the NRA alternative (a mandatory computerized check at the point of purchase), the public overwhelmingly prefers the NRA instant check.
<P>
     And to those who say they support the Brady Bill because it can't hurt, let me tell you a story. Armed with a knife, Charles A. Grant, Jr., sexually assaulted a 33-year-old woman on a Virginia beach woman one Tuesday in 1991. The assault was videotaped by a tourist who (not having a permit to carry a concealed handgun for protection), could do nothing to help except record the crime.
<P>
    Wednesday, Charles Grant raped a 12-year-old girl. News broadcasts of the videotape of Grant's Tuesday assault frightened many people in the nearby Nags Head community. 
<P>
     A young woman named Sonya Miller had been wanting a handgun for a while, and on that Wednesday, her father bought her a .38 special revolver. He gave her the revolver that evening.
<P>
     At about 9 p.m., Miss Miller went to the post office to pick up her mail. As she stepped into the dimly lit parking lot near the post office, Charles Grant saw her, and she saw Charles Grant. They both screamed. Grant told the young woman he would not hurt her, but when she attempted to get into her car, Grant lunged at the door. He stuck a .25 caliber pistol in her face, began climbing into the car's back seat, and said I'm going to kill you. 
<P>
     No, she replied, I'm going to kill you. Sonya Miller picked up the revolver she hadacquired less than 15 minutes before. When she pulled the hammer back, he dropped his gun and fled. Miss Miller drove home; her father called the sheriff's office; and Charles Grant was apprehended.
<P>
     Regarding the handgun Miss Miller had just acquired, It's the only thing that saved her life, her father observed. To enact the Brady Bill is to sign the death warrant for the next Sonya Miller. How many innocent people should die so that President Clinton is able to brag that he beat the NRA?
<P>
Federal Death Penalty. How about the rest of the crime bill? Well, President Clinton is probably right that there is some role for a federal death penalty -- especially if adequate funding for defense counsel, and reasonable habeas corpus rules ensure that only guilty people are executed.
But, as Representative John Conyers points out, it is foolish for politicians to posture about how tough on crime they are by listing the number of offenses for which they have created a federal death penalty. Senator Biden's 1992 crime bill found over 50 offenses meriting a federal death penalty, including murder of a federal meat inspector. I would suggest that our streets will not become safer simply because a tough message is sent to those hardened thugs who prey on Department of Agriculture employees.
<P>
     And the moral educational purpose that the death penalty serves -- to highlight the sanctity of human life by emphasizing society's horror at the unjustified taking of an innocent life -- is undermined by the application of the death penalty to any offense other than homicide. Thus, the proposal of Presidential candidate Paul Tsongas, which was echoed in the 1992 Biden
crime bill, to impose the death penalty for possession of large quantities of drugs is morally reprehensible. Assisting another person in engaging in a vice, or in making a foolish medical choice, or in altering their own state of consciousness is not on the same moral plane as homicide. To persons who believe otherwise, consider the possibility that if the mere release of
allegedly pernicious drugs into the stream of commerce becomes a capital offense, how long will it be until corporate officers who, through the chain of command, are already deemed criminally responsible for the release of  actual poisons into rivers and the air, become the next targets for
an omnivorous federal death penalty. The claim that particular water pollution didn't actually kill anyone may be deemed no more an excuse than the claim that a particular crop of hemp never killed anyone.
<P>
     So in proposing a relatively sensible federal death penalty, and resisting the urge for excessive piling on of inappropriate capital offenses, the Clinton crime bill deserves a cheer -- especially if the administration has the gumption to resist a piling on process as the bill moves through Congress.
<P>
A  Standing Army. But no cheers are due for the proposal for federal funding for 50,000 new police officers. First of all, the economy is just beginning to suffer from the largest tax increase in human history in order, supposedly, to reduce the massive federal deficit. This is no time to begin adding even more federal programs.
<P>
     Second, there is no hard evidence that police density makes that much a difference in crime. In 1973, the Kansas City police conducted a year-long experiment. Unbeknownst to the public, all patrol cars and foot patrols were pulled out of one area in the city, and placed in an adjacent, similar area. The police only entered the first area in response to specific calls for
assistance, while the second area enjoyed a doubling of the police presence. And after a year, the crime rate in both areas was unchanged.
<P>
     More fundamentally, federal funding of local police will inevitably bring local police under federal control. Major federal funding of highway construction was commenced with the best of intentions during the Eisenhower presidency, with no strings attached other than highway quality standardization. But in a few decades, the states had grown addicted to federal highway dollars, and those dollars have led to Congressional micromanagement of state drinking ages and of state driver's license revocation policies. Federal funding of education is well on the way to
destroying local control of public and private education. To pretend that federal funding of policing will have any result other than to gradually bring local police forces under the command of a federal police czar is unrealistic.
<P>
     The alternative Republican crime bill is superior to the Clinton proposal in that it pays for new spending by cutting spending elsewhere. But again, spending cuts ought to go to deficit reduction, not new spending. And the Republican alternative runs the same risk of the Clinton bill, of tieing local law enforcement to a federal tether.
<P>
     And the federalization of local police, combined with Vice-President Gore's proposal to consolidate all federal law enforcement under a single command brings us to violation of the spirit, at least, of the Second Amendment.
<P>
     The Second Amendment isn't about duck hunting, nor about shooting lone criminals, although both activities were considered morally laudable.  The Second Amendment at its core is about fear of a criminal federal government in general, and fear of a federal standing army in particular. Uniformed, professional, heavily-armed employees of the central government in Washington -- these were the people that the authors of the Constitution wisely feared would be more loyal to centralized authority than to the communities of America. And it was fear of this mercenary presence which wisely led the authors of our Constitution to believe that law enforcement should be under local control, where the checks and balances of community control would be strongest, and -- unlike the Mongol divisions of the Chinese Red army who massacred the Chinese students at Tienanmen Square -- locally-controlled law enforcement would be less likely to turn its guns on its own community.
<P>
     Thus, the issue on some of the more experimental aspects of the Clinton crime package, such as the national police corps, the community grants to local governments, the use of national service to fund police officers, and the funding of boot camps for first-time offenders, is not whether they will work. The 50 states are fully capable of conducting their own experiments with innovative crime control policies. And such experimentation is likely to be more fruitful when the states are spending their own money. The question for federal funding of these programs is whether they will erode local control, and augment federal control. And why do we need $475
million federal dollars to pay for school security guards? Or to pay for drug education programs? Can't local school boards make their own decisions, with their own tax dollars? And by the way, since the people elected Bill Clinton President, rather than Josef Stalin, isn't it time to do away
with federal funding for  so-called drug education programs that encourage children to turn their parents into the police?
<P>
     Troops to cops sounds like a nice idea -- training retiring military veterans to take police jobs. But do we really want the police to become even more like the military -- to focus on capturing an area and destroying an enemy, to rely heavily on high-tech assaults, with, understandably in a military context, no regard for the rights of persons being attacked, and only scant regard for the safety of bystanders?
<P>
     Already we live in a world were federal agencies feel free to assault on specious charges a peaceful community which happens to have eccentric religious beliefs and a lot of firearms. Already we live in a world where National Guard soldiers point their machine guns at teenage girls, while the United States Army, without probable cause, searches farms for illegal hemp, a product which George Washington grew on his own farm. Will America really be freer and safer by taking more giant steps towards a federal standing army involved in domestic law enforcement?

     <P>
     Let me suggest some elements that ought to have been included in a genuine criminal justice reform bill, reforms that would leave America both safer and freer: 
<P>
Forfeiture reform. Step one, consider Representative Henry Hyde's H.R. 2417, the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act. The act protects the fundament right to private property and restores the presumption of innocence through the following measures:
<P>
      Placing the burden of proof on the government. The government would be required to prove guilt, rather than the property owner being required to prove innocence.
<P>
      Providing for the appointment of legal counsel for indigent persons whose property has been seized. The billions of dollars in revenue generated by forfeiture programs provide more than enough resources to pay for counsel.
<P>
      Protecting from forfeiture the property of persons who have taken reasonable steps to ensure that the property would not be used in crime.
<P>
      Eliminating the requirement that persons opposing a forfeiture put up a 10% bond of the property's value. Under current practices, the government takes the property, and then makes the owner put up a bond for the property's value, if she wants to appeal the case while the government retains her property.
<P>
      Extending the time allowed from forfeiture challenges to 60 days after seizure, instead of the current 10 days.
<P>
      Authorizing property owners to sue the government for negligence damage to the property while the property was in government custody; and
<P>
      Allowing the property to be returned to the property owner pending a final resolution of the case, as long as adequate arrangements are made for the security of the property.
<P>
     Indeed, the Hyde forfeiture ought to be followed up with additional forfeiture reforms. A proportionality requirement should be introduced, so that a 10 million dollar piece of property is not subject to forfeiture over a dollar's worth of hemp.  And most importantly, we need to reform the forfeiture laws so that property is only subject to forfeiture if there is an attendant criminal conviction. The requirement for a criminal conviction has been evaded by the legal fiction that a forfeiture proceeding is an action against the property, rather than the owner. Simply put, legal fictions and the administrative convenience of law enforcement agencies should not be allowed to trump our nation's traditional commitment to private property as the foundation of a free society.
<P>
State Authority. Step two, as a beginning towards returning control over criminal justice to the states, reduce the budgets of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the Drug Enforcement Agency by 80%. Much of what these agencies do has nothing to do with any legitimate federal role in law enforcement. Arresting persons who sell small quantities of drugs or who sell firearms without a license is well within the competence of state and local law enforcement agencies. Federal agencies should focus exclusively on genuinely federal issues, such as the importation or interstate distribution of illegal commodities.
<P>
     Belief in the need to trim the federal role is not confined to libertarians and conservatives who thought that President Reagan's affirmation of the 10th Amendment was the best part of his first inaugural address. The National Sheriffs' Association and the American Correctional
Association ask us to Halt the growing trend towards federalization of state crimes. Federal criminal jurisdiction should not be expanded into areas of traditional state authority unless state, local and federal officials agree that there is a clear and compelling need for an increased federal presence.
<P>
     It is time that we recognized that a one-size-fits all federal approach is not working on most federal programs, including crime control. Mississippi doesn't need to have the same kinds of drug or alcohol laws as does Wisconsin, and Colorado ought to be able to watch the success or failure of the programs in Wisconsin and Mississippi, and then choose its own unique approach. Washington should get out of the business of trying to impose laws drafted in Washington as state statutes, and Washington should get out of the business of enforcing laws which are primarily a state and local concern. Why should Washington, rather than a state legislature, decide what requirements a licensed gun dealer should have? Why should Washington decide what kind of licensing system should be imposed on machine gun owners? Can't New Jersey and Arizona answer these questions differently, and why should Washington take away their 10th amendment right to do so?
<P>
     The 10th Amendment critique of federal criminal justice is not dependent on suspicion of the substance of underlying criminal laws. Carjacking is obviously a heinous crime, and carjackers deserve severe punishment, including the death penalty when the carjacking results in
a felony murder. But what business does Congress have passing a federal carjacking statute? Carjackings are not perpetrated by interstate conspiracies of automobile smugglers. Nor are state and local prosecutors reluctant to prosecute and vigorously punish these thugs. Likewise, turning
rape into a federal offense by redefining it as a civil rights violation improperly insults state and local law enforcement by presuming that existing rape laws are not vigorously enforced.
<P>
     Conservatives who want to use federal funds to push states towards remaking their state criminal justice system in a conservative image, with more mandatory minimums, pre-trial detention, and truth-in-sentencing, might perhaps consider what will happen when the tools of federal coercion begin to be used to require the states, increasingly dependent on federal criminal
justice dollars, to enforce the leftist criminal agenda: Mandatory minimums for paperwork violations of environmental laws. Harsh forfeitures imposed on persons who dare to possess an unregistered shotgun. Re-education program for the politically incorrect whose dissent from the radical feminist and critical race theory agenda is labeled hate speech.
<P>
     In this regard, applause is due to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, which a few days ago declared unconstitutional the federal Gun-free School Zones Act. By that 1990 law, it is a federal felony for you to park your car across the street from your house, take your unloaded hunting rifle out of your car trunk, and carry the rifle into your home, if you happen to be within a thousand feet of a school. Certainly state and local government ought to be able to restrict the carrying of weapons onto school property. But again, the restrictions appropriate in New York City are not appropriate for Bozeman, Montana. The federal Court of Appeals recognized as much, by declaring that federal control of this issue was an unreasonable intrusion into a traditional area of state and local control.
<P>
Warrant reform. If we can get the federal government out of regulating areas of state and local concern, such as who can possess firearms components, then we will begin saving lives by reducing the scope of operations of agencies such as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The fiasco and mass-murder in Waco highlight the need to prevent the fraudulent procurement of warrants for hypertechnical violations of BATF interpretations of federal gun laws. In this regard, the warrant requirement for gun law violations, and perhaps for other federal crimes as well, should be protected through the following reforms:
<P>
      Require that a warrant application be reviewed by a United States Attorney before being presented to a judge or magistrate. This will allow the Department of Justice to perform its proper function to review the legality of federal agency actions.
<P>
      Allow use of hearsay evidence only if the actual witness is unavailable.
<P>
      Require that probable cause be established for each element of the alleged offense.
<P>
      Establish a reasonable time limit, such as 30 days, between the date of an alleged offense and the date of a search warrant. This will prevent Waco-type situations, where a February 1993 raid was launched for offenses which had allegedly occurred in early 1992.
<P>
      Require that an application for a warrant fully inform the magistrate or judge of contradictory or possibly exculpatory evidence.

   <P>   Establish the presumption that once a warrant is served, the warrant and accompanying application should almost never be sealed from public disclosure, except when necessary to protect the safety of persons identified in the warrant application.
<P>
      Require specific judicial authorization for use of extraordinary use of force in serving a warrant, including no-knock entry. 
<P>
These changes would not impair the ability of responsible law enforcement agencies to obtain warrants, but they would prevent at least some irresponsible and abusive federal actions.
<P>
Mandatory Minimums. Finally, it is time for Congress to consider seriously Rep. Don Edwards (D-Calif.) bill to repeal all federal mandatory minimums, especially regarding non-violent crimes. Nearly 70% of federal prison space is used to house drug offenders, many of them first offenders serving 5, 10 or 20 year mandatory minimums. A free-market economist can tell you why this
policy hasn't created a dent in the supply of illegal drugs. Federal prison space should prioritize the long-term incarceration of violent offenders. Violent convicts should be allocated sufficient prison space to ensure that they stay off the streets until they are too old and lacking in high-
level testosterone to commit further violent crime. Only once the violent criminals are taken off the streets for good should whatever prison space is left over be used for non-violent prisoners.
<P>
     It is notable and commendable that the prison-building programs in the Republican alternative crime bill are focussed on increasing prison space for repeat violent offenders.
<P>
     In conclusion, I would urge that the conservatives of the 1990s take heed from some of the failures of the 1960s. The liberals of the 1960s were motivated by legitimate concerns for economic and social justice, as the conservatives and President Clinton are today motivated by genuine concerns over criminal justice. But these laudable concerns should not obscure the
fundamental principle that our federal government is one of limited, enumerated powers, and has no general police power to legislate at large. Many criminal justice programs that can appropriately be proposed by the Governor of Arkansas are not appropriately proposed by the President of the United States. The Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as well as the practical experience of decades of failed federal efforts to control matters of state and local concern, perhaps suggest that it is time to begin reducing, rather than expanding, the role of the federal government in many areas, including criminal justice.<P>

<p>
Every morning for seven years, Linda Desrosiers  packed her lunch before heading to work as a high-school cook. "I wouldn't touch the food they had us make," she says. "People looked at it and smelled it, but no one ate it."<p>
School janitors in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, an impoverished textile-mill town, confirm Desrosiers's stories of platefuls of grayish green beans and "beef surprise" winding up in the dumpster. One janitor said he changed the high school's industrial-sized garbage bags at least twice in each of the three lunch periods. <p>
In recent months, liberals led by President Clinton have argued that the federal school lunch program "ain't broke" and shouldn't be fixed. They argue, persuasively, that kids who are hungry won't learn. But they also make the false assumption that students actually eat the meals that the government subsidizes. Rhode Island is proving that students' nutrition levels can improve dramatically when subsidies for school meals are slashed.<p>
This academic year, the state of Rhode Island radically reformed its school-lunch program by dumping a quarter-century of centrally planned purchasing, hiring, and cooking. The state cut its $11-million school-lunch appropriation to less than $200,000 and fired all but 11 of the 780 workers who administered, cooked, and served the lunches. Now, private food-service contractors like Marriott and ARA Corp. plan the menus and feed the students. The school districts still get reimbursement from Washington, but the federal money is sent directly to the local districts on a per-meal basis. As a result, combined federal and state subsidies have fallen from more than $23 million in 1993-94 to $12 milliona 48 percent cut. <p>
The result: Kids are eating better. In the past seven months, student participation in school-lunch programs has soared, nutrition levels have risen to among the best in the nation, and poor school districts like Woonsocket are generating a profit.<p>
Brandon Powers, a sixth-grader at Woonsocket Elementary School, says the only downside of the privatized system is that it has put an end to daily "school-slop sculpture contests." "Now the food is pretty good," he says, "so people prefer to eat it rather than build with it." Even Desrosiers, now a cook for Marriott, eats it every day.<p>
Students at North Smithfield High School now eat their hamburgers instead of conducting experiments on the effects of mustard, catsup, and relish on burger flight. And students at a magnet high school in Providence no longer request extra gravy with their mashed potatoes just to provide greater contrast for finger-painting with their food. <p>
School officials back up students' claims that they are eating more. Since a private contractor took over Woonsocket High School's lunch program, janitors haul away 75 percent less garbage from the school cafeteria. Irene Scripsack, the business manager for the North Smithfield school district, says her janitors only collect 5 percent as much garbage as they used to. Scripsack won't say how often she ate the state's food, but admits it was "quite rare."<p>
"The state-run program suffered from what I call 'orange-ravioli syndrome,'" says John Caparco, the principal of Woonsocket High School. "Just providing food students should eat does not mean they'll eat it.  They were simply out to lunch when it came to making the food appealing." Caparco admits even he didn't eat the old food. "Now I get it all the time."<p>
Ellen McKenna, a junior dietetics major at the University of Rhode Island, demonstrated that plate waste was cut dramatically at schools that used private contractors. For instance, she found that most of the hot-food trays were "completely cleared of food" before they were emptied in the trash at Marriott's Potter-Burns Elementary School cafeteria in Pawtucket, where 32 percent of the students are eligible for free or reduced-price meals. Likewise, at ARA's Central Falls Elementary School, where 89 percent of the students qualify for free or reduced-price meals, students ate almost all of their carrots, breads, burritos, and sandwiches. <p>
At the state-run cafeteria at Lonsdale Elementary School in Lincoln, a wealthier community where the state-administered program had not yet been phased out, students were "picking at their food," rather than eating it. On the majority of the trays, most or all of the rice, bread, and fruit had been left uneaten. McKenna reports that students had difficulty identifying the food, and tended to push it around the tray rather than eat it. For instance, one student said he couldn't identify his ham-salad sandwich. McKenna described it as a "pink mush on a roll."<p>
After privatization, not only are students eating more of the meals on their trays, but more of the kids are buying meals.  In Woonsocket, for instance, where more than 77 percent of the students qualify for free or reduced-price meals, participation has soared under Marriott's direction. During the 1991-92 school year, this "severe-need" district served 2,652 lunches a day. Now it averages 3,486 lunches dailya 31 percent increase. Similarly, under the state-run system, Woonsocket only served 288 breakfasts daily; now it serves 597a 107 percent increase.<p>
Woonsocket is the rule, not the exception. In Providence, where more than 70 percent of the students receive free or reduced-price meals, participation has increased 22 percent since a private vendor took over the cafeterias. And wealthy school districts, like North Smithfield, have recorded 25 percent more students eating school lunches since the state system folded.<p>
Between bites of a chicken-patty sandwich, Pauline Goin says she and her friends rarely bought lunch when the state ran the cafeteria, because the food was always a mysteryin both appearance and taste. "The other stuff was, you know, welfare food, and it tasted like it," the sixth-grader says bluntly. "This stuff is regular foodyou know, for humans."<p>
Greater participation seems to improve discipline during the once-raucous lunch period. Woonsocket's Caparco says that the time his office spends handling discipline problems has been cut by about 20 percent. "If the kids are eating, it's harder to be fighting," Caparco notes.<p><b><center>Have It Your Way</b></center>
<p>
Ruth Eshelman, a nutrition professor at the University of Rhode Island, says that options are essential to students' satisfaction. "If I have a choice, I am much more likely to eat what I choose," Eshelman said. "If I have to eat carrots, they will be terrible, but if I pick carrots over green beans, the carrots might be wonderful."<p>
The state-run school lunch program offered no choice. Each week, newspapers across the state printed the upcoming menu with a total of five listingsthe entire state had one option each school day. Private vendors, on the other hand, offer about 20 alternatives daily. Woonsocket High School students, for instance, can now choose from five meats, several cheeses, and two kinds of bread in the deli line. They can also pick from a list of three or four hot sandwiches, two salads, and a pasta dish. In addition, the menu offers pizza and burritos. Even if the student tires of these regular items, several specials are offered each day. Students also choose from a selection of fresh fruit and vegetables at every meal. And parents are sent a monthly menu describing each day's choices and their nutritional value.<p>
Private vendors also increase participation by using name brands: Pizza is supplied by a local Domino's franchise, and burritos are cooked according to a Taco Bell recipe. The name-brand packaging and advertising raise the likelihood that students will actually like the meal.<p>
Private vendors recognize that student involvement is vital to customer satisfaction. In Woonsocket and Providence, groups of students and parents meet monthly with Marriott's food-service directors. Dina Dutremble, Woonsocket's business manager, says the state never responded to local concerns; private contractors, on the other hand, conduct weekly taste-tests. <p>
Sandra Caron, a senior at Woonsocket High School who is a vegetarian, says that these meetings have allowed her to buy her lunch at school for the first time. After explaining to the food-service director that she and several other students would be willing to buy lunch if vegetarian entres were more readily available, the company promised to look into it. "I suspected they would do what had always happened. Nothing ever happens," Caron says. "But within two weeks, there was a vegetarian item on the menu every day."<p>
Ellen Haas, a USDA official who supervises the school lunch program from Washington, doesn't trust the private sector. She insists that devolution to local districts, like Rhode Island's privatization initiative, will lead to "short-term malnutrition and a lifetime of serious and costly health problems." Her fears were echoed by House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, who equated devolution to "a dagger pointed at the hearts of our children." But a careful review of nutritional data demonstrates that Rhode Island's new, private programs outperform its state-run lunches. Haas's office did not return several phone callls.<p>
Current USDA regulations require that school lunches provide at least a third of the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of seven nutrientsranging from vitamins A and C to iron and thiamin. Rhode Island's state-run school-lunch program, however, did not meet these minimums. Bethany Algier, a nutritionist with Rhode Island's Department of Health, notes that a 1991 nutritional audit of the school-lunch program found that  the state's program fell short in vitamin C and iron and did not meet the target for calories. Plus, this audit assumed implausibly that the students were eating everything on their trays. Although liberals can speak of the value of mandating nutrition levels, Rhode Island demonstrates that these mandates are not even enforced, and it is impossible to ensure the students will even eat the food.<p>
The private vendors, however, combat both these flaws by providing more nutritious meals that the students actually want to eat. According to the Department of Health's nutritional audit, Marriott's menus exceed the state's program by at least three-fold in each of the RDA's seven nutrient categories. In fact, the private-sector program provides students with more than double the RDA of vitamin C, protein, and vitamin A600 percent of the federal minimum for school lunches.<p>
In addition to the RDA nutrients, the private vendors' meal plans have less fat, cholesterol, and sodium and more fiber than Rhode Island's state-run program. Over a 10-week period, the average Marriott lunch contained 33 percent less fat, 40 percent less cholesterol, and 40 percent less sodium than the state's lunches. Marriott's average lunch contained only half the saturated fat and twice the fiber of a government lunch.<p>
Desrosiers and other cafeteria workers don't find these numbers surprising. In the private kitchens, fruits and vegetables rarely come from the can, since the two leading companies, ARA and Marriott, can use their buying power to get price breaks on more nutritious fresh and fresh-frozen produce. In North Smithfield, the independent school-lunch program has promised parents that it will never deep-fry a single item it sells; it even uses low-fat mozzarella cheese on its pizza. This district's hamburger meat contains about 15 percent fat, while the state-run program never used beef with less than 30 percent fat.<p>
Most remarkable, however, is that private vendors don't just provide healthier meals that students will eat, they do it at a profit. Like discount book chains, Marriott and ARA make money selling a high-quality product cheaply by counting on high volume. The per-meal federal reimbursement formula gives the contractors an incentive to provide nutritious meals that kids will like, because the more meals they induce kids to buy, the greater their margins beyond fixed costs. So far, the strategy has paid off.<p>
The secret to making it all work is the plan's clever payment system. The complicated arrangement provides the private contractor with an incentive to feed more students and allows the school district to keep most of the profits. School districts pay the contractor an annual fee to run the program. This fee pays for everything from capital improvements to salaries and food. The school district then keeps all the money the students pay. In addition, the district keeps all of the per-meal subsidies Washington sends it. If these revenues fall short of the district's payment to the private contractor, the contractor assumes the loss. This way, the district can't lose money and the contractor has an incentive to keep costs down while serving more meals. If the district turns a profit, the contractor gets a small cut.<p>
Dutremble, the business manager for the Woonsocket School District, says that the school lunches were a daily headache under the state-run program. While the state provided all of the workers, menus, and food, her district had to pay for high-priced food-service equipment out of its local operating budget. These costs were often so high that some school districts could not afford "sneeze guards" in their serving lines.<p>
Under Marriott's direction, the program is self-sufficient and has already turned a $42,000 profit this year, most of which the district keeps. In Woonsocket, the money is being used to purchase a new $30,000 dishwasher and a truck to deliver meals more efficiently to the elementary schools. Providence's program will profit by more than $100,000 this year, and North Smithfield was $5,000 in the black as of January 1. <p>
In addition, fears that poor or small school districts would be ignored by private vendors are unfounded. In fact, poorer school districtssuch as Woonsocket and Providenceare considered more desirable contracts for private vendors. These students are less likely to bring a lunch than their more affluent peers and therefore participation rates rise more dramatically when the food improves. Small school districts in Rhode Island joined together to negotiate joint competitive contracts. Lastly, the state limits the threat of corruption by putting the program out for bid frequently. Rhode Island prohibits  school-lunch contracts of more than a year, and limits the number of renewals.<p>
Rhode Island's experiment with privatized school lunches is the brainchild of a state legislator, Paul Crowley. A restaurant owner, Crowley was appalled to discover wages in state-run cafeterias were more than $4 per hour higher than at private restaurants, while nutrition levels were substandard. <p>
For years, Crowley's efforts to privatize the program were blocked by state-employee unions. Two years ago, however, Crowley found that the Providence school board had conducted a study showing that a private vendor would save the district more than $600,000 a year. School officials there said they abandoned plans to privatize their program under union pressure. Crowley said the unions even sent busloads of lunch workers to their meetings. After public hearings, Crowley amended the state's Fiscal Year 1995 budget to phase out the school-lunch program this school year. Under the new system, local school districtsrather than the stateare reimbursed directly from the federal government. As in all states, students pay some, all, or none of the lunch cost depending on their parent's income; Washington coughs up the rest.<p>
"We should be in the business of teaching, not feeding," Crowley says. "If other people make a better mousetrap, it makes more sense to buy theirs than build your own." <p>
Although school-district officials universally praise the private-sector lunch program, some are concerned about the GOP's block-grant proposal. Providence officials, for instance, expect the district-wide student body to increase by at least 800 kids next year, and fear that the block grant will not cover extra meals. But Crowley claims the program will still thrive under the block grant proposal. As a district's population increases, more students will buy meals. Since private contractors get paid on a per-meal basis, a larger student body would compensate for a reduction in per-student dollars.<p>
Rhode Island is evidence that converting federal funds to block grants can only improve the nation's school-lunch program. Given full responsibility for the programs, Crowley predicts more states will turn to innovative private alternatives that cost less and maintain higher standards.<p>
In fact, Crowley believes if school lunches had been devolved years ago, Rhode Island would have privatized sooner. "We have found that local districts are best off when they handle this on their own," Crowley said. "Blockgranting can only help us continue on this path."

     The Department of Labor wants to create job opportunities for
tens of thousands of American workers, many of whom are minority,
poor, or unskilled. The Department plans to do this by expanding the
use of helpers on federal construction projects regulated by the 1931
Davis-Bacon Act. Yet Congress is attempting to block these efforts. To
protect high-paid union workers at the expense of low income workers,
Congress has tacked provisions onto the Persian Gulf emergency
spending bill (H.R. 1281), soon to arrive on George Bush's desk for
signature, that would prohibit the Labor Department from using funds
to relax the regulations now preventing less skilled minority youth
from working on federal construction projects.
<P>
     The Bush Administration correctly opposes this provision. The big
labor lobby reckons apparently that Bush will feel that he has to sign
the bill to cover the war costs incurred by non-defense agencies, even
though the bill now contains the anti-minority provisions regarding
federal construction. The Davis-Bacon Act for years has denied federal
contracts to small construction firms, many of them owned by
minorities, and jobs to low income workers. Bush should veto the bill,
telling Congress that he will not allow the Persian Gulf bill to be
held hostage to such anti-minority measures. Or the President might
use his power of "constitutional excision" and simply cross out the
offending provision from the bill. In either case, the President then
should throw his political weight behind the effort by Representative
Charles Stenholm, the Texas Democrat, to repeal the Davis-Bacon Act
altogether and thereby provide job opportunities for tens of thousands
of Americans.
<P>
     "Super-Minimum" Wage. The Davis-Bacon Act, passed in the depths
of the Great Depression, requires contractors to pay all workers on
federally funded construction projects valued at more than $2,000 the
"prevailing wage" as determined by the Department of Labor. In
practice, however, the Labor Department has tended to avoid making the
complicated wage calculations for each job classification. Instead it
uses local union wage scales as a proxy for the "prevailing wage."
Since the union wage is significantly more than the market wage, this
sets a "super-minimum" wage for each classification. This higher wage
in turn sharply reduces the pool of eligible workers likely to be
hired at that wage. Usually only union workers meet the wage test.
Traditionally the big losers in this process have been minorities --
those who are at the entry level or those who cannot break into the
union ranks.Yet individual workers are not the only victims of Davis-
Bacon. Minority and small contractors suffer also. Most of these
contractors are non-union and feel that paying Davis-Bacon wages on a
few federal projects a year would so disrupt their pay scales that it
is not worth the trouble or the administrative costs even to bid on
government projects. Most of these contractors, therefore, never
bother to bid on a Davis-Bacon regulated project.
<P>
     Davis-Bacon openly was intended to discriminate against blacks,
and that is precisely what it has done. The original Davis-Bacon Act
was drafted in 1927 by New York Republican Congressman Robert Bacon
after an Alabama contractor won the bid to build a federal hospital in
Bacon's district. As Bacon stated in the first hearing on the bill,
"The bid... was let to a firm from Alabama who brought some thousand
non-union laborers from Alabama into Long Island, N.Y., into my
congressional district." What Bacon was hinting at was that many of
the workers were black, and willing to work for less than local
building tradesmen. The debate on the bill took matters beyond
hinting. When the final bill was debated on the House floor on
February 28, 1931, Alabama Congressman Miles Allgood argued for the
Act, stating: "That contractor has cheap colored labor... and it is
labor of that sort that is in competition with white labor.. . This
bill has merit... [and] it is very important that we enact this
measure."
<P>
     Poison to Minorities. For nearly six decades Davis-Bacon has
harmed minorities. According to Ralph C. Thomas III, executive
director of the Washington, D.C.-based National Association of
Minority Contractors, "The law in its current form is poison to
minority contractors [and to] minority employment in general.... The
law stifles the minority contractors' efforts to not only hire as many
minority workers as possible, but it also hinders minority contractor
efforts to introduce new workers into the construction field."
<P>
     In an effort to give more opportunities to lower skilled workers,
the Department of Labor set out in 1982 to change the regulations that
generally had precluded "helpers" from working on federally funded
construction projects. Lower-skilled and thus lower-paid "helpers"
systematically were excluded from federal construction projects by
regulations that were "rigged" in favor of higher paid skilled workers
regardless of the tasks required. Example: if a worker who was really
a low-skilled "helper" picked up a hammer, he was declared a
"carpenter" and, therefore, must be paid a higher wage. Not only does
this discriminate against minorities, it adds billions of dollars to
federal construction costs, contributing to high budget deficits and
high taxes.
<P>
     The American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial
Organizations (AFL-CIO), whose members often benefit from Davis-Bacon,
sued the Department of Labor in 1982 to block any further enforcement
of the new regulations. After nearly eight years of litigation the
Department of Labor won on appeal and last February renewed its
efforts to enforce the regulations that would allow contractors to use
the lower-paid helpers on federally supported projects. 
<P>
     Big Labor Roadblock. The big labor lobby then struck back through
an amendment attached to the emergency spending bill by Congressman
John Murtha, the Pennsylvania Democrat. The amendment effectively
would withhold the funds that the Labor Department needs to carry out
the new policies and prevents the Department from administering "any
other regulation that would have the same or similar effect." The
White House's Office of Management and Budget declared its opposition
to the Murtha provision this March 7 in a "Statement of Administration
Policy."  
<P>
     Bush can make a strong statement of his support for expanding
employment opportunities for minorities and low-income workers by
vetoing this bill and sending it back to Congress for revision. Given
the President's popularity, Congress would not be able to hold Persian
Gulf money hostage to its job-destroying agenda. Or to avoid such a
situation entirely, Bush could take an even bolder approach. A number
of constitutional scholars suggest that Davis-Bacon violates the
Constitution because it discriminates against minorities. If this is
the case, as it clearly seems to be, Bush has the power through
"constitutional excision" to eliminate the offending sections from an
appropriations bill. In his only previous use of this power, on
November 3, 1989, when Bush struck a provision from an appropriations
bill, Congress did not challenge him. Whichever approach he takes,
however, the President should announce his support for efforts by
Congressman Stenholm and others to repeal the Davis-Bacon Act entirely
as a means to provide job opportunities to minorities.

<h3> THE DANFORTH "COMPROMISE": ANOTHER QUOTA CIVIL RIGHTS BILL </h3>
William G. Laffer III<BR>
McKenna Fellow in Regulatory and Business Affairs<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder Update No. 168<br>
October 7, 1991<br>
<P>
(Updating <a href="/heritage/library/categories/crimelaw/em302.html"><I>Executive Memorandum</I> 
No. 302</a>, "The Danforth 'Compromise': Another Quota Civil Rights Bill," June 3, 1991.)
<p><hr width=50%></center>

                      
<P>



      George Bush last year vetoed a so-called "civil rights" bill
because it would encourage employers to adopt racial quotas in
employment decisions. A revised version of the bill, called the "Civil
Rights Act of 1991" (H.R. 1), was introduced this year and already has
passed the House of Representatives, although with less than the two-
thirds majority needed to override the President's promised veto. The
House rejected an alternative bill offered by Bush. 
<P>
      Attention now has turned to the Senate, where Senator John
Danforth, the Missouri Republican, has introduced a "compromise" civil
rights bill (S. 1745). As in the House, the Senate debate has focused
on the issue of whether the legislation will promote quotas. Danforth
insists that it will not. Yet while Danforth has made significant
changes in his bill since it was first introduced this summer, it
remains a quota bill.
<P>
      What Is A Quota Bill? In its original, narrow usage, the term
"quotas" referred only to the practice of setting aside a fixed number
or percentage of employment positions for members of a particular
race, color, religion, sex, or ethnic group. In recent debates over
civil rights legislation, however, the term has come to be used for
all forms of race-conscious decision-making or preferential treatment
based on group membership, including such terms as "goals" and
"timetables." The term "quotas" also refers to laws that force
employers to abandon perfectly legitimate hiring practices simply
because they happen to produce statistical disparities between the
racial or ethnic composition of an employer's work force and that of
the general population. This broadened definition is more in line with
the commonly understood idea of a quota. Thus, a policy of giving job
applicants an advantage in the hiring process merely because they are,
say, black or Hispanic, would count as a quota, as would a policy of
always choosing a minority whenever two applicants are otherwise
equally qualified.
<P>
      A bill can fairly be classified as a quota bill if its effect
would be to give an employer the incentive to adopt quotas to protect
himself from potential lawsuits based on the percentage of minorities
in his work force. Or it would be a quota bill if it changes the rules
of civil litigation to make it impossible for victims of employment
discrimination to challenge quota plans adopted by employers under
court order or in settlement of prior litigation. It is in these two
senses the Danforth bill qualifies as a quota bill.
<P>
      Avoiding Disparate Impact Suits. Current civil rights law allows
individuals to sue an employer over legitimate and nondiscriminatory
hiring practices if these practices happen to produce a racial or
ethnic mix in the employer's work force that is different from that
found in the general population. A statistical disparity between the
racial or ethnic composition of an employer's work force and that of
the general population is called a "disparate impact." The Danforth
bill would alter the standards in disparate impact suits, making it
more likely that employers will lose in court, and more expensive for
them even when they win. This would encourage employers to try to
avoid being sued in the first place by giving special preferences to
groups that otherwise might be under-represented in the employer's
work force. 
<P>
      Two changes the Danforth bill would make to current law are
especially harmful:
<P>
      First, once a plaintiff has demonstrated that particular
employment practices used by an employer cause a disparate impact,
Danforth's bill would shift the burden of proof to the defendant
employer, requiring him to show that each of the challenged practices
is "required by business necessity." This change represents a radical
departure from previous law. Putting the burden of proof on the
defendant is contrary to the tradition of Anglo-American law, under
which a defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty: the burden
of proof is on the plaintiff, not on the accused. The change proposed
by Danforth also is contrary to the customary practice in other kinds
of civil rights cases, and in virtually all other areas of civil
litigation. Since defendants accused of intentional discrimination do
not have to prove their innocence, it would be odd and perverse to
require defendants who are accused merely of getting their work force
numbers wrong -- perhaps inadvertently -- to prove theirs.
Nonetheless, that is exactly what the Danforth bill would do. 
<P>
      This change alone would create pressure for employers to adopt
quotas. Not only would putting the burden of proof on defendants make
it more difficult for them to defend themselves against disparate
impact suits, but it would make it almost impossible for defendants to
obtain summary judgment and thereby avoid the expense of a trial. (A
court may decide in favor of a party without first holding a trial if,
based on those facts which are not in dispute, one party is entitled
to prevail as a matter of law.  Such a ruling without trial is called
a summary judgment.  It generally is harder for the party having the
burden of proof on an issue to obtain a summary judgment on that
issue.) Consequently, even if an employer were completely confident
that he could show the business necessity of his hiring practices at
the trial, often it would still be cheaper simply to change the
practices to produce the "right" mix of employees, and thereby avoid
being sued in the first place.
<P>
      Second, and of even greater concern, the Danforth bill would
change the standard for deciding whether an employment practice that
causes a disparate impact is "required by business necessity." The
current standard is based on whether a challenged practice serves a
legitimate employment goal of the employer in any significant way. The
new standard would require that challenged hiring or promotion
practices bear what the bill calls a "manifest relationship" either to
the performance of the "actual work activities required" by the job,
or to any other "behavior that is important to the job" in question.
The differences between the current standard and Danforth's proposed
new standard may appear to be slight. However, there are many
legitimate employment practices and goals which, under Senator
Danforth's formulation, would be treated as forms of racial
discrimination. 
<P>
Example:   An employer who requires all his employees, including
           janitors, to have a high school diploma could be found
           guilty of racial discrimination because the possession of a
           high school diploma does not bear a manifest relationship
           to the job of sweeping floors. This means that attempts by
           local businessmen to encourage local teenagers to finish
           high school by favoring high school graduates for
           employment almost certainly would be ruled illegal. 
<P>
Example:   An employer who prefers to promote from within the
           organization might face legal problems. Many employers
           believe that such a policy is good for employee morale, or
           believe that on-the-job observation provides a more
           reliable basis for choosing upper-level employees than a
           one-hour interview. Such employers thus might require
           certain entry-level employees to have skills and
           educational credentials above those necessary for the
           entry-level position. But under the Danforth bill such an
           employer could be found guilty of racial discrimination
           since the additional requirements would not bear a
           sufficient relationship to "the employment in question."
<P>
Example:   An employer who uses a test to determine which employees
           should be promoted to a higher position that requires
           special training could be found guilty of racial
           discrimination if he is unable to show a sufficient
           statistical correlation between performance on the test and
           performance in the job in question. It may be that the
           verbal and analytical skills evaluated in the test would
           indicate an employee's capacity to understand the material
           in the training program, and mastery of such such material
           may be indispensable to successful performance of the job.
           Nevertheless, these facts by themselves might not be a
           sufficient legal defense.
<P>
      The standard in the Danforth bill would require employers to
defend their hiring and promotion practices exclusively in terms of
performance of work activities required by, or other behavior
important to, the job in question. Thus, employers would be forced to
abandon employment practices and goals not directly related to the job
in question. Yet many employment practices and goals not directly
related to the job in question may be legitimate and sensible. For
example, given the already dismal state of American education, it
would seem absurd for Congress to punish employers for requiring high
school diplomas. Indeed, employers are being urged by Congress and the
Administration to encourage prospective employees to finish high
school. Moreover, regardless of whether an employment practice or goal
is socially desirable or not, the fact that it may not be directly
related to "the job in question" does not automatically make it a form
of racial discrimination. 
<P>
      With the restrictions that the Danforth bill would place on the
acceptable justifications an employer can offer in defense of a policy
that happens to produce a disparate impact, many employers would
conclude that offering a defense is not worth the cost. Instead
employers would seek to avoid being sued in the first place by
altering their hiring procedures to produce the "right" mix of race
and sex within their work force. In other words, they would adopt
quotas.
<P>
      There is another aspect of the Danforth bill that, by itself,
also would be sufficient to make the bill a quota bill. The measure
would restrict severely the right of individuals harmed by quotas or
other race-conscious "remedies" imposed by consent decrees or other
court orders to seek redress through an anti-discrimination lawsuit of
their own. For example, if an employer who is sued agrees to give half
of all promotions to blacks, or is ordered to do so by a court, better
qualified Asians or Hispanics might subsequently be denied promotions
because of the new quota. But under the Danforth bill, these workers
could be denied their day in court if they wished to challenge this as
unfair. This denial of due process and civil rights thus would lock in
quotas by protecting such a hiring policy from subsequent challenge.
<P>
      Proponents of this legislation, including Danforth, repeatedly
have called for a compromise. What they refuse to recognize or
acknowledge is that the Administration's alternative bill already is a
compromise bill. In fact, Bush already has gone farther than is
prudent in trying to compromise on the issue of quotas. Even his bill
would shift the burden of proof on the issue of business necessity to
defendants. The undesirable effects of this departure from the normal
presumption of innocence would be reduced greatly, however, because
the standard of business necessity in the President's bill is less
restrictive than that in the Danforth bill or in H.R. 1.
<P>
      Missing the Real Issue. Perhaps the greatest weakness of the
Danforth bill is that it focuses exclusively on making arcane,
legalistic refinements in the civil rights laws that were passed a
quarter of a century ago. Like H.R. 1 and last year's Kennedy-Hawkins
bill, the Danforth bill overlooks the fact that civil rights laws are
irrelevant to the most pressing problems facing America's neediest
individuals. Like its predecessors, the Danforth civil rights bill
mainly would benefit middle- and upper-class minority Americans who
have the education and skills to benefit from de facto quota hiring.
Because low-income minority workers tend to work in the kinds of jobs
in which, if anything, they are already over-represented, they would
not be particularly affected by the bill. Where employers would have
to make changes to reduce their exposure to litigation is in the
middle- and upper-level job categories, in which minorities tend to be
"under-represented." The only minority workers who can occupy these
jobs, however, and thereby benefit from any increase in the demand for
minority employees, are those with higher skill levels. Relatively
underprivileged or unskilled minority workers would not be able to
take advantage of increased opportunities the bill might create, and
the bill would do nothing to help those who lack necessary skills to
acquire them. At the same time, by saddling employers with another
layer of employment laws and regulations, imposing additional
administrative costs and litigation expenses, the bill actually might
tend to reduce employment opportunities for the neediest minority
workers. Thus, while the Danforth bill might increase the salaries and
employment prospects of minority engineers and doctors, it would do so
at the expense of high school dropouts struggling to climb up the
employment ladder.
<P>
      Empowering Minorities. A more forward-looking civil rights
agenda instead would create real economic opportunities for
minorities. Reduced taxes on low-income Americans and on businesses
would create more job opportunities. Removing government restrictions
and high taxes on small - and medium-sized enterprises in the inner
cities, through enterprise zones, would promote business creation in
areas where there are high concentrations of disadvantaged Americans.
And allowing parents to choose the schools to which they send their
children would help ensure that future generations of poor and
minority Americans are qualified for the best jobs. Such empowerment
strategies would improve the employment opportunities of disadvantaged
workers. Quotas would not.

<title>Using Appropriations Riders to Curb Regulatory Excess -- Heritage</title>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>

The House-passed versions of several appropriations bills include a number of spending restrictions. While controversial, these limitations, commonly known as riders, in many cases are necessary to encourage federal agencies to act more responsibly in setting and enforcing regulations. They also are needed to encourage the Clinton Administration to work more assiduously with Congress to reform some of the most seriously flawed regulatory statutes.
<p>
As the Senate prepares to consider the Labor/Health and Human Services appropriations bill, and as Congress enters into a conference on other bills, including Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies, and Transportation appropriations, Members should make sure that several riders in the House-passed bills are preserved in the final legislation.
<p>
The most important deal with: <br><ul>
<li><a href="#epa"><b>EPA (VA/HUD bill)</b></a>
<p>
<li> Delaney Clause;

<b>AN IMPERFECT BUT NECESSARY SOLUTION</b>
<p>
Faced with a Congress intent on reducing unnecessary and expensive laws that cannot be justified on public health or environmental grounds, the Clinton Administration has spurned invitations to craft substantive bipartisan reform of existing law. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) have persisted in implementing new regulations that are inflexible, expensive, and largely divorced from underlying scientific and economic realities. Congress has few tools to reshape this approach to regulation. 
<p>
The most promising short-term solution is to use the appropriations process to restrict the use of government funds to pursue questionable regulations until a general overhaul of the regulatory process can be achieved. Such riders not only would cool the regulatory zeal of federal agencies, but also would encourage the Administration to show more cooperation in negotiating substantive reform.
<p>

<b>WHAT CONGRESS SHOULD DO</b>
<p>
As the Senate and House-Senate conference committees consider the VA/HUD, Labor/HHS, and Transportation appropriation bills, most of the House riders should be retained, both to prevent federal agencies from promulgating ineffective and expensive regulations and to force the White House to focus on much-needed environmental and labor reforms. While most of the riders in the House-passed bills address important areas, several are particularly important, and including them in the bills sent to President Clinton should be a top priority.
<p>

<a name="epa"></a><b>Environmental Protection Agency (VA/HUD and Independent Agencies bill)<p>

The Delaney Clause</b>
<p>
The House provision would prohibit EPA from revoking or issuing regulations under Section 409 (the Delaney Clause) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act whenever a tolerance has been established under Section 408, which addresses standards for raw foods. The rider also would prevent EPA from simply changing the Section 408 tolerance to comply with Section 409.
<p>
The Delaney Clause was enacted in 1958 to ban any additive in processed food that has been shown -- in any amount -- to cause cancer in humans or laboratory animals. This seemed reasonable in the 1950s because, depending on the chemical, scientists could test only for traces of chemicals in quantities on the order of about one in a million. Today, however, with improvements in technology, scientists can test for many of these chemicals in quantities of about one in a quadrillion (a million billion). Indeed, some can be detected almost down to the molecular level. Thus, extremely small trace quantities that were undetectable -- and thus allowable -- 37 years ago now form the basis for a court order requiring EPA to eliminate the use of dozens of pesticides even though EPA's own findings have shown these same pesticides to be safe up to certain levels. Under Section 408 of the same Act, which relates to raw agricultural commodities, EPA has issued regulations setting the tolerance level deemed safe for consumption. Yet the strict language of the Delaney Clause means that there must be no trace of these same additives in processed foods, despite the finding by EPA that these chemicals can be consumed safely in small quantities. This prohibition is an enormous and needless drain on America's agricultural economy.
<p>
Even EPA Administrator Carol Browner has called for a change in the law. In the early days of the Clinton Administration, recognizing that the law was a scientific anachronism, she said that "right now the law says we cannot have these chemicals concentrated in processed foods. We have to accept what the law is. But at the same time we have gotten to a point where we have to say we know a lot more about these chemicals than we did 35 years ago when the law was passed."1  Unfortunately, the environmental lobby applied severe pressure to the new Administration, and Browner retreated from her initial position. Nevertheless, her early remarks demonstrate the reasonableness of this rider; spending billions of dollars to ban useful, safe pesticides to avoid negligible risks is bad public policy.
<p>
<b>Wetland Enforcement</b>
<p>
As passed by the House, the wetland rider would restrict EPA from enforcing the Section 404 permitting program. The EPA relies on Section 404 of the Clean Water Act to regulate landowners who wish to disturb wetlands on their property. The House rider would restrict EPA's authority to enforce Section 404; the Senate version would limit only its authority to override Army Corps of Engineers permit decisions. While the House rider may be overly broad, and thus may have unintended consequences, the Senate version does not go far enough. In addition to including the Senate provision, the final bill should be strengthened to at least restrict EPA from regulating "non-adjacent" (isolated) wetlands. 
<p>
There are three principal problems with EPA's current wetland policies.2 
<p>
First, the statutory authority itself is questionable. Indeed, authority for "non-adjacent" wetlands seems clearly to be lacking. Obviously, EPA should not pursue policies that neither the Constitution nor federal statute allows it to pursue, and Congress should not permit it to do so. 
<p>
Second, the EPA definition of what constitutes a wetland is too broad. According to the 1987 Delineation Manual, a wetland is any land that meets each of the following criteria:  inundated or saturated to 12 inches deep for at least seven consecutive days and 5 percent of the growing season, and more than 50 percent of dominant plant species are those found in marshes or swamps regardless of whether they are found elsewhere also. The language is so unnecessarily inclusive that land which is bone dry for almost the entire year can be deemed a wetland.
<p>
Third, the financial resources of many Americans are being destroyed in the name of protecting wetlands as landowners are forced to surrender, without compensation, their right to use their property. Because many affected individuals make their living or pay their mortgages from income derived from the land, their savings can be wiped out. For example, Bill Stamp's family in Exeter, Rhode Island, has been blocked from farming or developing its 70 acres of land for eleven years, yet has been assessed taxes at rates determined by the land's industrial value -- up to $72,000 annually. As a result, this fifth-generation farm family may lose its life savings. The government, however, appears unmoved. As one Army Corps of Engineers enforcement officer told Stamp:  "We know that this is rape, pillage, and plunder of your farm, but this is our job."3
<p>
The rider would give American property owners a temporary, partial reprieve from EPA's intrusive regulation while Congress enacts a new, sensible wetlands protection measure. The reform legislation currently in Congress (but under threat of presidential veto) would make wetlands protection legal, priority-based, and fair to those now forced to shoulder the financial burdens alone.
<p>
<b>Voluntary Environmental Self-Audits</b>
<p>
This rider would prohibit EPA from taking legal action against states or companies for environmental violations discovered during voluntary self-audits and disclosed in compliance with state law. 
<P>
Companies that conduct voluntary self-audits to identify and quickly correct any inadvertent violations are required to report their findings to the EPA, which then may fine them millions of dollars for past non-compliance. This policy obviously discourages responsible behavior by companies seeking to rectify environmental problems. If this barrier to voluntary compliance is eliminated, companies will be inclined to clean up pollution more rapidly, more thoroughly, and more cheaply. Numerous companies have indicated they would perform self-audits and correct violations if the threat of prosecution was minimized. Thus, restricting EPA from punishing past inadvertent behavior would benefit both the economy and the environment.
<p>


<a name="trans"></a><b>Department of Transportation (DOT bill)</b>
<p>
<b>CAFE (Fuel Efficiency Standards)</b>
<p>
This rider would prohibit the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration from further tightening Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards. 
<p>
CAFE rules currently require each automobile manufacturer to sell cars that average 27.5 miles per gallon (mpg) and light trucks that average 20.6 mpg. Enacted in response to the oil crisis in 1973, CAFE was designed to maintain stable, low oil prices by reducing demand. The primary support for continuing the program now comes from the environmental lobby, which sees CAFE as a permanent way to conserve energy. 
<p>
Experience indicates that the program has serious unintended consequences. Tighter standards yield little if any benefit but impose tremendous social and economic costs. The social costs include the additional deaths and serious injuries caused by cars that, while fuel efficient, are less safe because they are of lighter construction. Terminating the CAFE program would save thousands of lives. According to economists Robert Crandall of the Brookings Institution and John Graham of the Harvard School of Public Health, 1989 model cars were about 500 pounds lighter than they would have been without the 27.5 mpg economy standard. Crandall and Graham estimate that this weight reduction is responsible for almost one-fifth of passenger fatalities and that the program results in an estimated 2,500 additional deaths and 25,000 additional serious injuries per model fleet year.4  This is a high price to pay for a government program that yields questionable benefits.
<p>
CAFE standards also reduce the affordability of new cars and encourage consumers to keep less fuel efficient cars for a longer time. A 1995 study by Charles Rivers Associates has found that increasing standards by 30 percent would raise the average price of cars by $1,500 and trucks by $2,100. This sticker price increase would lead consumers to keep their older, less fuel efficient autos longer, which in turn would increase pollution by an estimated 4 percent by 2010.5
<p>
Tighter CAFE standards could be devastating to average families. The reason the traditional full-size family station wagon no longer is widely sold is that car manufacturers found it difficult to meet the 27.5 mpg standard for cars with these "gas guzzlers" in their fleets. Consequently, the market for even less fuel efficient minivans exploded because minivans had to meet only the light truck standard of 20.6 mpg.6  But if standards for light trucks are raised, manufacturers will be forced to raise prices dramatically to cut sales of the minivan so that their fleet average is in compliance. Most families no longer could afford the only vehicle designed specifically for families.
<p>

<a name="labor"></a><b>Department of Labor (LABOR/HHS bill)
<p>
Ergonomics and Fall Protection</b>
<p>
These riders prohibit OSHA from developing or issuing any proposed or final ergonomics standard during fiscal 1996, and requires OSHA to revise its fall protection standard to adjust the height threshold for required fall protection equipment (e.g., railings) from 6 feet to 16 feet before it can begin enforcing the rule.
<p>
OSHA's proposed ergonomics and latest fall protection rulemakings are classic examples of how OSHA puts the search for completely risk-free workplaces above common sense. Although Congress intended that OSHA assure workers safe and healthy working conditions, overly burdensome regulations like ergonomics and fall protection present a significant barrier to job creation and increased real wages. OSHA estimates its proposed ergonomics standard will cost $4 billion per year, and the National Association of Homebuilders estimates the fall protection standard will increase the cost of a home by $1,000 to $5,000. The ergonomics standard alone is the equivalent of almost 285,000 entry-level, minimum wage jobs or 115,000 full-time jobs paying $12.14 per hour with complete benefits. Further, OSHA's draft ergonomics standard requires employers to alter work practices continuously to keep up with developments in ergonomics. It is difficult to imagine how employers can ensure compliance with a regulatory moving target without incurring substantial additional costs. 
<p>
OSHA should be looking at less costly alternatives, but it is not. A broad-based standard like OSHA's draft regulation would impose large and unnecessary costs on small business without necessarily reducing ergonomic injury and illness. OSHA's mandate to formulate an ergonomics standard is based on a subjective and unclear definition. The evidence of causation is unclear, and risk factor threshold levels are unsubstantiated. There has been too little scientific research on ergonomic disorders for anyone to know whether such research can provide adequate guidance for the development of a broad standard. 
<p>
<b>Striker Replacement</b>
<p>
This rider prohibits any executive order or rule that penalizes a contractor because it permanently replaced lawfully striking workers during fiscal 1996.
<p>
Executive Order 12954, issued March 8, 1995, requires that any federal contractor who hires permanent striker replacement workers be subject to termination of the contract or debarment. The $100,000 annual threshold effectively extends coverage to contractors receiving 90 percent of federal contracts and will raise the cost of federal contracts as employers are forced to take into account the potential cost of settling labor disputes. The Employment Policy Foundation estimates the annual economic cost of implementing the order at between $520 million and $2 billion.7  Further, the order will increase the likelihood of strike activity, hurting both union workers and employers through lost wages and output, and may discourage unionized employers from even bidding on federal contracts. It also will increase the incentive for businesses to set up nonunion subsidiaries and encourage the use of nonunion subcontractors, two moves that ultimately hurt union workers' income and job opportunities. 
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
While permanent labor and environmental policy reform should be pursued, many of the problems addressed by the House appropriations riders are so egregious that immediate relief should be granted. While these riders are an imperfect solution, Americans should view them as necessary to encourage recalcitrant federal agencies to work with Congress to reform some of the nation's most burdensome regulatory statutes.

      He has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither
      swarms of officers to harass our people, and eat out their
      substance. 
<P>
      
                      Thomas Jefferson, <BR>
                      The Declaration of Independence<P>



      What Thomas Jefferson wrote of King George III might just as
well have been written of the federal government under President
George Bush. The reason: America has experienced an enormous growth in
regulation over the last three years, due almost entirely to
legislation signed by Bush, and to the decisions of officials he has
appointed. This burgeoning red tape hinders the economy's recovery and
jeopardizes future economic progress. President Bush belatedly
recognized the explosion of re-regulation on January 28, when he
declared a ninety-day moratorium on new regulations and instructed
federal agencies to review the efficiency of old regulations. In light
of the findings that various government agencies indeed could
streamline regulations, the President extended the moratorium for an
additional 120 days.
<P>
      A slowdown in regulation is desperately needed. Under George
Bush:

    <UL> <LI> The total annual length of the Federal Register, in which all
      new regulations are published, has grown from 53,376 pages in
      1988, President Ronald Reagan's last year, to 67,716 in 1991 --
      the third highest total ever.
<P>
     <LI>The number of federal employees devoted to issuing and
      enforcing regulations has risen from 104,360 in Reagan's last
      year to a new all-time high of 124,994, surpassing the previous
      record of 121,706 under President Jimmy Carter.
<P>
      <LI>The amount of money that the federal government spends each
       year administering its regulatory programs has increased by 18
       percent under Bush, from $9.558 billion in 1988 to $11.276
       billion in 1992, measured in constant 1987 dollars.</UL>
<P>
      As a result, regulation now is costing Americans somewhere
between $881 billion and $1.656 trillion annually, or between $8,388
and $17,134 per household. By way of comparison, Americans will pay an
estimated $1.053 trillion in federal taxes in 1992, or about $10,897
per household. Thus, it is possible that the total cost of regulation
now exceeds the total cost of taxation. 
<P>
      This surge in red tape did not happen in the face of
Administration opposition. In fact, the White House is directly
responsible for a good deal of it. For one thing, much of the growth
in regulation stems from new laws that were supported and signed by
the President, including the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Civil Rights Act of 1991,
and the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990. For another,
many of Bush's appointees have been far more enthusiastic about
creating and enforcing rules than their predecessors in the Reagan
Administration. 
<P>
Example: Just days after George Bush was sworn in as President, the
Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
significantly expanded the scope of federal regulation of wetlands. As
a result, thousands of landowners were told that they could not use
their own land because federal regulators now considered it to be a
wetland protected under the Clean Water Act. 
<P>
Example: While receiving considerably less attention than the EPA,
officials in the civil rights and antitrust divisions of the
Department of Justice, and antitrust officials at the Federal Trade
Commission, have been expanding the scope of their enforcement
activities well beyond that of their predecessors in the Reagan
Administration. 
<P>
Example: The Department of Justice under Attorney General Richard
Thornburgh, and the Department of Transportation under Secretary
Samuel Skinner, seemed to go out of their way to make their
regulations under the Americans with Disabilities Act as onerous as
possible. 
<P>
      This new regulatory build-up is taking an increasing toll on the
economy. It is like a hidden tax. And just like a tax, regulation:
raises the prices paid by consumers;
<P>
      <UL><LI>lowers wages and increases unemployment;
<P>
      <LI>hurts the country's international competitiveness;
<P>
      <LI>increases uncertainty for businesses and reduces investment;   
      and
<P>
      <LI>impairs innovation.

</UL>
<P>      In large measure, the growth in regulation and its burden has
been due to a failure on the part of the President, Congress, and the
regulatory agencies to view regulation properly. In their desire to
"do good" in a particular area, they often fail to take sufficient
account of the broader consequences of their actions. Even when they
consider the costs of regulation, they generally fail to focus on the
burdens caused by regulation taken as a whole. In other words, they
fail to recognize that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.
To remedy this, government officials must avoid focusing simply on the
benefits and costs (let alone on the benefits alone) of each
particular regulation viewed in isolation; instead they must weigh the
expected benefits of each regulation against its added contribution to
the overall burden of all regulation.

<P>
THE PURPOSE OF REGULATION
<P>
      Government regulations ostensibly are intended to protect the
public. (Economists normally distinguish between "economic regulation"
and "social regulation." Economic regulation is the regulation of the
prices or quantities of the goods or services provided in a particular
industry, or of other economic factors such as the number of firms in
an industry or the freedom of firms to enter or leave an industry. The
term social regulation normally refers to regulation affecting health,
safety, or the environment, but generally can be used to describe any
regulation that is not economic. Whereas most forms of economic
regulation are industry-specific, social regulation usually applies to
many different industries.) Proponents of new regulation might claim
that they wish, for example, to protect workers from avoidable
injuries on the job, or to shield the public from pollution that could
endanger their health, or to prevent harm to consumers from defective
products. While these goals are admirable, policy makers often fail to
ask whether a new regulation will in fact accomplish its goals in the
most cost-effective manner. In particular, they may overlook less
costly ways to achieve the same result, enabling the public to gain
more protection for each dollar spent. They fail to ask whether the
costs in lost jobs or slower economic growth that result from
regulations are worth the amount of protection that accrues to the
public. And they do not fully consider market solutions that will
serve the public interest without imposing on the private sector the
heavy costs associated with traditional "command-and-control"
regulation. When examining regulations, policy makers must take
account of their full costs and impact if they are to determine
whether the regulations help or harm the public.
<P>
      The beneficial effects of much regulation are hard to find.
Economists Robert Hahn of the American Enterprise Institute and John
Hird of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst recently conducted
a survey of all existing studies on the benefits and costs of
regulation, and found only two major areas in which regulation
produces total benefits that probably exceed total costs --
environmental regulation and highway safety regulation. (Robert W.
Hahn and John A. Hird, "The Costs and Benefits of Regulation: Review
and Synthesis," Yale Journal on Regulation, Vol. 8, No. 1 (Winter
1991), p. 256.) Even in these two areas, there is strong evidence to
suggest that equal or greater benefits could be obtained at a
substantially lower cost to society.
<P>
      Uniformly Ineffective. Outside these two areas, regulation has
been found to be uniformly ineffective. For example, numerous studies
of the regulation of workplace safety by the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration have found no significant effect on accident
rates, worker injuries, or illnesses. (W. Kip Viscusi, "The Impact of
Occupational Safety and Health Regulation, 1973-83," Rand Journal of
Economics, Winter 1986, pp. 567-580; Daniel P. McCaffrey, "An
Assessment of OSHA's Recent Effects on Injury Rates," Journal of Human
Resources, Winter 1983, pp. 131-146; W. Kip Viscusi, "The Impact of
Occupational Safety and Health Regulation," Bell Journal of Economics,
1979, pp. 117-140; Robert S. Smith, "The Impact of OSHA Inspections on
Manufacturing Injury Rates," Journal of Human Resources, Spring 1979,
pp. 145-170; John Mendeloff, Regulating Safety: An Economic and
Political Analysis of Occupational Safety and Health Policy
(Cambridge, Massachusetts: M.I.T. Press, 1979).) Likewise, a 1973
study of the Food and Drug Admin-istration's drug approval process,
undertaken by University of Chicago economist Sam Peltzman, found no
reduction in the proportion of unsafe or ineffective drugs reaching
consumers. (Sam Peltzman, "An Evaluation of Consumer Protection
Legislation: The 1962 Drug Amendments," Journal of Political Economy,
September 1973, pp. 1049-1091.) Similarly, numerous studies have found
that the Consumer Product Safety Commission has had no significant
impact on product safety. (See, e.g., W. Kip Viscusi, "Consumer
Behavior and the Safety Effects of Product Safety Regulation," Journal
of Law and Economics, Vol. 28, No. 3 (October 1985), pp. 527-553; Paul
H. Rubin, R. Dennis Murphy, and Greg Jarrell, "Risky Products, Risky
Stocks," Regulation, No. 1 (1988), pp. 35-39.) The evidence indicates
that the ban on cigarette advertisements on radio and television
imposed in 1970 reduced competition between brands -- especially by
eliminating ads containing health information -- and thereby slowed
the introduction of new brands lower in tar or nicotine. (John E.
Calfee, "The Ghost of Cigarette Advertising Past," Regulation,
November/December 1986, pp. 35-45; Lynne Schneider, Benjamin Klein,
and Kevin Murphy, "Government Regulation of Cigarette Health
Information," Journal of Law and Economics, December 1981, pp.
572-612.) Similarly, there is no evidence that civil rights
legislation has increased employment opportunities for minorities or
women. With the increase in employment-related litigation and record-
keeping costs that has resulted from the legislation, it is quite
possible that civil rights laws now actually reduce employment
opportunities for all people, including minorities.

<P>
REGULATION FROM NIXON TO REAGAN
<P>
      The great explosion in federal regulation began when President
Richard Nixon created a host of new regulatory agencies, including the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (OSHA), the Consumer Product Safety Commission,
and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Nixon also
signed a number of major pieces of regulatory legislation, including
the 1970 Clean Air Act and the 1973 Endangered Species Act, and
imposed specific controls on areas ranging from to noise pollution, to
pension programs, to general wages and prices. (The core of what later
became the Clean Water Act -- the Federal Water Pollution Control Act
Amendments of 1972 -- also became law while Nixon was President, but
over his veto.) The brief Presidency of Gerald Ford continued and
expanded the red tape of the Nixon years, although Ford did remove
most of Nixon's wage and price controls.
<P>
      Jimmy Carter's record was a mixed one. Carter tightened
environmental regulations, created the Department of Energy, and tried
to impose race and sex quotas on businesses through civil rights
enforcement. Yet Carter also championed significant deregulation of
air travel, railroads, and trucking. Further, he removed restrictions
on the rate of interest that banks and other depository institutions
could pay to their depositors, and took the first important steps
toward the eventual decontrol of oil prices. 
<P>
      Ronald Reagan proposed relatively little deregulatory
legislation. His main legislative strategy was to try to block --
usually successfully, through the use or threat of his veto --
legislation that would have increased red tape and slowed economic
growth. More important, Reagan took steps to reduce the volume of
administrative rules issued by government officials. Among the most
important actions, Reagan:<P>
 <UL> Issued Executive Order No. 12291, requiring all Executive 
      Branch agencies to estimate the benefits and costs of any 
      new regulations they wished to issue;
<P>
      Designated the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs
      (OIRA) within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 
      as a central office for conducting all cost-benefit review 
      of regulations; (OIRA was created under Carter; Reagan 
      expanded its mission.) 
<P>
      Established a Task Force on Regulatory Relief, headed by 
      then Vice President George Bush; and
<P>
      Appointed to most cabinet departments and independent 
      agencies individuals who favored a reduction in regulation, 
      and significantly reduced the staffing of most regulatory
      agencies.</UL>
<P>

RE-REGULATION UNDER BUSH
<P>
      Although George Bush projects himself as an avid foe of
regulation, his Presidency has seen an enormous resurgence of
regulation.
<P>

Example: The total annual length of the Federal Register, in which all
new regulations are published, declined during the eight-year tenure
of Ronald Reagan by 33,636 pages, from an all-time high of 87,012 in
Jimmy Carter's last year, 1980, down to 53,376 in 1988. (All figures
reported in this study for the number of pages in the Federal Register
either were obtained from, or else calculated on the basis of data
provided by, the Office of the Federal Register.) In less than four
years, the annual number of pages under the Bush Administration has
risen by 14,340 pages. Last year's total of 67,716 pages was the third
highest ever, surpassed by only two of Carter's four years.

<P>
Example: The staffing level of federal regulatory agencies has
increased sharply. The number of federal employees devoted to issuing
and enforcing regulations fell by 17,346 under Reagan, from a then
record 121,706 in Carter's last year down to 104,360 in 1988. Under
Bush, however, 20,634 new bureaucrats have been added, for a new all-
time high of 124,994 regulatory employees. 
<P>

Example: The amount of money that the federal government spends each
year administering its regulatory programs also has soared. Measured
in constant 1987 dollars, federal regulatory spending grew by only
$778 million over the entire course of Reagan's two terms in office,
rising from $8.780 billion in Carter's last year to $9.558 billion in
Reagan's last year. Bush, however, has increased federal regulatory
spending more than twice as much as Reagan, and in only half as much
time. In constant dollars, regulatory spending has risen by $1.718
billion under Bush, from $9.558 billion to $11.276 billion. (All
figures reported in this study for federal regulatory staffing and
spending either were obtained from, or else calculated on the basis of
data provided by, the Center for the Study of American Business,
Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri.) 
<P>
      Some of the blame for the growth in regulation under Bush lies
with the individuals Bush has appointed. With only a handful of
exceptions, these appointees are far more prone to issue regulations
and support regulatory legislation that their Reagan predecessors. For
example, although EPA Administrator William Reilly maintains he tries
not to impose undue regulatory burdens on businesses and households,
he and his agency have been at the forefront of the regulatory build-
up during the last three years. A case in point: Just days after
George Bush had been sworn in as President, the EPA and the Army Corps
of Engineers significantly expanded the scope of federal wetlands
regulations. Land that had standing water for as little as seven days
per year could be subject to federal control as a "wetland," as could
land that was dry at the surface but moist within eighteen inches of
the surface. In some cases this meant prohibiting farmers from
planting crops on their own land and stopping home gardeners from
planting flowers. In one case a man was jailed for clearing away old
tires and putting fill dirt on his own land as a base for a garage.
(See William G. Laffer III, "Protecting Ecologically Valuable Wetlands
without Destroying Property Rights," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder
No. 840, July 15, 1991.) Likewise, officials in charge of civil rights
and antitrust at the Department of Justice, and antitrust officials at
the Federal Trade Commission, have been quietly expanding the scope of
their enforcement activities well beyond that of their predecessors in
the Reagan Administration. (See, e.g., Charles F. Rule, "Back to the
Dark Ages of Antitrust," The Wall Street Journal, June 17, 1992, p.
A17. Rule was Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust
Division at the Department of Justice from 1986 to 1989.) 
<P>
      However, the principal driving force behind the growth in
regulation over the last three years has been legislation --
legislation which in every major instance has been signed and usually
supported by President Bush. Several laws in particular have meant a
surge in new regulation.
<P>

The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments 
<P>
      Environmental regulation accounts for the largest share of the
recent explosion of regulations. Bush promised during the 1988
campaign to support a new clean air bill, and he was instrumental in
securing its passage. Estimates of the cost of the legislation vary,
but all are huge. Murray Weidenbaum, former chairman of the Council of
Economic Advisors under Reagan and now Director of the Center for the
Study of American Business at Washington University in Saint Louis,
estimates that the law "will cost an added $25-35 billion a year, over
and above the more than $100 billion [already] spent annually on all
pollution controls." (Murray Weidenbaum, The New Wave of Business
Regulation, Contemporary Issues Series No. 40 (St. Louis, Missouri:
Center for the Study of American Business, December 1990), pp. 3-4.)
Economist Paul Portney of Resources for the Future, a Washington,
D.C.-based think tank specializing in environmental issues, estimates
that the new law will cost between $29 billion and $36 billion a year
while providing only about $14 billion a year in benefits. (Paul R.
Portney, "Economics and the Clean Air Act," Journal of Economic
Perspectives, Vol. 4, No. 4 (Fall 1990), pp. 173-181.) A spokesman for
the National Federation of Independent Business, which represents
about a half-million small firms, describes the Act as "probably one
of the most complex pieces of regulation... ever passed" and has
predicted that the legislation "is going to be a nightmare for small-
business people." (Quoted in Jonathan Rauch, "The Regulatory
President," National Journal, November 30, 1991, p. 2905.)

<P>
The 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) 
<P>
      Although described as a "civil rights" bill by its supporters,
including President Bush, the ADA does much more than simply prohibit
discrimination against the disabled. It also requires owners of
private businesses, apartment buildings, restaurants, and stores to
make -- at their own expense -- various physical modifications to
their premises, such as widening doorways and installing wheelchair
ramps, in order to accommodate the disabilities of current and
potential employees, tenants, and customers. Likewise, hotels and auto
rental companies must go to the extra expense of including wheelchair
lifts on all their new pick-up vans. And similarly, public transit
systems are required to install wheelchair lifts on all new buses. 
<P>
      While discrimination against the disabled is contemptible, the
ADA has little to do with the prevention of discrimination. As the
President's Council of Economic Advisors has acknowledged, the ADA
actually is a mandated benefit program. (Economic Report of the
President (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, February
1992), pp. 272-273.) Rather than providing these benefits openly by
spending tax dollars, the government taxes Americans implicitly by
commanding private parties to spend their own money.
<P>
      As with many government regulations, it is questionable whether
the benefits that accrue to the disabled from the ADA will be worth
the cost. In the case of many enterprises or places of employment in
many parts of the country, there might be few or no disabled customers
or workers currently facing significant obstacles. In these cases,
forcing each business to spend thousands or even hundreds of thousands
of dollars to comply with the letter of the law makes little economic
sense, and in some cases may endanger the survival of the business
(See Robert P. O'Quinn, "The Americans with Disabilities Act: Time for
Amendments," Cato Institute Policy Analysis No. 158, August 9, 1991.)
Moreover, Bush Administration officials have made the ADA even more
costly than it had to be. In many instances, the implementing
regulations require particular methods of compliance even though other
methods might be far less expensive yet of greater benefit to the
disabled.
<P>
Example: Airlines will be required to modify all aisle seats on one
side or another of their planes so that people in wheelchairs will
have an easier time getting in and out of the seats -- even though, on
average, only one passenger out of every 25 flights uses a wheelchair.
Since the required modifications are expected to cost the airlines
somewhere in the neighborhood of $40 million, it would have been less
expensive for the airlines if the government simply had required them
to let passengers in wheelchairs fly free-of-charge in the first class
section, whose seats already can accommodate a person with a
wheelchair.
<P>
Example: The Act requires all new buses purchased by public transit
systems to be equipped with wheelchair lifts. Thus will raise the
price of a new bus by about $15,000, and will raise the cost of
operating and maintaining each bus in a transit system's fleet by
about $5,000 per year. Since the vast majority of riders do not use
wheelchairs, it probably would be cheaper for public transit systems
to serve disabled passengers with a special fleet of mini-vans
equipped with the necessary lifts, which could then give the disabled
passengers door-to-door service. (See Nancy Traver, "Opening Doors for
the Disabled," Time, June 4, 1990, p. 54.)
<P>
      While difficult to calculate, the cost of the ADA may even
approach that of the 1990 Clean Air Act. Whether or not the ADA ends
up surpassing the Clean Air Act in cost will depend entirely on how it
is enforced, and the statute gives the regulators enormous leeway.
(See O'Quinn, op. cit., for a good discussion -- with many specific
examples -- of how open-ended the ADA is.) According to Chicago-based
economic consultant Robert Genetski, the required physical
modifications of office buildings and hospitals alone may cost some
$65 billion. And that figure does not take into account other huge
costs, such as the costs of equipping trains, buses, rental cars,
restaurants, hotels, or other public facilities. (Robert Genetski,
"The True Cost of Government," The Wall Street Journal, February 19,
1992, p. A18.) In addition to the direct cost of all these
modifications, the Act is certain to foster an enormous amount of
costly litigation.

<P>
The 1991 Civil Rights Act 
<P>
      Ostensibly an attempt merely to restore civil rights law to
where it stood before a series of Supreme Court decisions in 1988,
this legislation radically changed federal employment discrimination
law. It made it easier for employees to sue employers, harder for
employers to defend themselves successfully -- even when they are
innocent of any actual discrimination -- and more expensive for
employers when they lose cases. The new law allows the proportion of
workers of various races in an employer's work force to be used as
prima facie evidence of discrimination, and the employer must prove
that he is innocent rather than the plaintiffs proving that he is
guilty. (See William G. Laffer III, "Why Kennedy-Hawkins Will Mean
Quotas," Heritage Foundation Issue Bulletin No. 159, July 2, 1990;
William G. Laffer III, "Why the So-Called 'Civil Rights' Bill Would
Still Mean Quotas," Heritage Foundation Executive Memorandum No. 302,
June 3, 1991; William G. Laffer III, "The Danforth 'Compromise':
Another Quota Civil Rights Bill," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder
Update No. 168, October 7, 1991.)
<P>
      The additional costs due to litigation and fines will act like a
tax on employment. With each new job an employer creates, his record-
keeping burdens and chances of being sued will increase. (In order to
be able to defend themselves in the event that they are sued, most
employers now keep detailed records on the race and sex of all job
applicants. Such records became even more important for an employer to
have after Congress enacted the Civil Rights Act of 1990, yet
employers would not have to keep them at all were it not for the civil
rights laws.) Even if an employer tries to avoid litigation by using
quotas for minorities and women, he can never completely eliminate the
risk of being sued over the racial composition of his work force.
Moreover, an employer who uses quotas risks being sued for deliberate
discrimination by those whom the quota excludes. And even if the
employer is lucky enough not to be sued, his work force will be less
productive because he was forced to hire by race and sex instead of
merit. Thus, no matter which way an employer turns, the cost of
creating jobs and employing people will have risen. The end result of
the new "civil rights" law is unambiguous: It will cost the economy
jobs, lower wages, and make American firms less competitive. 

<P>
Other Regulatory Burdens
<P>
      Other legislative initiatives signed by Bush include the 1989
increase in the federal minimum wage, the Nutrition Labeling and
Education Act of 1990, the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990, and
increased authority for the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). When
all of Bush's regulatory initiatives are added together, and combined
with the increased staffing and budgets at the various federal
regulatory agencies and the new, more vigorous and far-reaching
enforcement policies that have been adopted by so many of Bush's key
appointees, it becomes clear that Bush is responsible for an enormous
increase in federal regulation. Indeed, according to a National
Journal article entitled "The Regulatory President," American business
under George Bush has experienced "the most imposing over-all
extension of regulatory authority since Nixon." (Rauch, op. cit., p.
2905.)

<P>
TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE
<P>
      There have been several bright spots in the battle against
regulation during Bush's term. Shortly after he was inaugurated, for
example, Bush created the Council on Competitiveness, headed by Vice
President Dan Quayle. The Council's task is to review major new
regulations with a view toward reducing the burden of regulation where
possible, and to act as a referee when different Executive Branch
agencies disagree. 
<P>
      The Council's staff, however, is quite small. Thus it is able to
review only a handful of the annual flood of regulations that the
Executive Branch issues. Last year, for example, the Council was
actively involved in drafting only some fifty to sixty regulations,
whereas the total number of regulations issued by agencies within the
Executive Branch was on the order of 2,000 to 3,000. (Rauch, op. cit.,
p. 2902. In addition, many regulations are issued each year by
independent agencies which are not part of the Executive Branch and
hence are not directly answerable to the President or the Council on
Competitiveness.) Moreover, even when the Council does review an
issue, it often must deal with agency personnel who resent having
their power to manage the economy questioned or curtailed. Lack of
cooperation and sometimes outright resistance on the part of agencies
make the Council's task even more difficult and limit its
effectiveness.
<P>
      Bad Advice. Another source of dashed expectations is OMB's
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), the agency
responsible for ensuring that new regulations do not cost more than
the benefits they provide. Despite the urging of his most loyal
advisors, including Vice President Quayle, White House Counsel C.
Boyden Gray, and Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors Michael
Boskin, President Bush has failed to give OIRA the support it needs to
assure that regulations impose the least burden on the economy.
Instead, Bush listened to OMB Director Richard Darman, the same
advisor who persuaded the President to break his solemn "no new taxes"
promise to the American people, and has refused to appoint a permanent
head of OIRA. Because Bush has not given OIRA the support it needs,
OIRA has been preoccupied with defending itself against congressional
attacks instead of taking the offensive against onerous regulation.
(William G. Laffer III, "Muzzling OIRA: An Attempt to Thwart Bush's
War on Regulations," Heritage Foundation Executive Memorandum No. 304,
July 15, 1991.)
<P>
      Some Constructive Reforms. Recognizing the burden that
regulation places on the economy, George Bush announced this January
28 a ninety-day moratorium on most new regulations that could hamper
economic growth. As part of the moratorium, regulatory agencies were
instructed to evaluate their existing regulations and to devise
initiatives that would streamline regulation and create jobs and
economic growth. A few agencies announced constructive reforms during
that period. The Food and Drug Administration, for example, proposed
to expedite somewhat its procedures for approving new drugs, and the
Securities and Exchange Commission has taken steps to make it easier
for smaller businesses to raise capital by selling stock. But as the
magnitude of the regulatory crisis became apparent, the original
ninety-day moratorium was extended an additional 120 days, through the
end of August. 
<P>
      There is only so much that a moratorium of this sort -- focused
mainly on new regulations -- can accomplish. While less new red tape
is, of course, a relief for business, the regulations put into place
during the last three years continue to burden the economy.
Unfortunately, since most of these new regulations have been mandated
by legislation, which the President signed, they cannot now be
repealed except with the unlikely cooperation of Congress.

<P>
THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF GROWING REGULATION
<P>
      Although the amount of money that the federal government spends
each year to administer its regulatory programs -- nearly $13.6
billion for 1992 -- is one of the costs of regulation, it is trivial
in comparison with the costs imposed on businesses, private citizens,
and state and local governments. For example, a ban on a particular
product may cost very little to enforce, and may even entail very
little in the way of direct compliance costs for the private sector,
such as paperwork requirements or litigation. Yet the full economic
cost of the ban might be very heavy in terms of higher prices and
reduced choices for consumers.
<P>
      In order to gauge the true cost of regulation, as well as any
increases or decreases in that cost over time, policy makers must look
at the full range of effects each regulation has, not just at the
direct enforcement and compliance costs. No regulation can be
evaluated properly in isolation. Like two harmless chemicals that when
mixed create a dangerous explosive, two moderately harmful regulations
can result in serious economic damage. The existence of other
regulations can make any new regulation more costly than it otherwise
would have been. Likewise, adoption of additional regulations can make
previously existing regulations more costly than they were before.
Thus, the true cost to be considered and weighed against any potential
benefits is not the cost that a new regulation would impose in
isolation, but the addition that it would make to the burden caused by
all regulations taken together. 
<P>
      When regulations are viewed as a whole rather than in isolation,
they are seen to act as a hidden tax. This tax takes the form of such
things as compliance expenditures, time lost due to paperwork
requirements, delays in the processing and issuance of permits
required by government, and attorney fees incurred in regulation-
related litigation. 
<P>
      Just like any other tax, moreover, regulation imposes broad
economic costs on Americans. Among the most important economic
consequences:
<P>
 <UL> Regulation raises prices paid by consumers and thereby 
      lowers living standards.</UL>
<P>
      Regulations impose substantial compliance costs which must be
borne by someone. These costs are borne in part by businesses'
employees and stockholders. To some extent, however, businesses pass
these costs on to their customers in the form of higher prices.
Regulatory costs can account for a substantial portion of the total
price consumers pay for a product or service -- for example,
regulation adds up to one-third of the price of a single-engine
airplane and over 95 percent of the price of vaccines for children.
(Peter W. Huber, Liability: The Legal Revolution and Its Consequences
(New York: Basic Books, 1988), p. 3.) 
<P>
      Regulation lowers wages and increases unemployment.
<P>
      Some regulations have a direct and immediate impact on wages and
employment. The minimum wage law, federal labor laws, and federal
civil rights laws, for example, all tend to increase the cost of
employing workers and thereby decrease the levels of wages or
employment, and sometimes both. Other regulations affect wages and
employment indirectly, but just as significantly. Banking and
environmental regulations, for example, both reduce the overall level
of economic activity. Each has contributed to the current recession
and helped to cause the private sector's loss of some 1.5 million jobs
since January 1990. (David Littmann, "The Cost of Regulation, Counted
in Jobs," The Wall Street Journal, April 21, 1992, p. A16.) 
<P>
      In some instances, job losses can be attributed directly to some
regulation. Example: Many studies have proven that the federal minimum
wage law increases unemployment rates significantly, especially among
minorities and teenagers who do not yet have the skills to command a
wage higher than the legal minimum. (See, for example, Peter Linneman,
"The Economic Impacts of Minimum Wage Laws: A New Look at an Old
Question," Journal of Political Economy, Vol. 90, No. 3 (June 1982),
pp. 443-469; Daniel S. Hamermesh, "Minimum Wages and the Demand for
Labor," Economic Inquiry, Vol. 20 (July 1982), pp. 365-380; James F.
Ragan, Jr., "Mini- mum Wage Legislation: Goals and Realities,"
Nebraska Journal of Economics and Business, Vol. 17 (Autumn 1978), pp.
21-28; Robert T. Falconer, "The Minimum Wage: A Perspective," Federal
Reserve Bank of New York Quarterly Review, Autumn 1978, pp. 3-6.)
Another example: Efforts to protect the spotted owl under the
Endangered Species Act have cost thousands of jobs in the logging
industry and many additional jobs in communities where logging is the
principal industry.
<P>
      In most instances, however, it will not be apparent that
regulation is responsible. This is because regulation of one part of
the economy can affect all other parts as well. For example, a recent
study in the prestigious Journal of Political Economy by economists
Michael Hazilla of American University and Raymond Kopp of Resources
for the Future found that environmental regulations reduce output and
productivity in the finance, insurance, and real estate industries
even though these industries produce no pollution themselves and
require no direct investment in pollution abatement equipment. Hazilla
and Kopp found that all sectors of the economy are affected by
environmental regulations. These regulations cause the costs of such
inputs to the production process as labor, raw materials, and
electricity to rise, and cause savings, investment and capital
formation to fall. (Michael Hazilla and Raymond J. Kopp, "Social Costs
of Environmental Quality Regulations: A General Equilibrium Analysis,"
Journal of Political Economy, Vol. 98, No. 4 (1990), pp. 853-873.)
<P>
 <UL> Regulation increases uncertainty for business and 
      reduces investment.</UL>
<P>
      Regulations reduce the rate of return on investments made in the
United States and encourage firms to move overseas. Moreover, the
threat of future regulation adds to the economic uncertainty that
businesses must face, and hence discourages long-term investment. By
changing or reinterpreting the fine print of regulations, for example,
government bureaucrats, the courts, or Congress itself can destroy the
value of existing investments. Rather than risk making large
investments that regulators might make worthless in the future,
therefore, businesses have an incentive to shy away from large, long-
term investments, and to seek instead shorter-term profits.
<P>
      The steel industry, for example, is especially sensitive to
uncertainty because it requires substantial investments in physical
assets that are expected to last for fifty years or longer. But since
environmental and workplace safety regulations can have a decisive
impact on a steel plant's profitability, it is not surprising that
investment in modern equipment by American steel producers faltered in
the 1970s relative to that undertaken by their foreign competitors.
(See, for example, Arthur B. Laffer and Marc A. Miles, International
Economics in an Integrated World (Glenview, Illinois: Scott, Foresman
and Company, 1982), pp. 126-127.) 
<P>
      An additional hidden cost associated with this uncertainty is
the "political investment" many U.S. industries make in trying to
influence the certainty, scale, and share of regulation and other
government activity. Estimates of the size of this political
investment vary considerably, with most ranging between 3 percent and
12 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), or around $170 billion to
$680 billion per year. (Jonathan Rauch, "The Parasite Economy,"
National Journal, April 25, 1992, pp. 983-984.) Whatever the true
figure is, only part of it is due to regulation, and it is impossible
to tell how much; the rest consists of efforts to obtain special
favors in the tax code or a share of government spending. However, all
of this political investment represents pure waste -- nothing of value
is created by it.<P>
Regulation impairs innovation.<P>
      Regulation discourages investment in the development of new
technologies, manufacturing processes, and product designs. While this
is true to some extent of all regulations and all kinds of innovation,
certain particular regulations are especially destructive of
particular kinds of innovation. For example, the 1962 amendments to
the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act significantly complicated the
FDA drug approval process. According to several studies, this doubled
the cost of developing drugs in the United States. (See, e.g., Martin
Neil Baily, "Research and Development Cost and Returns: The U.S.
Pharmaceutical Industry," Journal of Political Economy
(January/February 1972), pp. 70-85; Henry G. Grabowski, Drug
Regulation and Innovation (Washington, D.C.: American Enterprise
Institute, 1976); William Wardell, "More Regulation or Better
Therapies?" Regulation (September/October 1979), pp. 25-33.) The
amendments reduced the number of new drugs approved each year by
nearly two-thirds, from an average of 46 new drugs per year before the
amendments to an average of only sixteen new drugs per year after the
amendments. (Steve H. Hanke and Stephen J.K. Walters, "Social
Regulation: A Report Card," Journal of Regulation and Social Costs,
Vol. 1, No. 1 (September 1990), p. 17. Although one might suppose that
the 1962 amendments merely prevented the introduction of unsafe or
ineffective drugs that previously were slipping past the FDA, the
evidence does not support this view. University of Chicago economist
Sam Peltzman has found the proportion of ineffective drugs to be the
same after the amendments as before. Peltzman, op. cit. Under the
auspices of the Council on Competitiveness, the Bush Administration
recently proposed several measures that would streamline the FDA drug
approval process. See Paul H. Rubin, "Regulatory Relief or Power Grab:
Should Congress Expand FDA's Enforcement Authority?" Heritage
Foundation Backgrounder No. 900, June 11, 1992.) Judicial regulation
through tort law also has hampered innovation and competitiveness in a
variety of industries, including the pharmaceutical industry and the
emerging biotechnology industry. (See, e.g., Peter W. Huber,
"Biotechnology and the Regulation Hydra," Technology Review, Vol. 90,
No. 8 (November/December 1987), pp. 57-65.)
<P>
 <UL> Regulation imposes especially heavy burdens on small 
      and medium-sized businesses.</UL>
<P>
      Large firms generally can absorb the cost of complying with
regulatory programs more easily than smaller firms. Small and medium-
sized firms find it more difficult to afford the high overhead costs
of processing paperwork, paying attorney and accountant fees, and
committing staff time to negotiating the federal regulatory maze.
Indeed, some well-established large corporations sometimes support
regulation because, although a new rule may raise costs for all
businesses, small competitors will be harder hit or even put out of
business. (See Ann P. Bartel and Lacy Glenn Thomas, "Direct and
Indirect Effects of Regulation: A New Look at OSHA's Impact," Journal
of Law and Economics, Vol. 28, No. 1 (April 1985), pp. 1-25; Ann P.
Bartel and Lacy Glenn Thomas, "Predation Through Regulation: The Wage
and Profit Effects of the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency," Journal of
Law and Economics, Vol. 30, No. 2 (October 1987), pp. 239-264; B.
Peter Pashigian, "The Effects of Regulation on Optimal Plant Size and
Factor Shares," Journal of Law and Economics, Vol. 27, No. 1 (April
1984), pp. 1-28; B. Peter Pashigian, "Environmental Regulation: Whose
Self Interests Are Being Protected?" Economic Inquiry, Vol. 23, No. 4
(October 1985), pp. 551-584.) Since smaller firms tend to be more
innovative and create more new jobs than large firms, the regulation-
induced bias in favor of large firms over small firms has the effect
of reducing the rate of innovation and new employment.
Regulation increases federal and state budget deficits.
    <P>  By reducing overall economic growth, regulation shrinks the tax
base and reduces the amount collected by every specific tax. Although
the amounts involved can be estimated only roughly, as explained
below, the federal and state governments would raise more in taxes
each year if the burden imposed on the economy by regulation were
lower and the economy expanding faster.
<P>

HOW REGULATION CAN REDUCE HEALTH AND SAFETY
<P>
      Although much if not most social regulation is designed to
promote health and safety, many regulations actually do just the
opposite. This is by far the most important non-economic cost of
regulation.
<P>
      Regulation can reduce health and safety and increase mortality
in a variety of ways:
<P>
Example: Federal drug-approval laws and state tort laws reduce the
availability and increase the prices of life-saving drugs and medical
treatments. (See, for example, Peltzman, op. cit.; Rubin, op. cit.,
pp. 8-9; Sam Kazman, "Deadly Overcaution: FDA's Drug Approval
Process," Journal of Regulation and Social Costs, Vol. 1, No. 1
(September 1990), pp. 35-54; Louis Lasagna, "The Chilling Effect of
Product Liability on New Drug Development," in Peter W. Huber and
Robert E. Litan, eds., The Liability Maze (Washington, D.C., The
Brookings Institution, 1991), pp. 334-359.)
<P>
Example: In order to comply with federal fuel economy standards,
automobile manufacturers have been forced to reduce the weight of
their cars. But lighter cars tend to be less safe than heavier ones.
Further, manufacturers are penalized for introducing safety features
that might add to the weight of a car. With the fuel economy standard
for automobiles at its current level of 27.5 miles per gallon, Robert
Crandall of the Brookings Institution and John Graham of the Harvard
School of Public Health calculate that between 2,200 and 3,900 more
highway deaths and some 11,000 to 19,500 more serious injuries occur
over the lifetime of each model year's cars than would have occurred
without the standards. (Robert W. Crandall and John D. Graham, "The
Effect of Fuel Economy Standards on Automobile Safety," Journal of Law
and Economics, Vol. XXXII (April 1989), pp. 111-116. A federal appeals
court recently ordered the Department of Transportation to reconsider
its 1989 decision not to lower the standard from its current level of
27.5 miles per gallon to 26.5 miles per gallon, but the current
standard will still remain in effect until the Department sets a new
standard. Competitive Enterprise Institute v. National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, 956 F.2d 321 (D.C. Cir. 1992).)
<P>
Example: A proposed law requiring a parent traveling by airline with
an infant to purchase a separate seat for the child would make air
travel prohibitively expensive for many families and induce families
to drive instead of fly. Since flying is far safer than driving, the
result would be more infant travel deaths, not fewer.
<P>
      In these, as in many other cases of well-meaning regulation that
imposes costs on a family, it is mainly the poor who suffer the
unintended side effects, because poorer families cannot afford to pay
the extra money for such things as larger, heavier cars or another
airline seat. 
<P>
      Regulation can also reduce health and safety indirectly. Many
studies have documented that mortality rates decline in wealthier
societies, because these societies have more to spend on healthier and
safer products, and on better medical care. Since regulation slows
economic growth, it tends to reduce such lifestyle improvements. In
the early 1970s, for instance, when the U.S. economy slowed and
unemployment rates rose, mortality rates rose as well. While the
relationship between regulatory costs and increased mortality is
difficult to quantify precisely, two office of Management and Budget
(OMB) economists recently surveyed the relevant literature and
estimated that one additional premature death occurs for every $1.8
million to $7.25 million of additional regulatory costs imposed on the
economy. (The existing literature on this point has been summarized in
the Federal Register, Vol. 57, No. 114 (June 12, 1992), pp.
26005-26009. See also Aaron Wildavsky, Searching for Safety (New
Brunswick, New Jersey: Transaction Books, 1988) (especially Chapter 3,
"Richer Is Sicker v. Richer Is Safer"); Daniel J. Mitchell, "The
Deadly Impact of Federal Regulations," Journal of Regulation and
Social Costs, Vol. 2, No. 2 (June 1992) (forthcoming), pp. 45-56.)
Wealthier truly is healthier. 

<P>
THE TOTAL COST OF REGULATION
<P>
      The overall cost of social regulation, which purports to protect
health and safety, has risen since the Nixon years. Limited
deregulation that took place between 1978 and 1988 in the areas of
transportation, energy, telecommunications, and banking, (Although
banks by and large have not been deregulated, the federal government
did remove its restrictions on the interest rates that banks pay to
their depositors.) did cause the cost of economic regulation to fall
for about a decade. Because the decline in the cost of economic
regulation outweighed the growth in the cost of social regulation
during this period, estimates by Thomas D. Hopkins, former Deputy
Administrator of the Office of Management and Budget's Office of
Information and Regulatory Affairs, and now a professor of economics
at the Rochester Institute of Technology, suggest that the total cost
of federal regulation fell by between 15 and 22 percent from 1977 to
1988. (These percentages were calculated based on figures provided by
Thomas D. Hopkins in "Cost of Regulation," Rochester Institute of
Technology Working Paper, December 1991, Tables 5A and 5B. An abridged
version of this paper, which does not contain the various tables,
appears in the Journal of Regulation and Social Costs, Vol. 2, No. 1
(March 1992), pp. 5-31.)
<P>
      However, because there was almost no major deregulation after
1988, the cost of economic regulation no longer is falling. Meanwhile,
the cost of social regulation, particularly in the area of the
environment, has continued rising, especially since Bush took office.
Taking economic and social regulation together, the total cost of
federal regulation has climbed by some 10 percent to 12 percent since
1988, according to Hopkins's numbers. (Ibid.) Moreover, if current
trends continue, the total cost of federal regulation can be expected
to rise by at least another 24 percent by the year 2000. (Percentages
for the year 2000 were calculated based on the figures provided by
Hopkins, ibid., supplemented by Murray Weidenbaum's estimate of the
cost of implementing the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, provided in
Weidenbaum, op. cit., p. 3.) In fact, the total cost of federal
regulation will have returned to its 1977 level by 1997 at the latest.
It may even reach this level by the end of this year, depending mainly
on how soon and how severely the regulatory costs of the Clean Air Act
Amendments and the Americans with Disabilities Act are felt.
<P>
      Enormous Cost. To be sure, the precise cost of regulation is
extremely difficult to determine. Nonetheless, combining the estimates
of different scholars suggests that the direct costs of regulation on
the economy currently amount to at least some $635 billion to $857
billion per year, or between $6,565 and $8,869 annually per household.
Even after subtracting the applicable benefits of regulation, using
the most generous estimates available, the net direct cost of
regulation is some $364 billion to $538 billion per year, or between
$3,762 and $5,561 annually per household. These figures include the
costs to businesses and consumers of complying with environmental and
other social regulations, the total cost to consumers in the form of
higher prices and reduced choices due to economic regulations, the
costs imposed by government paperwork requirements, administrative
costs due to federal regulation of health care, and the direct costs
imposed by state tort law. These figures even include cost estimates
for two types of economic regulation which past studies have omitted
due to a lack of data -- banking regulation, and regulation of
electric utilities, although the estimates for banking regulation
still omit some important kinds of banking regulation. (In particular,
the cost estimates for banking regulation still do not account for the
costs of geographic restrictions, restrictions on banks' products,
services and investments, or minimum capital requirements.)
<P>
      These figures also include a range of estimates for the cost of
the Clean Air Act Amendments and the Americans with Disabilities Act.
They do not, however, take account of the 1989 increase in the federal
minimum wage, the 1991 Civil Rights Act, the 1990 Nutrition Labeling
and Education Act, the 1990 Pollution Prevention Act, or the increase
in antitrust enforcement activity by the Justice Department and the
Federal Trade Commission. (In fact, these figures do not include any
estimate at all of the costs or benefits of antitrust or civil rights
laws, even aside from recent statutory or enforcement policy changes.)
Nor do they include the cost of federal government mandates on state
and local governments, or of most forms of state or local regulation.
<P>
      Most important, the cost estimates given do not include any of
the indirect, dynamic effects of regulation. In particular, the
figures do not include any estimate of the reduction in productivity
and output caused by the direct costs, or of the impact of regulation
on technological innovation. While the productivity effects are
difficult to quantify and the effect on innovation is impossible to
quantify, a number of studies suggest that, taken together, the
indirect costs due to reduced productivity and innovation probably are
greater than the direct costs counted above. (See, e.g., Hazilla and
Kopp, op. cit.; Dale W. Jorgenson and Peter J. Wilcoxen,
"Environmental Regulation and U.S. Economic Growth," Rand Journal of
Economics, Vol. 21, No. 2 (Summer 1990), pp. 314-340. Both studies
show that reductions in labor supply, savings and investment, growth
in the capital stock, and output tend to accumulate over time. As a
result, under each study the total costs imposed by environmental
regulation end up being more than twice as large as the direct
compliance costs alone. Indirect support for the notion that total
costs are probably at least twice as large as direct costs,
conventionally measured, is also provided by a number of studies cited
by Hahn and Hird, op. cit., pp. 255-258, dealing with economic
regulation in the transportation sector. As the comparison shows,
estimates of the costs of transportation regulation made before the
partial deregulation that occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s
were consistently and substantially below the levels of benefits that
were observed in the aftermath of deregulation.)
<P>
      Assuming instead that the indirect costs only amount to
somewhere between 50 percent and 100 percent of the direct costs, it
appears that the total cost of regulation, excluding those categories
already noted, and net of all benefits, could be anywhere between $811
billion and $1.656 trillion per year, or between $8,388 and $17,134
annually per household. (Although a regulatory cost estimate ranging
between 14.3 percent and 29.2 percent of total Gross Domestic Product
may seem high at first blush, it is actually quite plausible. Between
one-half and two-thirds of whatever figure one uses represents an
estimate of the amount by which GDP would have been greater, in the
absence of all unnecessary costs of regulation, than it actually will
be, and a considerable portion of the remainder represents losses that
are not currently counted in GDP because they do not involve market
transactions, such as the time spent preparing one's own tax return,
or in an airplane waiting to take off or land because federal
regulations do not allow airports to charge market-based takeoff and
landing fees. Thus, the percentage of currently recorded GDP that is
attributable to regulatory costs is much smaller than these estimates
might at first appear to suggest.)
<P>
      The additional cost of between $447 billion and $1.118 trillion
per year represents the amount by which Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
would exceed its current level ($5.672 trillion in 1991) in the
absence of all unnecessary costs due to state and federal regulation.
(Insofar as some types of regulation -- environmental regulation in
particular -- produce benefits as well as costs, one may not simply
assume that all of the costs of regulation can be eliminated. However,
even where existing regulations may produce benefits that exceed
costs, it often appears that the same or even greater benefits could
be obtained at a significantly lower cost by using better-designed,
more efficient forms of regulation. Consequently, in calculating the
foregoing figures, wherever a regulation appeared to produce net
benefits, no cost was counted except the difference (if any) between
the actual cost imposed by the regulation in question and the lower
cost that would be incurred under a more efficient regulatory scheme.
Because the necessary costs of benefit-justified regulation were
omitted in calculating net costs, so were the benefits. By definition,
the benefits of the regulations in question could have been obtained
without incurring the costs that were counted here. Under this
approach, the only benefits that need to be subtracted from costs are
the benefits of regulations whose benefits are less than costs.) Some
20 percent of this additional GDP, or approximately $83 billion to
$216 billion, would go to the federal government as increased tax
revenue, thus reducing the federal budget deficit.
<P>
      As noted previously, the cost figures just presented were net of
all applicable benefits. It is important to realize that economists
count transfers from one group to another as benefits as well as
costs. Thus, for example, if import restrictions on sugar cost
consumers $10 billion per year but enrich American sugar growers by $8
billion per year, economists treat the $8 billion as a benefit and
subtract it from the $10 billion gross cost to obtain a net cost of $2
billion. If transfers are not subtracted as benefits, then the total
cost of regulation works out to somewhere between $1.056 trillion and
$1.969 trillion per year, or between $10,922 and $20,376 per
household. By way of comparison, Americans will pay an estimated
$1.053 trillion in federal taxes in 1992, (This figure represents
total estimated federal tax receipts for 1992, net of refunds, income
from trust funds, earnings of the Federal Reserve System, and other
miscellaneous receipts. See Budget of the United States Government:
Fiscal Year 1993 , Supplement (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government
Printing Office, February 1992), Part Five, Tables 2.1 and 2.5.)or
about $10,897 per household. Although these estimates are subject to
considerable uncertainty, it is quite possible that the total cost of
regulation now exceeds the total cost of taxation. (Even if one
subtracts transfers and only compares efficiency losses, counting the
burden of tax-related paperwork under taxation rather than regulation,
it still turns out that regulation may now be more costly than
taxation.)

<P>
CONCLUSION<P>

      The U.S. economy is being strangled by new regulation, much of
which has come into being during George Bush's term of office. As a
result, the total cost to the economy of state and federal regulation
actually may now exceed the total cost of taxation. 
<P>
      In large measure, the growth in regulation and its burden has
been due to a failure on the part of the President, Congress, and the
regulatory agencies to consider the full cost of regulation. In their
desire to do good in a particular area, policy makers often fail to
take sufficient account of the broader consequences. Even when they
consider the costs of regulation, generally they fail to focus on the
burdens caused by regulation taken as a whole. 
<P>
      Much More Needed. Although President Bush often complains about
the burden placed on the economy by excessive regulation, only Richard
Nixon in the last two decades has done more to add to this burden.
Bush, however, is to be congratulated on his moratorium on new
Executive Branch regulations. This is a necessary first step in coming
to grips with the regulatory crisis. But much more needs to be done.
Bush should seek more resources for Vice President Quayle's
Competitiveness Council. And he should appoint a dynamic, activist
deregulator to head the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.
Finally, he should highlight the many ways that the public health and
safety can be protected without the heavy hand of government.
<P>
      As the world becomes more economically integrated, and as
countries in Latin America and in the former communist bloc join the
ranks of the world's free market economies, American businesses will
face ever increasing competition. The U.S. no longer can afford to
cripple its enterprises with costly and unnecessary regulations.

    The Los Angeles riots have triggered demands for fundamental
reform of many policies affecting poor, inner-city neighborhoods. One
of the most pressing is education. In south-central Los Angeles, like
most inner-city communities, children today are consigned to an
extensive public school system which fails to educate them. That lack
of a basic education in most cases holds back those children for the
rest of their lives, condemning them to low-wage jobs or
unemployment. 
<P>
    The good news for these children and their parents is that the
Bush Administration authored legislation last year that was intended
to achieve fundamental education reform by "reinventing" the American
school system. The America 2000 proposal centers on parental choice,
national testing, and a program creating new kinds of schools.
<P>
    The bad news for inner-city children, and indeed for all American
children, is that one year later the reform package is facing fierce
opposition on Capitol Hill. In January the Senate stripped the
legislation of its most significant reform provisions, most notably
school choice. The America 2000 proposal is about to be taken up in
the House, where hostility to the core provisions is, if anything,
greater than in the Senate.  
<P>
    If poor Americans are to have the chance of a good education, the
Administration must regain the ground it has lost in the debate. This
requires George Bush to stand fast and fight much harder for his
America 2000 proposal, especially the key parental choice provisions.
If it is to succeed, the Administration must:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Strongly support certain proposed floor amendments to committee-
    passed legislation, most notably the amendment authored by Dick
    Armey, the Texas Republican, which revitalizes the school choice
    initiatives.
<P>
    Threaten to veto any legislation that omits central elements of
    the Administration's original reform package, such as school
    choice.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B> America 2000</B>
<P>
    President Bush's original America 2000 proposal contained four
central themes:
<P>
1)       Getting better and more accountable schools, through
         parental choice, national testing, and alternative
         certification (Alternative certification means allowing
         individuals without education degrees to become certified
         teachers, provided they have appropriate experience or a
         degree in their field.);
<P>
2)       Creating a new generation of American schools by encouraging
         schools that "break the mold" by offering alternative
         educational programs;
<P>
3)       Producing a nation in which families and communities help
         encourage students to learn by instilling respect for
         education, competence, and academic performance; and 
<P>
4)       Creating communities in which learning can happen, by
         increasing parental and community involvement in education
         reform.
<P>
    The President's America 2000 strategy also incorporated national
education goals to make Americans more competitive in the world
economy. These goals include the achievement of specific academic
standards, new curricula for American schools, a system of voluntary
national examinations, and more flexibility for public school teachers
and principals.
<P>
<B> Hill Action</B>
<P>
    The Administration sent its America 2000 package to Congress last
fall, after announcing the outline of the package in April. But
instead of incorporating the proposal's main features in a new
education bill, the House Education and Labor Committee last October
reported out H.R. 3320, which largely ignored the President's
strategy. Not to be outdone, the Senate this January passed S. 2,
which also failed to incorporate the most significant aspects of the
President's plan, and did little more than authorize $850 million for
a new block grant for school experiments effectively controlled by the
education establishment. 
<P>
    The Senate bill is severely flawed. Because of unwise concessions
by the Administration, the legislation contains only watered-down
provisions for creating "New American Schools," the experimental,
"break the mold" schools, intended to test innovative programs and
approaches to education, and it allows little regulatory flexibility
for teachers and administrators. In fact, the Senate bill is largely a
triumph of bureaucratic process over substance. 
<P>
    Worst of all, the Senate rejected even a very modest version of
the Administration's school choice proposal.The defeated amendment,
designed by the Administration and Senator Orrin Hatch, the Utah
Republican, would have authorized a three-year demonstration project
granting $30 million each year in education vouchers to help low-
income parents send their children to quality private schools, and it
would have provided a $5 million grant to each of six low-income
communities selected nationally to create pilot programs offering low-
income students in the community their choice of area public or
private schools.
<P>
    While very small, when compared with the total federal education
budget of $32.3 billion, these choice provisions would give low-income
parents the financial means to opt out of their failing public school
-- a choice which middle and upper income families already have -- and
allow their children to be educated in another school. This small
demonstration program simply would give school choice supporters an
opportunity, on a limited trial basis, to show that choice works. But
as a result of intense pressure from the education bureaucracy,
particularly the teacher and school administrator unions, the Senate
refused to sanction an experiment with choice.
<P>
    Likewise, the committee-passed House bill contains no choice
provisions. Representative William Ford, the Michigan Democrat and
Chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee, announced in
February that he would not bring the House bill containing portions of
the Bush Administration's education proposals (H.R. 3320) to the floor
for a vote. Instead, the House will consider a committee-authored bill
(H.R. 4323), which explicitly bans federal funding of private school
choice programs. It actually scales back existing community
involvement in improving local schools and gives more control to
public school boards, who in the past have had little interest in
serious innovation. H.R. 4323 also could hinder choice legislation at
the state level by sending a signal from Washington that choice is
unacceptable, and also by prohibiting the use of federal funds, which
often are used to pay for state pilot programs involving private
school choice. At the end of last year's legislative session 23 states
had some type of choice plan, and well over half gave consideration to
choice legislation. (School Choice Programs:  What's Happening in the
States, compiled and edited by Jeanne Allen with Angela Hulsey, The
Heritage Foundation, March 1992.) Significantly, efforts to promote
choice at the state level have been led by teachers and business
leaders as well as parents.
<P>
    The bill calls for a $700 million federal block grant program
which would be spent as the state and local bureaucracies saw fit as
long as it did not go toward choice programs involving private
schools. Vague descriptions of authorized activities would permit
practically any fad the education bureaucracies want to fund, without
any kind of accountability to parents. H.R. 4323 also contains
provisions aimed at "addressing disparities in expenditures and the
reasons for such disparities among local educational agencies in each
state and among states across the nation." These latter provisions
reflect the assumption that the way to improve schools in poor
communities is to make sure that school spending is equal throughout
the country. Yet numerous studies show that there is no significant
correlation between spending and school quality. (See John Chubb and
Terry Moe, Politics, Markets, and America's Schools (Washington, D.C.: 
The Brookings Institution, 1990).)
<P>
<B> The Armey Amendment</B>
<P>
    In an effort to correct the shortcomings of H.R. 4323,
Representative Dick Armey, the Texas Republican, plans to offer a
floor amendment to H.R. 4323. The amendment goes a long way toward
restoring the original content of the President's America 2000
proposals. The amendment: 
<P>
1)       Limits the use of the $700 million in new funds to projects
         based on school choice, site-based management, alternative
         teacher certification, merit testing, and New American
         Schools; <P>
2)       Allows the Secretary of Education to deny grants to
         activities which in his view will not promote reform in
         education; and<P>
3)       Gives state governors, not teachers and school
         administrators, the authority to head the panels charged
         with determining the use of federal grant money. 
<P>
    The Armey amendment explicitly allows private, parochial, and
public schools to be included in choice experiments and earmarks a
minimum of 25 percent of program funds for these initiatives. The
White House Choice
<P>
    America 2000 advocates the use of federal funds to stimulate
state and local level reforms based on choice and other promising
approaches. Congress, however, is transforming the plan into yet
another education spending bill aimed at propping up a government
school monopoly that is ruining American public schools and failing to
educate American children. The results so far of such congressional
"business as usual" education policies: Federal education spending at
all levels of government has increased over 25 percent since 1989, yet
test scores have fallen. 
<P>
    So far, the Administration has shown a desire to compromise on
its original proposal while the Senate and House tears it to shreds.
White House dithering merely encourages Hill opposition. As the
legislative disaster in the Senate was unfolding, the President
rightly threatened to veto any bill that did not contain education
choice provisions. But after the Senate passed a bill explicitly
rejecting choice, the Administration backpedaled and announced that it
was "reevaluating" its own position. Now, with the House legislation
soon facing a vote, opponents of major reform take comfort in the fact
that the Administration has neither issued an explicit veto threat
against H.R. 4323, although Education Secretary Lamar Alexander has
recommended such a veto, nor even indicated that it will support the
Armey Amendment on the House floor. The "Education President,"
opponents understandably conclude, seems prepared to give up on real
education reform without a fight. 
<P>
<B> Conclusion
</B><P>
    The Bush Administration has an historic opportunity to improve
American education. But the President can only do this if he takes the
initiative and makes clear to friend and foe alike what he really
supports and what is unacceptable. If he wishes to keep alive any
prospect of the core elements of America 2000 becoming law, he must:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Back strongly amendments for education choice and other key
    reforms when H.R. 4323 reaches the House floor, including the
    proposed Armey Amendment;
<P>
    State unequivocally that he will veto any education bill that
    does not contain education choice provisions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
    Only if the Administration draws a clear line, and forces
Congress to choose between fundamental reform and business as usual in
the schools, will inner-city children in America at last have the
chance to obtain a sound basic education.

<h3>FIXING THE WAR POWERS ACT</h3><p>

Expansion of remarks (at a Heritage Foundation symposium on May 22, 1995 by Ronald D. Rotunda) by Albert E. Jenner Professor of Law, University of Illinois College of Law.
<P>
In 1973, Congress enacted the War Powers Resolution over President Nixon's veto.1 Supporters viewed the law2 as an effort to prevent another Vietnam, while opponents saw it as an unconstitutional effort to restrict the Commander in Chief while not achieving its  well-intentioned goals.3 The law is now more than 21 years old. Like a young child growing up, it has reached its majority. Since then, liberals, conservatives, Republicans, and Democrats have all attacked the law. Former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D-ME), for example, has complained that the law simply "has not worked."  It "potentially undermines our ability to effectively defend our national interests" and "unduly restricts the authority granted by the Constitution to the President as Commander-in-Chief."4  Former President Ford agrees, calling the law both "unconstitutional" and "impractical."5  Presidents of both parties have been accused of ignoring it.6 With a pedigree like that, now is a good time to reevaluate the resolution.<p><b>Applicability of the War Powers Resolution</b>The coverage of the War Powers Resolution is broad, encompassing essentially every situation involving combat troops. Like most laws, it is written in the style of the Internal Revenue Code or the Treaty of Westphalia. Its intricate prose states that, unless there has been a declaration of war, the law applies to every case where the President introduces "United States Armed Forces into hostilities, or into situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances, and to the continued use of such forces in hostilities or in such situations."7  In other words, the law applies to virtually everything.<p>	Declarations of War. The exception for declarations of war means, in effect, that there are no exceptions, because no major power has declared war since World War II. Of course, the intervening years have witnessed major undeclared wars (the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Gulf War are obvious examples), as well as relatively minor ones (e.g., Panama,  Grenada, Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia).
<P>
	While our Constitution provides that only Congress can "declare war," the framers of our Constitution specifically rejected a proposal that would give to Congress the power to "make" war.8 Instead, the framers made the President the Commander in Chief, and the decision to seek a declaration of war became a political question for Congress to resolve. A declaration is an escalation of the war effort; in only a few circumstances has Congress taken that symbolic step. It is too late in our history to argue that there can be no war unless the war is officially "declared."  Since our Declaration of Independence, our country has been in about 200 armed conflicts, while we have declared war only seven times. Not even the Civil War, the bloodiest in our history, was a declared war.9<P>	Situations that Develop into Hostilities. The War Powers Resolution also applies to "the continued use of such forces in hostilities or in such situations."  Thus, if U.S. troops are     already stationed in an area where there are no imminent hostilities, but then we are attacked, we have a situation where there is the "continued use of such forces in hostilities or in such situations."<P>	In short, the War Powers Resolution applies to everything that involves hostilities or that develops into hostilities. In our uncertain world, that covers a great deal.
<P>

<b>When the President Can Use Combat Troops Short of a Declaration of War
</b><p>
Three major parts of the War Powers Resolution merit specific emphasis. First, there is section 1541(c), entitled "Presidential Executive Power as Commander In Chief; Limitation."  It states that the President's constitutional power to introduce U.S. combat troops is limited to only three circumstances:  "(1) a declaration of war, (2) specific statutory authorization, or (3) a national emergency created by attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces."10<p>	This section provides that the President is not allowed to send U.S. troops into combat unless Congress specifically gives advance approval; the only exception is if the President is responding to a national emergency created by an attack on U.S. territory or on U.S. armed forces.11 Even then, the President must report to Congress immediately and then "terminate any use" of the troops within 60 days unless Congress specifically approves of further action.12<P>	Our history demonstrates that there are many other situations where Presidents have the constitutional authority to act. For example, the President may use the military to rescue U.S. citizens abroad, to rescue foreign nationals when that directly facilitates the rescue of our citizens abroad, to protect U.S. embassies abroad, to implement a cease-fire involving the United States, or to carry out the security commitments in a treaty.13 The War Powers Resolution, oddly enough, does not even include the right of the President to deter an imminent attack on the United States. Section 1541(c) only covers the situation where there has been an actual attack!  Professor John Hart Ely admits that "it truly is impossible to predict and specify all the possible situations in which the president will need to act to protect the nation's security before he has time to obtain congressional authorization."14<P>	Over the years Presidents have justified military action without the specific consent of Congress, relying on various theories not found in the War Powers Act.15 President Roosevelt sent troops to Iceland and Greenland in 1940, although federal legislation appeared to forbid it.16 President Johnson initially justified sending Marines to the Dominican Republic to protect U.S. citizens; later Johnson relied on the Rio Treaty. President Clinton involved the military in Haiti without seeking congressional approval.<P>
	After the enactment of the War Powers Resolution, Presidents have simply ignored the strict limits of this section, as illustrated by incidents such as the Mayaguez rescue and the  invasion of Grenada. Moreover, the American people (particularly our citizens abroad) would not want a President to follow this section:  To do that would assure unfriendly      governments and terrorists that American embassy personnel, tourists, and other American nationals abroad are all fair game, unprotected by the world's only superpower. This section should simply be repealed.17<P><b>The Reporting Obligation</b><P>Various sections of the law impose specific reporting obligations on the President. In   general, the "President in every possible instance shall consult with Congress before" introducing troops into imminent hostilities and shall also consult with Congress regularly after the introduction of combat troops.18 The President must also submit a detailed written report to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate within 48 hours after the introduction of combat troops.19<P>	In a democracy, it is essential that the President consult with Congress and the American people and report what he is doing. If the American people are being asked to send their sons and daughters into combat, the President should honestly explain why. Granted, there will be some circumstances when it may be more difficult to report to particular congressional leaders. President Ford, in referring to the evacuation of Danang in April 1975, illustrated the problem:
<P><blockquote>
	Congress was in a congressional Easter recess. Not one member of the key bipartisan  leaders of Congress was in Washington. [H]ere is where we found the leaders of Congress. Two were in Mexico. Three were in Greece. One was in the Middle East. One was in Europe, and two were in the People's Republic of China. The rest were found in 12 widely scattered States of the Union.20<P></blockquote>	On the other hand, the law does not demand the impossible. The requirement of prior consultation only applies if it is "possible" to do so.21 The requirement of subsequent consultation is similar. The law only obligates the President to consult "regularly with Congress" while our armed forces are in combat situations.22 After he introduces troops, he must submit, within 48 hours, a written report to the House Speaker and the Senate President Pro Tempore explaining why he introduced the military, what authorized him to do so, and what is his estimate of the scope and duration of hostilities.23 <P>	 This basic principle is a sound one. The President has the responsibility, in any democracy, to justify his actions to the American people in a candid way. Many of the explanations of our Vietnam policy were not candid, as Robert S. McNamara's recent memoirs acknowledged.24<P><b>Automatic Withdrawal of U.S. Troops and the Legislative Veto</b><P>Section 1544(b) of the War Powers Resolution requires that "the President shall terminate any use of United States Armed Forces" at the end of the 60-day period unless Congress has either declared war or enacted a law specifically authorizing the use of this force.25 In short, if Congress does nothing, within 60 days (or sometimes 90 days), the President must withdraw the troops. As one supporter of the War Powers Resolution explains this provision, "the president's authority to act in emergencies simply runs out in 60 days if Congress does nothing."26<P>	Presidents and Congress have responded to this section by simply ignoring it. (Congress, for example, did not think that the 60-day clock should start running during the naval war against Iran in 1987-1988.27) Yet, its existence remains important. The inelegantly phrased language appears to give the President carte blanche authority for two months without any   serious oversight.28 It also allows the executive and legislative branches to blame each other for failure of will, for exercise of judgement. It obscures blame and muddies responsibility. It is better for people to know where the responsibility lies. Then we will know whom to blame, and to whom we should give kudos.
<P>
	If section 1544(b) were repealed, that would not prevent Congress from making known its view. On the contrary, Congress has always had the power to pass a concurrent resolution indicating its position on a matter. A concurrent resolution is not a law, and thus not subject to presidential veto. While this resolution does not legally bind the President, that does not make it irrelevant. If the President decided to ignore such a resolution, the people would know exactly whom to blame (or to praise) for the involvement of American combat troops. And Congress would make its will known by doing something, rather than by doing nothing. Everyone in Congress would have to stand up and be counted.
<P>
	Section 1544(c) goes beyond the prior section and creates what is known as a legislative veto. It provides that, notwithstanding the previous section, if both houses of Congress, by concurrent resolution, direct that the troops should be removed, the President must do so. This resolution, unlike a normal law, is not subject to presidential veto. Congress has always had the power to impose its will on the President by using its spending power to enact a law to limit presidential action, but a spending law would be subject to presidential veto. Section 1544(c) declares that it is not subject to veto but (unlike a normal concurrent resolution) must be treated the same as a statute.
<P>
	Section 1544(c) is known as a legislative veto because it gives Congress the right to veto presidential action. As such, scholars have concluded that it is unconstitutional ever since INS v. Chadha,29 a 1983 case that invalidated all legislative vetoes.30 While Professor John Hart Ely argues that section 1544(c) is constitutional,31 even Professor Laurence Tribe admits that this section is unconstitutional.32 The only question is whether the existence of this unconstitutional section infects the entire resolution, as some commentators have suggested.33<P><b>The Peace Powers Act of 1995</b><p>The constitutional and policy problems with the War Powers Resolution, and its apparent irrelevance to military hostilities since its enactment, have caused commentators to call for its repeal. That does not mean, however, that it should be replaced with a vacuum. People do want to avoid another Vietnam; they do want to have Congress involved; and they do want to control foreign adventurism by a President too quick to spill American blood.<P>
	Senator Dole (R-KS) and several other Senators have introduced S. 5, the Peace Powers Act of 1995. This bill continues the basic reporting requirements of the War Powers Resolution. It mandates that the President "in every possible instance shall consult with Congress before introducing" American forces into imminent involvement in hostilities.34 The proposed law also requires that the President submit a written report to the House Speaker and Senate President Pro Tempore within 48 hours after introducing or substantially increasing armed forces into a hostile situation. This written report must explain why the introduction of armed forces is necessary, what is the legislative and constitutional authority, and what is the estimated scope and duration of involvement. The President must also supply periodic reports and respond to additional requests for information.35 H.R. 1111, which is a bill that Congressman Dornan (R-CA) and others have introduced in the House, imposes similar    reporting obligations on the President.36<P>	Both bills avoid the unconstitutional legislative veto; both avoid trying to create a definitive list of circumstances where the President can use the armed forces. (Recall that Professor Ely warned that it "truly is impossible to predict and specify all the possible situations in which the president will need to act to protect the nation's security before he has time to obtain congressional authorization."37) Both avoid the situation where Congress    imposes its will by doing nothing, by failing to take action.
<P>
	And both avoid the problem of appearing to delegate to our court system important    questions of national policy. As Dr. Morton H. Halperin has noted, one of the major problems with the War Powers Resolution is that it has led to legal line drawing by the executive branch:  "What you don't need is a legal opinion from your lawyers that you have not yet crossed some line drafted in a statute about how imminent the hostilities are."38<P>	The proposed Peace Powers Act also deals with an issue that Congress never really thought about in 1973:  placing United States armed forces under foreign command. The United States has joined United Nations peacekeeping activities in the past, but it is only in recent times that the President has chosen to place U.S. troops under foreign command. The concern of many people is that foreign commanders may be more willing and ready to spend American blood than to spend the blood of their own countrymen. Just as many    people are more generous when spending other people's money, so also we might expect that foreign military commanders, if given a choice of sending their own troops or American troops in harm's way, will prefer to spill American blood.
<P>
	Consequently, Section 5 of the proposed Peace Powers Act provides that the President may not subordinate any element of the U.S. armed forces to any foreign national unless Congress enacts a law authorizing the subordination, or unless the President makes various findings and reports to various congressional committees. Sections 7 and 8 provide for prior congressional notification of proposed U.N. peacekeeping activities and require the President to identify the source of funding for these peacekeeping operations. These sections rely on Congress's spending power, which historically has been very broad.39<P>	These sections do not put the President in any straitjacket, but are designed to assure  candid consultation with Congress and the American people in matters involving foreign hostilities. In a democracy the people deserve no less. No overzealous President should involve the United States in unnecessary hostilities while avoiding congressional scrutiny. The War Powers Resolution has not worked; let us try something better:  the proposed Peace Powers Act.

<title>How To Improve the Quality of Children's Television - Heritage</title>

<center><h3>HOW TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF CHILDREN'S TELEVISION</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/thierer.htm">Adam D. Thierer</a><br>
Alex C. Walker Fellow in Economic Policy<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 450<br>
May 20, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A crusade has been underway in Congress in recent years to improve the quality of broadcast television on behalf of America's children. While obviously well-intentioned, these efforts have failed because they have preserved the current uncompetitive regulatory structure instead of allowing market competition to expand the number of new educational choices available to the average American family. But Congress now has a rare opportunity to improve the quantity and quality of children's programming by inviting a host of new competitors into the marketplace through expanded auctions of broadcast spectrum.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Unfortunately, 104 Members of Congress recently reaffirmed their commitment to the status quo when they sent a letter to the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) asking the agency to strengthen provisions of the Children's Television Act of 1990 (CTA). The problem is that the Children's Television Act actually has more to do with making work for communications industry regulators than with improving the quality of children's television. Although the Act does demand that broadcasters air more programming that "meets the educational and informational needs of children," it fails to define what that means. As a consequence, a lot of bureaucrats must spend a lot of time watching cartoons to decide what they think is "educational" and what is not.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Bureaucrats decide "Fat Albert" is educational, "The Flintstones" is not.</b> For example, according to recent FCC rulemakings, both "Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids" and "The Smurfs" are deemed "educational."  "The Flintstones" and "G.I. Joe" have not been so lucky. They have been singled out as being out of compliance with the CTA. Instead of asking the FCC to watch cartoons, Congress should ask itself whether regulators should be deciding what children watch at all. Any improvements in the quality of broadcasts in recent years can be attributed to the rise of cable and other video competitors, not edicts from Washington. Efforts such as the CTA are riddled with implementation problems and do nothing to improve the long-run quality of broadcast television. The real answer, as in the world of books and magazines, is to allow more choices and let parents decide for themselves what programs or channels are truly educational.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Washington knows best?</b>  The 104 Members of Congress who wrote to the FCC want the Commission to establish a minimum number of hours of acceptable programming per week that broadcasters must air. The letter declares that the FCC should establish a quantitative federal requirement of at least three hours of federally approved "educational" programming that private broadcasters must air each week or risk having their broadcasting licenses revoked. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While license revocation is rare in practice, it is the indirect pressure of federal oversight that counts in influencing programming. In essence, the FCC uses laws like the CTA to engage in regulatory extortion: Either firms meet the Commission's demands or they forgo marketplace opportunities which the FCC has the authority to restrict, such as a merger with another communications company.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
All of this begs the question of why Congress does not make similar demands of companies doing business in the print media marketplace. Why is it that <I>The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times</i>, and other newspapers do not have to devote three pages of their "A" sections to issues Washington bureaucrats define as "educational and informational"?  While one could argue that it is because the print media already are more focused on such issues than the more entertainment-minded broadcast industry, in reality the answer lies in seven decades worth of misguided First Amendment jurisprudence that has accorded electronic media lesser speech protections and access to markets than print media. As a consequence, laws like the CTA continue to be applied to electronically transmitted media such as broadcasting, even though they would never pass constitutional muster if applied to the print realm. Serious questions remain as to how the CTA will be enforced once most newspapers and magazines are delivered to Americans electronically.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition, such bureaucracy-enhancing efforts clearly do not complement last year's deregulatory efforts aimed at reducing federal meddling in communications markets. Instead of encouraging the FCC to expand its cultural inspections, Congress has the unique opportunity to force broadcasters to improve the quality of their programming, without infringing the spirit of the First Amendment, by launching more spectrum auctions.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Auctioning spectrum will invite more competition and improve quality.</b> Policymakers could invite greater numbers of educational and informational providers into the marketplace by auctioning off more spectrum, something Congress is now considering. Unfortunately, policymakers are about to give away approximately $10 billion to $70 billion worth of spectrum to the same broadcast industry from which they are trying to demand better programming. This means countless new, innovative educational and informational services may be kept off the market because existing broadcasters will be able to hoard large portions of new spectrum. Consequently, broadcasters will be under even less pressure to offer better quality fare to children and families. Auctioning the spectrum, by contrast, not only would bring in revenue to permit tax cuts and deficit reduction, but also would force incumbent broadcasters to air better quality children's programming to keep in step with their new rivals.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Regulations like the Children's Television Act do not benefit children and should be repealed. Intense rivalry for viewer allegiance, not more federal mandates, is the only way to improve the quality and amount of children's programming. Auction off more spectrum, and America's children will be offered the kind of quality programming they deserve and Congress desires.

<P>	   <B><FONT SIZE="+2">O</FONT></B>n New Year's Eve 1975, after an evening of taking LSD and watching cop 
shows on television, 15-year-old Raul Meza showed up at a convenience store near his 
house in Austin, Texas, armed with a deer rifle. Meza emptied the cash register, then 
marched the clerk, a 20-year-old college student named Derly Ramirez, into the walk-in 
freezer. Meza shot him in the back and left him for dead.</P>
<P>	Ramirez recovered to testify against the man who wounded him. Meza received a 
20-year sentence, and served five years before getting out on parole.</P>
<P>	On January 3, 1982, months after his release, 21-year-old Raul Meza abducted 
Kendra Page, a third-grader, as she rode her bicycle near her home in southeast Austin. 
Meza tortured, raped, and strangled the girl, then left her body behind a dumpster. Three 
days later, he surrendered to the police. Meza received 30 years for the killing.</P>
<P>	While behind bars, Meza racked up demerits for various infractions, and four 
years were added to his sentence after guards found a knife in his cell. Meza came up for 
parole seven times, and each time it was denied.</P>
<P>	By 1993, however, prison authorities could keep Meza no longer. Under Texas 
law, he had accumulated enough credit for good behavior to qualify automatically for 
release. The state freed him under mandatory supervision, a conditional release not unlike 
parole that can be granted without the consent of the parole board.</P>
<P>	No matter how notorious, most felons leave prison with little fanfare. They re-
enter society quietly and soon become anonymous. Some begin new and honest lives. 
Many others, freed from supervision and accountable to no one, commit new crimes. 
Raul Meza might have regained his freedom in the same way. But he never got the 
chance. One hundred and forty miles from Meza's Huntsville prison cell, an Austin 
newspaper editor decided to make him famous.</P>
<P>	In 15 years of covering crimes, Jerry White, the city editor of the <I>Austin 
American-Statesman</I>, had watched scores of criminals disappear from public view after 
sentencing. Most of them left prison years before their sentences expired, often to rob, 
rape, or kill again. "It became apparent," says White, "that even though these folks are 
sentenced and sent away, the story doesn't really end." White began compiling a list of 
inmates who were "fairly notorious" in Austin. Every few months, he called the 
department of corrections to ask when inmates on his list would be eligible for parole.</P>
<P>	In June 1993, the department of corrections confirmed that Meza was due to be 
released soon. Using the state's Open Records Act, the newspaper petitioned Texas's 
attorney general and found where Meza planned to live. An article ran on the front page 
of the Sunday paper eight days before Meza's release. The headline read, "`Nothing's 
Going To Stop It': Killer of 8-Year-Old About to be Freed."</P>
<P>    In a city of about 465,000 people, the story reached 240,000 homes and provoked an 
outpouring of media attention. Film crews greeted Meza as he walked out of the state 
prison and followed him for months. Publicity, mostly bad, seemed to trail him 
everywhere. Corrections officials moved him from town to town, but in each residents 
and local politicians protested his presence. Colin Amann, a Houston lawyer who 
represented the killer after his release, says angry citizens "kicked him in the butt from 
one end of Texas to the other."</P>
<P>	For much of 1993, Texans kept on kicking. Over several months, he was shuttled 
between towns and cities all over the state. Of the 276 halfway houses that were asked to 
accept Meza, 271 refused. "Every town he went to," says Amann, "people were just 
screaming and yelling. Lots of small communities went out and bitched about it. A lot. 
And it happened every time they'd move him, they had the same outcry."</P>
<P>	In August, the parole division placed Meza on his grandparents' farm, west of San 
Antonio. On August 31, local sheriffs charged Meza with "terroristic threatening" and 
disorderly conduct for bullying his elderly grandparents. A judge later dismissed the 
charges, but the incident made nearly every newspaper in Texas. At least 1,000 local 
residents signed a petition asking the state to move Meza again. The parole division sent 
him to Austin.</P>
<P>	His new neighbors protested, held rallies, carried signs. A few moved away. The 
furor subsided a bit when the father of the murdered girl publicly called for citizens to 
give Meza the chance to start a new life. He moved into his mother's house and found a 
job. In the first 10 months of 1994, the <I>American-Statesman</I> ran more than 20 stories on 
Meza. In August 1994, he was arrested for violating the curfew provision of his parole, 
and he returned to the state prison in Huntsville.</P>
<P>	At the time Meza was taken into custody, there were more than 116,000 parolees 
in Texas, 15,000 of whom had outstanding warrants for parole violations. Yet the 
governor's fugitive squad focused its energies on Meza, the most famous one. And while 
parolees in Texas routinely get three chances to break parole before being arrested, Meza 
was taken into custody after only one violation. His supporters cried foul. But the citizens 
of Texas were the better for it.</P>
<P>   Meza needed all the attention he could get. As a group, violent sex offenders have an 
extraordinarily high rate of recidivism. In Texas, about one-third of convicted rapists are 
arrested for new crimes within two years of getting out on parole. Ordinarily, parole 
officers are not able to supervise sex offenders carefully. But because they learned from 
news reports where Meza lived, neighbors were able to keep their children out of his 
path. Relentless publicity forced a troubled parole system to work effectively. And 
information disseminated by the press helped to create thousands of civilian parole 
officers--watchful neighbors who kept an eye on him.</P>
<P> 	Publicity, however, is a blunt instrument, and others were unintentionally 
bludgeoned by Meza's fame. His relatives were humiliated. His victim's parents saw their 
tragedy replayed in the press. And Meza himself was hounded across the state. Nobody 
knows how such attention may have retarded his rehabilitation, but it may not matter. 
Despite the burdens imposed on him and his family--or, more likely, because of them--
Meza did not kill another child while out of prison.</P>
<P>	Even Meza's attorney, a self-described liberal, believes the publicity was worth 
the cost. "I think everybody should know when a parolee is coming to live in their 
neighborhood," says Colin Amann. "That's why crime is committed, because people 
don't know who the criminals are. Once they get out, let's let the entire world know 
where they are going to live. Let's let the community have some responsibility for 
keeping its thumb on them."</P>
<P>	More and more communities are clamoring for that very responsibility. Meza's 
case illustrates what most people already sense: Citizens who know their neighbors will 
be safer than those who don't. Study after study has shown anonymity to be a factor in 
many crimes. Simply put, criminals are more apt to commit crimes in neighborhoods 
where they do not know the neighbors, and where the neighbors do not know one 
another. As James Q. Wilson and Richard Herrnstein explain in <I>Crime and Human 
Nature</I>, their expansive survey of criminology, "the more rapid the population turnover in 
an area, the higher the victimization rate, even after controlling for the racial and age 
composition."</P>
<P>	Conversely, close-knit communities tend to be resistant to predatory crime. A 
criminal is less likely to commit crimes where the neighbors recognize him, particularly if 
they know that he has a criminal record.</P>
<P>	Statistics explain why citizens have a vested interest in knowing who in their 
neighborhood has been convicted of serious offenses. Ex-cons commit a staggering 
amount of crime. As John DiIulio of Princeton University has pointed out, "within three 
years of sentencing, while still on probation, nearly half of all probationers are placed 
behind bars for a new crime or abscond." Nationally, recidivism for parolees is about the 
same as for probationers. DiIulio cites a revealing study of Florida convicts:</P>
<P>	"Between 1987 and 1991, about 87 percent of the 147,000 felons released from 
Florida prisons were released early. Fully one-third of these parolees committed a new 
crime. At points in time when they would have been incarcerated had they not been 
released early, these parolees committed nearly 26,000 new crimes, including some 4,656 
new crimes of violence--346 murders, 185 sexual assaults, 2,369 robberies, and 1,754 
other violent offenses."</P>
<P>	Not only are felons on supervised release dangerous, but there are a lot of them. In 
1993, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, a total of 671,000 Americans were on 
parole or probation. There is considerable evidence that many parole and probation 
officers are responsible for far more offenders than they can possibly supervise, even 
those housed under one roof. A investigation in 1993 by the <I>Rocky Mountain News</I> found 
that one of every six convicted felons placed in Colorado halfway houses escaped. That 
year, the study found, 526 felons walked away from halfway houses and into the 
surrounding neighborhoods. Seven of the escapees were convicted murderers. "In most 
cases," the paper concluded, "no one looked for them."</P>
<P>	Informed neighbors don't always just keep offenders from committing crimes; 
sometimes they can help ex-cons straighten out. Mike Elsworth got out of prison in 
Washington, D.C., for the last time on Halloween 1990, after serving two years for 
selling cocaine. Elsworth, who was paroled to the same part of town where he grew up, 
credits his neighbors for helping him keep his record clean since his release. Although he 
was shunned by at least one woman on his block, other "neighbors were supportive and 
understanding of me trying to do better once I got out. They knew I was looking for a job, 
and they would tell me about places that they knew were hiring, and some of them would 
tell me if I needed anything to come on by." Three months after his release, with the 
encouragement of his neighbors, Elsworth found a job.</P>
<P>	Elsworth says his neighbors gave him the help and attention his parole officers 
did not. In two years, Elsworth reported to five different officers. "It was like, every three 
months I had a new one," he says. "I don't know why. They really had little or no 
concern about me as a person." Elsworth met with his parole officer for 10 to 15 minutes 
every few weeks. But he saw his neighbors every day, which ultimately, he says, made all 
the difference.</P>
<P>	Of course, not all neighborhoods would take advantage of more information about 
felons. In some parts of cities, particularly in poor areas where citizens tend to live 
chaotic lives, neighbors often know who is on parole and don't care. Nor would giving 
neighbors the names and addresses of all newly released felons always benefit the felons 
themselves. Critics have long charged that releasing the names of parolees and 
probationers to the public would make it more difficult for convicted criminals to start 
successful new lives once they get out of prison. A federal judge recently struck down 
parts of "Megan's Law," a New Jersey statute requiring released sex offenders to tell 
their communities where they live. In his decision, Judge Nicholas Politan said the 
notification requirement amounted to a form of punishment, and cannot be added to 
penalties already in place before the law was passed in 1994. Requiring a convicted felon 
to notify his neighbors upon release, he wrote, would constitute a "lifelong albatross," 
and would ruin an ex-con's ability to "return to a normal, private, law-abiding life in the 
community." Judge Politan might be right. Ultimately, however, much of what would 
happen if the names of parolees were publicized is conjecture. As it stands, the identities 
of released criminals often remain shrouded in state and federal privacy laws. The Federal 
Privacy Act of 1974, for instance, generally bars authorities from divulging the names 
and addresses of parolees released from federal prisons. Most states, wary of civil-rights 
lawsuits brought by released felons, have adopted similar laws. While the intent of such 
statutes may be noble, their effect has sometimes been devastating.</P>
<P>	Last summer, the residents of Red Hook, a small town in upstate New York, paid 
the price for having an unknown felon in their midst. In June, Richard Moran, a lifelong 
criminal from the Bronx, was released from Rikers Island, where he had spent the 
previous three months on a parole violation, and placed in Red Hook's only homeless 
shelter. No one knew his criminal record. No one was watching.</P>
<P>	Had Moran's record become public, Tommy McCauliff, a 29-year-old with 
cerebral palsy, might still be alive. On a Sunday afternoon in July, McCauliff emerged 
from his apartment, staggered across the street, and bled to death on the sidewalk from a 
knife wound in his back.</P>
<P>	Police picked up Moran and charged him with second-degree murder. He was 
later convicted.</P>
<P>	By the time he came to Red Hook, Moran had spent close to half of his 43 years 
behind bars. First arrested in New York City for armed robbery in 1969, he went on to 
amass 26 different criminal charges, including several violent felonies. Within days of 
being released, Moran made his way to Shelter Plus, a state-financed boarding house for 
vagrants in Red Hook, 90 miles north. Under circumstances that are still not clear, he met 
Tommy McCauliff.</P>
<P>	When an inmate with two or more convictions is released from a state prison in 
New York, within 48 hours corrections officials must notify the police in the town to 
which he is headed. Rikers Island, however, is not a state prison, but a jail run by New 
York City. Authorities there were not required to notify police in Red Hook that Moran 
was on his way to their town. And they didn't.</P>
<P>	The state's department of social services in nearby Poughkeepsie was the only 
agency that knew about Moran's arrival in Red Hook, and New York's confidentiality 
laws require social workers to keep secret the criminal histories of their clients.</P>
<P>	"Anything in our records is confidential," says John Battistoni, the county's 
commissioner of social services. "Parolees just come in like anyone else. If they're 
without a place to go, we're required to give them shelter." Only a court order, he says, 
can force the department to divulge the names of the parolees it places in homeless 
shelters. A call from the local police department will not suffice. For employees who 
break confidentiality rules, says Battistoni, "the penalties could be severe. You'd be 
subjecting yourself and your county to all sorts of suits. It's tough stuff."</P>
<P>	All things considered, says Battistoni, he is not bothered by the secrecy. "I 
suppose people shouldn't be branded," he offers. "People are saying they'd like to know 
if a criminal is placed in their neighborhood. I often wonder what they would do with the 
information if they had it. Put a 24-hour tail on the guy?"</P>
<P>	Lisa Murray has no doubt what she would do with such information. "I would 
keep an eye on that person," she says, "and I would know if that person was near my 
child, if it was a rapist or a child molester, to get my kid away." Murray is one of five 
Red Hook women who formed a group called Concerned Citizens for a Safe Community 
after McCauliff's death. The group advocates changing the confidentiality laws they 
believe were partly responsible for the killing.</P>
<P>	Murray points out that Richard Moran is not the only criminal to move into the 
homeless shelter without the town's knowledge. Since McCauliff's death, police have 
arrested two other residents of Shelter Plus for selling drugs. "Whenever somebody gets a 
DWI or commits a robbery, it's in the paper before they're even convicted of the crime," 
she says. "So why not have a criminal who's already been convicted of a crime and 
released from prison be put in the paper saying where he's going to live?"</P>
<P>	A county legislator named Woody Klose quickly sponsored a resolution requiring 
local police to be notified whenever felons are placed in homeless shelters. Steve Saland, 
a state senator, sponsored a bill that would force corrections officials to notify towns 
whenever a parolee is about to be released into their midst. Unlike the statute in place, the 
new law would apply to jails as well as state prisons. It would require authorities to notify 
the mayor and the chief of police of the town to which the parolee is headed, as well as 
officials in the town where the crime was committed. The written statement would 
include the ex-con's physical description, his known aliases, and his criminal record. It 
would also contain his new home address. Towns would have to post the information in a 
public place, such as a bulletin board in city hall, in post offices, or in advertisements in 
local newspapers. Released offenders would be required to report to local authorities for a 
period of 10 years each time they moved to a new address in New York.</P>
<P>	Saland's notification law would apply only to paroled sex criminals, repeat 
violent offenders, and those convicted of three or more felonies. Saland says the law 
would not prevent parolees from committing new crimes. But it might help neighbors to 
protect themselves from released criminals. "All you can do is provide notice," he says. 
After that, "it's up to the community."</P>
<P>	Tommy McCauliff's death prompted New York politicians to take a new look at 
an old debate. For years, lawmakers have tried to balance the requirements of public 
safety with a belief that stigmatizing released felons makes rehabilitating them more 
difficult. Many states have compromised by requiring parolees and convicted criminals to 
register their addresses with law-enforcement officials, but not with neighbors or 
community groups. States that do provide for community notification when a felon is 
released nearly always limit the notification to cases involving sex offenders.
<P>	Most states that have such laws leave their application to the discretion of law 
enforcement officers. Often police departments get to decide which sex offenders 
constitute a threat to their neighbors. Although the state of Washington allows police to 
release photographs of and information about convicted sex offenders to community 
groups, and news outlets, the law is not always used. In the first 10 months of 1994, for 
instance, county police in Spokane notified the public only once of a paroled sex 
offender, though several were released into the area. Carol Dorris, who follows crime 
legislation for the National Victim's Center, says it is not unusual to see effective laws 
passed, then ignored. "It's fine to put in statutes and legislate something," she says, "but 
to enforce them is a lot harder to do."</P>
<P>	Nevertheless, recent developments show that concerned citizens have several 
outlets for civic action:</P>
<H3>Legislative Action</H3>
<P> The inability of probation officers to effectively track offenders 
argues for comprehensive notification laws--let the community provide the surveillance 
that the state cannot or will not. So far, such laws exist only in theory. For fear of 
destroying an ex-con's chances of success after release, no state has passed laws that 
would give the public the names and addresses of all parolees and probationers.</P>
<P>	Louisiana, however, has taken the lead in warning communities about released 
sex offenders. In 1992, the legislature passed two laws that ensure sex offenders will 
never again live anonymously in Louisiana. Or, as a later revision to the laws put it, 
"Persons found to have committed a sex offense have a reduced expectation of privacy." 
In fact, a person convicted of one of the state's 18 sex offenses can expect practically no 
privacy at all.</P>
<P>	The two laws and their amendments are vast in scope. No later than 10 days 
before a sex offender gets out of prison, corrections officials must send letters warning of 
his impending release to his victims, witnesses who testified against him, and the sheriff 
of the parish (county) to which he is going. Once he gets out, a sex offender must register 
with the sheriff and provide his fingerprints, his photograph, his social-security number, 
and any aliases he has used. The ex-con must also give the sheriff a description of his 
offense, including the date and place he committed it, and his home address. Offenders 
who move within the state of Louisiana have 10 days to re-register. The process 
continues for 10 years after their release.</P>
<P>	If his victim was a juvenile at the time of the offense, the offender must notify his 
neighbors as well. Twice within his first month out of prison, he must purchase an 
advertisement in his local newspaper. The ads must reveal his name, his address, and his 
offense. Descriptions of the crimes must be written in language ordinary citizens can 
understand; statute numbers do not suffice. To verify that it meets these specifications, 
the ad must pass muster with a parole officer.</P>
<P>	One such classified advertisement, which appeared in the <I>New Orleans Times-
Picayune</I> on May 8, 1994, is typical of the genre. "John Jones of 701 Teche St.," it said, 
"was convicted of a Sex Offense, Simple Rape." Another, on June 10, 1994, advertised, 
"I, Jim Davis, was convicted of molestation of a juvenile." [<I>Policy Review</I> has changed 
the names.] Other ads placed in the paper in June mentioned carnal knowledge, sexual 
battery, and indecent behavior with a juvenile.</P>
<P>	Once he has notified the larger community of his crime, an offender must tell his 
neighbors about it. The parolee must send letters or postcards with the same 
information--name, address, and offense--to every house within three blocks of his 
home. In cities, this usually means 36 square blocks and hundreds of houses. A parolee 
who lives in a rural area must send letters to everyone within a one-mile radius of his 
house.</P>
<P>	Finally, a sex offender whose victim was under 18 must contact the 
superintendent of the public-school district in his parish, as well as the principals of any 
private or parochial schools in the area.</P>
<P> 	If it chooses, a parole board also "may order any other form of notice which it 
deems appropriate, including but not limited to signs, handbills, bumper stickers, or 
clothing labeled to that effect." All of the expenses involved in the notification, such as 
stamps, envelopes, and advertising fees--not to mention any specially-labeled clothing 
the parole board may require--must be borne by the parolee. If at any time he fails to 
meet any requirement, an offender may be returned to prison.</P>
<H3>Citizen Journalists</H3>
<P>When John Roger, president of the Bayview Civic League in 
Norfolk, Virginia, asked the local police department to release the names of parolees who 
had moved into his neighborhood, it refused. Undeterred, Roger sought information at the 
other end of the criminal justice system: arrestees.</P>
<P>	Unlike the addresses of released felons, arrest records are publicly available from 
the police department. Every month, the league's newsletter, <I>Bayview Bylines</I>, publishes 
the name, race, and home address of each person taken into custody by the police within 
the boundaries of the Bayview neighborhood. Periodically, in a feature called "Pervert 
Alert," Roger also provides descriptions of flashers, peeping Toms, and other unsavory 
characters seen in the area. To pay for printing, local merchants buy advertising space in 
the newsletter. "Want to know why we do it?" he asks. "It's simple. We live here. We 
believe our members have a right to know what's going on."</P>
<P>	Though he prints only 4,000 copies of the newsletters, Roger is confident they 
reach many more people. Residents read it, he says, not only out of a fear of crime, but to 
"find if somebody they know has been arrested." The publicity can have consequences. 
Landlords, says Roger, scan the names of arrestees. "If it happens to be one of their 
tenants, they get rid of him."</P>
<P>	Although it remains difficult in most states to learn the whereabouts of parolees, 
there are other ways citizens can gather information on potentially dangerous criminals. 
In July 1994, John Johansen, a financial consultant in Arlington, Virginia, published the 
first issue of <I>Crime Prevention Bulletin</I>, a quarterly newspaper with a circulation of 
30,000. Police departments in Washington, D.C., and suburban Maryland and Virginia 
cooperated with Johansen, giving him the photographs and last known addresses of 
fugitives in the area. Johansen printed the mug shots, some beneath headlines like 
"Wanted for Murder." The papers were distributed throughout the area by members of 
neighborhood organizations.</P>
<P>	The Bulletin was an instant success. In many cases, fugitives were still living in 
the same areas, even at the same addresses, amid neighbors who had no idea they were 
wanted by the law. Local police did not have the resources to track down each of the 
fugitives. But they could respond to tips provided by citizens who recognized their 
neighbors in the <I>Bulletin</I>. In its first six months, police credited Johansen's newspaper 
with the arrests of 15 fugitives in Washington alone. Six of them were suspected 
murderers.</P>
<H3>Do-It-Yourself Advertising</H3>
<P> Sanford "Sandy" Krasnoff, the president of Victims and 
Citizens Against Crime, in Lousiana, says his group devotes much of its energy to 
making certain the state's sex-crimes laws achieve their desired effect. Every Saturday 
morning, the flamboyant Krasnoff, who at various times in his career has been a New 
Orleans cop, a lawyer, and a manager of professional prize fighters, hosts a radio show 
called "Crime Watch." Each week, during three hours of air-time donated by the station, 
Krasnoff announces the names, addresses, and crimes of all sex offenders released on 
parole or probation in Louisiana in the previous week. Krasnoff gets the information 
directly from the parole and pardons board.</P>
<P>	Krasnoff's group also monitors offenders after their release. A volunteer, whom 
Krasnoff refers to as "the sex lady," scans newspapers for advertisements placed by 
parolees under the new law. When he saw that some of the ads were "coming out in 
mumbo-jumbo, referring to act numbers and statutes instead of telling people exactly 
what they were charged with," Krasnoff wrote a letter to the department of corrections, 
which promptly instructed parole officers to reject such ads.</P>
<P>	According to William T. Price, the deputy director of the state's adult probation 
and parole division, the state's new sex-offender laws have not prompted violence from 
the public. In a few cases, people moved upon learning that a child molester had come to 
their neighborhood. But, he says, nobody has yet thrown a fire bomb.</P>
<P>	Price does worry that the laws may be too broad, covering not only child 
molestation and forcible rape, but also non-predatory crimes like bigamy. "If you can 
attach the concept of sex to it," says Price, a crime probably falls under the rubric of the 
new laws.</P>
<P>	For all its willingness to publicize the names and addresses of sex offenders, the 
state of Louisiana still guards information about other parolees carefully. Apart from sex 
criminals, the state's probation and parole division refuses to give out the home addresses 
of the convicts it supervises. The concern, says Price, is that some people, such as bill 
collectors, could put the information to unwholesome purposes. "We don't want to get 
into that business," he says.</P>
<P>	In the fall of 1994, residents of Warwick, Rhode Island, a Providence suburbwere 
desperate to publicize the whereabouts of a man named Craig Price. Five years before, 
Price had admitted stabbing to death four of his Warwick neighbors. Because he was 
technically a juvenile when he committed the murders, he was sentenced to a juvenile 
detention center until age 21. Incensed by Price's crime, a Warwick police captain named 
Kevin Collins organized citizens to fight his release. "This guy had butchered four 
people," says Collins, "knowing that when he gets out at 21, he can go out and obtain a 
gun, [or] work in a day-care center."</P>
<P>	Collins decided to keep Craig Price from ever becoming anonymous. He 
recounted Price's story on radio and television shows. He sent press releases to papers 
around the country. When he heard that Price planned to move to Florida upon release, 
Collins hired an airplane to tow a sign over Miami Beach. The banner read, "Killer of 4 
Craig Price Moving Here? No Police Record!" Similar messages floated over Chicago 
and beaches in Los Angeles and New Jersey.</P>
<P>	Once Price is released, Collins says, he will not be able to tell the public where the 
killer lives. "Once he gets out there--like if he moves into your neighborhood," says 
Collins, "if I went around there knocking on doors, I think they're going to come after me 
on a civil-rights violation." Collins says the memory of the man's crimes may be enough 
to keep Price from killing again in Rhode Island. "Hey, my attitude is, he deserves to be a 
prisoner of public opinion."</P>
<H3>Exercising the Right to Know</H3>
<P> Although no Rhode Island statute would prevent Collins 
from publicizing Craig Price's address once the killer is released, doing so would be 
unwise. As a police officer, Collins could wind up in federal court under Title VII of the 
United States Code. Passed in 1964 as part of Lyndon Johnson's civil-rights legislation, 
the law allows individuals to bring civil action against government officials who conspire 
to deprive them of rights guaranteed under the Constitution. Courts have interpreted the 
law liberally, and it is conceivable that Collins could be found to have violated Price's 
right to privacy, a protection some judges believe emanates from the Fourth Amendment.</P>
<P>	The state's privacy act prohibits government officials from releasing a parolee's 
medical records, or information about his drug or alcohol treatment. But no regulations 
prohibit the state from giving out his home address to citizens who ask. The privacy law 
does not bind Rhode Islanders who do not work for the government. Says James Jerue, 
chairman of the state's parole board, if Craig Price were released on parole in Rhode 
Island, any citizen could find out where he lived. Not that Jerue thinks citizens would try 
to learn. "It has never happened," he says. "No one has ever asked for a home address."</P>
<P>	Citizens have a right to know when potentially dangerous criminals are released 
into their neighborhoods. But they also have an obligation to make the effort required to 
find the information. And there are many ways to get it.</P>
<UL><LI>  In places like Rhode Island, citizens can simply ask the state for the names and 
addresses of parolees.
<LI>In states with strict privacy laws, such as New York, citizens can lobby the legislature 
for legal reform.
<LI>Individuals can ask newspapers to publish the results of every parole hearing in the 
state, as well as the names of every person arrested and convicted for a serious crime. 
Once such information becomes public, it can be spread to a wider audience on 
community bulletin boards and computer services.
<LI>Citizens' groups can apply political pressure to police departments to release the names 
and addresses of those arrested and of those being released from prison into the area.
<LI>  No citizens' group should underestimate the power of a well-placed news story to make 
police departments more accommodating to its requests. If public scrutiny helps to keep 
criminals honest, it can have the same effect on public officials.</UL>
<P>	More than anything, concerned citizens must be willing to spend time and energy 
gathering information on known criminals. Which means they must be nosy. An informed 
community is not necessarily the most private, but it will be the safest.</P>

<H3> A Felon's Perspective (sidebar)</H3>

<P>	It is clear that social-service providers cannot supply all the supervision many ex-
cons need to stay out of trouble. Neighbors can help. Lewis, a 29-year-old native of 
Washington, D.C., has spent a large portion of his life as a professional burglar. Like 
many current and former criminals, he understands that it is vital to know whether 
neighbors have criminal pasts. "People got to know," Lewis says. "If you don't know 
who's living around you, you're trusting everybody. Most of the people that I know, 
including myself, we want everybody to trust us, because once you get trusted you can do 
basically anything you want to do."</P> 
<P>	As a young man, Lewis broke into houses on his own street. Had the neighbors 
known about his criminal tendencies, he says, "it would have never happened, because 
they would have been better prepared. You'd be surprised at the people who leave 
windows open and go to work. Some people are even stupid enough to get drunk around 
you and leave their keys."</P>
<P>	At 17, Lewis was arrested for several burglaries. He was convicted and sent to 
Lorton prison, outside of Washington, first to the juvenile wing, then to the adult facility. 
By the time he got out on parole, three years later, he had not been reformed, but he had 
become considerably wiser: He stopped breaking into his neighbors' houses. "Quite a 
few neighbors" knew about his burglary convictions, he says. "Basically, it was a `we're 
going to wait and see' type of thing. I was watched and that discouraged me from 
anything."</P>
<P>	Instead, Lewis says, he looked in other neighborhoods, especially crowded parts 
of town where neighbors would not recognize him. And he always went on foot. "You 
never drive a different car to a neighborhood because everybody notices it. If people see 
that different car, they'll wait `til you get out of it." Lewis estimates he burgled nearly 50 
houses before being sent back to prison (on drug-dealing charges, not burglary).</P>
<P>	It has been several years since Lewis finished his last term in prison. He is 
married and lives in Prince George's County, Maryland. He says he has no regular job, 
but works on and off for a temporary agency. His current neighbors do not know about 
his burglary convictions, and sometimes Lewis is tempted to steal again. "The urge will 
hit when I'm broke," he says. "Sometimes when it gets a little tight with money and she 
starts bitching, you start thinking what you can do for money. And you think, `I could 
always do what I used to do.' "</P>
<P>	Although Lewis has chosen not to tell his neighbors about his criminal past, he 
does not believe other criminals should have the same choice. "Why not alert people to 
the fact that you got a known criminal in the neighborhood, you got a burglar living next 
door to you?" he asks. "The burglar who lives next door to you will get you sooner than 
you think, especially if you don't know, because he can see you every day, he sees your 
moves every day."</P>

<H3>States Take Action (sidebar)</H3>

<P>Some states require notification of local police when a released convict moves into town, 
including:</P>
<B>Alabama</B>--Those convicted of two or more felonies must register with the town sheriff 
within 24 hours of moving to a new address.</BR>
<B>Florida and Mississippi</B>--All convicted felons must register with the town sheriff within 
24 hours of moving to a new address.<BR>
<B>Minnesota</B>--Only those convicted of certain crimes must register, such as murder and 
child molestation.</BR>
<B>Missouri and Tennessee</B>--Only those on parole need register.<BR>
<B>Nevada</B>--All felons who stay for more than 48 hours must register with the police, as 
must all visiting ex-cons who come to the state five or more times within 30 days.
In a number of other states, community-notification laws apply only to sex offenders. Though 
provisions of last year's federal anti-crime legislation may ultimately require all those 
convicted of sex crimes to register with state authorities, so far only some states keep 
track of sex offenders. They include:<BR>
<B>Arkansas</B>--The staff of a facility that is releasing a habitual child molester must send 
state police the offender's new address.<BR>
<B>California</B>--Citizens will soon be able to call a state-run 900 number to receive 
information about those convicted of child molestation.<BR>
<B>Connecticut</B>--Released sex offenders must register with state law enforcement.<BR>
<B>Delaware</B>--Police may announce a sex offender's release in a newspaper advertisement.<BR>
<B>Georgia</B>--As a condition of parole, chronic sex offenders must notify the sheriff in the 
town to which they move upon release from prison.<BR>
<B>Indiana</B>--Police departments must tell any citizen who asks the names of child molesters 
who live in his or her county.<BR> 
<B>New Jersey</B>--Sex offenders must notify the police of their home addresses every three 
months, and in some cases must continue doing so for life.<BR>
<B>Oregon</B>--When a child molester goes free, the department of corrections may alert 
police, churches, convenience stores, neighbors, businesses, or other places where minors 
congregate.</BR>
<B>Washington</B>--Police may post flyers giving the names, photographs, and addresses of  
chronic sex offenders.<BR>

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT></B>he most popular outdoor basketball court in New York City is half the regulation 
size, offers no place to sit, and has sidelines bounded by a chain-link fence 20 feet high. 
Those who play here are literally encaged. Yet this ridiculously inadequate court, on 
West 4th Street in the heart of Greenwich Village, has drawn the likes of Denzel 
Washington and Julius Erving for pickup games. And the summer league based here is 
probably the most prestigious in the city. Each year, the West 4th Street League attracts 
more than 30,000 spectators--city-dwellers and tourists--who stand in blistering heat 
just to glimpse their favorite players and snap up league T-shirts at $12 apiece.</P>
<P>	West 4th Street basketball owes its popularity to the inner-city leadership of its 
volunteer commissioner, a limousine driver named Kenny Graham. With little support 
from city hall or local civic groups, he has spent the last 18 summers building the league 
into a New York institution. Lloyd Daniels, Mario Ely, Anthony Mason, Rod Strickland, 
and Jason Williams honed their skills here before going on to N.B.A. careers, and some 
of them still show up during the off-season. Former pros like Detroit's Kelly Tripuka mix 
it up with high-school dropouts.</P>

<H3>Midday Basketball</H3>
<P>	West 4th Street has developed its share of stars, but this is not the league's true 
purpose. In an era of commercialized sports, it is important to understand the 
contributions of a community league composed primarily of players whose glory days are 
over--25- to 35-year-olds with talent and pride, but no N.B.A. contracts. The league and 
its fans cherish players the media overlook, while putting sports and sportsmanship back 
into the community. It is midnight basketball played in broad daylight and without 
government handouts.</P>
<P>	A recent documentary film called <I>Hoop Dreams</I> dramatizes the pathos of the 
nearly-great athlete. William, a high-school phenom from Chicago, ponders his future as 
a scholarship recruit. In the final moments of the film, William reflects on all the people 
who've asked him,  "Will you still remember me when you're a big star in the N.B.A.?," 
and says, "I should've asked them, `Will you still remember me if I'm not?'" Promising 
inner-city players are typically groomed from the age of 12 or so. This process has 
obscured the virtues of athletic competition and replaced them with illusions of easy 
wealth. For a lucky few, lucrative professional careers represent a materialistic triumph 
and escape from the neighborhood.Graham's league, on the other hand, showcases those 
who cannot escape, who must remain behind and make their community work.</P>
<P>	"I started working there refereeing league games for $10 a game," Graham recalls. 
"The next year the league was falling apart and no one wanted to take over, so I decided I 
would be commissioner."</P>
<P>	Founded in 1968, the league had struggled along for several years with only eight 
teams, unreliable funding, and a shortage of referees. Today, Graham runs the oldest 
summer-basketball program in New York City. There is a game every day of the week in 
June, July, and August, five on Saturdays and Sundays. Each year, more than 600 players 
altogether participate in the 24-team men's division, a women's division of six teams, and 
an eight-team division for boys 15 and under. Its prowess is known nationwide. Last year, 
the Summer Pro-League outdoor championship, sponsored by Nike and shown on ESPN, 
was won by the defending champions from New York. But that team, which defeated a 
Chicago squad in the finals by 30 points, had finished second at West 4th Street.</P>
<P>	Youth teams have come from as far away as Seattle and France to play in the 
preliminary games before the seniors begin, but collegiate players rarely play here 
because the league is not sanctioned by the N.C.A.A. In his youth division, Graham 
prefers to work with younger, pre-high-school players, because high-school-age youths 
are often spoiled and difficult to control.   "We have trouble getting teams with 
responsible adults to control the players," he says. "It can be very difficult to talk to them. 
Last summer, we had high-school-age girls' teams, and fighting became a problem. At 
age 13 to 14, the kids will listen."</P>
<P>	The tiny court must hold two referees and 10 quick and often large players, so 
personal fouls proliferate. That makes refereeing difficult. "No one wanted to come down 
there to ref because West 4th Street was very rough," Graham says. "The first year I was 
commissioner, we had only one incident, and I took a stand. The players knew right then 
that I would not walk away from a problem." Arizona Pearson, who has played in the 
league for 11 years and now directs its youth program, has watched Graham keep the 
peace. "Kenny gets in the middle," he says, "but you have to do that, you have to be in 
control. With Kenny, it takes a lot to get him upset. If there's shouting and threatening, 
people apologize afterward."</P>
<P>	The cramped conditions also make ball control extremely difficult. Passing lanes 
are limited, and it is much easier here than in the N.B.A. for a defensive player to 
abandon his man to attack the dribbler or the post-up man waiting to turn and shoot. At 
the same time, the New York style of playground basketball frowns upon the staid jump 
shot in favor of the driving lay-up, with its infinite possibilities for blind pass-offs or shot 
creation. These factors produce a game of ferocious strength, speed, and competitiveness. 
The discipline and control of this style amazes outsiders and accounts for the league's 
popularity.</P>
<P>	West 4th Street smoothes the transition for many of the 98 percent of New York's 
good collegiate players who do not make it to the pros. The close of a competitive career 
can prompt an emotional letdown and demoralize young men with leadership abilities. 
Tony Hargraves was the co-captain of Iona College's basketball team in 1984-85 and was 
named an Honorable Mention All-American by the Associated Press, but he could not get 
a professional contract. Now an operations manager at Bear Stearns with a home and 
family in the suburbs, he continues to play regularly in the cage. "Good players still have 
a desire to play against people at their own level," Hargraves explains, "and West 4th 
Street offers this." When N.B.A. players show up, regulars treat them with respect, but 
they also relish the chance to show up the pro athletes.</P>
<P>	"The small court makes you do all the right things," Hargraves explains. "It 
improves your game. This is a place where you cannot continue to make mistakes. 
Anthony Mason [a power forward with the New York Knicks] is a prime example. West 
4th Street defined his game. He learned he had to move much more quickly. He became 
one of the stronger players in the city, and now he's one of the stronger players in the 
N.B.A."</P>

<H3>Respect Without Fear</H3>
<P>	I first became drawn to these players in the early 1980s, when I saw in their 
character something missing in the bright young MBAs at our big Wall Street trading 
firm. I saw in young players like Tony Sherman (who still plays) and Mario Ely (who 
won a championship ring with the Houston Rockets last year) awe-inspiring toughness, 
masculinity, and personal pride. These players are courteous but not chatty, fearless but 
disciplined. The better players have grit and a capacity for physical exertion that, I fear, 
our increasingly computerized society seems to devalue.</P>
<P>	Pearson sees the role of competitive basketball in the city quite clearly: "Of 
course it is fun, you can work off frustrations. But it's really about getting respect. That's 
what living in the city is about, you know." At West 4th Street, that means being looked 
up to by others. It's not the same as the fashionable notion of "self-esteem," which is of 
little use on the streets.</P>
<P>   Kenny's idea of respect is not built on fear. "I'm not militant and I'm not a cult leader," 
he explains. "I want people to learn they gain respect if they give respect. That's the 
bottom line.... Often black organizations are poorly run, and I tell players, `When you 
carry on, you reinforce stereotypes. If you make us and the league look bad, we could 
wind up with no league--and then you would have no chance to showcase your talents, 
we want a mutual respect for peers.... And respect for a program and an organization.... 
You can teach respect. I do it by talking, by challenging a person mentally. People judge 
others by their behavior, and I tell people that in their actions they represent their 
heritage, their culture, their race. A lot of so-called black leaders won't challenge black 
people about their behavior. It's easier to tell them [their problem is] white people."</P>
<P>   Fans must arrive early to reserve a good spot at courtside. For big games--the playoffs 
or the all-star game--youngsters sit on the fence or hang from tree branches. Graham or 
one of the staff wits uses a bullhorn to announce the games, and their commentaries are 
humorous, improvisational performances.</P>
<P>	The league has become an integral part of the lives of its 600-plus participants. 
Most of the players do not live in the neighborhood. They come mainly from Brooklyn, 
Harlem, or the Bronx to the playground here because they like to play before the big 
crowds in the Village.</P>
<P>	Sid Jones, a Brooklynite who has been coaching winning teams for 15 years, is 
particularly attuned to the sense of community the league has developed. "Generally, 
people don't spend time getting to know each other, but at this park, you meet people," 
Jones says. "The people you meet may help you in other parts of your life. Kenny and the 
league have been bringing people together for years, and it's now a community. You 
wonder, why can't people get along like this outside of sports? --Just about every 
subway line stops here, so you get people from all walks of life. It's a real melting pot. 
Players will come here when they won't go everywhere else. And I'll tell you, when you 
win a big game down here, you don't want to go home."</P>
<P> 	The city government provides the league nothing except a permit to play. "They 
are not that concerned with us," Graham says, "because they see we are doing OK. They 
are worried about their own programs. Occasionally a mayor will come down here to help 
get some votes. ... But they are not here to help the league."</P>
<P>   Graham never passes the hat. He and a few of his staff were once granted the status of 
part-time employees by the New York City Parks Department, but that was discontinued 
years ago. Money to run the league now comes exclusively from entry fees--$500 per 
team--and corporate sponsors. The principal sponsor for the last two years has been Fila 
Inc., a sportswear manufacturer, which subsidizes uniforms and gives sneakers to each 
team. Since 1986, Nobody Beats the Wiz has provided television sets for the winners of 
the Most Valuable Player and Sportsmanship awards. The nearby McDonald's feeds the 
staff more than 500 free meals each summer. The maker of Olde English 800 malt liquor 
provides a scoreboard and money for trophies and shorts.</P>
<P>	None of the league's successes--its local following, corporate sponsorship, and 
national recognition--would be possible without its reputation for serious, disciplined 
basketball. So Graham insists upon high standards of behavior. A public league held in a 
public park draws all kinds, and no one can be refused admission, but Graham works hard 
to maintain the dignity of the league. Sometimes a player or fan will challenge this. "One 
day right after a game, a guy on one of the teams dropped his pants," he recalls. "I didn't 
think it was funny. I laced into him something fierce. I embarrassed him right on the spot. 
What he did was totally wrong." As commissioner, Graham's decisions are final. If a 
player starts fights or disgraces the league in any way, he is banned for the season.</P>
<P>	Graham is a gifted leader who embodies positive thinking--necessary for 
entrepreneurs, but rare among administrators. Graham also takes great pride in delivering 
what he promises. Once when the TV prizes were held up due to a clerical snafu, he 
didn't hesitate to cover the costs. (Eventually, he was reimbursed.)</P>
<P>	Graham's devotion to excellence and good manners filters throughout the 
neighborhood. Good-humored and charismatic, he can quickly summon dozens of helpers 
to do whatever is needed--keeping score or sweeping the court before games. 
Afterwards, they leave the whole area cleaner than before. In this way, even street people 
become part of the league culture. "We take all kinds," says Graham. "We're all human 
beings. Sometimes people will tell me to get rid of a guy who maybe has a drinking 
problem. I say, if a man has a problem and I can help him, I will. Everybody can't be on 
the level we'd like them to be. Some guys have gone through their whole lives being 
rejected, but I will help somebody who wants to be helped. I can deal with them."</P>

<H3>Creating an Identity</H3>
<P>	Graham is proud of the fact that the league plays a part in the lives of many 
players and staff, even those who do menial work. "Many guys down here are not part of 
anything but a joint or a bottle of wine," he says. "We give them an identity above that 
stuff." Graham, who shuns smoking and alcohol, does not allow even surreptitious 
drinking in the park during games. He has also been known to chase smokers away, even 
though smoking is legal. He feels it creates a bad atmosphere for the kids who come to 
watch. He often reminds players that they are "guests" in the neighborhood.</P>
<P>   Even those who never became professional grow as players and as individuals. One of 
these is Tony Sherman, one of the best players in the league never to enjoy a good prep 
career or go to college. "He used to live down there," says Hargraves. "Every day at 3 
o'clock he'd be there working on his game. He's now a great player, and he's done it 
without a good high school record or any college experience.--At the park he became 
popular and he gained respect. That's a big thing in New York City." Pearson agrees: 
"Sherman's grown a lot. He could have been a troublemaker, but he watches his mouth 
now."</P>
<P>	Graham says Sherman has gradually earned the recognition he craves for his 
talent. He has come to follow the example set by Graham and some of the older players, 
and takes defeats with dignity.</P> 
<P>   "Sherman was once the king of the park," says Graham. "Many guys respected him out 
of fear. Now he's older, he's got responsibilities. I think he's realized that people give 
him respect. It's an important difference."</P>
<P>   Last year, then-Governor Mario Cuomo inaugurated the New York State Midnight 
Basketball League at a celebrity function in uptown Manhattan. The governor told the 
out-of-school, out-of-work youngsters for whom the league was created that "we have 
not done well by you, [but] we'll try to make it up to you." This was not the spirit that 
made West 4th Street.  Graham is not driven by paternalism or guilt, nor even by 
altruism. Like his players, he is motivated instead by a need for personal recognition and 
respect from the players and the basketball community. "It's nice to have people say, `I'm 
glad you're back,'" he says. Players and staff alike seek the rewards that come with 
excellence, not charity. "I tell them you don't have to love me--but you should respect 
me."</P>
<P>	Graham believes that other communities can duplicate the success of West 4th 
Street. First, he says, "develop a following. Develop a symbol. Our symbol is West 4th 
Street, playing in a cage. Our shirts are known all over New York--every kid wants one." 
Second, "develop people with character. You've got to let people know that you don't 
have to be out there, you've got a job and other things in your life. They can't just do 
what they'd like to."</P>
<P>	Sociologists like to point out that chaos and disorder are common aspects of 
malfunctioning inner-city families. One of Graham's greatest talents is for organization: it 
is he, not some government agency, that provides continuity for these New Yorkers. The 
order originates within the community rather than being imposed from without. There are 
lots of Kenny Grahams in every community. If such leaders are encouraged, they will 
come.</P>

INTRODUCTION
<P>
      During the 1980s, America's ability to create jobs was the envy
of the world. No longer. The American job-generating machine has
ground to a halt, and regulation deserves much of the blame. The
regulatory burden on U.S. firms relaxed through most of the 1980s, and
private-sector employment grew by 19 million jobs. Most of these new
jobs were created by small businesses, which are most sensitive to
regulatory costs. Over the last four years, however, the regulatory
burden has grown substantially (especially for small and medium-sized
businesses), and the private sector has lost nearly two million jobs
since early 1990.
<P>
      While government red tape is a costly frustration to American
business, few business owners -- or even government policy makers --
appreciate the full impact of regulation. Among the little-known
facts:
<P>
      Government regulation costs at least $8,000 per household, and
      may reduce national output by as much as $1.1 trillion per year.
<P>
           Unnecessary and inefficient regulation at the federal,
      state, and local levels is now costing the American people
      somewhere between $810 billion and $1.7 trillion per year --
      even after taking account of the benefits of regulation -- or
      between $8,400 and $17,100 per year per household. (Nancy A. 
      Bord and William G.  Laffer III, "George Bush's Hidden Tax:  The
      Explosion in Regulation," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 
      905, July 10, 1992, p.  19.  Regulations may be treated as
      "unnecessary" if (1) the costs they impose exceed the benefits
      they produce, or (2) even though they produce benefits that may
      exceed costs, they do so in an unnecessarily costly manner
      because of an inefficient method or approach.  The basis for the
      distinction between necessary and unnecessary regulations is
      discussed further in footnote 15 below. ) A major portion of
      this cost consists of the additional goods and services that the
      American economy could have been producing today but is not
      because of over two decades of slower growth due to excessive
      and inefficient regulation. The value of this foregone output is
      somewhere between $450 billion and $1.1 trillion per year.
      (Ibid.)
<P>
      Regulation reduces total U.S. employment by at least three
      million jobs.
<P>
           Another heavy cost of regulation is reduced employment
      opportunities for Americans. This toll is not usually apparent,
      because in most instances regulation merely leads to a slower
      growth in employment rather than to visible loss in existing
      jobs. Nonetheless, even by a fairly conservative estimate, there
      are at least three million fewer jobs in the American economy
      today than would have existed if the growth of regulation over
      the last twenty years had been slower and regulations more
      efficiently designed. (Footnote 17 below explains how this
      figure was calculated.)
<P>
           Many regulations directly increase the cost of employing
      workers and thereby act like a hidden tax on job creation and
      employment. Among such regulations are minimum wage laws and
      federal labor laws. These regulations place especially heavy
      burdens on small businesses, the primary engines of job
      creation. And exempting smaller businesses from regulations
      generally does not solve the problem. Instead it simply creates
      a "Catch 22" situation in which growing small firms are
      penalized by an increase in the number of regulations they
      became subject to.
<P>
           Officials currently face no explicit requirement to
      consider employment effects as they develop new rules. Nor do
      lawmakers. Even when the agencies or congressional committees do
      consider the employment effects of proposed rules or regulatory
      legislation, policy makers often do so in ways that are
      simplistic or that rely on faulty assumptions and models. The
      methodologies used vary from agency to agency, and from
      regulation to regulation even within agencies. Moreover, nowhere
      in the entire federal regulatory process does anyone consider
      the cumulative effects of existing regulations, or the possible
      combined effects of new and existing regulations.
<P>
      To deal with the mounting employment costs of regulation,
Congress and the Clinton Administration should institute several
urgent reforms. Among the most important: <P>
Reform #1:      President Clinton should issue an executive order
                requiring explicit consideration of the employment
                effects of all new regulations.
<P>
Reform #2:      Congress should extend the same requirement to all
                "independent" regulatory agencies that are outside the
                executive branch. 
<P>
Reform #3:      Congress should establish a federal regulatory budget.
                Such a budget means that a maximum total regulatory
                burden that government could impose on the economy --
                or regulatory budget -- would be established. Whenever
                an agency planned to add a new regulation that would
                exceed the budget, it would be required to repeal or
                modify some other regulation so that the total burden
                imposed on the economy by federal regulation would not
                be increased. Alternatively, the government would have
                to arrange an offsetting reduction from another
                agency. 
<P>
Reform #4:      Congress should require the expected employment
                effects of all proposed regulations to be published in
                the Federal Register; even before such a requirement
                is imposed, executive and independent agencies should
                voluntarily publish the expected employment effects of
                proposed regulations. This would permit the American
                people to know the expected magnitude of any job
                losses due to a new rule before it takes effect.
                Americans then could let officials and lawmakers know
                if they felt the benefits of the proposed rule were
                worth the job losses.
<P>
      Enactment of these four reforms would reduce substantially the
cost that federal regulations impose on the economy, while preserving
or even increasing the benefits that regulations sometimes can
provide. In particular, they would reduce the toll on employment and
wages that the well-meaning pursuit of worthy ends often takes. A
clean environment and safe and discrimination-free workplaces can be
achieved without depriving three million or more Americans of jobs.

<P>
HOW REGULATION KILLS JOBS
<P>
      Between January 1, 1983, and March 31, 1990, private-sector
employment in the U.S. economy grew by some 19 million jobs, rising
from 72.8 million jobs in December 1982, to 91.8 million jobs in March
1990. However, over the next two years the private sector lost nearly
2.2 million jobs, reaching a low of just over 89.6 million jobs in
January 1992. The number of private-sector jobs has recovered only
slightly since then, rising to 90.1 million jobs as of January 1993.
(Source:  U.S.  Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)
("establishment data," based on a monthly survey of employers,
seasonally adjusted).  These figures do not include agricultural
employment or employment by federal, state, or local governments. 
Using BLS's figures for total civilian employment ("household data,"
based on household interviews conducted monthly by the Bureau of the
Census, seasonally adjusted), including agricultural employment and
non-military government employment, the relevant employment figures
are 99 million jobs in December 1982, 118.3 million jobs in May 1990,
116.5 million jobs in August 1991, and 118 million jobs as of January
1993.)
<P>
      What accounts for the difference between the two periods? In
particular, what caused employment to start rising in January 1983,
and what caused it to begin to fall in April 1990? To be sure, there
are many factors that affect employment levels, including taxation.
Tax rates were reduced significantly in 1983, but increased somewhat
in 1990.  (See Daniel J.  Mitchell, "An Action Plan to Create Jobs,"
Heritage Foundation Memo to President-Elect Clinton No.  1, December
14, 1992, pp.  4-5.  The tax cuts that were enacted in 1981 did not
take full effect until January 1983.  Although the 1990 tax increases
were not signed into law until November 1990, President Bush renounced
his "no new taxes" pledge and indicated his willingness to agree to a
tax increase in June 1990.)But there is considerable evidence to
suggest that changes in the total cost of federal and state regulation
also played a major role, especially in the downturn that occurred in
1990.
<P>
      As the graph on the following page indicates, regulatory costs
generally were declining during the period of private-sector
employment growth. The period of decline and stagnation, by contrast,
started shortly after regulatory costs started to rise again.
Moreover, as the graph on page 5 shows, there was a very close
negative correlation between the number of federal regulators and
private-sector employment. Fewer regulators coincided with an increase
in job growth; an increase in regulators with a decline in job growth
and even a decline in jobs.
<P>
      Policy makers concerned about job creation need to understand
the basic factors that determine the level of wages and employment.
Explains economist Arthur B. Laffer: 
<P>
       <UL>Firms base their decisions to employ workers . .. .. in
      part, on the total cost to the firm of employing workers. .
      .. .. All else equal, the greater the cost to the firm of
      employing each worker, the less workers the firm will
      employ. Conversely, the lower the cost per worker, the more
      workers the firm will hire. (Arthur B.  Laffer,
      "Supply-Side Economics," Financial Analysts Journal,
      September/October 1981, pp.  32-33.)</UL>
<P>
      In a world without taxes or regulations, the cost to employers
of hiring an additional hour of labor services and the benefit to a
worker of working an additional hour would be the same. Taxes and
regulations raise the cost to employers above the reward received by
the employee. These government-mandated costs include such items as
unemployment and disability insurance, government paperwork
requirements, and the cost of lawyers to advise firms on how to comply
with the rules. While some of these government-imposed costs do
provide a benefit to the employee, many of them do not.
<P>
      The difference between what it costs a firm to employ a worker
and the net benefit the worker receives is commonly referred to by
economists as the "regulation and tax wedge." Any increase in the
wedge, whether caused by regulations or by taxes, will tend to raise
the cost to employers of hiring an additional employee, thereby
reducing the demand for labor, and reduce the net wages and benefits
workers receive, thereby reducing the supply of labor as well. Thus,
the basic laws of economics indicate that if regulatory burdens rise
(and tax burdens do not fall by an equal or greater amount),
employment and wages will fall.

<P>
THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT EFFECTS OF REGULATION 
<P>
      Some regulations have a direct and immediate impact on wages or
employment. The minimum wage law and federal labor laws, for example,
tend to increase the cost of employing workers and thereby decrease
wages or employment, and sometimes both. Other regulations affect
wages and employment indirectly, but just as significantly. Banking
and environmental regulations, for example, have a considerable
negative effect on the overall level of economic activity. And when
output slows, employment usually slows with it.
<P>
      More often than not, the effects of regulation on employment are
hidden by other factors, such as tax policy or general economic
changes. But in other instances, the impact on jobs is very clear. 
 Example: The federal government's efforts to protect the northern
spotted owl, under the Endangered Species Act and other related laws,
means millions of acres of land in Washington, Oregon, and northern
California have been closed to logging operations. Tens of thousands
of loggers have lost or will lose their jobs because of these
regulations, and thousands more jobs have been lost in communities
dependent on logging as the principal industry.
<P>
Example:        California has increased regulation sharply over the
last two years, driving businesses and jobs from the state. California
has lost approximately 700,000 jobs since May 1990. (George F.  Will,
"Can California Compete?" The Washington Post, September 27, 1992, p. 
C7.) Indeed, for the first time in nearly twenty years, more people
are leaving California than arriving. ("Californians leaving state in
record numbers," The Washington Times, September 4, 1992, p.  A2.)
While California's job exodus of course is due to many factors,
including higher taxes, several studies and surveys have concluded
that regulations -- especially onerous new environmental regulations
-- are the principal factor driving businesses' decisions to leave the
state. (The most important of these studies is California's Jobs and
Future (April 23, 1992), a detailed report prepared by the Council on
California Competitiveness, led by Peter Ueberroth, the former
baseball commissioner and organizer of the 1984 Olympic Games in Los
Angeles.  Another is Mark Baldassare and Associates, "Department of
Commerce Survey of California Manufacturers" (Sacramento:  California
Department of Commerce, Office of Business Development, December 13,
1989).  Two additional surveys are cited in Philip K.  Verleger Jr.,
"Clean Air Regulation and the L.A.  Riots," The Wall Street Journal,
May 19, 1992, p.  A14.)
<P>


Why the Regulatory Cost is Usually Hidden     
<P>
      Still, cases in which regulation can be clearly identified as
the culprit for specific job losses are the exception rather than the
rule. There are several reasons why there is rarely a smoking gun:
Businesses usually base their decisions on such matters as whether or
where to build a new plant, and how many people they will hire, on a
variety of considerations. It is rarely clear which consideration was
decisive.
<P>
      The<UL> result of regulation often is not a cut in wages or
      employment levels, but simply slower growth over time. Jobs not
      created are much less visible than layoffs.
<P>
      Regulation in one part of the economy can have an impact in
      other areas. For example, a recent study by economists Michael
      Hazilla of American University and Raymond Kopp of Resources for
      the Future, a Washington, D.C.-based research group specializing
      in environmental issues, found that environmental regulations
      had reduced employment in the finance, insurance, and real
      estate industries by 2.64 percent as of 1990. (Michael Hazilla
      and Raymond J.  Kopp, "Social Cost of Environmental Quality
      Regulations:  A General Equilibrium Analysis," Journal of
      Political Economy, Vol.  98, No.  4 (1990), p.  869.) This
      occurred despite the fact that these industries produce no
      pollution themselves and thus did not incur the direct cost of
      pollution abatement equipment. Hazilla and Kopp found that all
      sectors of the economy are affected by environmental
      regulations, because such regulations cause the cost of inputs
      to the production process such as labor, raw materials, and
      electricity to rise, and cause savings, investment and capital
      formation to fall.</UL>
<P>
      Unfortunately for workers, the indirect causal links whose
effects Hazilla and Kopp attempted to measure are invisible to most
observers. Nonetheless, Hazilla and Kopp found the employment effects
of environmental regulation for the economy as a whole to be
substantial. By their estimates, environmental regulations alone had
by 1990 reduced the overall employment level by 1.18 percent. (Ibid.,
p.  867.) This would mean between 1.1 million and 1.4 million fewer
jobs than would have existed without environmental regulation. (The
average number of Americans employed in 1990 was between 91.5 million
and 117.9 million, depending on which BLS data series one uses.  91.5
million x 1.18% = 1.1 million.  117.9 million x 1.18% = 1.4 million. 
Of course, the number of jobs eliminated by environmental regulation
might be smaller if some of the 1.18 percent reduction in labor supply
were simply due to people working fewer hours in existing jobs.) 
Moreover, environmental regulation significantly altered the
distribution of labor employment across the economy. Although a few
sectors, such as the natural gas industry and the wholesale and retail
trade sectors, experienced modest increases in employment, most
sectors experienced reductions. 
<P>

THE TOTAL COST TO THE ECONOMY
<P>
      Most studies analyzing the cost of regulation examine only
direct compliance expenditures. They do not consider the indirect
effects of regulation on output and employment. But some other
studies, such as that by Hazilla and Kopp, suggest that the indirect
effects may be as large as or even significantly larger than the
direct compliance costs, at least in the case of environmental
regulations. (Another such study, with similar results, was done by
economists Dale Jorgenson of Harvard University and Peter Wilcoxen of
the University of Texas.  See Dale W.  Jorgenson and Peter J. 
Wilcoxen, "Environmental Regulation and U.S.  Economic Growth," RAND
Journal of Economics, Vol.  21, No.  2 (Summer 1990), pp.  314-40.)
The reason for this is that reductions in investment due to regulation
have cumulative effects over time on output and employment.
<P>
      The most widely cited estimates of the combined cost of all
federal regulations put the figure between $595 billion and $667
billion per year for 1992, measured in 1991 dollars. (Thomas D. 
Hopkins, Cost of Regulation, Rochester Institute of Technology Public
Policy Working Paper (December 1991); Robert W.  Hahn and John A. 
Hird, "The Costs and Benefits of Regulation:  Review and Synthesis,"
Yale Journal on Regulation, Vol.  8, No.  1 (Winter 1991), pp. 
233-278.  The figures in the text are arrived at by taking Hopkins's
estimate of the total cost of regulation as of 1992, substituting
Hahn's and Hird's original estimate of the gross cost of economic
regulation for the figure Hopkins used (which was a modified version
of Hahn's and Hird's estimate), substituting Hopkins's updated but as
yet unpublished figure for the federal paperwork burden, and
converting the new total from 1988 to 1991 dollars.) However, these
estimates do not take any account of the indirect effects of
regulation on output and employment. A recent study by Nancy Bord and
William Laffer, of The Heritage Foundation, attempted to estimate the
indirect effects of all regulations -- state as well as federal -- by
extrapolating from the results of other studies, such as that of
Hazilla and Kopp. Bord and Laffer calculate that, in the absence of
all unnecessary regulatory costs, (Insofar as some types of regulation
-- environmental regulation in particular -- produce benefits as well
as costs, one may not simply assume that all of the costs of
regulation can be eliminated.  However, even where existing
regulations may produce benefits that exceed costs, it often appears
that the same or even greater benefits could be obtained at a
significantly lower cost by using better-designed, more efficient
forms of regulation.  Consequently, in calculating the foregoing
figures, wherever a regulation appeared to produce net benefits, no
cost was counted except the difference (if any) between the actual
cost imposed by the regulation in question and the lower cost that
would be incurred under a more efficient regulatory scheme.) annual
gross domestic product (GDP) would exceed its current level of $5.672
trillion as of 1991 by at least some $450 billion, and possibly by as
much as $1.1 trillion. (Bord and Laffer, op.  cit., p.  19.  Bord and
Laffer used a very wide range of estimates of the ratio of indirect
costs to direct costs because of the inherent uncertainty involved in
estimating how much output is not produced.  That is why their lower
and upper bounds are so far apart. )This additional output would mean
the existence of several million additional jobs. Even a conservative
estimate would put the figure at well over three million jobs. (Based
on the ratio of 1991 GDP to average private-sector employment in 1991,
the production of an additional $450 billion to $1.1 trillion in
annual GDP would mean the creation of an additional 7.2 million to
19.2 million jobs, depending on which figure is used for
private-sector employment.  However, because much of the additional
GDP would have come from increased productivity, rather than increased
employment, the actual job growth figures would likely be much
smaller.  Assuming that half of any increase in annual GDP came from
increased employment, the additional jobs that would have been created
in the absence of all unnecessary regulatory costs would number
between 3.6 million and 9.6 million.)
<P>
EXAMPLES OF JOB-DESTROYING REGULATIONS
<P>
      As noted earlier, some regulations directly increase the cost of
employing workers and thereby act like a tax on job creation and
employment. Three examples show in practical terms how this happens.
<P>
Example #1: Minimum Wage Legislation
<P>
      It is now almost universally accepted that minimum wage laws
reduce the employment of low-skilled workers whose productivity simply
is not worth what the employers are required by law to pay. (See,
e.g., Simon Rottenberg, ed., The Economics of Legal Minimum Wages
(Washington, D.C.:  American Enterprise Institute, 1981).) The only
major disagreement today is over the degree of employment reductions
caused by the minimum wage requirement. (Some studies note, for
example, that while the minimum wage law reduces employment of
low-skilled workers, it may increase employment of medium-skilled
workers who, to some extent, can be used in lieu of the low-skilled
workers whose labor the minimum wage renders too expensive.  However,
the increase in employment of medium-skilled workers is never enough
to fully offset the decrease in employment of low-skilled workers.)
<P>
      For the nine years running from January 1981 through March 1990,
the federal minimum wage remained fixed at $3.35 per hour. Because of
inflation, however, the real value of the minimum wage -- and
therefore the real cost to businesses of employing less-skilled
workers -- declined. Not surprisingly, the percentage of teenagers
with jobs climbed from 41 percent to over 48 percent over the same
period. (Alan Reynolds, "Cruel Costs of the 1991 Minimum Wage," The
Wall Street Journal, July 7, 1992, p.  A14.) 
<P>
      Congress decided in 1989 to increase the federal minimum wage to
$3.80 per hour as of April 1, 1990, and to $4.25 per hour as of April
1, 1991. Again, not surprisingly, teenage employment fell immediately
after each of these increases. Just four months after the 1990
increase, for instance, the percentage of teenagers with jobs had
fallen from over 48 percent to less than 43 percent, undoing most of
the previous nine years' improvement. (Ibid.) 
<P>
      In total, the federal minimum wage rose by 27 percent, and
teenage employment fell by 11 percent.  (Ibid.)The 1990 and 1991
minimum wage increases made it harder for teenage workers to get
summer and Christmas vacation jobs. The hikes made it harder for young
adults with little education, skill, or experience to obtain their
first full-time entry-level jobs. These are the jobs where they would
acquire the training, experience, and work habits that eventually
would make their labor worth more than the legal minimum. And the
increases in the minimum wage made it harder for unskilled housewives
trying to supplement their family's income while their children are in
school to obtain part-time work.
<P>
      Calculations by economists Lowell Gallaway and Richard Vedder of
Ohio University show that the total cost to a business for each worker
hired and for each hour worked rose sharply after each of these
increases in the minimum wage, but especially after the first -- which
was the larger of the two increases in percentage terms. (Lowell
Gallaway and Richard Vedder, "Why Johnny Can't Work:  The Causes of
Unemployment," Policy Review, Fall 1992, p.  29.)  Furthermore,
calculations by Gallaway and economist Gary Anderson of the Joint
Economic Committee (JEC) of Congress suggest that the total cost per
worker hired and per hour worked rose particularly sharply for smaller
businesses. (Gary Anderson and Lowell Gallaway, "Derailing the Small
Business Job Express" (Washington, D.C.:  Joint Economic Committee,
November 7, 1992), pp.  25-28.) Larger corporations tend to be less
affected (at least directly) by increases in the minimum wage, since
they already pay most if not all of their workers wages well above the
legal minimum. By contrast, the overwhelming majority of businesses
that employ people at the minimum wage are small and medium-sized.
Consequently, increases in the minimum wage -- like most other
increases in the regulatory burden -- tend to have a greater impact on
smaller firms, and to exacerbate the disparity that already exists
between small and large firms. (For a discussion of the disparate
impact of regulation on small business, and of the importance of this
disparity from the standpoint of job creation, see pages 10-12 below.)
<P>
      Private-sector employment peaked in March 1990, and started
declining sharply in April 1990. It appears likely, therefore, that
the legally mandated explosion in the cost of employing relatively
unskilled workers was a significant factor contributing to the 1990-
1991 recession and the stagnation of the past year. (See chart below.)
<P>
Example #2: Federal Labor Laws
<P>
      Federal labor laws regulate employers' dealings with their
employees and with organized labor unions. Under these laws, the
flexibility of companies to hire and fire workers is restric-ted, and
often they are required to engage in costly negotiations with labor
unions. Far from being balanced, federal labor laws deliberately tilt
the scales in favor of unions and against employers, as well as
against employees who do not wish to join a union. (See, e.g., Richard
A.  Epstein, "A Common Law for Labor Relations:  A Critique of the New
Deal Labor Legislation," Yale Law Journal, Vol.  92 (1983), p.  1357;
Daniel J.  Mitchell, "Government Intervention in Labor Markets:  A
Property Rights Perspective," Villanova Law Review, Vol.  33, No.  6
(1988), pp.  1043-1057.)
<P>
      There is, however, no free lunch. Restrictions imposed on
employers (and employees) by federal labor laws inevitably increase
the cost of employing workers, resulting in fewer jobs and lower
wages, or at least in slower growth in employment and wages over time.
(See, e.g., John T.  Addison and Barry T.  Hirsch, "Union Effects on
Productivity, Profits, and Growth:  Has the Long Run Arrived?" Journal
of Labor Economics, Vol.  7 (January 1989), pp.  72-106.  In addition,
compulsory union dues reduce the net benefits workers receive for
working, thereby reducing the supply of labor as well as demand.)
<P>
Example #3: Mandated Benefits
<P>
      Regulations that require employers to provide various benefits
to their employees, such as health insurance, unemployment insurance,
workers' compensation, retirement benefits, or child care, all tend to
reduce wages and employment. They increase the cost of employing
workers, which can lead to a slowdown in the creation of new jobs or
even to layoffs. 
<P>
      In the long run, employers will seek to offset their increased
costs, either by reducing wage and salary payments or by cutting back
on other benefits that the employer previously might have provided
voluntarily as a means of attracting workers. As a result, the total
value of the employees' compensation eventually may be no higher than
it would have been in the absence of the regulation. In fact, the
value to the employee may even end up being less than it would have
been, while the cost to the employer may still be greater. In this
case, the regulation will end up reducing the supply of labor as well
as demand. Thus, one way or another, much of the cost of the
regulation will end up being borne by the workers, whether in the form
of fewer jobs, fewer fringe benefits, a reduction in the growth of
wages over time, or some combination of the three. (See, e.g., Richard
B.  McKenzie, The American Job Machine (New York:  Universe Books,
1988), pp.  218-31; Don Bellante and Philip K.  Porter, "A
Subjectivist Economic Analysis of Government-Mandated Employee
Benefits," Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy, Vol.  13, No.  2
(Spring 1990), pp.  657-687.)
<P>

REGULATION AND SMALL BUSINESS
<P>
      The U.S. economy created some 19 million net new private-sector
jobs during the 1980s. Most of these new jobs were created by new
businesses, and most of the remainder were created by existing small
businesses. (Lawrence A.  Kudlow, "Small Business Is Big Business,"
Global Spectator, February 28, 1992, reprinted in Congressional
Record, March 10, 1992, p.  S3153.) By contrast, large U.S.
multinational corporations contributed less than one-tenth of one
percent of the employment growth that occurred between 1982 and 1989.
(Ibid.) Indeed, employment by Fortune 500 corporations actually fell
by about 4 million jobs during the 1980s. (George F.  Will, "A
refresher course on what ails us," The Providence Journal-Bulletin,
September 14, 1992, p.  A6.) Thus, taken as a separate sector,
employment in small and medium-sized businesses actually grew by an
astounding 23 million jobs.
<P>
      Small businesses have always been the engine of job creation in
the U.S. economy. Some 57.2 percent of all net new jobs created
between 1976 and 1986 were created by firms with fewer than 500
employees, 43.7 percent were created by firms with fewer than 100
employees, and 26.2 percent were created by firms with fewer than 20
employees. (U.S.  Small Business Administration, The State of Small
Business:  A Report of the President (Washington, D.C.:  U.S. 
Government Printing Office, 1989), p.  48.) Today, two out of every
three new jobs in the United States are created by small and medium-
sized businesses. (Kudlow, op.  cit.) The vast majority of American
businesses are small, and the majority of American workers are
employed by small firms. In the U.S., 93.3 percent of all business
establishments employ fewer than 100 employees, and 83.4 percent
employ fewer than 20 employees. Only 3.4 percent of all firms employ
500 or more employees, and only 1.5 percent of all firms employ 5,000
or more employees. (David L.  Birch, Job Creation in America:  How Our
Smallest Companies Put the Most People to Work (New York:  The Free
Press, 1987), p.  9.)

<P>
How Regulation Hurts Small Business
<P>
      Regulation does not affect all businesses equally. It imposes
the heaviest burdens on small and medium-sized businesses. The reason
is that small and medium-sized firms find it harder to spread the high
overhead costs of processing paperwork, attorney and accountant fees,
and the staff time needed to negotiate the federal regulatory maze.
Direct labor regulations, such as increases in the minimum wage, also
represent a comparatively larger burden for small firms. Consequently,
increasing levels of regulation tend to put small and medium-sized
businesses at a competitive cost disadvantage compared with larger
firms. (See, e.g., Ann P.  Bartel and Lacy Glenn Thomas, "Direct and
Indirect Effects of Regulation:  A New Look at OSHA's Impact," Journal
of Law and Economics, Vol.  28, No.  1 (April 1985), pp.  1-25; Ann P. 
Bartel and Lacy Glenn Thomas, "Predation Through Regulation:  The Wage
and Profit Effects of the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency," Journal of
Law and Economics, Vol.  30, No.  2 (October 1987), pp.  239-264; B. 
Peter Pashigian, "The Effects of Regulation on Optimal Plant Size and
Factor Shares," Journal of Law and Economics, Vol.  27, No.  1 (April
1984), pp.  1-28; B.  Peter Pashigian, "Environmental Regulation: 
Whose Self Interests Are Being Protected?" Economic Inquiry, Vol.  23,
No.  4 (October 1985), pp.  551-584.) 
<P>
      Future regulation will compound this problem. For example,
although President Clinton has yet to finalize his health care
proposals, he has indicated tentative support for proposals to require
firms to shoulder much of the cost of universal coverage for workers
and their families. This would significantly increase the cost of
hiring workers in the small business sector, where many firms
currently do not provide coverage. While 98 percent of all firms with
100 or more employees already provide health benefits, only 27 percent
of firms with fewer than 10 employees offer health benefits at
present. (Health Insurance Association of America, Source Book of
Health Insurance Data 1991 (Washington, D.C.:  Health Insurance
Association of America, 1991), p.  27 (Table 2.5).) In other words,
while 73 percent of firms with fewer than 10 employees would see their
cost of employing workers rise under either of these proposals, only 2
percent of firms with 100 or more employees would be significantly
affected.
<P>
      Out of the Frying Pan and into the Fire. To its credit, Congress
generally has tried to compensate for the disproportionate burden of
regulation on smaller firms by exempting firms below a certain size --
measured by the number of employees -- from various regulations. For
example, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of
1988, which requires employers to give employees and local government
officials advance notice before closing a plant or laying off workers,
only applies to firms with 100 or more employees. Likewise, the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 currently applies only
to firms with 25 or more employees. After July 26, 1994, however, the
ADA will apply to firms with 15 or more employees.
<P>
      Unfortunately, this well-intentioned approach does not really
solve the problem; it merely changes the form of the problem. In some
respects it may even make the problem worse, for it gives businesses
an incentive not to grow beyond a certain size. If a firm stays small
enough, it remains exempt from regulations. However, if it hires "too
many" workers, it becomes subject to various costly regulations. Thus,
instead of punishing firms merely for being small, federal regulations
also punish small firms for growing and creating more jobs.
<P>
      As a result, firms nearing the relevant threshold for a rule
have a powerful incentive to avoid hiring additional employees. For
example, in a letter to The Washington Times, the president of
Schonstedt Instrument Company of Reston, Virginia, tells how he has
deliberately kept his company below 50 employees in order to avoid
having to file certain forms with the federal government, because of
the cost and time involved. (E.O.  Schonstedt, letter to the editors,
The Washington Times, February 16, 1992, p.  B5.)
<P>
      Worse still, the prospect of an exemption from a regulation can
make it profitable for firms actually to reduce their workforces in
order to fall below the relevant threshold. For example, the Family
and Medical Leave Act of 1993, recently signed into law by President
Clinton, will apply to firms with 50 or more employees. Calculations
by the Joint Economic Committee (JEC) of Congress suggest that under
this law, a firm whose optimal size before the regulation was 60
employees might actually find it profitable to cut back to 49
employees. (Anderson and Gallaway, op.  cit., pp.  21-24.) As the JEC
report puts it, "Exemption from government regulations and mandates on
the basis of the size of a company is a guaranteed recipe for making
small businesses smaller." (Ibid., p.  24.)
<P>

THE MYTH THAT REGULATION CREATES JOBS
<P>
      Defenders of regulation sometimes argue that while regulation
may cut jobs in some firms, in general it is good for the economy and
creates jobs. A number of writers recently have made this argument in
connection with environmental regulation. (E.g., Timothy E.  Wirth,
"Easy Being Green...  Lighten Up, Loggers -- Environmentalism Actually
Creates Jobs," The Washington Post, October 4, 1992, p.  C3; Michael
Silverstein, "Bush's Polluter Protectionism Isn't Pro-Business," The
Wall Street Journal, May 28, 1992, p.  A21; Curtis Moore, "Bush's
Nonsense on Jobs and the Environment," The New York Times, September
25, 1992, p.  A33.) For example, it is pointed out that environmental
regulations stimulate employment in industries that manufacture
special devices required by government, such as scrubbers for
smokestacks, and create jobs in environmental clean-up firms.
Similarly, it is argued that securities regulations and the Treasury's
regulations interpreting the Internal Revenue Code create employment
for lawyers and accountants. 
<P>
      These arguments almost always rest on a basic economic fallacy:
they confuse the creation of jobs in a particular industry with the
creation of jobs for the economy as a whole. Thus while jobs are
indeed created in firms that assist in helping companies comply with
rules, these rules also cost jobs in the regulated industry. The
fallacy that adding costs to firms actually creates jobs in the
economy is a persistent fallacy that was refuted decades ago. Rather
than creating jobs, regulation simply diverts employment from
productive to unproductive activities, with a net loss in efficiency
and jobs. (See Frederic Bastiat, "What Is Seen and What Is Not Seen,"
in Frederic Bastiat, Selected Essays on Political Econ- omy, trans. 
Seymour Cain, ed.  George B.  de Huszar (Irvington-on-Hudson, New
York:  Foundation for Economic Education, 1964); Henry Hazlitt,
Economics in One Lesson (Westport, Connecticut:  Arlington House,
1979).) .In particular instances, the jobs created may be more or less
numerous than those destroyed. For example, if a new Medicare
regulation increases the cost of doing brain surgery, a hospital may
lay off one $300,000-per-year brain surgeon and hire three $30,000-
per-year administrators to fill in the relevant Medicare forms. In
other instances, however, a firm may lay off three blue-collar workers
and replace them with one higher-paid engineer. There is no reason to
expect the jobs that are created because of regulation to
systematically outnumber -- or pay more than -- the jobs that are
destroyed.

<P>
HOW TO AVOID UNNECESSARY JOB LOSSES
<P>
      Jobs are lost unnecessarily though regulation because currently
there is no explicit requirement that the employment effects of
regulation be considered, either by Congress when it legislates or by
federal regulatory agencies in the rule-making and enforcement
process. 
<P>
      Executive Order (EO) 12291, issued by President Reagan in
February 1981, does require executive branch agencies to inquire into
the overall costs and benefits of proposed regulations. However, EO
12291 does not explicitly require any particular kind of costs or
benefits to be counted. Thus, while the negative effects of a proposed
regulation on wages or employment levels can be counted as costs, they
do not have to be. Likewise, the employment-enhancing effects (if any)
of a proposed regulation can be counted as benefits, but need not be.
An agency thus may compute benefits and costs in dollars without ever
counting how many jobs would be gained or lost. Moreover, EO 12291
applies only to new regulations, not regulations that are already on
the books. And EO 12291 does not apply to any of the "independent"
regulatory agencies that lie outside the executive branch, such as the
Securities and Exchange Commission or the Federal Communications
Commission.
<P>
      This is not merely a problem in theory. A recent study by the
National Commission for Employment Policy examined the regulatory
review practices of seven federal agencies with major responsibility
for preparing and enforcing regulation. The study found that "federal
regulatory agencies . . . do not explicitly or systematically take
potential employment effects into consideration during the review
process, or in enforcement decisions." (Nancy A.  Bord, "Addressing
Employment Effects in the Regulatory Review Process," draft final
report prepared for the National Commission for Employment Policy,
September 9, 1992, p.  33.) Even when employment effects are
considered by the agencies, they are considered either in a simplistic
way, or on the basis of faulty assumptions and models. The
methodologies used vary from agency to agency, and even from
regulation to regulation within agencies. The study also found that
federal regulatory agencies generally fail to consider the cumulative
effects of existing regulations and the possible effects of new
regulations on existing rules. 
<P>
      Because regulation of one part of the economy can affect other
parts, and because regulations often interact with each other in
significant ways, no regulation can properly be judged or measured in
isolation. (An analogous point applies in the area of taxation: 
Because different taxes often interact with each other in important
ways, no individual tax can properly be evaluated in isolation.  In
fact, strictly speaking, taxes and regulations can only be analyzed in
conjunction with each other.  Each specific tax must be analyzed in
light of every other tax and every regulation, and each specific
regulation must be analyzed in light of every other regulation and
every tax.  See generally John R.  Hicks, Value and Capital, 2nd ed. 
(Oxford:  Oxford University Press, 1946); Arnold C.  Harberger,
Taxation and Welfare (Chicago:  University of Chicago Press, 1974).)
In fact, this interaction means the adoption of a new regulation can
increase the cost imposed by existing regulations. Therefore,
computing the total costs and benefits of any new regulation would
require determination of the net impact of all regulations taken
together. Generally speaking, the greater the volume of regulation
that already exists when a new regulation is introduced, the greater
will be the incremental, overall cost of adding the new regulation.
Failure to take account of this is one of the most important factors
contributing to the enormous growth in the overall regulatory burden.
It also helps explain the decline in U.S. labor productivity and wage
growth over the past two decades (see chart on following page), and
the decline in employment during the last two years.
<P>
      In light of the severe burden imposed by regulation on
employment, President Clinton and Congress should reform the
regulatory review process. Among the necessary reforms: 
<P>
Reform #1:      President Clinton should issue an executive order
                requiring explicit consideration of the employment
                effects of all new regulations. 
<P>
Reform #2:      Congress should extend the same requirements to all of
                the "independent" regulatory agencies that lie outside
                the executive branch.
<P>
Reform #3:      The President and Congress should establish a federal
                regulatory budget. 
<P>
      Under a regulatory budget, a limit would be placed on the total
estimated cost imposed on the economy each year by all federal
regulations. This limit would apply to new and existing regulations
taken together. Thus, if the budget had been reached, an agency
wishing to add a new regulation would have to repeal or modify an
existing regulation. If an agency could not find a large enough
offsetting reduction among the other regulations for which it was
responsible, the government would have to agree to an offsetting
reduction by another agency.
<P>
      The introduction of a regulatory budget would have several
virtues. First, it would place a limit on the total cost that can be
imposed on the economy by federal regulation. This total burden would
have to be a political decision, with ordinary Americans able to take
part in the national discussion. 
<P>
      Second, it would force agencies to debate each other to justify
the merits of proposed regulations, with the Office of Management and
Budget (or any other body designated by the President, such as the
newly created National Economic Council) making the final call. This
in turn would compel the agencies, as they are not compelled at
present, to think seriously about which regulations are most important
to them and yield the greatest benefits. 
<P>
      And third, it would give agencies the incentive to review their
existing regulations and find those which are not really worth
retaining -- or are causing greater job losses than expected -- in
order to make room for new regulations with a higher priority.
<P>
Reform #4:      Congress should require the expected employment
                effects of all proposed regulations to be published in
                the Federal Register before the regulations take
                effect. <P>
      Present law allows but does not require publication of expected
employment effects in the Federal Register. Congress should make such
disclosure mandatory. In the meantime, executive and independent
agencies should disclose expected job losses or wage reductions
voluntarily.This would permit the public to know the expected
magnitude of any job losses or net wage reductions. Thus Americans
could comment on this aspect of proposed regulations before they take
effect. This also would enable the public to compare actual job losses
with what was predicted at the time each regulation was issued. 

<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
      The President and Congress must do something to get the problem
of growing federal regulation under control. Regulation at the
federal, state, and local levels is now costing the American people
somewhere between $810 billion and $1.7 trillion per year, even after
taking account of benefits, or between $8,400 and $17,100 per year per
household. A major portion of this cost consists of the output that
the American economy could have been producing today but is not
because of over twenty years of excessive and inefficient regulation
-- somewhere between $450 billion and $1.1 trillion per year. 
<P>
      Another important cost of regulation is the failure to create
more employment opportunities for Americans who would like to work.
Many regulations directly increase the cost of employing workers and
therefore act just like a hidden tax on job creation and employment.
Unfortunately, regulation places especially heavy burdens on smaller
and medium-sized businesses, which are the primary engines of job
creation. As a consequence, there probably are at least three million
fewer private-sector jobs in the American economy than could have
existed today if the growth of regulation had been controlled and
regulations had been more sensibly and efficiently designed.
<P>
      While regulation has been taking a toll on employment throughout
the last two decades, the toll has risen sharply in just the last four
years. Moreover, two of the most significant and costly new
regulations of the last four years -- the 1990 Clean Air Act
Amendments and Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) -- only started
to take effect a few months ago; some of their provisions will not
take effect until the middle of 1994. So the impact of these
regulations on employment still lies in the future -- the heavy job
losses due to regulation in the last three years have been caused by
existing rules. In other words, the employment loss due to regulation
is almost certain to get worse if the President and Congress do not
take action. 
<P>
      Many specific federal regulatory programs deserve a drastic
overhaul. Even though repeal of such new regulatory programs as the
Clean Air Act Amendments and the ADA is politically unlikely, the
President and Congress could act to lighten the overall regulatory
burden in other areas. Reform of deposit insurance and federal banking
laws, for example, could help the entire economy and would do much to
alleviate the credit crunch that has restrained job creation by small
and medium-sized businesses over the past three years. (See William G. 
Laffer III, "How to Reform America's Banking System," Heritage
Foundation Backgrounder No.  810, February 26, 1991; Victor A.  Canto,
"The Credit Crunch" (La Jolla, California:  A.B.  Laffer, V.A.  Canto
& Associates, April 20, 1990); Victor A.  Canto, "The Credit Crunch
Revisited" (La Jolla, California:  A.B.  Laffer, V.A.  Canto &
Associates, November 16, 1990); William C.  Dunkelberg and William J. 
Dennis, Jr., "The Small Business Credit Crunch" (Washington, D.C.: 
NFIB Foundation, December 1992); Paul Craig Roberts, "Economic
Dominoes," National Review, November 30, 1992, pp.  37-42.  As
predicted by Canto and confirmed by Dunkelberg and Dennis, the credit
crunch has mainly affected medium-sized businesses and larger small
businesses (that is, those small businesses with at least 40
employees).) 
<P>
      But besides dealing with specific regulations, the regulatory
process itself is badly in need of reform. What is needed is for the
President and Congress to force agencies to inform Americans of the
likely employment effects of proposed rules and to set priorities in
rule-making. If these reforms are instituted, the federal government's
regulation of the economy could be conducted with the fewest pink
slips for American workers.

<TITLE>How to Solve the CBO's Telecom Tax Problem  -- Heritage </TITLE>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<CENTER><H3><I>HOW TO SOLVE THE CBO'S TELECOM TAX PROBLEM </I>
</H3>
<P> 
By Adam D. Thierer<BR> 
Executive Memorandum #414<br>
May 23, 1995<P>
</CENTER><HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>
 
	The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has scored S. 
652, the Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act 
of 1995, as a new $7 billion tax on the telecommunications 
industry.  The reason for this is that certain provisions of 
the legislation expand federally mandated subsidy transfers 
across industries, maintaining lower prices in one segment 
of the market (local, rural, and residential) at the expense 
of another (urban, business, and long-distance).  Although 
the subsidies do not flow directly through the federal 
government, the CBO correctly concludes that they should be 
scored as taxes because "payments between companies are made 
as a result of the exercise of the sovereign power of the 
federal government, not as a normal business transaction 
between companies." 
 <P>
	S.  652, as currently drafted, will increase the use of 
these subsidy flows to deliver more advanced 
telecommunications services to some Americans.  
Traditionally, these subsidies have been used only to spread 
the delivery of basic telephone service.  The new 
legislation, however, requires an "evolving" definition of 
universal service, meaning more than basic phone service 
must be subsidized.  In addition, the bill demands that all 
Americans be provided with advanced telecommunications 
services once "a substantial majority" have access.  These 
provisions would be extremely costly to administer and, 
therefore, would require increased taxes. 
 <P>
	While these problems must be addressed, Congress should 
not permit CBO's findings to threaten the success of broader 
legislative initiatives to deregulate the telecommunications 
industry.  Fortunately, lawmakers have two options for 
addressing these findings and continuing to move forward 
with this legislation:  
 <P>
 
 OPTION #1: 	 Give states control of universal service. 
 <P>
 
	The current federal telecommunications entitlement 
program, with its overlapping and inefficient cross-
subsidies, should end.  Congress could do this by giving 
states responsibility for designing, defining, financing, 
and delivering universal service.  Roughly three-fourths of 
these subsidies already are administered at the state and 
local levels.  Congress could establish a Federal-State 
Joint Board to transfer any remaining federal authority to 
the states.  The Board also could provide guidance to the 
states on how to eliminate current cross-subsidies that flow 
to multi-billion dollar corporations.  It could replace them 
with means-tested vouchers that give individual consumers 
deemed needy the means to choose among several providers, 
instead of forcing them to rely on a single monopolistic 
provider. 
 <P>
	This is a sound policy option to address the tax 
problem created by an inefficient system of subsidies to 
large corporations.  By contrast, any plan to maintain a 
federal role in the delivery of universal service would 
require tax increases to cover subsidy costs.  Sending or 
"devolving" all responsibility to the states would eliminate 
this federal tax problem while ensuring that universal 
service is delivered more effectively. 
 <P>
OPTION #2:  Table universal service for further study while 
moving forward with other                        
deregulatory initiatives. 
 
 <P>
	Congress could move forward with its broader efforts to 
remove barriers to entry, putting off reform of 
subsidization mechanisms for a few months and dealing with 
it in separate legislation at a later date.  This would 
eliminate the federal tax problem as long as other 
legislative provisions do not create additional cross-
subsidies.  However, Congress must follow three steps to 
ensure that any bill that passes does not contain a telecom 
tax: 
 <P>
STEP 1:	Eliminate all current universal service language 
from the bill. 
 <P>
STEP 2:	Do nothing to alter the current system in the 
interim. 
 <P>
STEP 3:	Include a provision requiring the Federal 
Communications Commission (FCC) or a presidentially 
appointed independent panel to complete a study within six 
months after enactment that requires the FCC or the panel to 
do the following: 
 <P>
Provide a detailed description of all implicit and explicit 
subsidies (both federal and state) utilized currently to 
provide universal service. 
 <P>
Quantify the cost of each of the described subsidies and the 
economic costs and benefits associated with each subsidy.  
This also would include a description of the providers and 
recipients of such subsidies. 
 <P>
Present its findings to Congress for immediate 
consideration.  The study also should have to present 
Congress with alternative policy options for ensuring the 
delivery of universal service.  This would need to include 
the feasibility of giving states complete responsibility for 
universal service as outlined in Option #1.  If Congress 
requires the FCC or an independent panel to study the 
current universal service system and policy alternatives, it 
will have more and better information than    currently 
exists on how to reform the system.  
 <P>
	 These two options provide Congress with a solution to 
CBO's findings while continuing to pursue broader 
telecommunications reform.  Such reform is critical to 
dismantling a system that now destroys competitive  
incentives in the local telephone market while draining 
billions of dollars from American businesses and  consumers.

<title>A Case for Principled Judicial Activism- Heritage</title>

<h3>A CASE FOR PRINCIPLED JUDICIAL ACTIVISM</h3><P>
<b>By James L. Huffman </b><br>
May 20, 1993<br>

<P>
Most political conservatives believe in the principle of judicial
restraint.  I share that conviction, but I also believe in judicial
activism.  My purpose today is to make a case for principled judicial
activism.  In the process I will argue that the traditional
conservative doctrine of judicial restraint poses a serious threat to
liberty, and is therefore not consistent with the fundamental
objective of the framers of the United States Constitution.
<P>
     Our Libertarian Constitution. I begin from the premise that the
United States Constitution, even in its civic republicanism, is a
fundamentally libertarian document.  This foundational premise is
critical to my argument, because the case for pervasive judicial
restraint, of the type practiced by the conservatives on the Supreme
Court, is based upon a very different foundational premise.  Their
premise is that the United States Constitution is founded upon
democratic majoritarianism.  Their commitment to this view is drawn
from the recently rediscovered civic republicanism of the framers.  My
libertarian understanding of the Constitution does not deny the
framers' commitment to civic republicanism.  However, I understand
that commitment very differently than do the conservatives on our
Supreme Court.  It should be of no small concern to conservatives that
the understanding of civic republicanism upon which the generally
accepted doctrine of judicial restraint relies is precisely the
understanding of civic republicanism which drives the vast regulatory
agenda of the new administration.  In a different lecture I might
marshall the evidence which supports my libertarian interpretation of
the Constitution and its relation to civic republicanism.  For the
present I will rely upon a concise statement of libertarian, civic
republicanism as expressed by the Anti-federalist Republicus, writing
in the Kentucky Gazette of February 16, 1788:
<P>

 <BLOCKQUOTE> Thus it appears how civil government becomes a substitute
     for moral virtue:  and that instead of infringing the
     rightful liberties of mankind, it tends to secure them:  and
     by this criterion may every government be tried:  that
     government which tends not to secure the lives, liberties,
     and properties of every individual of the community, as far
     as the law of reason would have done, is unjust and
     iniquitous and merits not the name of civil government.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     The Philosophy of Judicial Restraint. The highest responsibility
of every federal judge, affirmed by an oath of office, is to uphold
the Constitution.  I do not believe that the philosophy of judicial
restraint, which dominated federal judicial selection during the
Reagan and Bush Administrations, conforms to this high responsibility. 
I believe that the responsibility of a federal judge, to state it in
the language of restraint, is to be restrained in the interpretation
of constitutionally enacted legislation and regulations, and to be
aggressively activist in the protection of individual liberty.  My
purpose is to explain how a judge can justify the role I urge.
<P>
     Much recent Supreme Court case law seems to have had the purpose
of withdrawing the federal courts from essentially political matters. 
This is a good objective, but not when accomplished pursuant to a
philosophy of restraint which leads judges to fail in the performance
of their responsibilities under the Constitution.  In its rush to
avoid participation in politics, the Court has abandoned its
responsibility to uphold the political philosophy of our Constitution. 
Judicial restraint is not a part of that philosophy; it is not a
constitutional end.  It is a means which can serve constitutional ends
only if we understand how it relates to our fundamental political
philosophy.
<P>
     First, we should ask why conservatives would adhere to a
principle of judicial restraint.  Many will recall the oft-quoted
Tocqueville statement that every political issue in America is sooner
or later a judicial issue.  If Tocqueville meant that every political
contest may raise a judicial question, he was surely correct.  If he
meant that every political question is ultimately resolved by the
courts, he was not describing the 19th century federal courts he was
observing.  He would have been correct, however, had he been
describing the mid- and late 20th century federal courts. 
Tocqueville, like so many conservatives today, made the mistake of
concluding that judicial review is inevitably political.  Properly
done, judicial review is essential to the implementation of a
political philosophy.  Improperly done, as it has been for the last
half century, it is a political act itself.  Advocates of judicial
restraint would do well to understand the difference between judicial
adherence to a political philosophy and judicial participation in
politics.
<P>
     Why do conservatives advocate judicial restraint?  Four
traditional conservative arguments for a comprehensive philosophy of
judicial restraint come to mind. 
<P>

First, judicial activism is said to be undemocratic.  The federal
     courts are not democratic institutions.  Their role, the Supreme
     Court seems to say, is to permit the body politic to make its
     choices. 
<P>
Second, it might be argued that judicial activism is unconstitutional.
     It is not the role which the Constitution sets out for the
     courts, and correctly so because the courts are not competent to
     engage in public policy-making. 
<P>
Third, it would be unprincipled for judicial conservatives to be
     activist in light of their long-standing criticism of the
     activism of judicial liberals. 
<P>
Lastly, to take the opportunity to be activist, now that conservatives
     are in judicial power, would only legitimize activism by liberals
     when they come back into power, which they will do if ever they
     manage to meet their own, self-imposed, diversity requirements in
     making new appointments to the federal bench.
<P>
     Except for the last, I do not disagree with any of these
arguments in the abstract.  But I do not believe that they justify the
sort of restraint which the conservatives on the federal courts have
exercised over the last several years.  As to the first three
arguments, I will endeavor to explain in some detail how I believe the
arguments have been misapplied.  With respect to the argument of
setting a precedent for future liberal judges, I would suggest that
they will require no such precedent.  They will take their slice of
the pie when the opportunity arises.  The hope, if there is any, for
influencing future liberals on the court, is to establish a
libertarian principle of judicial decision-making which even they will
not be able to ignore.  Federal courts can insist, in other words,
that liberals respect the meaning of the label they proudly wear. 
<P>
      I believe that conservatives have gone astray in part because
they have framed the issue of judicial review too narrowly.  The issue
is not just who decides, but who decides what?  The fact that we have
committed some issues to the democracy, does not mean that we have
committed all issues to the democracy.  The Constitution recognizes
implicitly that state legislatures retain their police powers and
explicitly that the federal government has enumerated powers.  The
Constitution also limits both state and federal legislative powers. 
The democracy is thus limited and to that extent the judiciary not
only does not intrude upon the democracy when it enforces those
limits, it is constitutionally required to do so.  Those matters which
are constitutionally within the power of the federal and state
legislatures are not the concern of the judiciary and the Supreme
Court is correct in calling for judicial restraint.  But this does not
translate into a constitutional doctrine of judicial restraint on
every issue which might come before a court.
<P>
     The federal courts have a responsibility to determine whether or
not legislative actions are constitutionally within the power of
Congress.  John Marshall settled this question in Marbury, and,
notwithstanding volumes of discussion on the subject in the
intervening years, no one seriously questions the principle today. 
Where does a court look to answer this question?  It looks to the
power-allocating and rights-protecting provisions of the Constitution. 
This question is not to be answered without an understanding of the
Constitution as an expression of political philosophy. 
<P>
      A central point of the work I am currently doing on federalism
is that power allocation is not simply a power struggle between
competing governors, although it is inevitably that.  Under our
Constitution, it is also a careful assignment and division of power
for the purpose of assuring that government serves the interests of
the people who constitute it.  The allocation of power among levels of
government is not an issue in which many people take an abstract
interest.  We are interested in the question only as it affects our
individual and group interests.  One does not value federal power over
state power except to the extent that one will be better served in
some sense by federal power than by state power.  The same can be said
of the separation of powers among the judicial, legislative, and
executive branches.  No one, other than those who occupy the various
positions of power, can have any abstract interest in which branch of
government exercises what powers.  The structure of government has no
end in itself.  The framers of the Constitution did not agonize for
four months about structure because they cared passionately about the
question in the abstract.  Rather they cared passionately about the
lives of those who would be governed, and they understood that the
allocation of power would have great implications for those human
lives.
<P>
     The Presumption for Individual Rights. A court also looks to the
rights-protecting provisions of the Constitution to define the
legitimate power of government.  Because our Constitution contains an
enumeration of these rights guarantees, conservative judges, following
the thinking of Robert Bork and others, have expressed concern about
the judicial creation of rights which are not expressly guaranteed in
the Constitution.  But why should we interpret a libertarian
constitution to be parsimonious on rights?  Of course I need to
convince you that it is a libertarian constitution, but if I convince
you, then you should be persuaded to conclude that perhaps both
Lochner and Griswold got it right.  I do not say, therefore, that Roe
got it right.  That is a much more difficult question in my mind, but
not because of a tension between the rights of the majority to
regulate abortion and the right of a woman to have an abortion, but
rather because of the tension among the rights of the woman, the
fetus, and the prospective father.  Lochner and Griswold were about
the relationship between the individual and the state.  Roe was about
the competing rights claims of individuals.  In the former cases, a
libertarian constitution requires a presumption in favor of the
individual.  In the latter case, libertarian values do not establish a
clear presumptive favorite.
<P>
     We all know well the history of the Bill of Rights and of the
Ninth Amendment.  The Philadelphia framers did not include a Bill of
Rights in their proposed constitution.  Had their proposal been
ratified as proposed, would today's judicial restraintists contend
that the only rights individuals have against the federal government
are those few expressed in Article I, Section 9?  Would the philosophy
of judicial restraint require us to conclude that the Constitution
proposed by the Philadelphia convention provided no protection against
federal intrusions upon free speech, religious freedom, or due
process?   Of course we do have a Bill of Rights, and it includes the
Ninth Amendment.  Does it make more sense to say that the Ninth
Amendment is a truism or an empty vessel than to say it is filled with
the philosophy of libertarianism? 
<P>
      This is not, I would suggest, the position of one who would
rewrite the Constitution.  I believe I stand firmly on the ground of
framer intent.  Without reference to framer intent, or to some intent
other than that of the immediate decisionmaker, we have no
constitution.  Constitutional government is by definition limited
government and limited government requires that the constitution have
anterior meaning.  To accept all Supreme Court interpretation of the
Constitution as the meaning of that document is to abandon framer
intent in favor of the intent of the last court to decide. 
<P>
      But we should not be so naive as to believe that the framers of
the Constitution could somehow have expressed their intent clearly and
without doubt in their language.  We know a good deal about what the
framers valued and sought to accomplish.  There is more than
sufficient evidence that liberty was a central concern, if not the
central concern.  I do not deny that the division between individual
rights and the power of the state to regulate for the promotion of
individual rights is a difficult problem, but it is clear to me what
the judicial posture should be with respect to that issue. 
<P>
      Why should the judiciary defer to the democracy, as Justice
Scalia would have it?  Is the democracy threatened by an occasional
overreaching on the rights side?  Did Lochner or Griswold hamstring
the democracy so that it could not perform its constitutional
functions?  If we are to err, we should err on the side of liberty. 
Who has the power in this business of government?  Do claims of
individual right threaten the survival of the community?  Justice
Holmes once suggested that speech might on some occasions present a
clear and present danger to the survival of the nation, but those
occasions have proven rare indeed.  All the evidence we have before us
in the form of pervasive federal and state regulation demonstrates
that government has no problem aggregating and exercising power. 
Liberty has always been at risk in every society in the world.  If the
courts have any role to play in preserving our constitutional system,
surely it is to side with liberty and the individual.  The executive
and legislative branches of government have done quite well on their
own.
<P>
     The Presumption for Democracy. In an odd sort of way,
conservative judicial restraintists have joined with John Hart Ely in
the belief that judicial review is rooted in the protection of
democracy.  But why this persistent concern about democracy?  No doubt
the courts will and should intervene to halt governmental action that
violates the democratic principle, but do we do it for the sake of
democracy?  Is ours centrally a democratic constitution?  Is democracy
the ultimate goal of our system of government?  Can anyone articulate
a case for democracy that is not rooted in some more fundamental
value?  I think not.  I think democracy is, and, as Martin Diamond has
demonstrated, was in the view of the framers, the least worst form of
government.  Remember, it is American not to trust government.  Not
even democratic government.  Have we forgotten Madison's warning of
the tyranny of the majority?  The risks of tyranny are less in a
democracy than in other forms of government, but they persist
nonetheless.  Who is there to guard against such tyranny but the
courts?  But if the courts adhere to a judicial philosophy the
fundamental principle of which is deference to the democracy, the
tyrannous democracy will go unchecked.  By definition it will not be
checked by the people.  There is nowhere to turn but the courts, and
they, inspired by a simplistic philosophy of judicial restraint, will
have abandoned liberty for democracy and community.  Ironically, the
conservative judges have laid a solid foundation for the communitarian
visions of the new administration.
<P>
     Why is democracy the least worst form of government?  Why is it
the best form of government?  Is there something to be valued in
having 50 percent of the population plus one dictate to the other
members of society?  Is there something mystical about the agreement
of a majority which changes the self-interested opinions of
individuals into the public good?  Or, if you believe that individuals
have a dual capacity as self-interested consumers and public spirited
citizens, do differing opinions of the public good become the public
good simply by the agreement of 50 percent plus one?  I believe that
the reason democracy is the least worst, or best, form of government
is because it comes as close as we can in an extended republic to
permitting individuals control on their lives.  We value democracy
because it is as close as functional government can come to being
libertarian.  Only unanimity would totally satisfy liberty, but in a
society of 280 million we must settle for republican democracy.  We
settle for it not because it has merit by itself, rather because it
serves, as best we know how, liberty.
<P>
     Deciding the Claims of Liberty. The classic formulation of the
problem of liberty is that each individual should have the maximum
liberty consistent with the equal liberty of all other individuals. 
Holmes described this as a shibboleth, but it is not.  It is the
essential challenge of liberty.  When does government regulation
promote liberty and when does it interfere with liberty?  Consider a
D.C.  ordinance which prohibits discrimination on the basis of
hairstyle or dress.  Is this regulation consistent with a libertarian
constitution?  I do not find this case very difficult.  It is quite
clear to me that individual liberty is limited rather than promoted by
the regulation, notwithstanding that an articulated purpose of the
regulation is no doubt to promote liberty. 
<P>
      But we cannot decide every claim of liberty on an ad hoc
balancing in particular cases.  That would be the rule of man (and
woman), not the rule of law.  Our solution to this problem is rights. 
In the case at issue the rights question is whether the employer or
landlord has the right to hire or rent to whom they please or the
prospective employee or tenant has the right to dress and appear as
they please.  A positivist judge may conclude that the D.C.  ordinance
settles the question in favor of the prospective employee or tenant. 
But there is more positive law to be referenced, namely the
Constitution of the United States.  Does the police power of the
state, or in this case the enumerated and implied powers of Congress,
extend to such regulation?  Probably so, under established doctrine,
but it is just possible that we have it wrong, if liberty is our
standard. 
<P>
      But even in cases like this, rights problems are not simple. 
Courts are often faced with competing claims of right and it is the
nature of our system that the judge can seldom cut the baby in half. 
It is one way or the other.  One claimant wins and has the claimed
right.  The other claimant loses and does not have the claimed right. 
The definition and protection of liberty requires the drawing of
boundaries between people.  By deferring to past court decisions which
have permitted the democratic or bureaucratic denial of liberty,
courts violate their obligation to uphold the Constitution. 
<P>
      Feminist theorists like Catherine MacKinnon would have courts
refuse to draw these boundaries in the interest of community and
caring, but to do so, even in the name of democracy, is to abandon the
liberty of the individual to the whims of the state.  Catherine
McKinnon's (and I fear Bill and Hillary Clinton's) vision of the
Constitution is not the vision of the framers.  Perhaps their
communitarian vision is the wave of the future, but it is not for the
President or the courts to amend the vision of the framers.  Until the
Constitution is constitutionally amended, it is for the courts to
insist that the President and the Congress adhere to the vision of the
framers. 
<P>
      Wetlands as Liberty's Battleground. The definition of the
judicial role is much simpler where the regulation in question
purports to be in the public interest.  Section 404 of the Clean Water
Act, which says absolutely nothing about wetlands, has been
interpreted to be a congressionally mandated requirement that the
Corps of Engineers issue a permit before any wetland is filled or
otherwise destroyed.  Is this within the constitutional power of the
Congress?  A federal circuit court said no in the Hoffman Estates
case.  It was a bold act by federal judges; so bold that the circuit
court, acting en banc, withdrew the opinion.  All lawyers learned in
law school that Congress can do anything it wants pursuant to the
Commerce Clause.  Section 404 is a regulation of the navigable waters
of the United States, broadly construed.  A long line of cases
upholding federal regulation of everything from the feeding of
homegrown wheat fed to homegrown cows to the regulation of race
relations in establishments serving nonresident hamburger should make
it clear that the owners of lands with isolated wetlands must comply
with Section 404.  But a federal circuit panel said no, this makes
absolutely no sense.  And we all know they were right, even if the
opinion has disappeared from the Federal Reporter in the name of the
rule of law and judicial restraint.
<P>
     Court of Claims Chief Judge Loren Smith has decided two wetlands
takings cases, Loveladies Harbor and Florida Rock, which are in direct
conflict, most would say, with Supreme Court takings jurisprudence as
expressed in the Penn Central case.  Judge Smith is also right.  Judge
Smith also will probably be overturned, if not in those cases then in
some others.  But Judge Smith might not be overturned, and if he is
not he will have served the interests of our libertarian Constitution. 
He will have had the courage to say that the emperor has no clothes. 
And while abridging the law as interpreted by prior judges, he will be
upholding the rule of law as it must be understood under a libertarian
Constitution.
<P>
     What is the point of the rule of law?  It is to avoid the rule of
man and woman.  Which is to say it is to avoid the rule of the king,
the dictator, the arbitrary judge, and the tyrannous majority.  The
rule of law is about liberty.  We value it because we value liberty
and the certainty which guaranteed liberty provides to human lives. 
To be judicially restrained in the name of the rule of law without
reference to the reason we value the rule of law is to put form over
substance.
<P>
     Our Conservative Judges. Our Constitution is not just a machine
that would go of itself, in the words of Michael Kammen.  If a
machine, it is one with a purpose.  When, while being maintained by
the Supreme Court, it goes of itself to produce results for which it
was not intended, we need a new maintenance crew which will make the
necessary repairs.  The conservatives on the Supreme Court are not
that crew.  They have as much as said (see O'Connor in the abortion
cases) that if the court gets it wrong it will have to stay wrong. 
That is what judicial restraint requires.  But that is not what
liberty requires.  They clearly need some help from below.
<P>
     Part of the problem is that our conservative judges, like all of
our lawyers, are trained in the tradition of Langdellian legal
science.  All will readily proclaim themselves legal realists, but
they will behave as legal scientists, asking only what is the law?  It
is not for the judge to ask what the law ought to be.  That is for
legislators.  But that is for legislators only within their
constitutional domain.  The law ought to be what it was intended to be
and when we have gotten it wrong we should set it right. 
<P>
      Popular Sovereignty, Not Democracy. Liberty is too important to
be sacrificed to an abstract commitment to judicial restraint. 
Deference to democracy is appropriate where the democracy has the
constitutional responsibility.  What the courts should ultimately
defer to is popular sovereignty, not democracy.  There is a
difference.  Popular sovereignty is about individual people having
control, not about the people as some mystical entity having control. 
We have come to associate the term sovereignty only with states in the
general sense of that term.  But sovereignty is said to derive from
the people.  Why?  Because each individual is and ought to be an
autonomous, sovereign entity.  This idea is at the heart of 18th
century social contract theory which was so important to the framers
of the Constitution. 
<P>
      The Constitution is the creation of popular sovereignty, and it
is that to which the courts should defer.  The conservative position,
as expressed by many federal judges, is not neutral.  There are not
neutral principles for judges to hide behind.  When Holmes said in
Lochner that the Constitution does not enact any particular philosophy
he was wrong.  Without a philosophy the Constitution is an empty
vessel.  The conservative, judicial restraint position serves a
particular conception of the Constitution, and I believe it is not a
conception the framers intended.  The judicial restraint of
conservatism is rooted in majoritarianism, not libertarianism.  Even
if one can make a case of framer intention to create a government
which would promote and enforce civic virtue, it cannot be made in the
name of majoritarianism.
<P>
     It strikes me in reading many judicial opinions that one of the
problems with our judiciary is that our judges have too much
experience with the real world.  Judges have served in agencies and in
Congress and have worked in law firms.  They have learned how to solve
immediate problems for their clients and constituents.  But we need a
little of the vision thing, and not just prospective vision.  A little
hindsight would be helpful; there is much to be learned and remembered
from our past.  The ideas debated by Madison and Hamilton and
Jefferson and Marshall are relevant to more than isolated legal
controversies.  They are fundamental to what our society has been and
will become.
<P>
     For Judicial Activism. In sum, my argument is this.  The federal
courts should be restrained in the review of actions which are
constitutionally undertaken by the other branches and levels of
government.  Indeed once the court concludes that government has acted
within its constitutional powers, there is no further role for the
court.  This means there is no room for judicial utilitarianism, ... la
Judge Richard Posner, or for judicial communitarianism, ... la Justices
Douglas, Rehnquist, and Scalia.  But in deciding whether or not the
government is acting within its constitutional powers, as defined by
constitutional definitions and allocations of power and by
constitutional guarantees of individual rights, the courts should be
unabashedly activist. 
<P>
      To illustrate I will return to the takings cases decided by
Judge Loren Smith and now pending before the Federal Circuit.  These
cases involve challenges to the Corps of Engineers's implementation of
Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, what has come to be our wetlands
protection statute.  A federal judge might be asked to address several
questions in such a challenge.  1) It might be asked whether the
federal government has the constitutional authority to regulate the
lands in question.  Assuming that the government does have such power,
2) it might be asked whether the government's regulation of the lands
in question is in the public interest in light of the economic uses to
which the land might be put.  Or 3) it might be asked, assuming again
that the government has the power, whether the Corps has properly
delineated the lands in question as wetlands.  Finally, assuming that
the government has the power and has properly delineated the wetlands,
4) it might be asked whether the government action constitutes a
taking of private property.  On the second and third questions,
whether the government has acted in the public interest and whether
the Corps has properly delineated the wetlands, I argue for judicial
restraint.  The courts know nothing of the public interest nor of
wetland hydrology and biology.  On the first and fourth issues, on the
questions of the extent of government power and of the individual
rights limits on government power, I argue that the federal courts
should be aggressively activist. 
<P>
      To defer to the legislature and the agency on the issues of the
extent of and limits on government power, on the grounds of democracy
is to abandon the notion of constitutional government in favor of
something resembling parliamentary sovereignty.  The vast array of
balancing tests to which our Supreme Court has reduced constitutional
law is the inevitable consequence of such deference.  The Warren Court
did it selectively; the Reagan Court has set out to do it on
principle.  The loss of liberty is the price we pay for adherence to
this so-called conservative principle. 
<P>
      There is no point in insisting upon the rule of law if that law
has no regard for liberty.  Rather than adhere to this principled
restraint in the vain hope that a future liberal court will do the
same -- that we will not again go from Lochner to Griswold -- we
should recognize that both Lochner and Griswold had it right.  As has
been said of free speech, liberty is meaningful only if it has
application to those exercises of liberty which we detest.  If
conservatives embrace the liberties of the left as well as those of
the right; if conservatives embrace the rights of free speech and
criminal due process with the same enthusiasm as they do economic
liberties and the Second Amendment, then they will have set a
libertarian precedent which a liberal court will have difficulty
ignoring.  A reliance on libertarian principal will force liberal
judges to recognize the inappropriate activism of their balancing
tests and the unacceptability of their distinction between economic
and personal liberties.
<P>
     The most significant accomplishment of the Reagan-Bush
Administrations has been the staffing of the federal courts with
intelligent judges.  My fear is that the Reagan revolution will come
to nothing as these judges sit on their hands in the name of a
simplistic theory of judicial restraint.  It is a theory which accepts
majoritarian tyranny as a constitutional requirement.  James Madison
would be dismayed.  The price, as Madison and his contemporaries
warned, will be the continued erosion of liberty.<P>

<p>
Since the publication of "A Nation at Risk" in 1983, Americans have become increasingly alarmed about the dismal results and soaring costs of their public schools. No group of citizens has a closer view of these problems or a more immediate stake in addressing them than the parents of the country's 48 million schoolchildren. Here and there, parents have won minor battles to influence curricula or oust mediocre school-board members. But as individuals, parents are no match for the forces that favor the status quo.<p>
Parents' most promising forum to agitate for reform and hold their local educators accountable for failure already exists: the venerated National Congress of Parents and Teachers, commonly known as the PTA. Unfortunately, parents cannot count on either their local PTA or its national leadership to advance parental interestsor even air diverse viewpoints. As it operates today, the PTA is useless to parents who want to play a meaningful role in educational reform. <p>
The mission of the PTA has always been to "work on behalf of the best interests of all children on issues that affect their health, education, and welfare" and "to encourage parent involvement." With almost seven million members, the PTA offers great potential for promoting parental involvement in the educational welfare of children. But in the 1990s, that mission requires of the PTA something it has been unwilling to do: demand accountability for performance and spending at every level of the educational system.<p><center><b>Local Control</center></b><p>
Decades ago, parents had significant influence over their neighborhood schools. Over the years, however, school districts consolidated, teachers and administrators came to see themselves as credentialed professionals, and state laws standardized educational practices and curricula. Today, many parents are less likely to get involved in their children's educational environment. Nevertheless, the impetus for reform will have to come from parents active at the grass roots.<p>
The PTA ought to be helping such parents overcome the considerable barriers to holding local educators accountable. For instance, it should be of great concern to parents that student grades tend to be as high in low-achieving as in high-achieving schools, but the PTA deliberately avoids such educational issues.<p>
In the annual battles over allocating financial resources, the PTA should play a major role in deciphering complicated budgets for the benefit of interested parents. Instead, PTAs rally with teachers unions for tax increases, seldom questioning the effect on parents or the educational outcomes for students.<p>
Parents also deserve greater consideration of their  interests in the contract negotiations that determine pay and working conditions for teachers. For instance, teachers in Montgomery County, Maryland, refused to write recommendations for their college-bound students because such "extra" duties weren't in their contract. In some areas, a parent who wishes to lodge a complaint about a teacher must navigate a bureaucratic process established by contract. Parents may have to submit a written account of the grievance in order to secure a meeting with the teacher, who has the right to bring along a union representative. Some parents find such time-consuming and intimidating conditions a clear subordination of parental interests to teacher rights.<p>
It is indisputable that teachers are already well represented in negotiations. Therefore, an effective local PTA that works on behalf of parental interests should insist on more than the current minimal accord paid to parental concerns. Working through the PTA, parents could ensure that their schools:
<ul><li>Demand pro-parent scrutiny of teacher contracts;<li>Justify their annual budgets;<li>Air alternative views to the pro-union positions on privatization, teacher tenure, tuition-tax credits, school choice, and teacher standards;<li>Establish expeditious complaint procedures so that parents could challenge decisions and actions of teachers or administrators;<li>Make certain that student grades provide parents with adequate information about the educational progress of their children, or lack of it.</UL>	
<p>
Nowadays, local matters are greatly affected by policy at higher levels. State governments now have a hand in everything from funding to curricular standards. President Clinton's Goals 2000 legislation, enacted last year and under review by the new Republican-controlled Congress, may bring down the heavy hand of the federal government, too (see sidebar, page 88). Similarly, PTA members who wish to be active at the local level must take account of PTA policies set by the state and national hierarchies and imposed on individual chapters.<p>
At the least, the PTA has the power to keep parents informed of academic issues, from educational policies set at the national and state levels to the curriculum and employment practices of their local schools. At its best, the PTA could help frame the national debate over educational reform, lobby for some of the reforms that debate has already produced, and work to change the restrictive collective-bargaining statutes that tend to shield teacher unions and teachers from accountability and limit parental involvement.<p>Why the PTA Is Weak
<ul><li>PTA's ineffectiveness can be attributed to six inter-related areas:<li>Misdirected resources. At the local level, the PTA has become a fundraising auxiliary for school districts, while its child-advocacy efforts have focused on social, non-educational issues.<li>Stifled debate. Many PTA officials stifle open discussion of controversial issues and discourage parents from questioning the PTA's official positions.<li>Ignorance. Most PTA members have no idea of the policies advocated in their name by the PTA hierarchy at the national and state levels.<li>Careerism. The PTA's national officers are elected by a restrictive process that requires a national PTA presidential candidate to make a commitment of nearly 10 years to rise "through the chairs." Consequently, many PTA national leaders serve long after their own children have left school.<li>Transient membership. Parental interest is often high at the elementary-school level, tapers off in middle school, and all but disappears in high school. As a result, PTA officers and professional staff have inordinate influence.<li>Teachers-union influence. National PTA policies, which often are automatically adopted as state and local PTA policies, reflect the dominant influence of the teachers unions, especially the National Education Association (NEA). </ul>
<p>
Of these factors, by far the most important is the last. Parents and teachers in the PTA both claim to share the same goal: promoting the educational welfare of children. But the PTA's governance structure, in which unionized teachers play a major role, is fatally flawed. Fundamentally, parents and their children are the consumers of education; teachers are part of the producer complex. Elevating the interests of the producers above the interests of the consumers is a formula for irrelevance. In the last 12 months, I have attended two national PTA meetings and five state conventions, and I cannot recall a single instance in which any policy contrary to the interests of teachers unions was given a proper hearing.<p>
Ever since the 1960s, the NEA and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) have lobbied vigorously for state legislation requiring school boards to bargain collectively with teachers unions over the terms and conditions of employment. Teachers have the statutory right to bargain collectively in 34 states and the District of Columbia. Many school districts outside of those states engage in de facto collective bargaining with the teachers unions. By its refusal to challenge the teachers unions in collective bargaining, the PTA has eliminated itself as an independent advocate for parents. The PTA claims to "seek to participate in the decisionmaking process establishing school policy." But whenever school boards sacrifice parental interests to union interests as often happens in these negotiations, the PTA cannot and will not object.<p>
Such impotence has been apparent at least since the PTA's 1968 position statement on "teacher negotiations, sanctions, and strikes." The PTA resolution, reaffirmed in 1987, identifies the "dilemmas" that teacher militancy and union negotiations impose on PTA members:<ul>
<p>
"1. If the PTA provides volunteers to man the classrooms, during a work stoppage, in the interest of protecting the immediate safety and welfare of children, it is branded as a strike breaker.<p>
"2. If the PTA does not take sides in issue[s] being negotiated, it is accused of not being interested.<p>
"3. If it supports the positions of the board of education, which is the representative of the public in negotiations, the teacher members of the PTA have threatened to withdraw membership and boycott the local PTA activities." (Italics added.)</ul>
<p>
Collective bargaining is used in most school districts to resolve such issues as teacher compensation for extra curricular activities, class size, parental grievance procedures, and the frequency and scheduling of parent/teacher conferences. In effect, the PTA does not take sides on issues subject to bargaining, regardless of their impact on students, parents, or the public. That position constitutes a major victory for unions and a setback for parents.<p>
How are PTA members supposed to respond to this dilemma? The 1968 resolution urges them to be alert to symptoms of teacher dissatisfaction (abnormal turnover, complaints, and "teacher-supported legislation defeated by state legislature") before a strike and to promote the public airing of issues. At no point does the PTA suggest that teacher dissatisfaction may be unwarranted. The PTA's statement acknowledges that the teachers' threat to withdraw membership and boycott the organization greatly concerns the scores of PTA's professional staff members at the state and national organizations.<p>
This surrender may have the cost the organization anyway. The PTA does not keep track of the ratio of teachers to parents among its membership. But we do know that membership peaked in 1966, when more than 12 million teachers, administrators, and parents were members of the National PTA.<p>
The organization then lost more than six million members from 1966 to 1982, years when collective bargaining by teachers unions increased to unprecedented levels. With the withdrawal of parent activists who refused to accept the PTA's subservience to union interests, the PTA has evolved into an NEA front on non-educational as well as educational issues.<p>
To be sure, the PTA sponsors many worthwhile programs and activities. Few of them, however, relate to education. The PTA doesn't merely waste its potential for constructive action; it may even hinder reform. In recent years, the teachers' unions' formidable influence over the PTA has been seen in the following issues:<p>
Opposition to school choice. In addition to its refusal to challenge union positions in collective bargaining and teacher strikes, the PTA opposes vouchers and tuition-tax credits that would empower parents to choose private schools. Thus the PTA has capitulated to the NEA/AFT insistence on maintaining the public-school monopoly at all costs.<p>
Delegates to the 1994 state convention of the California Congress of Parents, Teachers, and Students (the California PTA) broke into thunderous applause when a speaker congratulated them on defeating the school-choice ballot initiative known as Proposition 174. "You were the voice of the California children!" she shouted. More than one million California PTA volunteers defeated Proposition 174, she said, and "all the California Teachers Association did was put up the money." <p>
In fact, the PTA provided a large bloc of foot soldiers in the campaign against Proposition 174. At one workshop, a PTA official reminded delegates that "we will pull the PTA Charter if any unit goes beyond the PTA agendaas we would have with any PTA that supported vouchers."<p>
No matter how modest a voucher plan might be, the PTA can be expected to oppose it. In 1994, New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman was expected to introduce a pilot program for school vouchers in the ailing Jersey City school system. Nevertheless, state and national PTA officials called the plan a "threat" to public education. As a result, New Jersey PTA delegates voted to "[t]ake an active role in opposing" private-school vouchers. Not surprisingly, the PTA and the New Jersey affiliate of the NEA joined a coalition to defeat this and all other voucher proposals. <p>
Opposition to privatization. State PTAs structure their conventions to reinforce the national organization's opposition to privatization of school services. At Maryland's state PTA convention last year, the state vice president for legislative activity expressed hostility for privatization. Several delegates stomped out of a standing-room-only session on the topic when the state chairwoman refused to permit a balanced discussion of audience views on this issue. She instead rebutted criticism of PTA's opposition to contracting out school services. The reason for PTA opposition? Allegedly, some unionized employees could lose their jobs.<p>
Focus on non-educational issues. PTA programs are designed to diminish dissatisfaction with poor school performance. Instead of conducting hearings to address the causes of academic deficiencies, PTAs sponsor events presenting students' work in the most favorable light. Much time and effort goes into women's auxiliary or support services: trip chaperoning, bake sales, and other fundraising activities. Clearly, good PTA parents are supposed to be passive supporters, not active critics, of schools and teachers. <p>
Last summer, PTA delegates from 53 states and territories met in Las Vegas for the 98th annual national convention. Convention delegates received two days of workshops to learn how to produce materials that generate positive public reaction to PTA, respond to extremist groups challenging health/sex education curricula, implement the PTA's HIV/AIDS awareness programs, and rebut right-wing groups favoring school choice.<p>
Delegates considered resolutions on violence in video games, inhalant abuse, the quality of indoor air in portable classrooms, and the sale, resale, and destruction of confiscated firearms. These are typical of the non-educational, social issues on which PTAs focus their time and money.<p><center><b>The PTA Stifles Dialogue</b></center><p>
In its 1983 position statement in support of public education (revised and reaffirmed in 1991), the national PTA pledged to ensure that "adequate, objective, and language-appropriate information be available to parents so that they can make informed decisions." Unfortunately, the PTA is ignoring this directive.<p>
Given the way PTAs are governed, it is virtually impossible for parent members to develop parent-friendly policies that may conflict with the interests of teachers unions. Parents ought to have a forum for advocating the adoption of reforms like school-choice programs and the privatization of school services, ensuring that teachers are available for frequent conferences with parents, challenging teacher tenure, and assessing the value of report cards, grades, and standardized tests for measuring student performance. Unfortunately, many PTA parents are finding it increasingly difficult to articulate their needs and lodge their complaints within the PTA.<p>
Taking such action within the PTA would require parents to challenge teachers and teachers unions at meetings where both are present. Many parents fear teacher retaliation if they aggressively advocate parental over teacher interests. PTA parents also feel intimidated by the overwhelming pro-union bias in PTA publications and programs, as seen in the selection of convention issues and speakers.<p>
When one speaker after another proclaims the dangers of school choice, for example, it is difficult for rank-and-file members to challenge the PTA's position on the issue. PTA convention programs and publications ought to include balanced discussion of the issues.<p>
Indeed, open discussion of parental concerns is virtually absent at state and national PTA meetings. In practice, parents who seek accurate, unbiased information on educational issues are expected to fall in line with PTA positions.<p>
"The PTA severely limits the opportunity for dialogue and dissent," says Jo Cooper, an Oklahoma parent and 19-year PTA veteran. In 1994, the state legislative chairman of the Oklahoma PTA warned her not to publicly oppose national PTA positions. Cooper's offense? In a public meeting in her suburban Oklahoma City school district, she opposed the national PTA's enthusiastic support of the Goals 2000 legislation and HR 6, the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Cooper believes both pieces of federal legislation will undermine local control.<p>
In 1992, Kathy Moran, a PTA official in Villa Park, California, received a letter from the state organization demanding that PTA leaders "do everything possible" to block the gathering of signatures for the 1992 state ballot initiative on school choice. When she tried to organize a debate on the merits of choice, she was told that PTA chapters must present only the anti-choice perspective. <p><center><b>What's a Parent to Do?</center></b>
<p>
Is it any wonder that a backlash is developing? Small groups of concerned and sometimes angry parents are challenging the status quoincluding the PTA's deference to the teachers unions. Among their options:<ul>
<li>
Withhold support. Withholding dues to the state and national organizations can be an effective way to protest. At its recent board meeting, the Indiana State PTA lamented that it had to amend its annual budget after losing 3,000 members and their dues.<li>
Reform from within. Parents who believe the PTA can be reformed from within should form a "parental-control" caucus. Parents committed to pro-parent policies could bring about basic changes in the PTA. With a functioning caucus, they might find the strength to make their voices heard at state and national conventions. They could push to reform cumbersome procedures and restrictive election requirements in order to elect national PTA officers committed to pro-parent positions.<p>
Of course, for such internal reform to succeed, more parents now dissatisfied with PTA operations would have to become involved. Like-minded parents need to serve as officers of local chapters and as delegates to state and national conventions.<li>
Assert leadership locally. In Greenwich, Connecticut, local PTA president Kay Wall questioned the state's implementation of a misnamed "outcome-based education" program in June 1992. Without the support of the PTA, she organized a protest group, the Committee to Save Our Schools (SOS), which contributed to the collapse of Connecticut's plan. <p>
Within her local PTA chapter, Wall has organized and chairs an Academic Challenge and Excellence Committee (ACE) that focuses on restoring high academic standards for all children. "They don't really want parents involved in the way I want to be involved," Wall says, "which is knowing the details of the curriculum, knowing what is being tested, and questioning the new standards." Wall is also encouraging members to challenge the PTA's official support of Goals 2000.<li>
Revise PTA membership policy. As long as unionized teachers employed under collective bargaining are members of the PTA, it may be futile for parents to criticize educational policy. The NEA's own experience is instructive here. Before the enactment of collective-bargaining laws, the NEA included administrators at the local, state, and national levels. As a result, local NEA chapters were usually unable to promote teachers' interests, and actions of school administrators were seldom criticized.<li>
Encourage competition. If parents feel that their PTA cannot represent their interests, they should form alternative organizations. Some active parents are requesting disaffiliation from the national PTA. Janice Thompson, a parent in North Carolina who calls herself a "keeper of the home," ardently opposes the PTA's social agenda and its close association with teachers unions. Thompson emphasizes the need for parental involvement in academic issues, and feels that PTA affiliation is a hindrance, not a help, to parents who wish to raise academic standards.<p>
To build her case for reverting back to a local parent-teacher organization (PTO), she called the North Carolina State PTA office in Raleigh and asked, "What is the last thing the PTA accomplished in the classroom?" Says Thompson, "They didn't even have an answer." Last March, parents at her elementary school voted to revert to a PTO. "At the local level," Thompson says, "we know the issues, and here we can work with parents and the school for the benefit of the students." <p>
The PTO is organized locally, with no allegiance to state or national associations. Local parents, teachers, and administrators direct the activities, which are not unlike those of the PTA. Governance is usually through simple bylaws, determined by all parents who attend the meetings. It's true, as PTA literature points out, that a PTO does not emphasize lobbying effortsbut such efforts might contradict local standards and parental positions. Members of PTOs have found they can work through the local education maze more easily without the national-policy prohibitions and teachers union allegiances of the PTA. <p>
Activist PTO parents direct their energy toward improving their own schools and their own children's educational opportunities. While many appreciate a PTO's autonomy, some recognize its lack of organizational training and support.<li>
New opportunities for involvement. Current educational reforms are introducing new ways for parents to become involved in schools. For instance, charter and magnet schools within public-school systems often include provisions for parental involvement similar to requirements at private and parochial schools. School-management companies and for-profit businesses that offer services to public schools often stress active parental involvement. Parents should encourage this trend by insisting that school districts and schools retain the utmost flexibility in contracting for services.</ul>
<p>
At a time when special-interest groups are increasingly viewed in a negative light, the PTA is already well placed to act as a respected advocate for the educational interests of children and parents. As the struggle intensifies, the teachers unions will do their utmost to preserve the PTA as their subservient ally. The good news is that parents concerned about education want to do more than attend monthly PTA meetings. They are forming groups and creating procedures that will empower them as consumers of government services.

<h3> ENDING JUDICIAL DICTATORSHIP</h3>



<b>By Patrick J. Buchanan</b>
<p>
Delivered January 29, 1996 at <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a>, Washington, 
D.C.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	All just powers, Thomas Jefferson wrote in the 
Declaration of Independence, derive from the consent of the governed. Governments are 
republican, he later said, "in proportion as they embody the will of the people and execute it."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But in America today, the power that stands astride 
this country like a colossus is not the power of the majority; it is not the power of the governed; 
it is the power of the judiciary. The Supreme Court, not the majority, decides what is right or 
wrong in America. The Supreme Court has final say on criminal justice, education, voting, 
employment and promotion, taxation, immigration and deportation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In these areas, as in all others, the majority can pass 
a law or make a proposal, but it is always up to the Court to make the final decision. It may find 
a "constitutional right" and decide the majority's plan violates it: End of majority plan.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	To revise Lincoln's words, we today have a 
government of the judiciary, by the judiciary, and for the judiciary.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Now, someone must determine what a child will 
learn, how a criminal shall be treated, and what kind of society we will live in. Who shall it be? 
The judiciary -- or the majority?
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Traditionally, in America, middle-class families 
controlled most of the things central to their welfare. They decided them at the state and local 
level -- education, crime, spending, taxation, public health and welfare, including abortion. The 
values of the governed prevailed because, if government officials weren't responsive, they were 
kicked out of office.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As the judiciary takeover took hold, however, the 
power to throw the bums out became almost pointless because elected officials had less and less 
power. The middle class had lost the ability to control the things that mattered to it. Its power had 
been taken away from it by the Supreme Court. The Court centralized power in Washington and 
exercised that power without democratic consensus. Led by the Court, the country set off on a 
30-year experiment with non-democratic government.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We get one kind of society when decisions are made 
by the majority. We get another kind when decisions are made by judges, what Jefferson called 
the "despotism of an oligarchy."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The majority has never asked government to do 
anything brilliant or unusual -- just educate a child, defend the nation, and keep the streets safe. 
Civilized society had been doing those things for a long, long time, and we were even doing 
them at reasonable cost, in the much-maligned 1950s. But the Court took them over and made 
itself morally answerable for the safety and welfare of the nation. And the things the Court took 
over in working order do not work any more.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Today the values of the Supreme Court determine 
all the issues that make up the quality of life. Unfortunately, the values of the Court differ 
markedly from those of the governed.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Court, by the mid-1960s, began a long period 
of active opposition to the wishes of the majority. Since then, the Court has been in the vanguard 
of an intellectual elite that believes that the prevailing social order of middle-class America is 
deeply flawed, unjust, and irrational.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Traditionally, the Court's function was to decide 
cases, to interpret the law, to supervise the lower courts, and on rare occasions to declare a 
federal or state law unconstitutional. But look at how far the federal judiciary has gone.
<p><ul>
<li> In 1958, the Court ruled that prayer, commonplace in American public schools, was now 
unconstitutional. All prayer, Bible instruction, and even the posting of the Ten 
Commandments was henceforth forbidden.
<p>
	<li> In 1973, the Supreme Court declared that women had a constitutional right to an 
abortion, a right undiscovered by the men who had written the Constitution or any of the 
greatest of the jurists who interpreted it over two centuries.
<p>
	<li> In 1974, Judge Arthur Garrity ordered the integration of Boston's public schools 
through court-ordered busing. Result: violence, boycotts, racial animosity. Instead of 
integration, Judge Garrity produced a school system where 80 percent of the students are 
minority Americans.
<P>
	<li> In 1987, a Kansas City federal judge ordered a doubling of property taxes and a 25 
percent increase in income taxes to pay for improvements in the public schools.
<p>
	<li> In 1988, in Yonkers, Judge Leonard Sand imposed stiff and escalating fines, nearly 
bankrupting the city, because its elected officials refused to vote as the judge had 
demanded on a plan to put low-cost housing in white neighborhoods.
<p>
	<li> In 1995, the Supreme Court threw out term limits on congressional delegations in 23 
states.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What we have here is gross usurpation of power by 
federal courts, which are using that power to rewrite laws to conform with the Court's idea of 
what is just, fair, and right. What the Founding Fathers intended to be the weakest branch of the 
federal government has become the most powerful: The Supreme Court has become a 
superlegislature.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Court's new role is as adversary to the people.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	By defining "individual rights" as it wished, the 
Court has centralized control over every moral, political, social, and economic issue in the 
country. The Court says it is acting on behalf of a higher authority, the Constitution, but in fact 
the Supreme Court has twisted and reshaped the Constitution -- as Jefferson said -- as an artist 
shapes a ball of wax.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Court today derives its powers from its own 
will and is not subject to correction or reversal. It has become the one branch of government on 
which there is no check, and for which there is no balance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Judges, Justice William Brennan wrote in the 1979  
decision, "are not mere umpires, but, in their own sphere, lawmakers." In 1985, Justice Brennan 
told a Georgetown Law School audience that the "Majoritarian process has appeal under some 
circumstances, but I think ultimately it will not do." Justice Brennan added: "Faith in democracy 
is one thing, blind faith quite another." The Court's role, he said, is "to declare certain values 
transcendent, beyond the reach of temporary political majorities."
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Court freely uses all the coercive power of the 
state to enforce its orders. One rule binds al l-- either there will be school prayer or flag burning 
or term limits or pornography, or there won't be -- and if it is not the majority's rule that prevails, 
as it is in a democracy, it is the minority's.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The minority, because of the Court's intervention, is 
no longer just protected; it is put in control. However, the Court, despite the use and threat of 
force, has not settled anything. Race relations are worse than they were. Abortion is a sorer issue 
today than when the Court took control of it in the 1973 decision,   . Force cannot bring about a 
democratically sustainable solution to the culture wars.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Criminal conduct, to the Court, became a form of 
self-expression, a statement of social protest and criticism. The Court orders that taxpayers must 
provide lawyers for criminal defendants who cannot afford to pay for one. The Court routinely 
overrules the actions of local police, of boards of education, and the state laws under which they 
act.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Who are the beneficiaries of the Court's protection? 
Members of various minorities including criminals, atheists, homosexuals, flag burners, illegal 
immigrants (including terrorists), convicts, and pornographers. In December 1994, the month 
after 59 percent of California voters approved Proposition 187 limiting social welfare benefits 
available to illegal aliens, a single federal judge prohibited state and local officials from 
following the new law. California taxpayers continue to support the illegals as the case drags on 
in the federal courts.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But this is only the tip of the iceberg of judicial 
dictatorship in America.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Court's power flows to economic as well as 
social and cultural issues. Since it interprets the antitrust laws, the Court determines the amount 
of competition in the country. The laws, which Teddy Roosevelt intended to protect small 
business, have been interpreted to favor big business. The Court has also ruled to encourage the 
forces of globalism against American workers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In a 1986 decision, the Court ruled against U.S. TV 
manufacturers -- when we still had some -- and in favor of their Japanese competitors. The 
Japanese conceded they had conspired to raise profits in Japan but denied they did so to bankroll 
a predatory pricing conspiracy in the United States to drive our manufacturers out of business.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Court agreed with the Japanese that no trial to 
find the facts was necessary. According to the Court, the Japanese had no "plausible motive to 
engage in the conduct charged." The Japanese, the Court said, "had no rational motive to 
conspire" since it would call for them "to destroy [U.S.] companies larger and better established 
than themselves, a goal that remains far distant."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But not so far distant after the Court's decision: The 
Court, when it could have made a difference, allowed the Japanese to drive the American 
companies out of business. The middle class, which had lost its political clout, was now losing 
its well-paying jobs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Federal courts today supervise and, in effect, 
administer the operation of the state schools, prisons, and mental hospitals. A consent decree in 
South Carolina requires the state to provide a recreational program for convicts, including 
tournaments in croquet, badminton, paddleball, and backgammon.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in July 1993, prior to 
her confirmation hearings, wrote to the Senate Judiciary Committee that federal judges find these 
"chores" to be "uncongenial and unwelcome." Had "state and federal legislatures" done a better 
job, the courts would not have been forced to take over the schools, prisons, and mental 
hospitals. The majority, according to Justice Ginsburg's theory of democracy, gets first shot at 
solving problems to the satisfaction of federal judges. But not the last word.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Court argues that it is the only institution that 
will protect the rights of minorities and prevent the tyranny of the majority. But who thinks the 
majority wants to tyrannize over the minority? The majority changes as the issue changes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Does the country need nine guardians to save us 
from totalitarianism? Can it be saved from totalitarianism by nine guardians? Jefferson thought 
the majority was the only "true guardian" of individual rights. The majority may sometimes err, 
Jefferson said, but "its errors are honest, solitary and short-lived."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Democracies correct mistakes sooner and more 
easily than do other systems. Judges with lifetime tenure, like dictators, do not correct -- or admit 
-- their mistakes. Majority action corrects, as do safety valves on a steam engine.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Jefferson did not see anything in the Constitution 
that gave the Supreme Court power "to decide for the Executive, more than to the Executive to 
decide for them."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Alien and Sedition Laws were enacted by the 
Federalist Congress in 1798 to suppress criticism of the government. The federal courts found 
the laws to be constitutional and convicted and imprisoned newspaper publishers. Upon 
Jefferson's election in 1800, he released every person in jail, or being prosecuted under the laws, 
asserting the law "was a nullity, as absolute and as palpable as if Congress had ordered us to fall 
down and worship a golden image: and that it was as much my duty to arrest its execution in 
every stage, as it would have been to have rescued from the fiery furnace those who should have 
been cast into it for refusing to worship the image."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	How do we reign in an out-of-control Court? It is 
not hard to do; here are several ideas:
<p><ul>
	<li>One, we could appoint judges for a term of years rather than for life. The term could 
be renewed if the President and Senate think they have done a good job. We should not 
delude ourselves that life terms keep judges above the political fray. They have joined the 
fray and, like other politicians, must be held to some accountability.
<p>
	<li> Second, federal judges at the appellate and district court levels could be made 
subject to voter recall and removal.
<p>
	<li> Third, Congress could use its power, granted in the Constitution, to restrict the 
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.
<p>
	<li> Fourth, we could do what Teddy Roosevelt recommended in his 1912 presidential 
campaign -- have the nation decide at the next election whether to uphold or reject any 
Court decision creating a new "right" or overturning a state or federal law. "It is the 
people and not the judges who are entitled to say what the Constitution means," said T.R., 
"for the Constitution is theirs, it belongs to them and not to their servants in office."
<P>
	<li> Fifth, we could simplify the way in which we amend the Constitution--to remove 
Congress from the process.
<p></ul>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Right now the Constitution requires Congress to 
approve proposed amendments before they can be sent to the states for their consideration. 
Congress, however, obviously won't approve limits on its powers such as are called for in the 
Balanced Budget and Term Limits Amendments. Congress also naturally protects the Court 
because the Court is the source of most of its powers. We should allow the states, without the 
approval of Congress, to amend the Constitution.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Any state should be able to propose an amendment, 
and if three-fourths of the states agree to the language, the amendment should become part of the 
Constitution. At the Constitutional Convention, Mr. Madison came close to having such 
authority put into the Constitution.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The purpose here is not radical change. It is to put 
an end to radical change being imposed upon a free people by an unelected elite which serves for 
life and is answerable now to no one. It is to restore the original system of checks and balances 
envisioned by the conservative men who wrote the Constitution.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Over the past 30 years, the Court has lost any sense 
of its proper relation to the country and has consequently lost the respect of the people. The 
people's respect will return as soon as the Court returns to its traditional role--an independent 
judiciary acting within a democratic Republic.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Majority rule is not perfect, and a democratic 
Republic will not always be just, or incorrupt, or provide a completely rational social order 
wherein all wants are satisfied. A majoritarian society is imperfect because man is imperfect. But 
it is the faith of the democrat that self-government provides the best way of assuring freedom for 
the individual to live as he wishes, and to develop his talents to their fullest.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In a judicial dictatorship, you get a government and 
society designed by the Supreme Court to conform to its intellectual vision of America. The 
public, however, does not share the Court's vision. With democracy, you get, as Jefferson said, 
not a perfect government, but one as good as the people.

Clinton's Regulatory Reform is Not Likely to Cut Red Tape
</h2>
By Susan M. Eckerly<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum #367<BR>
October 8, 1993<BR>
</CENTER><HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>

     President Bill Clinton last week signed an executive order
outlining the process by which his Administration will oversee rule-
making by federal agencies. The President claims the new procedure
will "lighten the load for regulated industries and make government
regulations that are needed more efficient." Unfortunately, that is
unlikely to be the result.
<P>
     The new executive order does retain much of the White House
review system set up by Presidents Carter, Reagan, and Bush -- which
did rein in excessive rule-making to some degree. But the Clinton
order also creates loopholes which will allow regulatory activists to
pursue their agenda, making it unlikely that the flow of red tape will
diminish. Federal regulation is conservatively estimated to have cost
the economy between $595 billion and $667 billion in 1992.
<P>
     One such loophole is that the order gives more power to the
federal agencies and a reduced role to the Office of Information and
Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) located within the Office of Management and
Budget. During the Reagan years, the function of OIRA was extended
beyond minimizing the agencies' paperwork requirements to making sure
that agencies conducted cost-benefit analyses on proposed regulations.
The office was overshadowed during the Bush Administration by Vice
President Dan Quayle's Competitiveness Council, which acted as a
referee between federal agencies and tried to reduce the burden of new
regulations. OIRA still retains a role in the regulatory process in
the new order. But the order declares that a purpose of the new
procedure is "to reaffirm the primacy of Federal agencies in the
regulatory decision-making process" -- essentially ending OIRA's
critical role as a restraint on excessive regulation by agencies. 
<P>
     Under the order, OIRA will review only those regulations that it
or the agencies consider "significant," or will cost the economy more
than $100 million annually. This is not crucially different from the
procedure under the Reagan Administration, when OIRA played a key role
in overturning costly regulations. But there is now to be a subtle but
significant change. If OIRA and the agency cannot agree on what is a
"significant" regulation, the dispute is to be resolved by Vice
President Gore, who has shown an inclination to side with proponents
of regulation. Moreover, OIRA must now review agency submissions under
very strict timetables. OIRA Administrator Sally Katzen has said that
this could cut by one-third the number of regulations OIRA has time to
review.
<P>
     New Age Cost-Benefit Analysis. To its credit, the executive order
retains the cost-benefit basis for regulatory review set up under
Reagan. And the order recommends that agencies consider the "degree
and nature" of risks in setting regulatory priorities and identify
alternatives to regulation such as "marketable permits." The problem
is that the executive order also contains language that potentially
could undermine the cost-benefit test. For instance, it expands the
definition of costs and benefits to include not only "quantifiable
measures" but also "qualitative measures... that are difficult to
quantify," such as "the enhancement of health and safety, the
protection of the natural environment, and the elimination or
reduction of discrimination or bias." Because these types of benefits
are impossible to quantify, it will be much easier for an agency to
claim that the benefits of a proposed regulation outweigh the costs. 
<P>
     For the first time, the Vice President is explicitly named as
"the principal advisor to the President" on regulatory policy. Al
Gore, who is an outspoken environmentalist and was a strident critic
of the now defunct Competitiveness Council, is given responsibility
for coordinating "the development and presentation of recommendations
concerning regulatory policy, planning, and review, as set forth in
this executive order." A review of the first nine months of the
Clinton Administration suggests that the Vice President is unlikely to
stand in the way of aggressive regulatory agencies.
Example: As of this October 1, the number of pages in the Federal
Register (51,563), in which all new regulations are published,
exceeded the pages from last year (45,558) by roughly 10 percent.
<P>
Example: The Clinton Administration already is using executive orders,
thereby circumventing the public notice and comment provisions of the
Administrative Procedures Act, to enact environmental policies with
significant implications for industry.
Benchmarks for Success. The next few months will tell Americans just
how serious the Clinton Administration is when it pledges to reduce
the burden of red tape, and it will show whether the executive order
does indeed open the door to regulatory mischief. And while the
Clinton Administration could hardly be expected to lead a crusade
against regulation, there are a number of actions the White House
should take to show it is serious about regulatory relief. For
example, it should: 
<P>

     <UL>Conduct a thorough review of existing regulation. To Clinton's
     credit, the executive order calls on federal agencies to submit
     to OIRA within ninety days a policy under which the agency
     periodically will review "existing significant" regulations to
     determine whether any of these can be eliminated. Vice President
     Gore and the OIRA administrator must prove to the American people
     that this is not a meaningless exercise. 
<P>
     Adopt the Airline Commission's recommendation to implement a
     regulatory budget. The National Commission to Ensure A Strong
     Competitive Airline Industry report recommends that the Federal
     Aviation Administration subject regulations, except for emergency
     safety regulations, to an annual regulatory cost budget. Such a
     budgetary frame of reference would compel regulators to consider
     the overall cost picture as they look at individual regulatory
     issues. The Clinton Administration should adopt and expand upon
     this, recommending that other agencies experiment with this idea.
     <P>
     Insist that all federal mandates be fully funded by Congress and
     administered by the federal government. At the very least, the
     Clinton Administration should adhere to its National Performance
     Review report recommendation that "The President should issue a
     directive limiting the use of unfunded mandates by the
     Administration." OIRA should also make sure that the agencies
     adhere to the executive order's requirement that they assess the
     ability of state and local governments to carry out federally
     regulated mandates.
<P>
     Fulfill Gore's pledge to strengthen the Regulatory Flexibility
     Act and support the proposed Paperwork Reduction Act Amendments.
     Although neither of these legislative measures would by
     themselves roll back the regulatory tide, they enjoy bipartisan
     support in Congress. Moreover, legislation has been introduced to
     implement the National Performance Review recommendation that
     there be judicial review of the Regulatory Flexibility Act,
     thereby putting teeth in a statute meant to ensure that agencies
     consider the impact of proposed regulations on small business. In
     addition, the Administration should work for passage of the Nunn-
     Danforth-Bumpers Paperwork Reduction Act, which would, among
     other things, overturn the 1990 Dole v. United Steelworkers of
     America decision that currently exempts over a third of agency
     rule-making from OIRA paperwork review</UL>. 
<P>
     In a perfect world, the language of President Clinton's executive
order might achieve his goals of easing the regulatory load on
business and creating a more streamlined regulatory system. But in the
world within the Washington Beltway, and judging from the early record
of the Administration, the new executive order creates a review
process that will in practice be exploited by regulatory activists
inside and outside the government. The American economy is not likely
to experience any significant reduction in the mountain of red tape
created by Washington.

<i>"When all government, domestic and foreign, in little as in great things, shall be drawn to Washington as the center of all power, it will render powerless the checks provided of one government on another, and will become as venal and oppressive as the government from which we separated."</i><p>
<right>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;  -- Thomas Jefferson.<sup>1</sup></right><p><p><b>INTRODUCTION</b><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Throughout much of American history, especially since the New Deal, the federal government increasingly has encroached upon the fiscal and constitutional prerogatives of state and local governments. Today, this imbalance has reached a crisis point, and the states are fighting back. Through a variety of initiatives, they are demanding that federal mandates be funded and, in many cases, even are challenging the authority of the federal government to impose these mandates, whether funded or not. With the new, more state-friendly Congress, states and localities have an historic opportunity not only to effect mandate relief, but also to restore balance in state-federal relations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At one time states and localities saw compliance with Washington's conditions as a small price to pay for federal funding of popular state-implemented programs. But now the federal share of that funding is decreasing while the mandates are becoming more numerous, complex, and expensive. Unfunded federal mandates and highly prescriptive federal programs have backed many states and localities into a fiscal corner, forcing them to sacrifice their own programs and priorities in order to comply with standards set by a distant federal government. Aurora, Colorado, for example, calculates that it will have to repair some 28,000 curbs in order to comply with the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) at an average cost of $1,500 per curb.<sup>2</sup>  Like many municipalities, Aurora simply cannot afford the federal mandate, and the January 1995 deadline for compliance with ADA is looming. Columbus, Ohio's famous 1991 study found that unfunded federal environmental mandates alone will cost their city $856 per household per year by the year 2000.<sup>3</sup>  The National Association of State Budget Officers reports that Medicaid's share of state spending will grow from just over 10 percent in 1987 to 20 percent in 1995.<sup>4</sup>  Federal Funds Information for States projects state Medicaid spending of $77 billion in 1995.<sup>5</sup>  Ohio Governor George Voinovich complained recently of a "forced trade-off between Medicaid and education funding. In the past five years, education declined as a share of state spending... because new Medicaid mandates consume more and more state resources."<sup>6</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Micromanagement by federal agencies imposes costs and one-size-fits-all standards that treat Lubbock like Detroit and Wyoming like New York. For instance, Anchorage, Alaska's sewage inflow was so clean that the municipality could not meet Congress's requirement that all sewage treatment facilities reduce incoming organic waste by at least 30 pe
rcent. Still, the federal Environmental Protection Agency insisted that the city meet the arbitrary standard. Anchorage's response was to arrange for two local fisheries to dump fish viscera into the river so the city could remove them.<sup>7</sup>  Arizona legislators have complained that the Clean Air Act is too strict even for the naturally occurring dust from Arizona's deserts, let alone automobile emissions. House Majority Leader Brenda Burns commented: "The Clean Air Act's one-size-fits-all standard cannot work in Arizona. We could take every car off the road and still not be in compliance. I suppose we could pave the desert, but I don't think that would be realistic."  Federal courts also micromanage the states by mandating state policies ranging from prison library collections to local tax rates to the education of illegal immigrants. Time and again, Supreme Court decisions have allowed relentless expansion of Congress's enumerated powers. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But states and localities seem to have reached their limit and are fighting back in a number of ways:<ul>
<li>They are publicizing the costs of unfunded federal mandates and holding their Congressmen publicly accountable for mandate votes.

<li>They are challenging Congress's authority to impose mandates, resisting micromanagement by the federal bureaucracy, and in some instances simply refusing to comply. 

<li>They are suing the federal government for violation of the Tenth Amendment<sup>8</sup> and arguing to constrict the expansive interpretation of the Commerce Clause.<sup>9</sup> <li>They are lobbying Congress to pass mandate-relief legislation and to submit for ratification by the states a "no money, no mandate" constitutional amendment. <li>They are considering collective action to challenge the federal government's most grievous intrusions on states' autonomy and to amend the Constitution to reaffirm the principles of federalism.</ul>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
With increasing frequency, these state actions are carried out alongside the efforts of a growing grassroots movement dedicated to reestablishing the constitutional limitations on the federal government. The National Tenth Amendment Committee in Colorado, for example, is working with legislators, activists, and groups in over 40 states to pass resolutions asserting state sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment.<sup>10</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Opposing unfunded federal mandates is a nonpartisan "good government" issue. Whether Republican, Independent, or Democrat, liberal, moderate, or conservative, state and local government officials tend to agree: Washington politicians should not be allowed to take credit for promoting popular causes while states foot the bill. Local officials are quick to add that the same is true of unfunded state mandates. As Newark Mayor Sharpe James states, "If something is important enough to require a state or federal mandate, we should have a voice in deciding how to do it. And if it's important enough to require a mandate, it should be important enough to have state or federal funding to help carry out the mandate."<sup>11</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Prohibiting unfunded federal mandates will restrain overall government spending and regulation and will virtually require Congress to set priorities among programs. It will allow states and localities greater flexibility to devise responses suited to their own particular circumstances, enabling them once again to become "laboratories of democracy."  Most important, it will make government more accountable by bringing it closer to the people. Controlling their state legislatures and town councils is far easier than controlling the immense federal bureaucracy.
<p>

<b>COUNTING THE COST</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
One of the most difficult challenges for states in fighting unfunded federal mandates has been the complexity involved in calculating the costs. The very definition of an "unfunded mandate" is ambiguous. Technically speaking, strings-attached programs, or grants-in-aid, such as Medicaid are not mandates. Theoretically, the state can refuse federal funding and decline to participate in the program. In reality, grants-in-aid are offers the states find it difficult to refuse. To deal with this problem of definition, the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR) has coined the phrase "federally induced costs," a useful umbrella that encompasses all unfunded costs the federal government imposes on states and localities.<sup>12</sup>  Generally, when state and local officials complain about unfunded federal mandates, they are thinking of this broader concept.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Even with the problem of definition clarified, the task of calculating the costs of federal mandates is daunting. Hundreds of jurisdictions and agencies can be affected by a single mandate. These entities usually do not have the capacity to monitor the costs. And even if they did, another office would have to assemble the data from all the agencies involved in order to calculate the total. Still, these costs need to be counted, and state and local governments have an interest in making that happen.
<p>

<b>Cost Studies</b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Fortunately, some jurisdictions and research organizations have begun to calculate and publicize the costs of mandates. Among Washington-based state and local government associations, for example, the U.S. Conference of Mayors recently reported that the Clean Water Act alone cost cities with populations greater than 30,000 more than $3.6 billion in 1993. From 1994 through 1998, the ten studied mandates will cost cities $54 billion: the Clean Water Act alone will cost $29.3 billion; the Safe Drinking Water Act, $8.6 billion; and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, $5.5 billion.<sup>13</sup>  The 1993 survey performed by Price Waterhouse for the National Association of Counties estimated that "counties are spending $4.8 billion annually to comply with just twelve of the many unfunded mandates in federal programs" and that they will spend close to $33.7 billion over the next five years.<sup>14</sup>  The National Conference of State Legislatures' regularly updated Hall of States Mandate Monitor tracks Congress's unfunded mandates and mandate-relief legislation.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In 1993, the governments of Tennessee and Ohio issued federal mandate cost studies -- the first such studies to be focused on individual states. The Ohio report found that unfunded mandates would cost the state $356 million in 1994 and over $1.74 billion from 1992-1995.<sup>15</sup>  Tennessee found that the annual costs of federal mandates imposed between FY 1986-1987 and the end of 1992 would grow from $12 million the first year to $195 million in 1994-1995 and $242 million in 2001-2002.<sup>16</sup>  In 1994, Texas reported that its federally induced costs rose from $6.5 billion in the 1990-1991 biennium to $8.9 billion in the 1992-1993 biennium, and $11.4 billion in the 1994-1995 biennium.<sup>17</sup>  Among state-based research institutes studying mandate costs are the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute<sup>18</sup> and the Barry Goldwater Institute for Public Policy Research in Arizona.<p>&#160;
 &#160; &#160; &#160;Cost figures such as these demonstrate the major impact unfunded federal mandates have on state and local budgets. Union County, North Carolina, cleverly shows the effects of mandates on its budget by itemizing the costs of unfunded state and federal mandates in its tax bills. Moreover, by providing reliable mandate cost figures to the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget, states can help improve the accuracy of these offices' calculations. If states and localities do not develop their own hard numbers, they have less standing to challenge CBO and OMB estimates.
<p>

<b>Mandates Auditor Acts</b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Another way states and localities have begun to address the problem of producing cost figures is by creating mandates auditor offices. In May 1994, Missouri became the first state to establish an office for the sole purpose of tracking federally induced costs. The Missouri legislation charged the "Federal Mandate Auditor" with creating an "inventory of all unfunded federal mandates on all levels of government in the state, calculating by program and agency the cost of such mandates, and performing an historical analysis of year-to-year trends in unfunded federal mandates."<sup>19</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Michigan State Representative Michael Nye plans to introduce a similar bill in 1995 proposing a state "Mandate Ombudsman" and a mandate database. Modeled after a 1993 Mackinac Center for Public Policy proposal,<sup>20</sup> the ombudsman would "track, forecast, disseminate, and distribute information regarding mandated legislation."  This new office will coordinate a systematic effort across all agencies of state government to monitor and report on Michigan's federally induced costs.
<p>

<b>PUBLICIZING THE PROBLEM</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;State and local officials have developed several creative ways to publicize the problem and hold federal lawmakers accountable to their constituents. Among them:<ol>

<li><b>Mandate-Relief and Tenth Amendment Resolutions</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the past year at least twelve states passed resolutions calling on Congress to pass specific mandate-relief legislation, to fully fund mandates, to stop imposing mandates, and/or to provide cost estimates for any bills that would impose new mandates. But while some state and local officials are satisfied simply to have federal mandates funded, others believe that many mandates represent an overreaching of the federal government's constitutional authority. Eight states (Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania) expressed this concern in 1994 by passing resolutions that assert state sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment. California's is typical: "The State of California hereby claims sovereignty under the 10th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States over all powers not otherwise enumerated and granted to the federal government by the United States Constitution and that this measure shall serve as notice and demand to the federal government to cease and desist, effective immediately, mandates that are beyond the scope of its constitutionally delegated powers."<sup>21</sup>  Some Tenth Amendment resolutions argue further that the states authorized the federal government, not vice versa. According to the National Tenth Amendment Committee, legislators in over twenty states plan to introduce similar resolutions next session. While mandate-relief and Tenth Amendment resolutions may have little or no legal force, they effectively publicize the problem and deliver a clear message to Congress.
<p>
<li><b>Congressional Delegation Mandates Consultation Acts</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;One particularly effective way states are publicizing the mandate problem is by passing "congressional delegation mandates consultation acts."  Noting the recent explosion in federal mandates and the consequent strain on state budgets, these acts "invite" the state congressional delegation to appear before a special session of the legislature to discuss the problem of unfunded federal mandates. Initially, the idea was to invite the state's U.S. Senators, not its entire congressional delegation, to explain their votes on mandate legislation.<sup>22</sup>  The theory was that while the Seventeenth Amendment changed the election of senators from election by state legislatures to direct election by the people, it did not change the legal principle of the relationship between U.S. Senators and their respective states. However, all the mandates consultation acts actually introduced invite the entire congressional delegation and the American Legislative Exchange Council's model legislation also invites the entire delegation.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Mandates consultation acts have been passed in seven states. Alabama led the way, adopting the innovative resolution in 1992 under the leadership of State Representative Perry Hooper. South Dakota followed in January 1993. Since then, Arizona, California, Delaware, Michigan, and Pennsylvania have adopted the act.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Alabama, South Dakota, Delaware, and Arizona have held, or attempted to hold, meetings with their congressional delegations. The other three states are scheduling meetings or have not yet followed up on the resolution. In Alabama all nine congressmen participated in the meetings, and all nine signed on to the most far-reaching mandate-relief bills in the 103rd Congress. Despite their participation in meetings, only one of the three in South Dakota's delegation supported a strong mandate-relief measure in 1994. Delaware tried unsuccessfully to schedule meetings, but two out of three from its delegation still supported substantial mandate-relief legislation in 1994. Six out of eight from Arizona's congressional delegation participated in a November 1994 meeting with the state legislature's Committee on Federal Mandates. All six promised to end unfunded federal mandates on states. Concerned about meddlesome federal judges, Senator-elect Jon Kyl (R-AZ) suggested in particular that "it may be time to invoke a little-used portion of the Constitution [Article III, Section 2] that allows the House and Senate to set the parameters of federal judicial powers."<sup>23</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While state legislatures may not have the legal power to require the presence of federal legislators, a Member of Congress who declines the invitation opens himself up to charges of "inside-the-Beltway arrogance."  If he accepts, he is not likely to argue for requiring his home state to pay for Washington's latest schemes. More likely, he will profess his faithful opposition to mandates on behalf of his beleaguered state. In any case, he is likely to think twice before voting for the next proposed unfunded mandate he encounters.
<p>
<li><b>Congressional Delegation Voting Reports</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Another way to give states leverage over their congressional delegations is to conduct regular voting reports. In 1994, the Virginia House of Delegates expanded the duties of the Commonwealth's liaison office in Washington, D.C., to include "[r]eporting in a timely manner to the General Assembly all federal mandates and regulations which may have an effect on the Commonwealth."  The reports are to include "the names of those Virginia congressional members who voted for such mandates and regulations."

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In a similar effort to restore accountability, the Arizona-based Barry Goldwater Institute for Public Policy Research has developed a "mandate scorecard" for the U.S. Congress. The November 1994 report scores members of the 103rd Congress for their votes on selected unfunded federal mandates and mandate-relief legislation. Those who voted with the states at least 75 percent of the time are termed "friends of the states," while those who voted with the states less than 25 percent of the time are labeled "foes of the states."  Those who scored between 25 percent and 75 percent are labeled "neutral."  According to the report, the highest-scoring "friends of the states" were Senators Hank Brown (R-CO), Larry Craig (R-ID), Judd Gregg (R-NH), Dirk Kempthorne (R-ID), Richard Lugar (R-IN), and Alan Simpson (R-WY) and Representatives Chris Cox (R-CA), Jennifer Dunn (R-WA), Thomas Ewing (R-IL), Tillie Fowler (R-FL), Porter Goss (R-FL), Joel Hefley (R-CO), David Levy (R-NY), Howard (Buck) McKeon (R-CA), Dan Miller (R-FL), Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA), Edward Royce (R-CA), and Bob Stump (R-AZ). The lowest scoring "foes of the states" were Senators Max Baucus (D-MT), Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Wendell Ford (D-KY), Howard Metzenbaum (D-OH), Donald Riegle (D-MI), and Paul Wellstone (D-MN) and Representatives John Dingell (D-MI), Sam Gejdenson (D-CT), Barbara Kennelly (D-CT), Jim McDermott (D-WA), Joe Moakley (D-MA), Ray Thornton (D-AR), Craig Washington (D-TX), and Maxine Waters (D-CA).<sup>24</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Mandate voting reports provide a political tool for holding federal lawmakers publicly accountable for shrinking the share of state budgets available for local priorities such as education or police. As these reports become more sophisticated, it may become possible to calculate each senator's or representative's cost to state and local budgets.</ol>
<p>
<b>MAKING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PAY</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The most conspicuous objective of the anti-mandates movement is to require the federal government to fund its mandates on states and localities. State and local officials have considered two approaches: supporting federal mandate-relief legislation and intercepting federal taxes.
<p>
<b>Federal Legislation</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The "Big Seven" national associations of state and local governments -- National Governors' Association, National Conference of State Legislatures, U.S. Conference of Mayors, National Association of Counties, National League of Cities, Council of State Governments, and International City/County Management Association -- have been lobbying Congress resolutely to pass effective mandate-relief legislation.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Community Regulatory Relief Act (S.993) introduced by Senator Dirk Kempthorne (R-ID) and the Federal Mandate Relief Act of 1993 (H.R.140) sponsored by Representative Gary Condit (D-CA) were strong bills that received widespread attention and support in 1994. Neither addressed existing mandates, but both would have required Congress to fund any new mandates imposed on state and local governments. Both bills had a majority signed on as cosponsors, but neither house's leadership allowed a vote. Congress also failed to vote on less restrictive bills negotiated by Senator Kempthorne and Senator John Glenn (D-OH) and by Representatives John Conyers (D-MI) and William Clinger (R-PA) (H.R. 5128). These bipartisan bills would have established a point of order requiring Congress to authorize funding of mandates whose estimated costs exceed $50 million annually, unless the majority by roll call vote waive the point of order. The bills also would have required CBO cost estimates of private sector mandates exceeding $200 million and executive branch consultations with state and local officials before writing federal regulations.<sup>25</sup> <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Shortly after the election, incoming Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-KS) promised Republican governors that "the first bill in the Senate, S. 1., is going to be unfunded mandates."  The 104th Congress's mandate-relief agenda will likely build upon and strengthen 1994's bipartisan bills -- perhaps by requiring a three-fifths supermajority to waive the point of order; by lowering the $50 million point-of-order threshold; by requiring the appropriation, not just the authorization, of funding for mandates in order to avoid the point of order; or by allowing states and localities not to implement mandates for which funds have not been appropriated. Incoming Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch of Utah has indicated his intent to propose a "no money, no mandate" amendment to the Constitution. By offering it simultaneously with a Balan
ced Budget Amendment (BBA), he hopes to ease the concerns of states and localities which fear that a BBA would lead the federal government to balance its budget by imposing still more unfunded mandates on them. Governors strongly prefer that the two amendments be written as one.<sup>26</sup>  State and local leaders also are likely to raise with the 104th Congress broader issues many considered it unrealistic to address in 1994 -- issues such as repealing or reforming existing unfunded federal mandates, transferring federal programs to states and localities, compelling federal agencies to allow states greater flexibility in implementing federal programs, and restricting federal judges from directing state and local policies.
<p>

<b>The Interception of Federal Taxes</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
One of the most aggressive approaches to fighting unfunded federal mandates is the possible interception of federal taxes as reimbursement for federally induced costs. For instance, South Carolina State Representative Ralph Davenport introduced a bill in 1994 instructing the State Budget and Control Board to devise a plan for intercepting federal individual and corporate income tax payments made by South Carolina residents to compensate the state for the cost of unfunded federal mandates. The idea had considerable support among legislators but failed to make it out of committee. A few states have considered intercepting federal gasoline taxes in response to the burdensome Clean Air Act. In both cases, it is unclear how the state would manage the interception, considering that federal income and gasoline taxes generally are paid directly by individuals and corporations to the federal government. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There is, however, at least one federal tax states could intercept very easily: the federal income taxes of state employees. Such monies are already in the state treasury, and no collection procedure would have to be altered.
<p>
<b>TO COMPLY OR NOT TO COMPLY</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
No state has acted to intercept federal taxes, but many are resisting compliance with onerous federal mandates, for example, by disputing federal agencies' implementing regulations, by asserting the states' right to challenge the constitutionality of a federal mandate and direct its implementation, through simple noncompliance, by opting out of federal programs, and through return of primacy.
<p>

<b>Negotiated Compliance</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The courts have ruled that regulations set by federal agencies have the same force of law as associated legislation. But some states argue that there is a difference between the performance standards set in congressional legislation and the fine print of the federal bureaucracy's implementing regulations. Virginia's Secretary of Natural Resources, Becky Norton Dunlop, has used this argument to explain the opposition of Governor George Allen's administration to the expensive, centralizing emission inspection systems the federal Environmental Protection Agency insisted Virginia use to comply with the Clean Air Act: "Once we had reviewed the law and determined that the plan was not mandated by law but rather by unelected bureaucrats at EPA, we pulled the plan back and submitted a plan that met the performance standards of the Clean Air Act but was consumer friendly, more cost effective, and would result in real improvements in air quality."<sup>27</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
More than a dozen states have resisted this EPA plan that requires "test-only" inspection stations and specified high-tech equipment costing $150,000 at each site. Test-only stations have proven quite unpopular because they require drivers whose vehicles fail inspection to go elsewhere for the necessary repairs and then to return to the test station for re-inspection. States also complain that the high-tech equipment is unreliable. Understandably, they want to devise their own system of compliance rather than have a one-size-fits-all approach imposed on them. They tend to agree with Columbus Mayor Greg Lashutka: "The federal role should be one measuring results: how much pollution is reduced, rather than prescribing how it should be done."<sup>28</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Until recently, however, EPA generally has responded to states' proposed alternate compliance plans inflexibly, frequently threatening to withhold federal funds. Virginia's proposal, for example, imitated one of four methods for testing fleets that EPA itself had recommended to state governments in a 1993 memorandum.<sup>29</sup>  Still, EPA dismissed it and threatened to withhold federal highway funds. In explaining the rejection, EPA regional administrator Peter Kostmayer obligingly displayed what Governor Allen calls the federal bureaucracy's "monarchical elitism": "We needed to get their attention," asserted Kostmayer. "The governor has given every indication that he does not want to do it our way."<sup>30</sup>  EPA officials further explained that if EPA approved Virginia's innovative plan, other states would want to reopen and renegotiate their plans.<sup>31</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The states perhaps are beginning to have their way, however. The EPA is backing down from its rigid insistence on the test-only stations and expensive high-tech equipment. EPA Administrator Carol Browner recently announced that the agency would help states design alternative plans. Kostmayer is striking a more concili
atory tone: "Voters have sent a message that they want less confrontation and more cooperation. I think we can do a better job of that," he said recently.<sup>32</sup>  This case is a good example of the impact states can have on federal agencies by focusing their resistance simultaneously on the same problem.<p><b>Noncompliance, Opting Out, and Return of Primacy</b><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Simple noncompliance is another response to unfunded federal mandates. Asserting they do not have the resources to implement the regulations, many law enforcement officials across the country are ignoring Brady Act gun control standards that require background checks on gun buyers.<sup>33</sup>  Governor Pete Wilson has announced that California will not implement "motor voter" sections of the National Voter Registration Act without federal funding. In his August 26, 1994, executive order Governor Wilson stated that "California's motor voter program will be ready to go on January 1, 1995, but it won't go anywhere unless the federal government pays for the mandate they have imposed."  At the time of Administrator Browner's recent announcement that the EPA would be more flexible about Clean Air implementing regulations, several states had announced they simply would not follow some of the specifications.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Serious compliance issues also have arisen over the Clinton Administration's implementation of the liberalized Hyde Amendment provision that allows Medicaid funds to be used to pay for abortions in cases of rape or incest. Some lawmakers, including Representative Henry Hyde (R-IL) himself, assert the new provision does not require funding for such abortions; it only allows it. Moreover, at the time of this change in the amendment, funding abortions, except when there is a threat to the life of the mother, violated 29 states' laws and constitutions. Nevertheless, the Clinton Administration ordered states to fund rape and incest abortions. Many states threatened to ignore the order. Several states succumbed and are bringing their laws into compliance with the mandate. Eleven states -- Arkansas, Colorado, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Utah -- were threatened with loss of Medicaid funds if they did not comply. Faced with such widespread opposition from state officials, the federal Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) has allowed some flexibility regarding how long states take to comply, although it continues to insist that states fund rape and incest abortions. Considerable legal action is still pending.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The salient point in this last example is that similar situations are predictable outcomes of federal strings-attached programs: States succumb to the temptation of federal funds and buy into a program; the people and the state become dependent on it; Congress changes the rules of the game; and the state is directed actually to change its law or even its constitution in order to continue receiving the popular funding. Strings-attached programs can lead to the federal government's virtually dictating state law. Yet, all too often, states have been quick to bargain away their autonomy in pursuit of federal dollars. They responded no differently to 1994's temptation, the crime bill's prison construction money. Most state and local officials who took a public position supported this centralizing bill, despite the additional $28 billion liability it imposes on the states and the greatly increased federal intrusion it allows into states' criminal justice systems.<sup>34</sup>  "No doubt," argues Edward Zelinsky, former alderman and member of the Board of Finance of New Haven, Connecticut, "most mayors and city council members feel they have no choice but to accept any law enforcement assistance offered by federal and state governments. However, I suggest an alternative course: Municipal officials should respectfully, but firmly, refuse such assistance and demand mandate relief instead."<sup>35</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;States should consider opting out of federal strings-attached programs. Studying which federal programs are the best prospects for this would be a worthy project for mandates auditor offices and nonprofit research institutes. In 1992, as Medicaid costs were rising at nearly 14 percent a year and consuming a huge proportion of the state budget, Colorado legislators actually considered opting out of Medicaid and implementing their own Medicaid-style program. In a bipartisan effort, both houses of the legislature passed a bill that would have charged a joint budget committee with study
ing this possibility. Even with the prospective loss of federal funding, Colorado lawmakers felt they could manage their own system in a more cost-efficient manner. Despite their efforts, Governor Roy Romer, apparently uncomfortable with such sweeping reform, vetoed the bill.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Another rarely used option is to turn over state-administered federal programs, or parts of such programs, to federal agencies. This "return of primacy" allows state agencies to forfeit, for an indefinite period of time, programs which prove too burdensome to administer. Once surrendered, these programs are funded and enforced by the federal government. Iowa, for example, returned primacy over Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA) hazardous waste inspection and permits to the EPA in 1985. The state Department of Natural Resources, despite its successful implementation of the program with fifteen employees, was told by EPA that it had to dedicate fifteen more employees to the permit and inspection process in order to come up to standard. The state determined that compliance with this arbitrary standard was not worth the expense. According to an official in the Iowa Environmental Protection Division, EPA now administers the program with no more than two employees working from the EPA regional office. As one might expect, the EPA does not have the resources to administer that which it requires of the states. More widespread return of primacy would help expose the unrealistic burden EPA and other agencies place on states by forcing the federal government to be accountable to its own regulations. There are downsides to return of primacy, however. For instance, state-level administration of regulatory programs tends to yield a friendlier, more flexible and responsive environment for citizens and businesses. But states may regain primacy at any time.
<p>
<b>Colorado's Federal Mandates Act.</b>  Colorado's Federal Mandates Act (Senate Bill 94-157) is one of the sternest and most comprehensive responses to unfunded mandates to date. The bill is intended "to ensure that federal mandates implemented in Colorado comply with state policy as established by the General Assembly."  Most important, it asserts Colorado's right to determine the constitutionality of any federally mandated program, prohibits any state appropriations unless the federal program meets the state's established criteria, and establishes programs and principles for the development of legal theories and legal action to oppose federal mandates. The bill declares the state's primacy in directing the implementation of federally mandated programs and puts state employees involved in implementing these programs on notice that they report to the state, not to the federal government. It argues that the "burden to prove the insufficiency of the state's efforts to implement federal requirements [should be] shifted to the person or agency who asserts such insufficiency."  In other words, Colorado should not be required to prove that its implementation plan for a mandated program is sufficient; rather, before it can require a plan's alteration, the federal government should have to prove that the plan is insufficient. Colorado's Federal Mandates Act lists 19 of the most egregious unfunded federal mandates and criticizes federal mandates for failing to reflect the realities of the Rocky Mountain region, for not allowing the state sufficient flexibility, and for not respecting the rights of the state, its local governments, and its citizens.
<p>

<b>LEGAL ACTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
States also are taking various kinds of legal action against unfunded mandates. They are commissioning offices to study possible legal action; they are suing the federal government, using Tenth Amendment and other constitutional and legal arguments; and they are suing the federal government for reimbursement for the costs of mandated programs for illegal immigrants.

<p>
<b>Constitutional Defense Councils</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In response to Governor Fife Symington's proposal in November 1993, the Arizona legislature was the first to commission a "Constitutional Defense Council" to direct the study, initiation, and prosecution of appropriate legal action aimed at "restoring, maintaining, and advancing the state's sovereignty and authority over issues that affect this state and the well-being of its citizens."  Meetings and hearings will examine "federal mandates; court rulings; the authority granted to, or assumed by, the federal government; laws, regulations, and practices of the federal government; and any other activity deemed appropriate given the purposes of the council."  The council has the authority to direct the attorney general to take appropriate legal action. Its million-dollar budget will fund the hiring of qualified attorneys to research and prosecute the cases.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Several other states also are studying possible legal action. Utah has established a constitutional defense council based on the Arizona model. Within the last year, Colorado, Hawaii, and Maine have directed their attorneys general to investigate legal action to challenge unfunded federal mandates.

<p>
<b>Resuscitating the Tenth Amendment</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While Tenth Amendment jurisprudence in the post-New Deal era has not been favorable to state autonomy, efforts to restore a more balanced understanding of federalism in the courts are mounting. One encouraging sign came in the Supreme Court's 1992 decision, New York v. United States, in which the Court sided 6-3 with New York's argument that it had been "commandeered to do the government's regulation" by a federal requirement to dispose of low-level nuclear waste. Deciding on Tenth Amendment grounds, Justice O'Connor wrote for the majority that "No matter how powerful the federal interest involved, the Constitution simply does not give Congress the authority to require the states to regulate."

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A similar suit, Missouri v. United States, filed in July 1994 by Missouri Governor Mel Carnahan, addresses congressional and EPA authority with regard to punitive sanctions within the Clean Air Act. Penalties imposed on nonattainment include the withholding of federal highway funds and "offset" rules which effectively halt economic development in the region and, if the EPA wishes, in the entire state. Missouri claims these regulations conflict with the Tenth Amendment and the Spending Clause. Like New York, the Missouri suit claims that "Congress has effectively commandeered the legislative process of the States by compelling them to implement regulatory programs.... " But Missouri would take New York a step further by broadening the concept of "impermissible Congressional compulsion" to include the threat of withheld federal funding. Tenth Amendment challenges also have arisen in response to federal gun-control mandates contained in the Brady Act, which imposes duties on local law enforcement officials such as background checks on gun purchasers and is being challenged in several courts around the country. A Montana federal district court judge, for example, struck down part of the law, citing New York v. U.S. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Another related constitutional issue being considered in the courts is reliance on the Commerce Clause as the basis for congressional legislation.<sup>36</sup>  The expansion of Congress's Commerce Clause powers throughout most of American history has been one of the major causes of the erosion of state powers. Today it is claimed as the authority for approximately 97 percent of all federal legislation. At issue in a circuit court decision the Supreme Court recently heard -- United States v. Lopez -- is whether Congress has constitutional authority under the Commerce Clause to ban the possession of guns near schools under the Gun Free School Zones Act. The connection between interstate commerce and the possession of guns near schools is indeed difficult to discern. The Lopez decision, which is expected early 1995, will be a strong indication of how much the present Supreme Court wants to correct the imbalance in America's federalist system. Seven national associations of state and local government officials -- including the National Conference of State Legislatures, National Governors' Association, and National League of Cities -- filed an amicus curiae brief arguing against such sweeping Commerce Clause authority for Congress.

<p>
<b>Immigration Lawsuits</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Governors in Florida, California, Texas, and Arizona have filed suit against the federal government for costs their states have incurred from illegal immigrants. The federal failure to secure the borders against illegal immigration has resulted in substantially increased costs to these four states in particular. Strictly speaking, not all these costs are unfunded federal mandates. States always have been obliged to prosecute and incarcerate criminals, whether they are illegal immigrants or not. Such costs, because they are not federally mandated in the same sense that safe drinking water standards or motor voter compliance are, constitute a "cost shift."  Attorney General Janet Reno has responded to the California suit by promising a small partial reimbursement for the state's incarceration of illegal immigrants. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 provides for federal reimbursement for such expenses, but this will be the first time funds actually have been appropriated for this purpose.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
State costs of educating and providing health care to illegal immigrants, on the other hand, are federally mandated. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 requires states to reimburse hospitals for expenses incurred in caring for uninsured illegal aliens. The requirement that states cover the education costs for illegal immigrants is mandated by the Supreme Court's Plyler v. Doe decision. California estimated that illegal immigrants will cost state taxpayers $3.4 billion in 1994, including $1.9 billion in unfunded federal mandates (education and health services) and $474 million for incarceration. Adjusting for taxes paid by illegal immigrants, California estimated its net loss will still be $2.7 billion.<sup>37</sup>  These figures do not include the costs of providing services to the children of illegal immigrants.<p><b>AMENDING THE CONSTITUTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Some state officials believe that states ultimately will have to take constitutional action to establish reliable protection against federally induced costs. Kansas and South Dakota have passed resolutions calling for a constitutional convention to pass an amendment that would prohibit unfunded federal mandates on states. However, there are some in the anti-mandates coalition who wonder just how limited a "limited" constitutional convention might be. They are concerned about the possibility of a "runaway" convention that would dramatically alter the Constitution, despite the fact that even a constitutional convention may propose only amendments that must be ratified by the states. These people are not likely to be satisfied even by South Dakota's language stipulating that its application should "be deemed null and void, rescinded, and of no effect in the event that such convention not be limited to such specific and exclusive purpose."

<p>
<b>A Conference of the States</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Utah Governor Mike Leavitt has offered a proposal that may make this a moot point. Leavitt's "Conference of the States" proposal, if successful, would demonstrate to Congress the states' ability to conduct a constitutional convention while avoiding the controversy and risk (to whatever extent it exists) of an actual convention. Governor Leavitt and his Democratic partner, Nebraska Governor Ben Nelson, intend this Conference of the States to address "one narrow purpose" -- the development of "an agenda or action plan that would give states leverage to compete in the federal system, ultimately restoring balance between the states and the national government. The action plan could consist of legal strategies, carefully crafted amendments to the U.S. Constitution, or other components."

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In response to this proposal, the National Governors' Association and National Conference of State Legislatures have formed a task force to consider a conference of the states as one possible device for organizing "collective state action, concentrating state power, and focusing national attention on federalism."  The American Legislative Exchange Council also has indicated interest in the proposal. Governors Leavitt and Nelson are determined that the effort remain bipartisan and focused solely on federal-state relations.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
According to Governor Leavitt's plan, the conference would be preceded by a series of "Federalism Summits."  The agenda for the Conference of the States would be drafted at these meetings of state and local leaders and analysts. To convene the conference, each state would send a delegation, most likely legislators and governors. If any states were unable to pass resolutions authorizing a delegation, individual legislators would represent their states on their own. The action plan resolved by the conference would be reported back to the legislatures. If three-quarters of the states formally endorsed the plan, it would be particularly difficult for Congress to ignore. If Congress did not submit the conference's proposed amendments to the states for ratification, the option of calling for a constitutional convention remains open. Says Governor Leavitt, "Supporters of this proposal hope and believe that such dire action as calling a constitutional convention would not be necessary. But the threat must exist to motivate Congress to act."

<p>
<b>The States' Initiative and the States' Veto</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
At the November 1994 Republican Governors' Association meeting in Williamsburg, Governor Allen proposed a constitutional amendment with two complementary parts: the States' Initiative and the States' Veto. As described in the Governor's Executive Order Number Thirty-Seven, the proposed amendment would enable states to amend the Constitution or to overturn federal legislation without either a constitutional convention or congressional or judicial action: "Under the proposed States' Initiative, if three-quarters of the States approve a proposed amendment within a specified time period, and if Congress thereafter fails to override the States' action by a two-thirds vote of the Senate and the House of Representatives, then the state-initiated action would become part of the Constitution."<sup>38</sup>  The States' Veto would enable three-quarters of the states to repeal objectionable federal legislation or regulations unless Congress overrides the states' action by a two-thirds vote of both houses.<sup>39</sup><p><b>CONCLUSION</b><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As much as excessive taxation, wasteful spending, and picayune regulation, the centralization of power in Washington threatens to smother America's enterprise and liberty. The states have the power, the authority, the opportunity, and the responsibility to rein in an out-of-control federal government. Successful efforts to end unfunded federal mandates and restore balance to America's intergovernmental system will transfer decisionmaking to levels of government more accessible and, therefore, more accountable to the people -- namely, state and local governments. States and localities are leading the fight against federal encroachment by a variety of means: educating the public; publishing mandate cost studies; holding federal lawmakers personally accountable to their constituents; challenging Congress's authority to impose mandates; resisting or refusing compliance with federal micromanagement; suing the federal government; working with each other
 to lobby Congress and plan strategies to restore balance to federal-state relations, including constitutional amendment strategies and more. The sleeping giant in American governance -- the states -- has re-awakened. It is a force that can moderate, if not tame, the federal leviathan.

Governor Pataki Speaks on Federalism -- Heritage </title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<b>Heritage Lecture 535</b><br>
<p>
<h2>The Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/95lect.htm">Lectures and Seminars</a></h2>
<hr>
<h3>Federalism on the Hudson:  The Empire State Strikes Back</h3>
<a href="gopher://nyslgti.gen.ny.us:70/11/NY_STATE_GOV/GOVERNOR">Governor George Pataki</a> Speaking in Heritage's Van Andel Center, July 27, 1995
<p><br>
I want to begin by saying how much I've looked forward to coming here today. The reason has to do with <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage/mission.html">Heritage</a>, with all of you, and the importance of ideas in politics.
<p>
I'm one of those, for example, who can remember a time in the 1960s when there was very little opposition to a Republican President's plan for something called the Family Assistance Plan, a program that even its strongest supporters now admit would have made the current welfare catastrophe even worse, perhaps even an insoluble one. But in those days, one young congressional staffer saw the danger and, virtually singlehandedly, marshalled arguments against the plan after it passed the <a href="http://www.house.gov">House</a> by a two-to-one vote -- arguments that eventually translated into "nay" votes on the floor of the <a href="gopher://gopher.senate.gov">Senate</a>. The power of that young conservative's well-marshalled arguments saved the nation from a serious social policy mistake, but it also led to something even more fortuitous and important. You see, when <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Ed Feulner</a> saw the effect that his ideas could have even on Capitol Hill, it led to another idea:  the idea of this place, the idea of Heritage.
<p>
Some of us who were young conservatives back in those days remember the title of a book by Richard Weaver: <i>Ideas Have Consequences.</i> Twenty-five years or so later, we see evidence of how right Weaver was in the consequences of Ed Feulner's idea of Heritage. This building and lecture hall in the heart of Capitol Hill are the physical evidence. There's also Heritage's generous endowment. But even more impressive is Heritage's history, its record not only of stopping bad legislation, but developing and disseminating the ideas that have led to the current conservative counterrevolution in public policy. When that revolution began in 1981, Heritage electrified this city with its blueprint,<i> Mandate for Leadership</i>, one that <a href="http://www.erinet.com/bkottman/reagan.html">Ronald Reagan</a> embraced and one that, as you continually updated it, made Heritage a foremost idea bank of the conservative revolution.
<p>
So Heritage is many things:  a think tank, a government in exile, ground control for conservatives and the Republican Party. But I also want you to know that for those of us who were part of a silent revolution going on outside of Washington and beyond the Beltway, it was also a beacon from the policy mountaintop. For a small-town mayor, state assemblyman, and senator named George Pataki, and for others like me, you were a reminder of how vigorous and exciting conservative ideas could be; for us, you were an inspiration to keep fighting for those ideas at the state and local level.
<p>
And this brings us to my first point today. Last fall in New York State, the state many regard as the most liberal state in the country, an icon of liberalism fell. News of the defeat of Mario Cuomo, the foremost liberal spokesman in America, was considered by many people in and out of Washington just too good to be true. Mario Cuomo's defeat signalled the death of liberalism. After all, it wasn't Mario Cuomo who was defeated; it was his philosophy of more government, more spending, and more taxes. I am here today to say that this victory was not just a victory for George Pataki. The defeat of Mario Cuomo and his liberal policies is a victory for all of us. On behalf of the people of the state of New York, I thank you for your tremendous help in bringing about this change.
<p>
I was glad we could run the kind of political campaign we did, one that emphasized the stark differences between liberals and conservatives, that made it clear one side was for less spending, lower taxes, and more growth while the other side was for more spending, higher taxes, and more government dependency. Our opponents believed in control and regulation and redistribution of wealth by government elites. We believed in individual freedom and personal responsibility and the unbounded riches only a free and creative people can create.
<p>
We didn't, however, just make these points or put forward these issues; we had specific policy recommendations and programs to back them up. We had an innovative, carefully prepared tax-cut plan. When it came to spending and budget proposals, we called for specific reforms. On programs like Medicaid, the help of my running mate Betsy McCaughey, an expert on health care and a former think-tanker herself, was invaluable. In the same manner, we put forward not just rhetoric, but specifics about reforming our failed welfare and criminal justice systems.
<p>
I believe that having this kind of substance and content to our campaign was crucial to its success. But no one knows better than I that implementing conservative policy alternatives in a state where liberal policies were perpetuated for decades isn't done easily or overnight. Throughout this process, you at Heritage have been the leaders. I'm particularly proud of the New Yorkers -- Lew Lehrman, <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage/staff/kemp.htm">Jack Kemp</a>, Bill Simon, Midge Decter, and Dusty Rhodes -- who have had a role in your success.
<p>
And how could I not thank my good friend, <a href="http://policy.net/capweb/States/NY/NY.html">Senator Al D'Amato</a>, who is one of the leaders in the fight to control government spending, reduce regulation, and make our people safer in their homes and neighborhoods?
<p>
These great New Yorkers emphasize my point. Our victory in New York state and over Mario Cuomo last November was not just a victory of politics; it was a victory of ideas, our shared ideas. It was not just the work of candidates and their campaign supporters; it was the work of those who have made policy alternatives to the statist ideas of elitist liberals credible. This has been your work. So I'm here today for a simple reason:  to congratulate you on that work, to thank you for it, and to urge you, by all means, to keep it up.
<p>
I want to bring you up to date on what we have managed to achieve during the past six months in New York as we rolled back failed liberal policies and replaced them with fresh and promising alternatives. Before I do that, though, let me make just one additional personal note on the long road we have walked together overturning failures of liberalism.
<p>
You know, Ed Feulner used to say he could remember when the whole conservative movement could fit in a phone booth. And I know your Vice President for Government Relations, Kate Walsh O'Beirne, who got her start in politics working in Jim Buckley's 1970 campaign, knows the truth of that statement.
<p>
Believe me, so do I. I remember as a teenager my Hungarian relatives as they watched the flickering black and white TV images of the Soviet army crushing freedom on the streets of Budapest. I remember in those days how we anti-communists wondered whether the world would ever wake to the menace of Soviet totalitarianism and the evil empire. And I remember, too, as a college student the struggles of young Republicans with older party leaders who in places like Connecticut and New York were so deeply and routinely liberal. I can also remember election night 1964 -- the desolation we felt. A desolation, however, that eventually turned to determination as we started wearing buttons that read:  "26 million Americans can't be wrong."
<p>
They weren't, of course, and it was a good start. Since that time we've seen what the great conservative historian Eric Voegelin called the "variegation" and "differentiation" of conservative ideas. All that means, really, is the description of a process by which a few seminal ideas get diversified in a culture -- in Wisconsin, in New Jersey, even in "Taxachusetts."
<p>
But there was always that one holdout, that last bastion of liberalism and a home for true believers. In a state like New York, liberals just didn't see the coercive side of government as we did, and they couldn't understand one of history's most solemn lessons:  that government's appetite for power, unless carefully watched and checked, makes it the greatest of institutional threats to personal freedom and economic progress. Such liberals honestly believed government was some great benevolent force that, in the hands of an enlightened elite (namely themselves), could be just as nurturing and helpful to society as the family. Mario Cuomo actually made this comparison, by the way, at the 1984 Democratic National Convention, and Senator Paul Laxalt said it all when he responded at the Republican convention:  "If you believe Mario Cuomo when he says government is just like family, just like Mom and Pop, ask yourselves this one question:  When's the last time all the IRS wanted from you was a kiss and a hug?"
<p>
What a price New York had to pay for all the big government, for the decades of liberalism. The Empire State became a leader in taxes, regulatory burden, welfare spending, and crime. We were also right up there at the top in jobs lost and young people moving out of the state.
<p>
As a New Yorker, it was hard to watch. I knew my state as a gateway to freedom for millions. I had four grandparents -- Yanos and Elizabeth Pataki, Agnes Lynch, and Matteo Lagna -- come through those gates at Ellis Island. Three of them could not even speak or read English when they got their first job. All they had was their own belief in a better future for themselves and for their children. But something else, too:  the opportunity that America and New York, the Empire State, offered them.
<p>
My own life saw even more opportunity and good fortune. The son of a Peekskill mailman, I had a chance to go to schools like Yale, to study law at Columbia, and to make a good living for my family. Maybe you can understand, then, why I got into public service. I wanted to bring back the kind of hope and opportunity that was being lost in the social and economic wreckage left by decades of liberal rule.
<p>
In looking at the changes that I knew needed to be brought to New York, I was, of course, looking through a highly personal prism. Those of us who have a philosophical preference for the individual over the collective actually forget that we come to our common ideas through a unique set of individual experiences. So, in discussing the changes that have come to New York, I hope you will permit me today to describe them by using the prism through which I saw them during the campaign and my first six months in office:  a prism of hope, a prism of economic and educational opportunity fostered by strong communities and families.
<p>
In seeking the restoration of New York as a breeding ground of hope and opportunity, that last word -- families -- has always loomed large in my mind. In the days of hope and opportunity, we had tremendously strong families; my parents were there, brother, cousins, aunts and uncles, all of us helping and caring for each other. What a contrast that is to the family instability and the outright social mayhem fostered by intrusive government and a state welfare system that must have been the worst in the nation.
<p>
I say "must have been" because we have now dramatically changed that failed welfare system. I can't say it was an easy fight in the legislature. But we did, and here's what we've achieved so far:
<p>
<ul>
<li>First, workfare is now a reality in New York. Able-bodied recipients who refuse to work won't get welfare.
<p>
<li>Second, learnfare is also a reality. This means that if you're on welfare and you're not making sure your children get to school, you face sharply reduced benefits.
<p>
<li>Third, pregnant teenagers no longer can set up welfare apartments. They're now required to stay at home.
<p>
<li>Fourth, we've attacked welfare migration and removed the incentive to move to New York in order to receive welfare benefits.
<p>
<li>And fifth, there's a serious crackdown on fraud. This means special fraud task forces, computer checks, and the use of promising techniques like finger imaging.
</ul>
<p>
Unlike liberals, who believe government programs can be "value-neutral," we know all human actions, and especially the corporate actions of government, have a normative content, that they send a strong message. Behind our reforms, then, is a message that is the opposite of that sent by the old welfare system and its cycle of dependency. This new message reaffirms our common belief in the importance of keeping families intact, in values like hard work and individual responsibility, and in the sense of pride and self-worth to which every human being is entitled.
<p>
A second element in the restoration of New York's greatness and its recovery from years of liberal rule is that of strong communities. When I was growing up, the idea of parks ruled by thugs, or the idea of parents afraid to send their kids to the corner store, or even school -- all this was unthinkable. That's why in just a few short months we have totally restructured the criminal justice system. Here's what we have accomplished:
<ul>
<p>
<li>The death penalty was reinstated after being vetoed for 18 consecutive years.
<p>
<li>Violent felons can no longer get early release or work release and must serve longer sentences.
<p>
<li>Repeat violent felons can no longer get out on parole.
<p>
<li>Repeat violent felons now face new tough sentencing laws that require them to serve at least 85 percent of their sentences. In the past, they could get away with serving less than half.
<p>
<li>We've made great strides in cracking down on other criminal offenses. I will sign a bill that will allow communities to be notified when sex offenders are released into their neighborhoods -- also known as Megan's law. I have also tackled organized crime in places like the Javits Convention Center in New York City, where it has had a frightening influence.
</ul>
<p>
We're being tough and we're being smart. We've made it possible for nonviolent drug offenders, with the consent of the judge and prosecutor, to get into treatment rather than be sent for a full-time tutorial in criminality in prisons like Attica.
<p>
The third area of our reform efforts is the one you've probably heard the most about:  restoring jobs and economic opportunity to New York. Here are the results:
Take reducing the size of government. For the first time in fifty years -- for the first time since World War II and Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak --New York's general fund will spend less than the year before. And we're tackling the tough ones, reforming programs that need it the most. In Medicaid, for instance, we're bringing down costs with anti-fraud SWAT teams and managed care alternatives.
<p>
Even more startling for what some call the most liberal state in the Union, we cut income taxes by 25 percent.
<p>
And we've abolished or reduced other taxes, including container taxes, beer taxes, estate taxes, the petroleum business tax, pari-mutuel taxes, and the real property gains tax.
<p>
I can't stress how vital these reforms are. During the most recent national recession, New York lost 400,000 jobs. Even as the recovery began in April 1991 and the rest of the country was gaining jobs, we continued to lose jobs -- 150,000 of them. It's not just a matter of dollars and cents; it's the message government sends to employers and businesses. I believe the message we are now sending is business-friendly, one that says New York understands that higher taxes and more spending mean fewer jobs and less growth.
<p>
By the way, you'd be amazed at how quickly word gets around. In just the past few months, the CEOs of Kodak and IBM have announced they would keep and expand large parts of their operations and thousands of jobs in New York because of the recent changes in the state's attitude. A few weeks ago, Pepsi announced plans for a $10 million expansion in the Hudson Valley. And just yesterday, Ball Incorporated announced plans to build a new manufacturing plant in central New York. And though we may not know about them right now, I think there are many more businesses that are currently making the same decision.
<p>
The fourth and final area of concentrated reform has been restoring and expanding educational opportunity. The New York I grew up in was famous for the excellence of its school system. But today, when people think of New York schools, they think too often of huge  union salaries, administrative and bureaucratic overhead, low test scores, and classroom disruption.
<p>
I remember a few years ago when my predecessor called an education summit. Everybody came:  the teacher unions, administrators, boards of education, as well as advocacy and special-interest groups of every description. Only two groups were left out:  parents and students. And that's been the problem:  The attempt to micromanage education from Albany has meant an education system that too often serves the purposes of bureaucrats and special-interest groups, but not parents and students.
<p>
We've moved to reverse this trend. We've made bureaucracy a focus of the education debate. I've taken on the state Board of Regents and called for its abolition. I've reduced the size of the state's education bureaucracy, and I've moved to centralize accountability in the education system with one person -- the governor.
<p>
Now, in education as in the other three areas, there is much more to talk about. For the moment, though, I want to suggest an overall point. In seeking to renew New York, in restoring the economic and educational opportunity that made our state a magnet of hope and freedom for millions in the past, we are carrying the conservative revolution of ideas into one of the last liberal states in the Union. The new policies we're instituting overthrow all the unworkable liberal abstractions of the past. We are seeking to empower the people instead of elite micromanagers in government. And rather than treat the poor or disadvantaged as failures, we want to build their pride and self-sufficiency.
<p>
So against years of failed liberal policies, the Empire State is striking back:  striking back with reforms that will restore opportunity and give present-day New Yorkers and their children the same chance to achieve the American dream. Let me also draw from the experience of the past six months three specific lessons that may be helpful in bringing dramatic change and reform to other levels of government.
<p>
You know, when I first proposed real spending cuts and a 25 percent income-tax cut, these ideas were dismissed as unrealistic campaign gimmicks. And that's why it's hard to  describe the sense of "the world turned upside down" I had as I sat in my office not long ago. I was listening to the legislative debate, and I heard Democrat after Democrat in the State Assembly stand up, denounce my budget and my tax cut, and then vote for them anyway. In a state where they were proud to increase taxes and increase spending year after year, lawmakers in 1995 had no choice but to do the opposite. They knew where the people stood. They knew what the people wanted. And it was change.
<p>
And that brings me to the first important lesson:  Seek no incremental change. Pursuing only half-steps takes the focus off liberalism's sweeping failure and deprives us of the larger philosophical and practical arguments that can carry the public debate. So our policies have to be up to our rhetoric. We should remember what Napoleon said to one of his generals:  "If you mean to take Vienna, take Vienna."
<p>
You must stick to your principles. But it's important to keep the door open to opponents as well as to friends and allies. It's also important to disagree civilly and courteously. But let's not be afraid of the disagreement and controversy. As Margaret Thatcher says, controversy is good; it moves your agenda forward.
<p>
I'm also reminded here of a story told about Jack Kennedy when he was seeking the Democratic nomination for President. Many old-line party types thought him far too young for the job, and one of them, Harry Truman, expressed himself in his usual colorful language on the subject. Asked, after the Democratic convention in 1960, how he was ever going to make up with former President Truman, Senator Kennedy said simply:  "Well, I suppose President Truman will apologize for calling me an SOB and I will apologize for being one."
<p>
There's a lesson here. The American political system is built for robust debate; it's flexible enough to be both adversarial and collegial. Take advantage of both, but, most of all, don't be afraid of being adversarial when core principles and goals are at stake.
<p>
And the key to sticking to principle is one that gives conservative reformers an edge every time over the entrenched interests and Beltway mentality in places like Albany and Washington. Although it's my last point, it's also one you've heard before. In fact, at a dinner to kick off your first endowment drive back in 1983, President Reagan said:  "Many people in the power structure of our capital think that appealing to someone's narrow self-interest is the best way to appeal to the American people as a whole, and that's where they're wrong. When the American people go to the polls, when they speak out on the issues of the day, they know how high the stakes are. They know the future of freedom depends not on what's `in it for me' but on the ethic of what's good for the country, what will serve and protect freedom."
<p>
President Reagan went on to say that we must remember that the American people do not want political leadership that serves the special interests, but leadership that offers hope and a vision of the future. He reminded us that issues and ideas really do count. They count because the American people have rejected what liberalism has become, and they have recognized and embraced the conservative message whenever it has been coherently and consistently presented.
<p>
Entrenched liberal interests can't see this because they tend to project their own obsession with self-interest on the people as a whole. They also don't realize that though the people know less about the intricacies of government than bureaucrats or elitist micromanagers, the people do know better about both what and how government is doing. And that's the point we need to keep in mind:  that our system of government is based on the revolutionary belief of the American Founders in what they called "popular government," the idea that the people as a whole know better than any group of elites.
<p>
We believe in the people. We know what they can achieve and accomplish. We should also remember that people expect and are entitled to leadership. And leadership means that when we are embattled against entrenched interests, we must take the time to turn to the people, to explain the situation and then ask their help and support. That's what we did in New York. When the entrenched interests fought the budget and my tax cuts, when they tried to block hope and opportunity, we took our message to the people.
<p>
The larger historical record is clear about what happens when American leaders go to the people. That night President Reagan spoke to you, he predicted the eventual triumph of the West in the Cold War. But in doing so he cited the words of Joseph Warren, a Boston doctor who would be remembered as one of the great American Founders had his life not been cut short by a bullet on Bunker Hill. Not long before that battle, Dr. Warren told a Boston crowd:  "Our country is in danger but not to be despaired of. On you depends the  fortunes of America. You are to decide that important question on which rests the happiness and liberty of millions yet unborn. Act worthy of yourselves."
<p>

The record is clear:  Just as they did in 1776, the Americans of our own time have acted worthy of freedom, worthy of their heritage, worthy of themselves. And now that America and the conservative revolution have brought down a totalitarian empire and ended the Cold War, we are turning to problems left too long neglected at home. Today, then, in our cities and states a great conservative revolution and reaffirmation is underway. I'm proud to be part of that effort and proud to tell you that New York is now at the forefront of this revolutionary reaffirmation of growth and hope, opportunity and freedom.

jailed earlier for violent crimes, spent only a fraction of their sentences in 
prison. We are now paying the dividends of a liberal justice system that 
refuses to take punishment seriously: Virginia has witnessed a 28 percent 
increase in criminal violence over the last five years. Three out of every four 
violent crimes--murder, armed robbery, rape, assault--are now committed by 
repeat offenders.</P>
<P>	This is why my administration pushed through legislation, which took 
effect on January 1, 1995 that will impose penalties for rape, murder, and 
armed robbery more than twice the national average for those crimes. We 
have abolished parole, established the principle of truth-in-sentencing, and 
increased as much as fivefold the amount of time that violent offenders will 
actually spend in jail. Experience vindicates what commonsense has always 
told us: The only foolproof crime-prevention technique is incarceration.</P>
<P>	 Our new system is attempting to unravel 30 years of paper-tiger laws 
based on the questionable philosophy that people can change, criminals can 
be rehabilitated, and every violent criminal--even a murderer--deserves a 
second chance. The new law in Virginia will prevent thousands of crimes, 
save lives, save money, and restore trust in the criminal justice system. 
Despite this, we now face entrenched opposition from liberals in the General 
Assembly, who hope to thwart reform by withholding funds to build the 
minimal number of prison facilities needed to house Virginia's most violent 
inmates.</P> 
<P>	A few weeks after taking office in January 1994, I created the 
Commission on Parole Abolition and Sentencing Reform. It was a bipartisan 
commission of prosecutors, judges, crime victims, law-enforcement officers, 
business leaders, and legal scholars. William Barr, a former attorney general 
of the United States, and Richard Cullen, a former U.S. Attorney for the 
Eastern District of Virginia, co-chaired the commission. They had a daunting 
task.</P>
<P>	I called for a special session of the General Assembly in September 
1994 to focus the public's and the legislature's attention on this issue. I gave 
the commission six months to demonstrate the need for change, develop a 
detailed plan, and explain its costs and implementation.</P>
<P>	We were quickly able to show why a complete overhaul was necessary. 
Convicted felons were serving about one-third of their sentences on average, 
and many served only one-sixth. Violent criminals were no exception. First-
degree murderers were given average sentences of 35 years, but spent an 
average of only 10 years behind bars. Rapists were being sentenced to nine 
years and serving four. Armed robbers received sentences averaging 14 years 
and served only about four.</P>
<P>	Amazingly, a prior conviction for a violent crime did not affect this 
phenomenon. Even murderers, rapists, and armed robbers who had already 
served time for similar offenses were receiving the same sentences and 
serving the same amount of time as first offenders.</P>
<P>	Statewide, the violent crime rate had risen 28 percent in five years, 
even though the crime-prone age bracket (15 to 24 years) was shrinking. 
Criminologists widely regard trends in the size of this demographic group as 
the best predictor of criminal activity. Unfortunately for Virginians, the 
crime-prone-age population is expected to rise sharply in the state beginning 
in 1996--all the more reason to press forward with reform. The peak age for 
murder and armed robbery has been dropping steadily; by 1993, it stood at 18 
years for both crimes. More than three-quarters of all violent criminals in the 
system in 1993 had prior convictions.</P>
<BR>
<H3>The Plan</H3>
<P>	Only a multi-pronged approach can begin to turn these numbers 
around. Virginia's new law means, first of all, eliminating discretionary 
parole, in which a parole board can release an offender after he has served 
only part of his sentence. In Virginia, this policy clearly was being abused: 
offenders received 30 days of good time for every 30 days they served--
effectively cutting their sentences in half as soon as they came in the door.</P>
<P>	But this is not all. We need to eliminate "good time" as well. In order to 
encourage good behavior among inmates and allow correctional officers to 
maintain order, the commission proposed a system of earned-sentence 
credits. This system would allow inmates to earn a maximum of 54 days per 
year--a dramatic reduction from the average of 300 days they had been given 
in the past.</P>
<P>	Long before our bill became law, we held town meetings across the 
state to solicit advice from citizens, and discussed the plan's details with 
prosecutors, victims-rights groups, corrections experts, and criminologists. 
The need for more prison space became a primary concern. Even before I took 
office, Virginia was expected to double its prison population by the year 2005. 
The state was facing a shortfall of 7,100 prison beds by 1999. At the same 
time, opponents of the plan were already carping about too little spending on 
crime prevention and education and too much on building prisons.</P>
<P>	Obviously, judges need some mechanism to guide their sentencing 
decisions. A system with no parole and no "good time" could not afford 70-
year sentences for drug dealers or 150-year sentences for armed robbers. But 
how much do we increase the time served for violent offenders? Our 
commission found an answer by evaluating the relationship of recidivism to 
time served and age of release. The data showed that the longer an offender 
remained behind bars, the less likely he is to commit another crime after 
finishing his sentence. Similarly, the older the offender upon release, the less 
his propensity to commit more crime. In fact, after 37 years of age, the 
likelihood of violent crime drops dramatically.</P>
<P>   Although preventing criminals from committing further acts of violence was 
the primary goal, the increases had to reflect the notion of retribution as well. 
We wanted Virginia to send a message to violent criminals: We will not 
tolerate violence, and if you commit a violent crime, you will stay in prison 
until you're too old to commit another one.</P>
<P>	Virginia increased prison time for violent criminals as follows:
<UL>
<LI>  100 percent increase for first-time violent offenders.
<LI>  125 percent for first-time murderers, rapists, and armed robbers.
<LI>  300 percent for those with previous convictions for assault, burglary, or 
malicious wounding.
 <LI> 500 percent for those with previous convictions for murder, rape, or armed 
robbery.</UL>
<P>	To target the young violent offender, we counted comparable juvenile 
offenses as felony convictions when determining a sentence. For example, if 
John Smith is found guilty in a juvenile court of armed robbery at age 14, and 
was convicted of another armed robbery at age 19, the sentencing guidelines 
call for a 500 percent increase in the time he normally would have served 
under the old system.</P>
<P>	By abolishing a bankrupt parole system, and by drastically reforming 
the "good time" credit provisions, Virginia courtrooms are redefining what the 
truth-in-sentencing debate is really about. Under our system, every inmate 
convicted of a violent crime will serve a minimum of 85 percent of his or her 
sentence. Nationwide, criminals on average serve well below 50 percent of 
their sentences. There is simply no surer way for the state to protect its 
citizens from society's most dangerous members.</P>
<BR>
<H3>Saving Lives and Money</H3>
<P>	 Had the law been in effect nine years ago, it would have saved the life 
of Detective Taylor. Had it been in effect four years ago, Leo Webb would be 
alive today.</P>
<P>	The most conservative estimates show that more than 4,300 felony 
crimes would have been prevented between 1986 and 1993 if the current 
system had been in place. That number is based on actual convictions--real 
cases, not projections.</P>
<P>	Over the next 10 years, the new law will prevent at least 119,000 
felonies, including 26,000 violent crimes. Because of those averted violent 
crimes, an estimated 475 lives will be saved, 3,700 women will be spared from 
rape, and more than 11,300 aggravated assaults will not be committed. As a 
result, citizens will save more than $2.7 billion in direct costs.</P>
<P>	Back in September, when it became clear that the legislation would 
pass with overwhelming support, some vocal opponents claimed that 
abolishing parole was a declaration of war on young black males. They 
demanded that the Commonwealth spend more money on prevention 
programs, and charged that, by focusing on punishment, we were merely 
catering to "white fear." Their arguments fell on deaf ears.</P>
<P>	The crime prevented as a result of the new law will benefit the African-
American community--one-fifth of Virginia's population--more than any 
other group. Of the preventable murders that occurred between 1986 and 
1993, about 65 percent involved black victims. For assaults during that same 
period, about 60 percent of the victims were black. Taylor and Webb were 
both African Americans.</P>
<P>	Of all the crimes committed by recidivists during that same period, 60 
percent would have been prevented if the current law had been in place. 
There is no other prevention program that can show even a fraction of this 
success. That is not to say that other prevention programs are not valid or 
important. However, it is clear that when it comes to violent offenders, 
incarceration is the most just and the most efficient.</P>
<P>	Virginia has been spending an average of $658 million in taxpayers' 
money each year on handling recidivists. This is the cost of new 
investigations, new arrests, and new trials. The total cost of the prison 
construction needs for the next 10 years is about $750 million. The new law 
will force us to build more prisons--but not many more. Virginia would have 
doubled its prison population in the next 10 years anyway.</P>
<P>	The difference is that under the old system, the ratio of violent 
criminals among the prison population to non-violent has been 50:50. 
Marijuana dealers, embezzlers, and petty thieves have been serving time in 
the same $40,000-per-year hard cells as murderers, rapists, and armed 
robbers. Under the new guidelines, the inmate ratio will be 70 percent 
violent, 30 percent non-violent. This is obviously a more cost-effective use of 
medium- and maximum-security prison space.</P>
<P>	Try telling that, however, to the liberals in the General Assembly. I 
asked lawmakers in February for $402.6 million as a first installment in 
revamping our prison system. They voted to provide only $104.4 million. They 
are shortchanging prison construction, making it more likely that dangerous 
criminals will be released early--and be back in our neighborhoods. 
Increasing prison terms without increasing prison capacity is precisely the 
mistake that too many other states have already made.</P>
<P>	Part of the problem with the current system of incarceration is its near 
inability to distinguish between dangerous criminals and the more routine, 
petty offenders. Under our plan, we are building low-cost work centers to 
house first-time and non-violent offenders. These work centers operate at 
about half the cost per inmate as a standard prison, and they ensure that the 
inmates get work opportunities while incarcerated. The average length of 
stay at a work center will be about 10 to 18 months. We can build these 
facilities quickly, freeing up bed space in the prisons for violent criminals.</P>
<P>	The abolition of parole and establishment of truth-in-sentencing rules 
was the centerpiece of my campaign for governor in 1993. During that 
campaign, critics claimed my approach was too drastic and too costly. Pundits 
and politicians still doubt that Virginia can overhaul its entire criminal-
justice system without breaking the bank. Those naysayers failed to hear the 
public's demand for change. The people of Virginia--particularly crime 
victims and their families--are tired of seeing criminals walk free after 
serving only a fraction of their sentences. Businessmen can't afford to watch 
deals collapse because potential clients are concerned about crime. 
Prosecutors and police are frustrated that their hard work often amounts to 
abbreviated prison stints for criminals.</P>
<P>	In order to overturn the status quo approach to crime reduction, we 
listened to all those people and presented extensive research to show that 
what we had been doing was not working. Public safety is the primary 
responsibility of government. Without it, nothing else can succeed. Education, 
economic development, and health care all suffer when people feel 
threatened.</P>
<P>	Virginians came together to formulate and implement this reform. We 
looked at what North Carolina, Texas, Florida, and the federal government 
had done in the area of sentencing reform. We borrowed some of the best 
aspects of those systems and avoided some of the mistakes they made. In the 
end, we did it the Virginia way.</P>
<P>	The principle that guided this effort, and should guide policymakers in 
all issues, is honesty. Easy-release rules prevent judges and juries from 
preempting the community's judgment about the proper punishment for 
illegal conduct. Under the new law, judges will not have to play guessing 
games when imposing sentences. Police officers will not have to see the same 
criminals out on the streets only a year after their last arrest. Criminals will 
know that they cannot beat the system. Crime victims and their families will 
finally see justice done. Virginia's citizens can now trust that their 
government is working to make this Commonwealth a safe place to live, to 
work, and to raise families.</P>

<h3>Which Will Survive: The Welfare State or the Republican Revolution?</h3>
<p>
<b>By Senator John Ashcroft (R-MO)</b>
Delivered August 4, 1995 at <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>, Washington, D.C. 
<p>
	It is an honor to be speaking at The Heritage Foundation. This organization, founded on the solid principles of a limited government and an unlimited America, is rightfully America's foremost think tank.
<p>
	As we gather here today, we do so at two important milestones:  first, on the eve of one of the most significant public policy debates of the modern era; second, on the eve of the congressional mid-summer break. I would like to take a few minutes this afternoon to assess the state of the revolution more than halfway through the first session of the 104th Congress and to speak to the profound and immense challenges now facing the Republican Party as the welfare debate unfolds. 
<p>
	I am as convinced as ever that last fall's unprecedented election was about more than voter anger and frustration. I am convinced that it was a call to responsibility for an arrogant national government that, for more than a generation, has repudiated the most basic laws and principles of our democratic society -- repudiating what can be called our nation's "survival values," the foundation that is our heritage. 
<p>
	These survival values are not a narrowly defined, partisan, sectarian set of values; they are the essential elements of our common creed. They are familiar to all of us -- responsibility, opportunity, community, mobility, and family. They are uniquely American and have allowed the huddled masses to rise from the ranks of the outcast to the ranks of the affluent, opening a golden door of opportunity to any who would enter. But for 30 years, these survival values have been explicitly repudiated by Washington's willful arrogance. For all of its good intentions, Washington has replaced responsibility with rights, opportunity with entitlements, community with handouts, mobility with dependency, and family with government. 
<p>
	Washington has sent the message that fiscal irresponsibility, unrestrained spending, and never-ending deficits are acceptable for government, engendering a belief that irresponsibility is acceptable at the personal level as well. 
<p>
	Washington has said that what children know is not finally as important as how they feel, robbing generations of the foundation of basic knowledge and the nobility of service to others.
<p>
	Washington has said that the criminal is the victim and the victim the criminal, unleashing a torrent of violence against America, and especially America's poor. 
<p>
	Washington has promoted welfare programs which encourage illegitimacy, discourage work, mock marriage, and require dependence, consigning generations to hopelessness and despair.
<p>
	It was to the Republican Party that the American people turned last fall as they sought someone to help restore the survival values repudiated by the last three decades of government behavior and programs. Our party has begun that task in earnest. We have moved in the right direction by passing a balanced budget resolution which signals to the public the right message of integrity and responsibility; by passing a crime bill in the House that begins to restore justice to an unjust system which devalues human life; and by having the House pass an education reform bill that restores to states the right to demand educational achievement rather than self-indulgent feel-good programs that teach baseless self-esteem.
<p>
	As important as these accomplishments are, I believe they will be seriously compromised if we fail to fundamentally dismantle and replace the current Washington-based, one-size-fits-all, micromanaged welfare system. Our efforts and our ability to replace welfare will be viewed by the American people and by history as a measure of our commitment to restoring our survival values, a bright line in our public life between cheap talk and real action. It is easy to call for a revolution, much more difficult to achieve its promise. But that is the difference between administration and leadership. The American people want leadership.
<p>
	Across the world, our enemy for nearly 50 years no longer exists -- the result not of a conquering enemy from without, but a defeat from forces within. What communism did to the Soviet Union is not unlike what welfare threatens to do to America; it stifled her spirit, lulled her into dependence, and compromised her greatness. Our danger today is to not recognize the threat, to believe that doing anything, so long as we do something, is sufficient. If that occurs, Republicans will have failed, the welfare state will have survived, our pathologies will metastasize, and an America that today stands on the brink of chaos will tomorrow be thrown into an abyss of mayhem. 
<p>
	In 1965, a young Assistant Secretary of Labor named Daniel Patrick Moynihan wrote,
<p><blockquote>
	 From the wild Irish slums of the 19th century Eastern seaboard to the riot-torn suburbs of Los Angeles, there is one unmistakable lesson in American history:  A community that allows a large number of young men to grow up in broken families, dominated by women, never acquiring any stable relationship to male authority, never acquiring any rational expectations about the future -- that community asks for and gets chaos. In such a society crime, violence, unrest, unrestrained lashing out at the whole social structure -- these are not only to be expected, they are very nearly inevitable. 
</blockquote><p>
	Words of warning 30 years ago are now a jarring description of reality in modern America.
<p>
	Statistically, the America that concerned him then is no match for the America in which we now live. Then, the illegitimacy rate hovered around 8 percent overall -- about 4 percent for whites, 28 percent for blacks. Today, the overall illegitimacy rate approaches 30 percent -- about 23 percent for whites, nearly 70 percent for blacks. If current trends continue, and it appears that they will, every other child born in America will be illegitimate by the year 2000.
<p>
	In 1965, about 11 percent of all families with children were single-parent families. Today, that number is dangerously close to one in three American families. Of those homes, approximately 90 percent are homes without a father. According to certain projections, only 6 percent of black children and 30 percent of white children born in 1980 will live with both parents through age 18. To put it in perspective, for children born in 1950, 52 percent of black children and 81 percent of white children lived with both parents through age 18.
<p>
	The situation we now find ourselves in is one unprecedented in human history. And it is a situation best understood not in statistics, but in human faces -- in the balance sheet of human lives. During the past week, I have been going to the Senate floor every evening to talk about some of these stories. All of them come from reporting in the mainstream press. All of them are profoundly disturbing.
<p>
	For instance, there is the story of a five-month-old girl named Ariel Hill. She was born on Christmas Eve 1992 and killed in May of 1993. She lived with her 22-year-old mother and father and four other siblings in a squalid one-bedroom apartment in public housing. The family's principal source of income was welfare. One day, her mother grew tired of her screaming, placed her in a sink, and burned her with hot water. She had not been fed in days. She died weighing less than seven pounds. When investigators examined the apartment they found a scrap of paper with each child's name on it and the dollar amount that they were worth on welfare. A life reduced to the dollar amount of a welfare check. When lives are valued for the dollars that they bring in, what has become of our survival values?
<p>
	There is also the story of Ernesto Ventura. He is at least the fourth generation of a welfare family that includes about 80 welfare recipients and takes up nearly $1 million a year annually in welfare funds. The family and most of its members have given up hope of finding a way out of the welfare dependency maze. At the time of his abuse, his mother was 26, pregnant, and the mother of six children by five different fathers. She was a drug addict supported by welfare and neglecting her children. One night she grew angry at Ernesto and plunged his hands in boiling water. She waited three weeks before seeking treatment. The paramedics found him lying on a bare mattress covered with his own blood and excrement. A life trapped in a web of cultural dependence. When generations live and die in perpetual welfare, what has become of our survival values?
<P>
	Unfortunately, there are hundreds of stories like these. They are tragic and they are very difficult to talk about. But as difficult as it is, I believe that these stories are even more important than the statistics. They reveal the cold, hard realities of a cruel system that must be dismantled and replaced. The standard against which reform must be judged is not some utopian ideal, but the system that helped give us Ariel Hill and Ernesto Ventura. 
<p>
	These are the faces and stories that we must remember as Congress turns to welfare. Unbelievably, these are not the faces and stories of people victimized by a malevolent system, but the faces of people victimized and traumatized by benevolence -- by good intentions. If our current system had been designed by a foreign enemy intent on our destruction, it could not have been any worse. We need more than good intentions. Our goal must not be to feel good about ourselves in passing something; our goal must be to do good by those who are suffering daily. Our danger is not to be found in being too bold, but in being too timid in defense of our values. It is not in reaching for the ideal; it is in compromising for the conventional to the detriment of the needy. Half-measures and rhetorically powerful reform are not enough. This is a system that must be replaced.
<p>
	So when the Senate turns to welfare tomorrow, how can we tell whether it is enacting real reform?  Let me lay out a five-part test. 
<p><ul>
<li>	First, we must end welfare as an entitlement. The notion that people should receive federal welfare benefits even if they do not work, even if they abuse their children, is a failed and pernicious notion. Real reform will end welfare's entitlement status. It will free people from the shackles of governmental dependence to embrace the responsibility and opportunity that are the hallmarks of America's survival values. Anything less is a retreat.
<p>
	<li>Second, we must radically limit Washington's intermeddling, micromanaging, counterproductive control of welfare. For 30 years, our welfare system has been premised on the belief that Washington knows best. It has prescribed a one-size-fits-all system that, in reality, fits none. The bureaucracy has levied a sort of tax upon the poor, taking up money and preventing it from reaching those in need. Real reform means Washington's oversight of welfare should end. Instead, funds should be distributed directly from the Department of the Treasury to the states and monitored by an independent auditor agreed upon by both a state's governor and the Secretary of the Treasury. Anything less will ensure that those who have crafted our current welfare system will be around to "manage" whatever modifications this Congress makes. Anything less is a retreat.
<p>
	<li>Third, we must encourage a national debate on illegitimacy while simultaneously doing all we can to ensure that illegitimacy is reduced. Most of the problems surrounding welfare can be tied, in one form or another, to illegitimacy. It is at the root of the family's breakdown in the inner city; it is tied to everything from educational failure to crime; it is the lifeline of dependency. Much progress has been made in recognizing it for the evil that it is. We must encourage further debate and discussion of it. At the same time, we also need to send a clear and strong signal that reducing illegitimacy is a priority of any reform. Anything less is a retreat. 
<p>
	<li>Fourth, we must not fall into the trap of believing that laws alone will solve our welfare problems. As we all know from our experience in the drug wars, passing a law is one thing, changing habits something entirely different. In this fight, the Senate needs to enlist private and religious charitable organizations. These groups have a character entirely different from that of governmental entitlement. Theirs is the character of concern and compassion. Government's is one of sterile indifference. We need more of the former and less of the latter. Anything less is a retreat.
<p>
	<li>Last, we must realize that unanimous reform is seldom real reform. In 1988, we passed the Family Support Act. It passed by a vote of 98-1. It tried to be all things to all people. We have seen that it is detrimental to all. These are enormously difficult and divisive issues; genuine efforts at solution do not lend themselves to unanimity.
</ul><p>
	Today, senior Republicans will be introducing a bill that falls short of the tests we have discussed. We cannot fall short. We must call our nation to greatness. We must signal that ideas and principles are more powerful than Washington's politics and pragmatism. We must refuse to compromise the revolution without ever trying to retake our city on the Hill. We cannot settle for being rhetorically impressive while simultaneously being substantively lacking. Half-measures which tinker at the margins are predestined to fail. We can and we must do better. The debate in the hours to come will be interesting and it will be contentious, but it is a debate we must have. 
<p>
	Some of the tests that I lay down are controversial. Some might call them radical, others nonsensical. But if they are radical, it is only because the magnitude of suffering is unrivaled and unprecedented in American history. In these circumstances, half-measures and self-deception are a form of betrayal against the poor. 
<p>
	For 30 years, Washington has repudiated and rejected the proven values of our history. We have come to discover that these values are not traditional values; the testimony of our times reveals them to be our survival values. We stand prepared to reclaim them today, and the nation cries out for our leadership. Our resolve will be tested in the hours to come on a debate we must have. I believe we are up to the task.

<a href="/heritage/staff/truluck.htm">PHIL TRULUCK</a>, Executive Vice President of The Heritage Foundation:  
<p>
	Congressman Dan Miller of Florida is one of the stars among conservative legislators here in Washington. He is in his second term now, and he epitomizes a principled politician. It's a good way to highlight our session here today at the Physicians Council.
<p>
	The Congressman had no previous political experience before he won in 1992. He came up here as a businessman and a college professor. Now he serves on the House Appropriations Committee and the House Budget Committee, which puts him in two good positions to do something about the huge federal budget deficit and federal spending. He represents the thirteenth district of Florida, which is the southwestern part of Florida. Most important, he serves on the Speaker's task force on Medicare reform, working with his fellow Congressmen on this key issue.
<p>
	Also joining us is Grace-Marie Arnett, the President of Arnett & Co., a consulting firm here in Washington, D.C. Grace-Marie, who specializes in health care policy, is also a senior associate with the Domestic Policy Issue Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. She is also a founding member of the Consensus Group of Washington health policy experts who advance ideas on a market-based approach to health care reform. Because of her long-standing interest in tax policy, Grace-Marie Arnett was asked to serve as executive director of the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform, recently formed by Senate leader Robert Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich and chaired by Jack Kemp. The 14-member commission expects to issue its recommendation in December 1995. 
<p>
	 And finally, joining us today is John Liu, Health Policy Analyst of The Heritage Foundation. John is a native of California and before coming to Heritage in 1994 served as Legislative Counsel to Congressman Cliff Stearns (R-FL), where he helped to draft the Consumer Choice Health Security Act, the legislative embodiment of The Heritage Foundation's consumer choice health care reform proposal, sponsored by Congressman Stearns and Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma and 24 other Senate cosponsors. John holds a bachelor degree in political science from the University of California at San Diego and a Juris Doctor degree from the Tulane University School of Law in New Orleans, Louisiana.
<p>
	Congressman Miller, please give us your thoughts, and thank you again for joining us.

<b>THE URGENT NEED TO REFORM MEDICARE</b>
<p>
<a name="dan"></a><b>REPRESENTATIVE DAN MILLER:</b>  Thank you for having me here. My district in Florida has more seniors than any district in the United States:  Sarasota, Sun City, Port Charlotte, Venice. It's a great area to represent.
<P>
	Medicare is really the biggest issue we face this year. It is the biggest issue because of the enormous fiscal pressures if we don't address it. There is one overriding fact:  Medicare is going bankrupt. We have no choice. For health care reasons, it has to be addressed. From a political standpoint, they say this is the third rail of politics:  It will kill you politically. It is a very difficult issue, but we have to do it. Let me share with you some of my thoughts and some of my observations on what we can expect in this process over the next several months.
<p>
	Our House leadership -- Speaker Newt Gingrich and Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas, in particular -- are very aware of the need politically to convince the American people of the critical importance of this issue. The focus right now is to make the American people aware that we have a big problem. As I said, Medicare is going bankrupt. We know that. Everybody here, I think, already knows of the Medicare trustees' report authored by HHS Secretary Shalala, Labor Secretary Reich, and Treasury Secretary Rubin. The trustees tell us that there is no question:  Medicare is going bankrupt in the year 2002. We need to make the American people aware of that massive shortfall and of its implications.
<p>

<b>THE CLIMATE OF OPINION</b>
<p>
	We are making progress. We just got some polling information on this topic, and it is interesting. Two months ago we did a poll, and nobody knew Medicare was a problem. But the polls that were just released yesterday by Linda DiVall say that there is a big change. Before, nobody would believe there was a problem with Medicare. Now when you ask them if there is a problem, 63 percent of the American people believe there is. In fact, 34 percent of the American people now realize there is a problem without the pollster even mentioning it to them. So we have made, I think, tremendous strides in raising the awareness of the American people. You cannot go to the solution until there is an awareness of the problem.
<p>
	We are also making progress in explaining what we are trying to do. We are not cutting Medicare spending. Whenever you hear Speaker Gingrich talking, that it's going bankrupt, he notes that we are going to spend more money on Medicare. What we are doing is reducing the growth of spending on Medicare.
<p>
	We are starting to get that message out, too. Two weeks ago, Tom Brokaw and NBC News came to my district, where we held a town hall meeting. When Brokaw introduced this segment on the national news, he said, "Republicans want to reduce the growth in spending."  The following week, ABC News did something on the same topic, and Peter Jennings introduced a segment about different Members of Congress and about how they are handling Medicare. Jennings introduced it by saying, "Republicans want to reduce the growth in spending on Medicare."  Sunday night, I was watching the NBC News and they even showed a segment with President Clinton, who said, during his talk with Speaker Gingrich, that Republicans want to reduce the growth of spending on Medicare.
<p>
	So we are making great progress. Now we are starting to say, "We're not cutting Medicare; we're slowing the growth of spending."  These are the numbers:  We are going from $4,800 a person to $6,400 a person (see Chart 1). That is not as much as future spending projections would be if we did nothing. Medicare is going bankrupt, but it is a very important program, and we must preserve it; we must save it; we must strengthen it. In doing so, we will still be spending $1,600 more per Medicare beneficiary.
<p>
	Our next task is to explain to everybody why Medicare is going bankrupt. Much of the problem is in the design. Medicare today is designed to increase spending on health care rather than control it. Members of Congress have always tried to ratchet down on the providers; go back and look at projected savings in past budget reconciliation bills. In drafting those bills, Members of Congress said, "We're going to save $50 billion," but they ended up saving very little. The desired savings never did materialize. 
<p>
	 Next year, in 1996, the amount of money going into the Medicare trust fund, which is Part A, is going to be less than the money that is going out, for the first time. The Medicare Part A trust fund is paid for, through payroll taxes, by employers and employees. Next year is the first time they will have had a negative figure for the year (see Chart 2). The Medicare trust fund right now has about $130 billion in surplus; in the year 2002, it crosses the line to zero. So it is very easy to see what happens to the fund. It is not just hypothetical; these are real numbers (see Chart 3).
<p>

<b>TAXES AND PREMIUMS</b>
<p>
	There are ways to strengthen Medicare, but what if we don't?  If we do nothing about reforming Medicare, the most likely choices are to raise taxes on working families or to increase premiums dramatically for seniors. There is no escape. You would have to raise the payroll tax over $1,700 for somebody who makes $40,000 a year or raise the Medicare premiums on senior citizens by 300 percent -- and neither of those options, in my view, can be sold to the American people. You cannot raise premiums on senior citizens by 300 percent, and you just cannot raise payroll taxes by 100 percent. We have to come up with a new solution.
<p>

<b>PRIVATE SECTOR EXPERIENCE</b>
<p>
	 Look at the experience of the private sector. Costs in Medicare are now going up 10.5 percent; the private sector's costs are going up 4.4 percent (see Chart 4). CEOs of large corporations have been telling us about the areas where health care costs are having a negative growth rate. At a House Budget Committee meeting, we had a presentation by IBM, Texas Instruments, and Eastman Kodak. They are all having a negative growth in their cost of health care, while we are having double digit increases in Medicare. So there is a lot to learn from the private sector. We can do a lot better in Medicare than we are doing today.
<P>
	Some, both in and out of Congress, are not only afraid of this issue, but also think that we can just put it off. They are wrong. We have to address the problem expeditiously. The reason:  Medicare's financial crisis is severe today and will only worsen tomorrow as the American population gets older (see Chart 5).

<p>
<b>TECHNICAL ISSUES</b>
<p>
	One of the technical issues that we have is scoring savings for private sector-style market efficiencies. Everybody here in Washington knows what budget scoring is. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates the cost of a policy; depending on how the policy is designed, it can be scored by CBO for savings. The question is, what is or is not a scorable saving?  President Clinton had the same problem two years ago with his health care reform bill. 
<p>
	 There are other cases -- for example, medical malpractice. We all agree that malpractice reform will save money, but the Congressional Budget Office says, "We don't know how much it would save, so you don't get any credit for passing malpractice reform."  The same issue arises with managed care:  HMOs do not necessarily save money. As we know, the Mathematica study came out and said you may even end up losing money on managed care. But should we simply let the CBO scoring drive our policy?  That is an issue we have discussed, and it makes it difficult.
<p>

<b>MEDICAL SAVINGS ACCOUNTS</b>
<p>
	I like the medical savings account option (MSA) in a reformed Medicare system. It is probably going to be one of the options available. The problem, critics say, with medical savings accounts is adverse selection; that is, the healthier people will want medical savings accounts and will desert conventional insurance. What this means is that in designing a medical savings account, we have to make sure that adverse selection is minimized.
<P>
	Remember that some critics say the very same thing about HMOs. The fear is that younger and healthier people will enroll in HMOs and desert traditional insurance, again causing a severe adverse selection problem. But, again, it depends on how you design the system. This problem is not overwhelming the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), where we have a series of consumer choices. I can go to HMOs, PPOs, or fee-for-service. Our idea is to give people choices like that. I think that the MSA may also be one of our options; we are moving in that direction.
<p>

<b>KEEPING TRADITIONAL MEDICARE</b>
<p>
	Should we treat new enrollees differently than older enrollees?  I think, when you take 85-year-olds, it is much harder to change their health care behavior patterns than it is for 65-year-olds. We have said that we're going to maintain the traditional Medicare program. Some people are afraid of HMOs. New people entering the Medicare system should be treated differently than those over a certain age. Their life experiences are different. This is another practical item to be resolved.

<p>
<b>PRESCRIPTION DRUGS</b>
<p>
	Getting away from all the technical issues, I think it is very important to make it possible for elderly people to buy prescription drugs either by choosing an HMO or another managed care provider or through some other innovative option, including a new fee-for-service option.
<p>
	Again and again, we see that the most important single concern among senior citizens is the cost and availability of prescriptions. Their second concern, after prescriptions, is long-term care. When we talk about a general strategy in health care policy, we should be sensitive to this issue of long-term care and provide greater incentives for people buying long-term care. It is part of our larger health care reform strategy.
<p>
	
<b>SOLID INFORMATION</b>
<p>

	Finally, we should encourage states or private contractors, not the HMOs, to bring solid information to seniors. This addresses a lingering insecurity that seniors feel about making choices.
<p>
	One of our House Budget Committee proposals was to provide that kind of information. As a federal employee or retiree, you can go to a bookstore today and buy a book that explains all the different options we now have. That is perhaps still a little complicated. Federal workers and retirees like their system, but I think we can do it in a better, more simplified way. Under Medicare today, there are some choices, under Medigap, of supplemental insurance. If you want a Volkswagen or if you want a Rolls Royce, it's your choice. You pay for what you get. So choice is not utterly foreign to senior citizens. 
<p>
	 None of this is going to be easy. There are a whole series of challenges. Medicare is a very complex system. You have Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B and supplemental insurance, as well as a host of big private contractors and supervisory roles played by the Health Care Financing Administration, issuing thousands of pages of guidelines. It is a paperwork monster, but it was designed in 1965.
<p>
	It is time to get Medicare ready for the 21st century. It has to be addressed by the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Commerce Committee. It has to go to the House and Senate floors. We want it to be resolved by the time we pass the federal budget. We have made a commitment:  We will come up with a way to reduce the growth in spending to save Medicare and balance the federal budget. It is not only a promise; it is our duty.
<p>

<b>THE CHANGING POLITICAL DEBATE</b>

<p>
<a name="grace"></a><b>GRACE-MARIE ARNETT</b>:  It is a pleasure to be here with you at the Heritage Foundation's Physicians Council meeting.
<p>
	It was a pleasure to join you in hearing the presentation last night by Senator Bill Frist, a heart transplant surgeon and colleague of yours, who has demonstrated the power of one person's commitment to change. As all of you know, Dr. Frist decided to run for the United States Senate last year and won a huge upset victory in November. 
<p>
	 You also make tremendous contributions to your profession, both by your work, day in and day out, treating patients and by your added involvement in the policy process through the Physicians Council. By being part of this organization and by getting the word out about the central importance of the physician-patient relationship, you make a crucial contribution to health policy.
<p>
	I want to make a few preliminary comments as a transition into my remarks about the politics of health care reform. Dr. David Brown, Chairman of the Heritage Physicians Council, mentioned my work with the Consensus Group.1  We have done a great deal of work on market-oriented health care reform, advancing ideas that will help to restore the physician-patient relationship. But making any changes in the health care system is like turning a great battleship. It is so huge, it can only be done by degrees. If you try to spin a battleship too quickly you put the ship at great risk. You must instead set a clear course and begin to make those first few-degree turns carefully.
<p>
	The current employment-based system offers security to tens of millions of people. But it also has serious flaws -- leaving tens of millions of people without coverage and driving up the costs of health insurance and medical services. Yet it must not be changed too quickly, as we learned too well during the health care reform debate.
<p>
	Many of the changes advocated by earlier speakers, including <a href="/heritage/staff/moffit.htm">Bob Moffit</a> of The Heritage Foundation and Kevin Vigilante of Brown University, are important steps in moving the system in the right direction -- changes like giving individual Americans vouchers and tax credits for the purchase of health insurance. These changes would begin to give individual Americans more control over their health care spending choices as a transition to a more individually based health insurance system. Certainly, many employers will continue to offer health insurance as part of their employee compensation packages. If a person's employment-based plan offers the best option, they could choose that plan. But if their labor union, their professional association, or their school district offers them a better deal, they could choose that, instead. Personal choice is key.
<p>
	Now, I would like to talk about the politics not only of general health care reform, but also of Medicare. And I want to share with you what I believe is driving the debate. But before I do, my basic conviction, and my absolute, solid sense of the medical profession, is that you will prevail. The Bible's <i>Book of Sirach</i> (also known as <i>Ecclesiasticus</i>), Chapter 38, says:  "Hold the physician in honor, for he is essential to you, and God it was who established his profession."  I believe this Biblical passage shows that ultimately the independence and integrity of the medical profession will be preserved. 
<p>
	 The medical profession, as Dr. Brown said, cannot function without physicians. Nurses, physicians' assistants, and other medical professionals may gain more authority to do specific procedures. And that can be good in terms of economic efficiency. But medical care must be coordinated with the physician's supervision.
<p>
	These last few years have been traumatic for your profession. You have been "rolled" politically. But this can't last. The medical profession cannot move forward without physicians. But every single physician must ask himself or herself where he or she can make the most difference. And being part of this organization is a very, very good start.
<p>

<b>THE BATTLE OVER MEDICARE </b>
<p>
	Let us look at the terrain and the environment of this round of the battle over health care reform. If the rhetoric over Medicare spending were to be stripped away, it is clear that the health care issue is once again being used as a battleground for a major political clash over money and power. The debate over funding health care for the elderly is a debate over control of billions of tax dollars. It also represents a pivotal battle over the direction of federal programs. 
<p>
	 Medicare is in serious trouble. The Medicare trustees, including the Clinton Administration's Treasury and Health and Human Services secretaries, have warned that the program will go bankrupt in seven years unless major changes are made. Either taxes will have to be raised further or the program must be restructured. Raising taxes is the old way of doing business in Washington; updating the program to inject more market efficiency is the new way. It is a clear choice. 
<p>
	 Liberals have tried to entwine Medicare with the balanced budget agreement and tax cuts, but Medicare is a separate program with separate problems that must be addressed directly.
<p>
	In this latest incarnation of the health care reform debate, the voters are as alienated as they were last time, confused by the tactics and distortions. During the last phase of the health care debate over the Clinton bill in 1993 and 1994, the public was turned off by talk of health alliances, vast new bureaucracies, and fines, penalties, and jail terms to enforce the plan. None of this connected with them -- well, it connected with them; it scared them. But they didn't believe that the changes were going to help them in any meaningful way. And they were right.
<p>
	This time, the debates on health care have little to do with the health care system again, and everything to do with money and power. In 1993 and 1994, health care reform was to have been the vehicle for Congress and the executive branch to gain a lock on political power by providing health care that's always there for the middle class. The middle class didn't bite; in fact, they bit back.
<p>

<b>SOLID INFORMATION IS KEY </b>
<p>
	The American people had every reason to be afraid of the Clinton Administration's Health Security Act. I don't think anybody did more to give the American people the details of what was in that bill than The Heritage Foundation, particularly Bob Moffit. There were probably, at one point, maybe seven people in this city that had read the whole 1,342 pages, and Bob was one of them. 	
<p>
	 Bob Moffit did a line-by-line analysis, not only of what was in the bill, but what its implications were for the health care system. And he completed his analysis in just a few weeks. The background paper began circulating in policy circles, and people who were not going take the time to read the bill read Bob Moffit's analysis.2  It was a very important contribution to the debate.<p>	Soon after the bill was released, several of us who had read the bill, including Bob, gathered around a table and began exchanging revelations:  "My goodness, did you see what was on page 342?"  one said. "Oh, no, but did you see page 946?"  another answered. We were all aghast at the sweep and intrusiveness of this piece of legislation.
<P>
	The more the American people learned about the details of the bill, the more scared they got. And they learned about it because of that bedrock work by the health policy community.
<p>
	During the debate, the things that were most politically charged came percolating to the surface:  employer mandates, alliances, regulations, fines, penalties, jail terms. Then people started to say, "Wait a minute. This is un-American."  This change in popular opinion begins with the kind of detailed analysis that think tanks like The Heritage Foundation do.
<p>
	The American people got so frightened by what they saw that they said, "We don't want anything to do with that bill, and we don't want anything to do with anybody that cooked up that bill."  So they threw many of the liberals in Congress who supported the bill out of office. 
<p>
	 Fear is a very effective political motivator, and now fear is being used to unnecessarily scare seniors in the Medicare debate. To quote House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas, "The Democratic Party once stood firm on the conviction that Americans have nothing to fear but fear itself. Now the liberals stand firm on the conviction that they have nothing to offer but fear itself." 
<p>
	 There have been some very telling quotes in the health care reform debate. Consider the insights of Judith Feder, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Health Policy at the Department of Health and Human Services. In defending the Clinton plan, Judith Feder said, in a quote on the front page of <i>The New York Times</i> on December 5, 1993, "What we're trying to do is replace the ineffective, inefficient bureaucracy of the unfettered marketplace."
<p>
	At a conference in Chicago a couple of weeks ago, Ms. Feder said, "We're going to do to them what they did to us."  So flags are up. Liberals in Congress are now clearly trying to convince Americans that conservatives are gutting Medicare to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy. This is wrong.
<P>

<b>INTERESTS ARE SPECIAL </b>
<p>
	Many special interests are lining up to keep Medicare spending at its current unsustainable level. Medicare spending cannot continue to rise at 10 percent a year without bankrupting the program. The Medicare trustees themselves have acknowledged this. President Clinton has acknowledged this. But for every dollar the federal government spends, there are at least two constituencies:  the person who gets the services that are provided and the person who gets the money who provided those services. Every dollar that is saved by making the program more efficient is a dollar that will not be spent. There are a number of groups with a short-term view that want to keep spending federal tax dollars at the current rate, despite the consequences for the long-term solvency of the Medicare program and the future benefits of seniors and seniors-to-be.
<P>
	And they could win. Medicare is highly subject to political pressure. It illustrates the key reason why government involvement in the health sector is a bad thing:  Decisions are based upon politics, not economics, innovation, or efficiency. Short-term political expediency often prevails over long-term solvency.
<p>
	So now we have the special interests who, last time, lined up to fight government-run health care at all costs this time lining up to save government-run health care -- in the form of Medicare -- at all costs. Washington politics is nothing if not paradoxical. These special-interest groups are a grass-roots army, and they are arming to fight as Congress tries to restructure and save Medicare.
<p>
	Anybody who looks at Medicare's numbers knows that something has to change. Unless Congress is successful in getting to the root of the issue and rethinking the way the program is structured, Medicare's future will continue to be in jeopardy.

<p>
<b>POLITICS AND TAXES</b>
<p>
	Let's turn now, for a moment, to the debate over tax cuts. In 1980, Ronald Reagan swept into the White House and brought a Republican Senate with him on the promise to revive the American economy with across-the-board cuts in income-tax rates. And the largest peacetime expansion in this nation's history ensued. There are a lot of debates about why that happened. There is almost no debate that an extra dollar in the pocket of an American citizen is a better way for that money to be spent than an extra dollar spent by the federal government.
<p>
	President Reagan did what he said he was elected to do:  cut taxes. In 1990, President Bush said, "Read my lips:  No new taxes."  And then he broke his pledge. Pollsters who look for underlying trends say that President Bush's soaring popularity after the Gulf War was really only superficial; underneath, the popular anger at him for breaking his pledge over tax cuts never really went away, and he was defeated in 1992.
<p>
	In 1992, President Clinton ran on a promise:  middle-class tax cuts. Not only has he not delivered on a tax cut, but he won, by one vote, the largest tax increase in history in 1993. And he was proposing yet another tax increase through his health care bill. Look what happened in 1994:  The voters threw out dozens of legislators who supported these policies.
<p>
	Get the message?  If conservatives haven't learned the lesson that voters mean business when they talk about tax cuts, the liberals certainly have. They've learned that if they can stop conservatives from cutting taxes, they have a shot at regaining power.
<p>
	Liberals know they can't win the debate, an open debate, over raising taxes. They know they can't win an open debate over whether or not we should have a balanced budget. Medicare is the liberals' logical battleground, because it obscures what we're really talking about and there is a tremendous, electrifying charge of politics and seniors being frightened about losing their benefits.
<p>
	In 1996, liberals may not have a better idea about what they want to do if they're elected. But they certainly will try to use the politics of Medicare to stop conservatives from fulfilling their promises.
<p>
	Medicare is the battleground. It affects all of you on a very immediate basis, because it affects your ability to get fairly compensated for the services that you provide. That's not what this debate is about. In a more efficient market, you will get fairly compensated and likely will be unshackled from the huge burden of paperwork that Medicare demands. 
<p>
	 Nor is this debate about seniors getting less health care. The market could easily take care of giving seniors a benefit that's worth $4,800 today and $6,400 in seven years and give them the same, if not better, health care more efficiently. But Members of Congress may not have a chance to do that if conservatives get thrown out because the Medicare debate blows up in their face.
<p>
	I urge you to continue to participate in the debate, to continue to stay informed about the real issues that are being decided, and to help in the effort to put both the Medicare program and the whole federal budget on a more sound footing. 
<p>

<b>INFLUENCING THE POLICY PROCESS</b>
<p>

<a name="john"></a><b>JOHN C. LIU</b>:  I'd like to follow up on Senator Bill Frist's comments last night, supplementing what Grace-Marie just said on the politics of health care reform. Congress is the key actor, and we should be clear about what we expect in this Congress, short-term and long-term. As physicians and members of the Heritage Physicians Council, you can be instrumental in playing a key role in the policy debate.
<p>
	Bob Moffit and I attended town hall meetings across the country last year at which different Senators and Congressmen supported our position on where this health care reform should go:  consumer choice and competition.
<p>
	Congress unfortunately does not have the stomach to tackle comprehensive health care reform. This is partly because last year's debate was so grueling, the bills so detailed, and the legislative analysis so time-consuming that Members of Congress, with so much else on their agenda, fashioning budget and tax policy in particular, simply don't have the time in the remainder of this session to deal with the intricacies and complexities of comprehensive health care reform.
<p>
	But the problems remain. You still have a growing uninsured population in this country, mostly middle-class and lower-middle-class and low-income individuals working hard and struggling to put food on the table. At the same time, too many Americans have no practical access to health insurance, because current federal policy, through the tax code, has penalized them, making it significantly less affordable. If their employer, maybe a small business, cannot afford to give them health insurance, even a very scaled-down policy, they are in serious trouble.
<p>
	This same population that is uninsured is currently providing a subsidy to a growing population that is already getting health insurance. Through the tax code, through the HI payroll tax, they are subsidizing, and helping subsidize, the health care of our growing Medicare population, those 65 and over. And that tax burden is getting heavier. That is another reason why we must have Medicare reform this year. The Speaker of the House, the Senators on the Finance Committee, and others have wisely decided to tackle this issue of Medicare reform this year.
<p>
	It will be tough, but it must be done. As the Medicare trustees have stated, if nothing is done now, this system is not going to be around by the year 2002. That's only seven years away.
<p>
	Senator Frist told you last night to go back home and talk to your physician colleagues. As physicians, your views and opinions on health care issues are respected. Friends of mine who are doctors, and in their training and their residencies, are very impressed when they hear a sound idea from a colleague. When doctors hear a politician tell them something, a red flag goes up. But when a colleague offers an educated opinion or shares insights into what's going on, they tend to pay more attention. After all, you are the professionals providing health care to the American people.
<p>
	Visit your Congressman or state legislator back in the districts. It's perhaps more inconvenient to come to Washington, D.C., and meet your Senator or Congressman, but go back home. Call the scheduling office back in the district. Find out when your Congressman will be home in the district office, and be sure to schedule an appointment. Even fifteen minutes of their time, as Senator Frist mentioned, is valuable. You do not need to travel to Washington, D.C.
<p>
	Talk to your specialty organizations. As a colleague of mine last year said, unfortunately, organized medicine seemed "brain dead" when it came to health care reform. Even some of your specialty groups, unfortunately, have had only one obsession:  wanting to be a player at the table. That is not necessary. Groups in Washington, D.C., as you learned during last year's health care debate, do not always represent your philosophy. They often hire former staffers from the Hill who articulate official Washington's point of view. Because Congress has been dominated by liberals for the past forty years, far too many professional organizations have hired top liberal staffers from Capitol Hill to run their Washington offices, allegedly representing your interests back home. As you know, however, that is often not the case.
<p>
	There is no magic solution to influencing public policy. Write to professional organizations' newsletters and make your opinions known; write to your colleagues; go back and visit your alma mater if you can. Try the front door. Several of my friends have visited their med schools back in California and New York and have had maybe an hour's worth of time with their former dean. An even better idea:  You should spend perhaps an hour or so lecturing future med students on the direction of health care policy and its impact on medical practice. 
<p>
	 This Congress, in its first four months, already has achieved more in health care policy than the last Congress achieved in two years. A positive provision passed through the House under the Contract with America is that the self-employed now have access to a 25 percent tax deduction for their health insurance. And that has already been signed into law. Federal savings accounts are going to be introduced this afternoon. Congressman Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, will be introducing an MSA bill.
<p>
	Congressman Bill Thomas of California, the Health Subcommittee chairman, has introduced an insurance bill which takes care of pre-existing conditions and allows individuals who change jobs, and who have been insured, to retain that coverage and not be penalized if they wish to switch insurers. Portability is still a major goal of health care reform, and work along this line is underway in the Senate.
<p>
	Again, this is in the first four months of the new Congress. Incremental changes are likely:  not as broad or sweeping as the government-run Clinton plan or as the free-market Heritage Foundation plan, but we will see advances in the right direction. Unfortunately, a lot of these measures are being advanced simply in the context of the present flawed system:  a tax policy which penalizes individuals for choosing their provider or their health plan outside of the employer's health plan.
<p>
	So there's a lot more to be done.
<p>
	Medicare, as Grace-Marie Arnett mentioned, will be the battleground for this Congress. I was at a conference not too long ago with Congressman Pete Stark, the former chairman of the Health Subcommittee of Ways and Means, a prominent liberal from my home state of California who proudly says that, as the chairman of the House Health Subcommittee, he was privileged to serve as "the CEO," along with eleven members, the "board of directors," of the Medicare program. This is a health insurance company, he said, that provides health care to 38 million Americans.
<p>
	That's a neat way of putting it. But apparently the shareholders didn't like their CEO and board of directors, voted them out, and installed a new CEO and board of directors for Medicare. This new board, I'm pleased to report, has embraced the idea that a free market is the best mechanism for controlling costs when it is allowed to work, and it should work for America's senior citizens.
<p>
	Congressman Dan Miller has been working on a draft proposal to present to the House of Representatives. He and several other members of the House Commerce Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee, which have jurisdiction over Medicare reform, will be working on this proposal.
<p>
	Medicare is in deep financial trouble. But Pete Stark and Congressman Sam Gibbons of Florida, responding to the Trustees' Report, a very nonpartisan report which comes out every year, say, in effect, "It's nothing to get hysterical about. We've been reading these predictions for the past several years, and they're always talking about insolvency. It's nothing to get hysterical about."
<p>
	And I would agree. Let's not get hysterical about it. But let's get concerned about it, because this 30-year-old system was designed to insure the health of those who were elderly and truly needy. While it would be bad form to get hysterical, it is high time to get serious.
<p>
	Medicare can't control costs, except through price controls and shifting costs to the private sector. We've seen the federal government slowly take tighter control of doctors and hospitals and implement more reams of rules and regulations. I don't need to go into the RBRVs, the DRGs, or the PPS. You know better than I do about the impact of these complex systems of fee schedules and price controls. They don't work.3  But unless something is done now, we should be very concerned, not just for our future, but for our parents' future, because this is a system that is designed to insure that we get quality health care in our golden years. And, as a nation, we are getting older.<p>	Liberal special-interest groups have been very vocal already, talking about Draconian cuts. And they know how to play the game. They've placed ads in the <i>Washington Post</i> and <i>New York Times</i> about what this Congress is going to do, or might do. We are being asked to write our Congressmen to make sure that Grandmother isn't going to get cut off from health care.
<p>
	While that is a good short-term scare tactic, the awful negative numbers in Medicare will force a public reckoning. Working Americans could be faced with huge taxes, including additional payroll taxes of 3.5 percent or even 3.9 percent.4  In my opinion, when the American people come to realize this, liberals in Congress will have lost credibility on this whole issue.
<p>
	Think back to the Medicare catastrophic debate in 1988. Liberals lost credibility. They lobbied to add benefit after benefit after benefit to what was, back then, a very lean Medicare catastrophic package. If it had passed as Bob Moffit's colleagues in the Reagan Administration had designed it, it would have been affordable. And it would have been workable.
<p>
	Unfortunately, special interests and liberals in Congress saw it as a great opportunity to lump on more benefits. And Congress back then was not well-known for saying "No."  So they added benefit after benefit, the cost soared, and the bill collapsed, to be repealed only a year later.5<P>	Nevertheless, as far as politics is concerned, Medicare reform is going to be tough. The media like to call any reform proposals Draconian cuts, for example. Heritage has put forward a major Medicare reform proposal that we just finished within the past twenty-four hours. We have drafted a defined contribution proposal that a lot of members on Capitol Hill have shown an interest in advancing.
<p>

<b>A MODEL FOR REFORM</b> 
<P>
	Basically, the Heritage Foundation proposal will allow seniors to apply a defined government contribution towards the health care plan of their choice, just as congressional and federal retirees do today in the popular Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). They can stay in current Medicare, if that's what they want to do. This is a good political measure. Obviously, no Member of Congress wants to go home and say, "I'm taking away your Medicare."  A lot of folks have grown accustomed to it, and anyway, we don't want to take it away.
<p>
	But for Americans about to retire, or those who perhaps are not happy with the current Medicare system, we are now offering choices. Heritage has prepared a paper detailing the specifics of this Medicare proposal.6  We hope that this concept will go far in defining the debate. From our conversations with the Speaker's office, the Majority Leader's office, and other members of the committees of jurisdiction, this basic concept of using the FEHBP as a model for Medicare reform is being very well received.
<p>
	Indeed, one of the Medicare proposals of the House Budget Committee, unveiled at a conference not too long ago in Virginia, was inspired by the Heritage Foundation model. Another one is a variation of this, offered by Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire. It's still a consumer choice proposal, but he has a stronger emphasis on managed care.
<p>
	Of special interest to physicians is that the American Medical Association has gone on record as supporting a Medicare voucher. Heritage has been working with the AMA, outlining common ground between their voucher proposal and our Medicare reform proposal.
<p>
	This is a national debate that we can win. This Congress has promised the American people it would hold back spending, cut back government, and give more choices and freedom to individuals. The average American is not stupid. He can make his own decisions. If active and retired Congressmen and Senators can choose their own health plan from among a variety of options, why can't their constituents?  If it's good enough for Ted Kennedy, if it's good enough for Al Gore, then it's good enough for the rest of us.

<p>
<b>ROBERT MOFFIT:</b>  On Capitol Hill and around the country, Americans are pondering the basis for renewing the debate on the American health care system. What is our starting point?  Of course, with you, the members of the medical profession, the central issue is the doctor-patient relationship. Ideally, that relationship and its preservation should be the touchstone of reform. But not all agree. Some corporate experts feel that we ought simply to build reform on the basis of the current health insurance system -- the employee-based, tax-supported insurance arrangements that have been with us since World War II.
<p>
But underlying the current insurance system are major market distortions. This is a fundamental fact of our economic life. It is the environment in which you, as physicians, currently operate. These market distortions serve to drive up health care costs while accelerating the rate of uninsurance among the working population.
<p>
What this means, ladies and gentlemen, is that if you insist on building upon the current insurance system, inescapably this means that you must close it up even more, to adjust for these distortions, and increase the already heavy role of bureaucracy and the regulatory regime that governs it. It also means reducing doctors and hospitals to the status of even more highly regulated public utilities. I think this is logically inescapable if the basis for new reform is simply the current employer-based insurance system.
<p>
<b>Managed Competition.</b> With last year's collapse of the Clinton plan, several states are experimenting with the latest versions of "managed competition," establishing the managed care networks inspired by the theoreticians of the Jackson Hole Group.1<p>Let us consider the current trends in private, employer-based insurance. Right now, in too many boardrooms of corporate America, our colleagues in the business community are celebrating what they believe to be a triumph of the free market. We are witnessing a mass movement of employees into managed care networks. Now, the rate of acceleration is nothing short of breathtaking. In 1992, no more than 15 percent of all Americans were enrolled in health maintenance organizations. Today, 63 percent of all workers are enrolled in health maintenance organizations, PPOs, or other managed care plans.
<p>
While, in fact, many representatives of corporate America see this as a triumph of the market, it is nothing of the sort -- at least in the normal meaning of the market. Could you imagine a free market where there is no normal collision of the forces of supply and demand, even on the most basic level, which is the consumer purchase or sale of a commodity?  Could you imagine a free market where the customer of goods and services is an entirely different personality from the consumer of those goods and services?  Or could you imagine a free market where, for all practical purposes, the consumer of a good or a service has no property right in the commodity -- in this case insurance -- that is bought and sold?  Of course, you could not answer "yes" to any of these questions.
<p>
So it is really quite absurd to say that we are witnessing a triumph of the market when the consumer of the commodity -- in this instance, health insurance -- cannot personally buy it, when the consumer can have no property right in the commodity once it's purchased, and when the consumer cannot realize any personal savings in a free exchange by weighing the value of the commodity and the price to be paid for it.
<p>
The current mass movement to managed care, whether that form of care is a good idea or a bad idea, is not a triumph of the market. It is, however, the latest evolution of the current insurance system, which is a fundamentally distorted third-party payment system built upon a legally exclusive, tax-supported, employer-based model that frustrates consumer choice and competition.
<p>
<b>Consumer Demand and Consumer Choice.</b> In many instances, there is no consumer demand because, in fact, consumers are not even consulted by insurance companies about whether they would like to buy the product. Rather, corporate managers are deciding, for solid financial reasons relating to the company's bottom line, that they can no longer afford traditional indemnity insurance and are enrolling their workers in managed care plans. This is a transaction where the employer, not the employee, makes the key decisions and, at the same time, where the employer, not the employee, realizes the savings.
<p>
If the managed care plan is less expensive than the conventional corporate insurance plan, this amounts to a reduction in the worker's compensation. Too many Americans do not yet clearly understand this. The reason:  Too many Americans think, wrongly, that the employer's contribution to their company's health benefits package is the employer's money and not the employee's money. I personally know of no instance where corporate benefits managers are giving workers cash back in an amount equal to the difference, say, between the higher cost of last year's indemnity plan and the lower cost of next year's new managed care plan. Whatever the impact of the managed care revolution on the quality and delivery of health care services, this is very often an employer, not an employee, decision. This should be the subject of extensive congressional debate. Unfortunately, it is not; at least, not yet.
<p>
The new managed care revolution brings with it two related problems. One is economic. The other, more important problem is political.
<p>
In the transition from fee for service to managed care plans, there is likely to be -- and the preliminary studies bear this out -- a transitional savings to employers. The existing professional literature indicates that this is the case. The economic problem is that there is no guarantee that managed care, whether in the form of a staff model HMO or other managed care options, will contain long-term health care costs. According to a 1993 GAO report on the subject:  "Although many employers believe that, in principle, managed care plans save money, little empirical evidence exists on the cost of savings and managed care."
<p>
But that is not the most important problem. The more serious problem is political; and it is a political problem at the direct expense of managed care. Lest I be misunderstood, I am not an opponent of managed care. I am only saying that individuals should be personally free to choose or reject it, and that government policy on the issue should be strictly neutral. Managed care, in fact, is not being given a fair shot in the free market because there is no free market. This is bad for managed care. When employees are forced into managed care plans without other options, or against their will, they not only have been deprived of a choice of their health plan, but they also are deprived of their choice, in many instances, of a doctor or a medical specialist.
<p>
In other words, Americans will have even less choice over their health care decisions than they have today. If popular dissatisfaction with employer-based insurance grows -- as it surely will, especially with the higher number of uninsured and an expected rise in health care costs, which we may see again, perhaps at the end of this business cycle -- this popular dissatisfaction can threaten the entire private health care system.
<p>
Advocates of a Canadian-style system have had a rather difficult time selling the notion that monopoly is really good for you, or that government monopoly is even better. Or, as my colleague, <a href="/heritage/staff/butler.htm">Dr. Stuart Butler</a>, Heritage Foundation Vice President, suggests, try to imagine that your health care future is going to be bright and cheery when it is run by those thousands of eager public servants ready to answer your every call or help you with any question over the phone down at the local government clinic.
<p>
But advocates of the Canadian-style system can make an excellent case in saying, "You may not like the Clinton plan or its various congressional incarnations, and you may not like government-run health care, but at least, under a Canadian-style system, you will retain your right to a physician."
<p>
<b>The End of Private Practice?</b> That is, for most Americans, a powerful argument. It's a clincher. It can also mean the end of private health insurance, and I submit to you that if it's the end of private health insurance, it is really the end of private medical practice. Private practice cannot survive outside of private markets.
<p>
This morning, we have two physicians who are going to talk about this vital issue:  the doctor-patient relationship.
<p>
Kevin Vigilante, M.D., comes to us from the Miriam Hospital at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. He is the clinical partner in the Miriam Immunology Center. Kevin cares for women with HIV and started a community outreach clinic to provide health care to women coming out of prison. He has been the principal investigator in an NIH study to determine the effects of early treatment of HIV infection with AZT. He has also been the principal investigator on the Ryan White grant to provide HIV prevention and care. He has been the Director of Emergency Medical Services and Clinical Assistant Professor of Medicine at Brown University. He has been the Director of Primary Care and Instructor of Medicine at Yale University.
<p>
Dr. Vigilante is a graduate of the Harvard School of Public Health and Yale University's Internal Medicine Department. His M.D. is from Cornell University. He got his master's degree in bacteriology from Wagner College, and he got his bachelor's degree at Johns Hopkins University in philosophy and political science. This past year, Dr. Vigilante ran for the U.S. House of Representatives against Congressman Patrick Kennedy, garnering 46 percent of the vote.
<p>
Sandra Mahkorn, M.D., serves as Chief Medical Officer of FHC Managed Care Health Services in Norfolk, Virginia. Before assuming that position, she was a Clinical Assistant Professor and Satellite Clinic Medical Director for the University of Wisconsin in the Wisconsin Medical School.
<p>
In the Bush Administration, she served in two capacities:  first, as the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public Health Policy of the Department of Health and Human Services between 1991 and 1992, and second, during the last several months of the Bush Administration, with Vice President Dan Quayle on the White House staff. She was an Associate Director for the President's Council on Competitiveness.
<p>
Before her White House appointment, Dr. Mahkorn was the lead physician at the Oxnor Clinic in New Orleans, Louisiana. She is a member of several medical associations and holds a master's degree from the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee in educational psychology and urban affairs and a master of public health degree from the Tulane School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine. She received her M.D. from the University of Wisconsin at Madison.
<p>
I turn you over to Dr. Vigilante.
<p>
<b>THE ETHICAL IMPERATIVE</b>
<p>
<b>KEVIN VIGILANTE:</b>  Thanks very much. It's great to be back here at the Heritage Foundation. It is always a pleasure to work with brilliant people, and I have been a fan of the innovative Heritage approach to solving our health care dilemma for quite some time.
<p>
I was asked to come and talk about the physician-patient relationship. I think it is probably the most precious thing we have in the practice of medicine. Most of us did not choose to do what we do because of money, but because of some other, more important sources of gratification. I think that in this whole national health care debate, the physician-patient relationship has not had adequate attention.
<p>
And it is undergoing a tremendous change. Go back to the Hippocratic Corpus, 2,500 years ago. We Hippocratics call it the Hippocratic Corpus because it was written by a number of different people. Hippocrates, the great Greek philosopher, only wrote a small portion of it, and like any piece authored by multiple people, it has its share of contradictions, inconsistencies, and differences in style.
<p>
But one thing throughout the entire Corpus is constant:  It is the physician's primary duty -- actually, his sacred duty -- to serve the patient. It puts the physician clearly in the servant role.
<p>
That is the ideal. Throughout ancient and modern history, that tradition endured right up until the present time. True, you can find exceptions, such as the Great Plague, where some of the best and brightest physicians fled the towns and cities to leave their patients behind to be cared for by lowly "plague doctors."  But that was an exception.
<p>
We all know physicians who are, perhaps, pompous and arrogant, and thus do not typify the notion of the servant. But, again, that is a deviation from the ideal.
<p>
Under this model, it is the patient's prerogative to leave the physician at will, for whatever reason, without explanation. But, ethically, it is not a reciprocal relationship. The physician can never leave the patient at will, or abruptly. That, according to the professional ethic and the law, is called abandonment. The physician must subordinate himself or herself to the needs of the patient in a service capacity.
<p>
What has happened recently, very recently, is that for the first time in the last 2,500 years, on a large scale, that relationship has started to change. In a very subtle, insidious, and somewhat unrecognized way, it is changing, and we are seeing corporate medicine, managed care medicine. It is a change from a dual relationship to a triadic relationship, where the physician is no longer employed by the patient. The physician is now employed by a corporate entity.
<p>
A physician has two functions in that regard. He has to care for the patient, but he also has to meet a financial or cost objective established by the corporate entity. So what was previously a very unambiguous relationship with the patient has become conceptually blurred. Where does the physician's loyalty lie?
<p>
Most of us, and most of our colleagues, are going to go on practicing largely the same as we did before. We have a strong feeling that the ethical imperative is to be responsible first to your patient. But like all such changes, at first imperceptible and insidious, these things have gradual influence, and in subsequent generations, I fear we are going to see a change in physician behavior. This is borne out, I think, most acutely or dramatically in the concept of futility. Somebody mentioned last night at dinner that the last few months of life are the most expensive when we're under care.
<p>
There is a raging debate in the realm of medical ethics called the problem of futility. When you have somebody who is in the last days and months of life, undergoing extraordinary methods of treatment, and the physician feels that this is futile care, that this will not change the ultimate outcome of this person's life, who has the right to withdraw treatment?  Is it the physician unilaterally?  Is it the physician in consultation with the family, particularly if the family wants everything done?
<p>
In the old model, you could have a debate as to whether the physician had some right in saying, "I'm not obliged to deliver all forms of treatment -- I can withhold some treatments based on professional judgment."  But now there is a third factor in this decision, not related to the physician's professional judgment as to whether this care is futile or in accord with the family's wishes. It's the pressure that the managed care corporation brings to bear.
<p>
Their bottom line is precious; and if the last six weeks, or six months, of care is responsible for the majority of their cost -- well, who is going to be making decisions about futility, and where are the pressures going to come from?  And when there is uncertainty, when do you come down on one side or the other?  This is very, very important ethical territory. We cannot avoid it.
<p>
So I am very concerned about the corruption of the physician-patient relationship. Again, let me just say one thing:  I am not anti-managed care and I am not anti-HMO. Some of my best friends work for HMOs, and they're good doctors. Harvard Health is in my territory, and I'd be proud to practice medicine there. It's good medicine. But you know, there's the good among HMOs, there's the bad, and then there's the ugly. And it's not always easy to tell, especially if you're a lay person, which is which, or what it's going to be five years from now.
<p>
<b>Personal Choice.</b> The solution to this problem, to this dilemma, is choice. Give the patient the choice of saying, "Yes, I want to be a part of that HMO and that doctor," or, "I don't. I would prefer to be a part of that HMO, or managed care, or PPO, or neither. I want to go to somebody else completely outside the managed care structure."
<p>
That is the essence of it. Because once you've done that, you've empowered the patient. He can make the decision as to how much ethical ground he's going to trade in for cost savings, and it's his choice. Right now, it's the employer's choice because the employer says, "Look, I'm getting the best deal from X Y Z managed care down the road. So you don't get so many MRIs. However they're doing it, I don't care. They're saving me money. That's who you're going with."  For employers and their doctors, that's a real problem.
<p>
The reason why employees don't have choice is simple:  the tax code. It is because the only way you can get a tax break is if your employer buys the policy for you. And that's nuts.
<p>
Most people still don't get it. They don't realize that right down there in the bowels of the system is this one small, invisible tax lesion. It's like a genetic error. It's very tiny; it's very small; but its effects are protean, and it's passed on from one generation to the next. Unless you identify that gene, you will not fix the disease.
<p>
But this is more invisible than any gene, because nobody is out there getting NIH grants to look for it. Unless you change the tax code, you're not going to fix this problem. And that's the importance of what the Heritage people were saying years ago:  "Fix this lesion."  If you do that, the American health care system will be in a position to pick up its pallet and walk.
<p>
The other thing that is very important is medical savings accounts (MSAs). MSAs provide an ethical, as well as financial, counterweight to corporate managed care because with an MSA, you are dealing, for much of your care, in cash, and cash goes anywhere. It's your choice as to where to bring it. Nobody says you can't go here or go there. It preserves the possibility of a fee-for-service environment and opens up possibilities for other forms of care. And it injects price competition, real price competition, into the marketplace. The only way a consumer can tell what something is worth economically is price. That's what prices are for.
<p>
So I conclude by warning that the traditional physician-patient relationship is under threat. This very emotional, precious relationship is under threat from a very arcane and technical marauder:  a few lines in the federal tax code. For too many policymakers, there is a cognitive disconnect here; you almost can't believe it. Unless we focus on it, we will not be able to heal our health care system or salvage the doctor-patient relationship.
<p>

<b>A MODERN FABLE</b>
<p>
<b>SANDRA MAHKORN:</b>  I'd like to tell you a story about Dr. Goodfellow, who lives and practices in Home Town, U.S.A. Dr. Goodfellow finished his internship in 1963 and set up a simple general practice. He hired a medical assistant and a receptionist and worked hard, often seeing as many as thirty-five to forty patients a day.
<p>
A large factory in Home Town shut down, and Dr. Goodfellow saw about five or six patients a day for free during the local economic crisis. Many of these were older and retired people, and he knew they'd have a hard time paying their bills.
<p>
Dr. Goodfellow knew his patients very well, and so did his medical assistant and his receptionist. He loved medicine, and he loved being his own boss, a trait that he had inherited from his father, who ran a small family grocery store. In the evening, Dr. Goodfellow often spent an hour or so going over books and catching up on his paperwork, and at the end of the day, he went home to find his two children watching "Leave It to Beaver" and to enjoy a good, home-cooked meal.
<p>
He worked long days, and sometimes nights, but he was happy. He felt good about what he did, and he knew his patients liked him and believed in him.
<p>
The years passed quickly. One morning after coming to the office, Dr. Goodfellow paged through his 1995 calendar. August 8 was a day he had circled in red. He would turn fifty-nine-and-a-half on that day, and he could withdraw money from his IRA without penalty. Should he retire?  He never thought he'd want to consider that option so soon, but things had changed.
<p>
"Oh, well. I'll think about it a little more," he decided. Then he grabbed his white coat and stethoscope, and entered the examining room of his first patient.
<p>
"Hello, Mrs. Adams. I'm Dr. Gatekeeper -- oh, I'm sorry. I mean, Goodfellow. I see you're a new patient with Happy Health HMO. Can I do anything for you today?"
<p>
Mrs. Adams pulled a long strip of paper from her purse. He sank onto the swivel stool, prepared for a long session. "Well, I've been seeing a dermatologist for this rash and an allergist for these awful sinus problems I have. And I have some urinary problems, so I see this nephrologist. So if you'd just write me some referrals, I'll be on my way."
<p>
"Why didn't the HMOs ever tell patients they'd have to get most of their care from a family doctor?"  thought Dr. Goodfellow. He resented being put in the middle.
<p>
Dr. Goodfellow's staff had grown with the years and the hassles, and he now employed a registered nurse, a file clerk, a receptionist, and a medical assistant. Besides that, he contracted with a billing service, an answering service, and medical transcriptionists. Not infrequently, he was forced to hire a lawyer. He was also forced to hire consultants to help him decipher new regulations, such as OSHA and CLIA.
<p>
Last year, the overhead alone was over 60 percent, and his income had dropped. Dr. Goodfellow now had time to see only about eighteen patients a day. Some days, it seemed as though the paperwork took the bulk of his time.
<p>
New Medicare regulations had just been published. "Well, I guess that interesting article on new treatments for rheumatoid arthritis will just have to wait," he thought. A few years ago, he had neglected to keep up with some regulations regarding Medicare billing, and several patients left his practice after receiving nasty-sounding letters from the federal government that made it seem as though he was fraudulently charging them.
<p>
He walked into the next exam room. Mrs. Williams hadn't noticed him come in at first. Her forehead was barely visible behind the latest issue of  . Dr. Goodfellow's mouth dropped a little bit when he read on the front cover of the magazine, "What Your Doctor Doesn't Know Can Kill You."  As Mrs. Williams slowly lowered the magazine that she had picked up in his waiting room, Dr. Goodfellow detected a sense of anxiety in her expression. After spending half an hour convincing her that he really did understand the side effects of Robitussin DM, he ordered all magazines removed from his waiting room except for   and  .
<p>
He was about to see his third patient of the day when the receptionist paged him to take a call. It took him twenty minutes to explain to Happy Health HMO's utilization review expert why Mr. Cardiac, a 52-year-old business executive in congestive heart failure and a four-day-old coma, wasn't a candidate for early discharge on a home respirator.
<p>
Even though his office staff had swelled, it seemed as though the number of things he was able to do in his office had dwindled to nothing. Last year, he discarded the strep screens he had been doing and placed his cholesterol monitor in storage after registering as a waivered lab under CLIA -- the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. He continued, however, to secretly perform Gram stains from time to time, something he had learned in medical school. In his heart, he felt he really had a right to provide that service to his patients.
<p>
He kept his microscope in a locked cabinet in a dark corner of his office. One day, a disgruntled employee discovered the Gram stain reagents he had forgotten to replace in the desk drawer and called the CLIA police. The next afternoon, an officious-looking gentleman stormed into his crowded waiting room flashing a badge, while anxious patients looked on. Intimidated, he escorted the surly inspector to his office. His microscope, a bottle of Crystal Violet, and his microbiology texts were all confiscated. "You know, you could be fined $10,000 for this," said the inspector as he bagged up the evidence.
<p>
Finally, it was lunch time. He grabbed a bagel that had been left by a drug detail man and jumped into his car. The hospital had called a meeting to discuss the new PHO they were forming. The idea sounded good until he read the fine print.
<p>
The afternoon schedule was almost as challenging as the morning's. Exhausted, he was about to leave the office when the hospital's patient advocate called. "Mrs. Macintosh was irate," she explained. "She insisted she had not given informed consent for the two metal staples to be used in place of the two silk ones after her laparoscopy. She's threatening to sue, and her attorney wants you to call him."
<p>
"Tell Mrs. Macintosh I'll speak to her about it in the morning," sighed Dr. Goodfellow wearily and apologetically.
<p>
Patient advocates. Every hospital has them now. "Strange," he thought. "There was a time I thought I was the patient advocate."
<p>
He shuffled into the den after a long ride home. His grandchildren were at first oblivious to his presence, watching "Beavis and Butt Head."  Finally, his granddaughter bounced onto his lap:  "Grandpa, guess what?  I've decided to become a doctor."
<p>
<b>The Moral of the Story.</b> The Dr. Goodfellow story illustrates several factors that have contributed to the disintegration and dissolution of the physician-patient relationship.
<p>
First, there has been a revolutionary transformation in the medical marketplace resulting in a dramatic shift in the way we interact and view ourselves in relation to our patients. The helping relationship has been replaced by a contractual relationship. Instead of doctor and patient, it is now provider and consumer.
<p>
Second, the third-party payer has taken on a directive role. Rather than passive players, as was the case with traditional indemnity plans, physicians and patients are the subjects of behavioral management strategies. Reimbursement schemes and monetary incentives are designed to elicit defined health care decision responses. Not only must the physician and patient consider the medical pros and cons of alternative treatment, but other factors must be considered. For example, should the 60-year-old woman who has been doing well on a particular blood pressure medicine that is no longer on her HMO's preferred drug formulary risk changing medications to avoid a higher copay?
<p>
Third, since PPOs and MCOs discourage or prohibit the use of providers not listed in their panels, the doctor-patient relationship has been supplanted by the patient-HMO relationship. It's no longer "my doctor," but "my HMO."
<p>
Fourth, the media have not been particularly kind to the physician. Perhaps it's the anti-authority inclination; perhaps it's a bit of muck-raking. Doctors are not above being questioned. Nor should they be immune to legitimate challenges. But the challenge often takes the form of an attack. Articles such as "What Your Doctor Never Learned in Medical School" abound and undermine former trust.
<p>
Finally, federal and state governments have stepped into the physician's office to regulate the practice of medicine. Under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, for example, physicians who choose to do a simple strep screen or read a Gram stain are faced with costly and burdensome regulatory requirements. Regulations promulgated under the guise of protecting the public too often have been the products of scientifically baseless political grandstanding. A 1994 study in the   found that strep screens could be performed by sixth graders, with an average IQ of 90, with 95 to 100 percent accuracy on the first attempt. Yet the government considers strep screens so complex a test for the physician that expensive regulatory burdens are required to protect the public.
<p>
There is probably no turning back, but where do we go from here?  As physicians, we must take an active role in deciding our futures. In many cases, we may be employees. But the health system can't function without us, and therein lies our strength. We have a responsibility to our patients to preserve their health care choices. And we have a responsibility to ourselves to preserve our decisionmaking options.

<p>        	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">N</FONT></B>othing could be more heart-breaking than the sight of a baby born with an 
addiction to cocaine. There is very little doctors and nurses can do to ease the pain of 
these innocent newborns, whose mothers' use of hard, illegal drugs during pregnancy 
constitutes nothing less than blatant child abuse.</P>
<P>	Walk into the neonatal unit of any hospital in America, and you will see crack-
cocaine babies. Some cry and shake uncontrollably. They refuse to take food. Many die.</P> 
<P>	And those who survive are far more likely than other children to be sentenced to 
lives of behavioral problems, birth defects, and learning disabilities.</P>
<P>	Nationwide, one in 10 children born has been exposed to cocaine in the womb. 
This condition affects 350,000 babies a year. Our society can address this problem 
effectively. We can significantly reduce this type of child abuse. Unfotunately, the policy 
of the Clinton administration is to protect, not the children, but the "rights" of the mothers 
to escape the consequences of their actions.</P>
<P>	Several years ago, when I was serving as a circuit solicitor in South Carolina, I 
became aware of the growing problem of crack-cocaine babies at Charleston's Medical 
Unversity of South Carolina (MUSC). My office worked with the hospital to aggressively 
confront pregnant women with the consequences of their drug use. Over a five-year 
period, we presented all pregnant mothers who tested positive for cocaine use with a 
choice: Either seek drug treatment or face arrest and jail time.</P>
<P>	This became one of the first "crack-baby" prevention programs in the nation. And 
the program worked. Scores of women agreed to enter rehabilitation and stayed off drugs 
for the remainder of their pregnancies. Before-and-after statistics present a clear picture. 
Before the sanctions took effect, 24 pregnant mothers a month tested positive for cocaine. 
Virtually none of them was willing to seek help voluntarily. Then, beginning in 1989, 
when we launched a tough amnesty program, the number testing positive for cocaine 
dropped to five or six a month. Prenatal visits as well as live births at the hospital stayed 
the same. Other states were looking at our success as a model.</P>
<P>	Tragically, the cocaine-baby program, which was clearly saving lives, was 
effectively shut down by the Clinton administration. Under the president's direction, a 
swarm of federal officials came to Charleston making unfounded allegations of 
discrimination and accusing the hospital of violating the "privacy rights" of the addicted 
mothers. The Clinton administration warned us that a private civil-rights suit was 
pending, and threatened to cut off $54 million in federal assistance, or about 60 percent 
of the facility's annual budget. Last year, the hospital finally relented, ending the 
successful intervention program.</P>
<P>    Now, once again, the babies cry out in agony. And once again, hospital staff with no 
legal recourse must watch pregnant women knowingly cause neurological damage to 
their unborn children. MUSC nurse Shirley Brown expressed the frustration eloquently: 
"You just have to sit around with your hands tied and watch them destroy a baby." 
Indeed she is right. If this is what President Clinton has in mind when he calls for a return 
to individual and community responsibility, then this administration faces a profound 
moral crisis.</P>
<P>	Administration officials and representatives of the American Civil Liberties 
Union (ACLU) called the cocaine-baby program punitive, discriminatory, and invasive. 
In fact, it was none of the above.</P>
<P>	By the late 1980s, nurse Brown and her staff noticed an increasing number of 
pregnant women coming to the hospital--not for prenatal care, but because of 
hemorrhaging or other acute problems related to their pregnancies. In the course of 
treatment, many of these women tested positive for drug use, usually cocaine. Thus the 
program grew out of a deep concern among the hospital staff for the welfare of both 
mother and child.</P>
<P>	At first, the hospital tried to educate the women about the damage they were 
causing to themselves and to their unborn babies. Sadly, hospital workers could not 
convince many of the expectant drug-addicted women to enter a drug-treatment program. 
Most wouldn't even return for any type of prenatal care at all. The women--mostly poor 
and uneducated--received free counseling. They were offered free drug treatment and 
free prenatal care, but few participated in the program voluntarily.</P>
<P>	At the same time, the delivery and treatment of crack babies was putting a 
tremendous strain on hospital resources, as well as on the moral sensibilities of hospital 
personnel. Normal neonatal delivery costs can be as low as $500 per baby, but the costs 
of cocaine babies and the intense postnatal care they require have increased 
tremendously. The hospital has seen bills reach $750,000.  Most are born to welfare 
mothers, so Medicaid and the hospital were picking up the bill. According to the General 
Accounting Office, a single cocaine baby can run up a lifetime tab of $1 million in 
medical and educational costs.</P>
<P>	At the time we launched the cocaine baby program in Charleston, I was circuit 
solicitor. Last year, I was elected attorney general for South Carolina, and now view the 
problem from a statewide perspective. Hospitals across our state see drug-damaged 
babies with growing frequency. In every major city in the country, hospitals have units 
devoted to crack mothers and crack babies. But no one dares to forcefully address the 
causes of the problem. We are merely watching it happen and paying an increasingly high 
price in dollars and human suffering. We saw an opportunity to make a difference.</P>
<P>	During the operation of the cocaine-baby program in Charleston, everyone 
concerned was brought to the table--social workers, people from Charleston County 
Substance Abuse, drug-rehabilitation specialists, law-enforcement officials, hospital 
officials, and my office, which was willing to prosecute when necessary. We all agreed 
on one principle: We needed a program that used not only a carrot, but a real and very 
firm stick.</P>
<P>	Those who argued most forcefully for the cocaine-baby program were people who 
dealt with drug addiction every day: the rehabilitation specialists. They told us that 
"unless you have sanctions in place, unless you understand the basic irresponsibility of 
these drug-addicted women, it won't work."</P> 
<P>	Working closely with Chief Reuben Greenberg of the Charleston Police 
Department, we set up an amnesty program with sanctions for those who don't abide by 
the rules. Whenever a prenatal patient tested positive for drugs, hospital staff first 
counseled the mother about what she was doing to her unborn baby. They presented her 
with a letter from the solicitor's office explaining that she faced arrest and prosecution 
(crack cocaine use is a felony in South Carolina) if she refused treatment. The solicitor's 
office then promised to drop all charges if the woman successfully completed a drug-
treatment program. We saw this as a child-abuse prevention program with a goal of 
producing a healthy child.</P>
<P>	We had solid legal grounds to act in this manner, especially in the third trimester 
of the pregnancy. During the final trimester, the fetus is regarded as viable, that is, 
capable of sustaining life on its own, and is therefore granted significant protections 
under both federal and state law. Indeed, the viable fetus is a person under the law. In this 
legal context, we offered pregnant women immunity from prosecution, free medical 
services, and free access to a program of drug rehabilitation. All we asked of them in 
return was to enter the program in good faith and to stop abusing their unborn children 
with illegal drugs.</P>
<P>	Politically correct resolutions by the American Medical Association and the 
American Pediatrics Association denounced the policy as punitive and unwise. The 
National Institutes of Health also sent down some officials, who made the incredible 
claim that the hospital was conducting coercive experiments on pregnant women. Then 
the Clinton administration, ideologically driven by the absurd notion that a woman's 
privacy rights overrule a mother's most basic responsibility to her own child, would not 
allow us to protect the lives of the babies or their self-destructive mothers. Donna 
Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services, sent an investigative team from the 
department's ethics division. One HHS official, without offering any evidence, claimed 
the program had "a chilling effect on minority pregnant women seeking prenatal health 
care."</P>
<P>	Of course, the cocaine-baby program was not punitive. The program was not 
designed to put people in jail. It was a humanitarian effort to save lives through tough, 
decisive action under urgent circumstances. In fact, the women involved in the program 
almost invariably avoided jail.</P>
<P>	Most of the pregnant women who tested positive for crack cocaine (after they 
understood their options) agreed to enter the drug program. The small number who 
refused the program were indeed arrested, but nearly all of their cases were dismissed 
because the women quickly agreed to enter the program once they saw we were serious. 
Only two continued to refuse help, and they were ultimately placed on probation. The 
cocaine-baby program was not a punitive "lock-up" program, but an amnesty program. 
And it was working.</P>
<P>	Also, there is absolutely no evidence that it scared anyone away from prenatal 
care. Remember, very few of these women came to the hospital in the first place to take 
advantage of prenatal services. They came because of urgent medical problems related 
either to their pregnancy or to their addiction.</P>
<P>	Opponents of our cocaine-baby program continually failed to understand that 
prosecutorial action, like a thermostat, can be constantly adjusted. Charges can be 
dropped at any time. We can add conditions.</P> 
<P>	The system has a great deal of flexibility that can be used to motivate 
irresponsible people to take responsible action. Many public defenders (though they are 
not likely to admit it publicly) thought the cocaine-baby program was a great idea.</P>
<P>	Cocaine addicts need a strong motive to mend their ways. And most drug and 
law-enforcement officials also agree. A federally funded research survey showed that 
about 30 percent of those who enter public drug-treatment programs do so only because 
of direct or indirect legal pressure. The Office of National Drug Control Policy noted in a 
1992 report that "the criminal justice system can steer offenders toward drug treatment as 
a condition for deferred prosecution."</P>
<P>	The Clinton administration, however, seemed utterly unconcerned with common 
sense or practical solutions to a problem that is literally destroying the lives of adults and 
infants. Within a matter of weeks, HHS also sent investigators from its Office of Civil 
Rights. They alleged that the program was discriminatory toward blacks. Marie Chretien, 
a regional manager in the Office of Civil Rights, claimed in a letter to the hospital that its 
substance-abuse policy "may result in an adverse disproportionate impact on African-
American women."</P>
<P>	It is true that most of the women treated were black. The hospital serves a 
primarily indigent population, and most of the patient population is black. The South 
Carolina Drug Prevalence Study showed blacks were more likely to use cocaine than 
whites.</P>
<P>	Ask Police Chief Greenberg, who is also African American, if this policy was 
discriminatory. He would be among the first to tell you that cocaine use is much more 
common in South Carolina among blacks than whites--and that the black community 
was benefiting most from the prenatal program. "[The program's opponents] don't care 
about the race issue. They're just using this as a tactic," Greenberg says. "I was glad that 
somebody was finally doing something to help kids in the black community. It was 
giving kids a chance who otherwise would not have anything close to an equal playing 
field. At least at the point of birth, that child ought to be given the best opportunity for a 
full and productive life."</P>
<P>	In spite of all this, the HHS civil-rights office threatened in a letter last June to cut 
off federal money to MUSC unless it backed away from its aggressive treatment program. 
"It is the government's obligation to ensure that federal funds do not support a program 
which discriminates," Chretien wrote in the letter. "This obligation entails making a 
formal determination of whether there is a violation of the Title VI regulation--and if 
negotiations for voluntary compliance fail, the initiation of administrative enforcement 
proceedings to terminate federal financial assistance."</P>
<P>	What continues to amaze me, as the state's chief law-enforcement officer, is the 
groundlessness of the discrimination charge. In October 1993, the liberal, feminist Center 
for Reproductive Law and Policy filed a civil suit against the hospital alleging that its 
policy was racially discriminatory, and thus a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of 
the 14th Amendment. The New York-based center, an offshoot of the ACLU, asked a 
federal judge to issue an injunction against the hospital to suspend the drug-testing 
program. The judge declined, finding no basis for the discrimination charge.</P>
<P>	It's no coincidence, by the way, that shortly after the feminist group failed in its 
lawsuit, investigators from the Clinton administration swooped down on the Medical 
University. I am convinced their plan was coordinated with HHS officials. So is the 
hospital. "It was obvious to us there was collusion between the center and all the federal 
agencies that came down on us," says the university's president, Dr. James Edwards.</P>
<P>	Whether HHS officials would have followed with their own lawsuit is unclear. 
Almost certainly they could not have won in court. But they didn't need to. The hospital, 
dependent on federal funding, never had a chance. HHS agents made an ex parte decision 
that the program was discriminatory. And so they exercised the federal version of the 
golden rule--that is, they've got the gold, so they make the rules.</P>
<P>	The Clinton administration was willing to withhold millions of dollars from the 
Medical University, stop all of its Medicaid assistance, shut down its children's hospital 
and its cancer center, discontinue dozens of medical services from radiation oncology to 
pediatric surgery, close down its 558 beds, and force the hospital to turn away its 
patients--all to end a program that offended the liberal sensibilities of Donna Shalala and 
Bill Clinton. A gun was held to the hospital's head, and for the protection of all the other 
patients, the hospital had to agree to give up.</P>
<P>	Unfortunately, this saga isn't over yet. The Office of the Solicitor and virtually 
everyone else involved in the hospital's prenatal drug policy is being sued by the Center 
for Reproductive Freedom on behalf of five women who tested positive for cocaine.</P> 
<P>	They want $3 million. It's a complicated suit, but it boils down to a claim that the 
program violated their right to privacy. In fact, the so-called constitutional right to 
privacy does not protect the results of a drug screen, especially not in this case.</P>
<P>	First of all, you don't have a right to use crack cocaine; it's a felony. Second, all 
of the women knew about the amnesty program--there were public-service 
announcements about it, the women voluntarily came to the only hospital in the state that 
sponsored it, they were counseled about the consequences of testing positive, and they all 
signed consent forms before being screened.</P>
<P>	Medical personnel are held legally accountable for the health of both mother and 
unborn child throughout the pregnancy. In fact, malpractice insurance exists to support 
the obligations of primary-care providers in just such cases. If a fetus is damaged by 
inadequate, mistaken, or negligent medical practice, the hospital would quickly face 
lawsuits. So how is it that we have no legal means to keep mothers from seriously 
damaging or destroying their own babies? "If the mother is not going to be held 
responsible," says nurse Brown, "then I don't think any nurse or physician giving 
obstetrical care should have to be held liable."</P>
<P>	The Clinton administration apparently believes that infants have no rights at all 
until the umbilical cord is cut. But the U.S. Supreme Court has never said that the states 
do not have a compelling interest in protecting the health of the unborn in the third 
trimester when they can live outside the womb. Indeed, case law in South Carolina and 
elsewhere suggests that society does have certain obligations to the unborn child, 
certainly at very advanced stages of development. South Carolina courts have interpreted 
"person" to include a viable fetus.</P>
<P>	We put tremendous resources into prosecuting child-abuse cases because of the 
great damage done to children, and we make no apologies for that. The cocaine-baby 
program we started in South Carolina was, most of all, a child-abuse prevention program, 
protecting the smallest and the most innocent of children.</P>
<P>	President Clinton and his messengers appear to be fundamentally unconcerned 
with the hundred of thousands of cocaine-addicted women who stagger into the delivery 
units of hospitals across the land. The only remedy they offer to the horribly damaged 
children who result from this madness is to increase the flow of Medicaid dollars, 
provided by taxpayers, to pay a price so large that it is literally impossible to calculate. 
And the greatest frustration of all is knowing that this increasingly expensive tragedy can 
be prevented. One of the most basic responsibilities a mother has is to her child. If a 
mother injected cocaine into the tiny arm of her infant, causing permanent brain damage 
or death, certainly that mother would be arrested and prosecuted.</P>
<P>	Yet that is exactly what addicted mothers do when they consume cocaine 
throughout their pregnancy. In South Carolina, we tried to do something about it. The 
program we created was working. Now it is no more. And as long as powerful federal 
bureaucrats continue to manipulate federal funding to serve a bizarre agenda that is deaf 
to the cries of damaged babies, there is nothing more we can do.</P>
<P>	Why is the Clinton administration stopping us from protecting our children?</P>

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">S</FONT></B>peaking in Galesburg, Illinois, in January, President Clinton proposed a federally 
funded job-training program "to keep the American Dream alive in the 21st century." 
Cost to American taxpayers: $3.5 billion a year.</P>
<P>	If he had driven about an hour north, Clinton could have visited a college campus 
that proves his program is unnecessary. DeVry Institute of Technology, headquartered in 
Oakbrook, Illinois, makes a handsome profit by offering a first-rate technical education to 
working-class students. This little-known school shows how private businesses 
outperform government in providing good job training.</P>
<P>	On 13 campuses from Atlanta to Los Angeles, more than 15,000 students--35 
percent of whom are black or Latino--are earning their bachelor's of science degrees at 
DeVry. Ninety-four percent of the school's graduates land jobs in their fields of study 
within six months, with an average starting salary exceeding $24,000 a year.</P>
<P>	DeVry's alumni enjoy cutting-edge technical careers. At Hughes 
Communications, the nation's largest satellite company, 22 of the 30 engineers 
responsible for orbit maintenance are DeVry graduates. KLA Instruments, which designs 
quality-control systems for the manufacture of microchips, boasts that a fifth of its 1,000 
employees graduated from DeVry. All this at an annual cost per student of $2,500 less 
than similar state-run programs.</P>
<P>	And DeVry posted a $12-million profit on revenues of  $211 million last year to 
boot.</P>

<H3>Selling Job Opportunity</H3>
<P>	Since its founding in 1931 by Herman DeVry, the inventor of the portable 
motion-picture projector, the institute has specialized in technical training that leads to 
lucrative careers. DeVry, which grants accredited bachelor's degrees, is a for-profit 
venture whose stock trades on the NASDAQ exchange. In short, it sells job opportunity.</P>
<P>	Five years ago, when Zaneta Rizzo graduated from a small high school in rural 
Louisiana, she "knew less than nothing" about computers, thought DOS was pronounced 
"dose," and was terrified of automatic-teller machines.</P>
<P>	After two years of bouncing among jobs in fast-food restaurants, Rizzo enrolled at 
DeVry's Dallas campus. Recently she graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer 
information systems and is deciding between several job offers with computer-training 
firms. Before DeVry, Rizzo's salary peaked at $760 a month. Her current offers are for 
$25,000 a year--a 275 percent pay hike.</P>
<P>	When Jeri Gomez graduated from high school near Fresno, California, she 
enrolled in a local community college to study the health sciences and dance, but classes 
were constantly being canceled, so she enlisted in the army. After serving in Desert 
Storm, Gomez enrolled at DeVry's Pomona campus. She is now deciding among several 
job offers in software programming that pay more than $30,000 a year.</P>
<P>	Rizzo's and Gomez's stories are typical of DeVry students, many of whom field 
multiple job offers before their commencement. In fact, more than 95 percent of 
engineering and accounting majors are placed in their fields within six months of 
graduation--a success rate many of the nation's top schools never approach. How does 
DeVry do it? By running the college like a business.</P>
<P>	Unlike most colleges, DeVry receives no direct government money or alumni 
gifts. Nearly all revenues, and therefore profits, come from tuition. And DeVry has found 
that the best way to attract more students--over half of whom are the first in their 
families to attend college--is to secure high-paying jobs for graduates. Dennis Keller, 
DeVry's chief executive officer, says the school avoids anything that doesn't help 
students find careers.</P>
<P>	To this end, DeVry maintains an enormous placement system with more than 100 
staffers and a database of thousands of employers. While most other schools in the 
country assign placement officers to handle a broad spectrum of careers, DeVry has 
found that employers prefer to communicate with staffers who understand their particular 
needs. For this reason, each officer is trained in a specific field. For instance, Motorola--
which is based near DeVry's DuPage County campus in northern Illinois--works closely 
with staffers specializing in telecommunications. The payoff has been tremendous. When 
the electronics giant was planning a major expansion in Illinois, it consulted DeVry 
placement officials in advance to secure an educated labor force.</P>
<P>	DeVry also edges out the competition by studying labor trends, nationally as well 
as in the local markets near each campus. DeVry does not depend on the federal 
government's research, which is mostly retrospective; its researchers analyze new and 
growing fields. Using data from interviews with small and large employers, annual 
alumni surveys, and more than a dozen local-industry advisory panels, DeVry graduates 
can target rapidly emerging areas that traditional schools miss. Relying on data from the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics, for instance, most colleges until recently paid little attention to 
the cellular industry. DeVry officials, on the other hand, adjusted their 
telecommunications curriculum eight years ago to include this technology, and 
subsequently launched the careers of many graduates. "Health care is the next big one," 
says Norman Metz, a senior vice president at DeVry. "We are currently focusing on the 
medical-equipment industry that will handle the graying of America."</P>
<P>	Despite these unsurpassed placement results, the Clinton administration has 
frowned upon for-profit schools like DeVry, insisting the capitalist model leads to a 
useless education. At a 1993 press conference, Labor Secretary Robert Reich told 
journalists to be wary of these institutions, claiming that they mismatch thousands of 
students, and that there is no market for their degrees. Reich's warning was reiterated by 
the media, including the Cleveland Plain Dealer, which urged some for-profit schools to 
carry "warning labels" detailing prospective students' chances of finding employment 
after graduation. In fact, if many state schools had to publish such information, students 
would likely flock to DeVry.</P>

<H3>Blood, Sweat, and Jobs</H3>
<P>	Some for-profit trade schools, to be sure, are little more than diploma mills that 
give gullible students a shlock education. These schools usually go bankrupt when 
students catch on that their degree leads nowhere. But for an institution that is in business 
for the long haul, producing high-quality education for satisfied customers is essential to 
growth and profitability. Keller believes that every graduate represents the school: If an 
employer is unsatisfied with the quality of a single graduate's work, he is unlikely to hire 
from DeVry in the future. That would ultimately harm the bottom line.</P>
<P>	To that end, the school maintains a demanding curriculum that students call 
"brutal" and Keller calls "tough love." It is a no-frills, lots-of-sweat education. The 
rigorous process begins even before the classes start. Although the school accepts SAT 
and ACT test scores--applicants average at the 45th percentile--all students are required 
to take DeVry's admissions test in math. About 14 percent of the applicants fail the exam. 
Of the remaining students, about a quarter are admitted on the condition that they take 
remedial classes. Applicants are also required to take a College Board English test that 
determines their placement in humanities courses.</P>
<P>	From the first day, students follow the curriculum in lockstep. There are no 
electives. Students immediately choose a major from among five fields: electronics-
engineering technology, computer information systems, business operations, 
telecommunications management, or accounting. Each major requires eight or nine 
semesters, and can be completed in three years with summer school.</P>
<P>	Students and DeVry's senior management both prefer this inflexible system. Like 
a manufacturer, the school desires a reputation for providing a consistent "product"; 
students say they enjoy receiving firm direction. "This gets rid of a lot of the time-
wasting filler classes, like underwater basket-weaving, that people take elsewhere," 
recalls Rose Huening, a 1986 graduate.</P>

<H3>Heavy Lifting</H3>
<P>	Here there is no time to waste. Each term, DeVry students take at least four 
classes, plus labs, often exceeding a conventional courseload by four to six credit hours. 
The first-year courseload for computer information systems is typical: five computer-
science classes, four computer labs, two math courses and a math lab, two English 
courses with one writing lab, an economics course, a psychology course, and a business 
course. In addition, since many of the students have never before been pushed to work so 
hard, all freshmen enroll in a class on "success strategies," which teaches study skills and 
time-management techniques.</P>
<P>	George Dean, the vice president for educational planning, believes that many 
traditional colleges waste a great deal of energy embracing new teaching methods. DeVry 
doesn't mandate teaching methods--professors can choose whatever textbooks they 
want--but the level of academic expectations is set at the head office, and it's set high. 
"At the end of the course, the students have to be able to do x and y and z," Dean says. 
"If it works better at the Columbus campus to teach it z then y then x, it doesn't bother 
me."</P>
<P>	Dean is comfortable giving the professors ample latitude because they are 
required to gain real-world experience in their field, and so tend to prefer the most 
practical methods. Although some students earn money for tuition by assisting faculty 
members, they are prohibited from teaching, and are usually limited to grading papers.</P>
<P>	Unlike trade schools that teach specific skills (many of which become obsolete as 
technology changes), DeVry's curriculum focuses on teaching students how to reason. In 
many ways, DeVry offers the liberal-arts version of a technical education: students learn 
how to solve technical problems. They are drilled thoroughly on the basics, and required 
to spend countless hours in the lab to build an educational foundation. On exams, 
students are rarely asked straight-forward mathematical questions; instead, they are 
usually given detailed descriptions of real-world problems, including information they 
must recognize as extraneous. Dean claims that this education prepares students to 
operate efficiently in the business world. Furthermore, teachers will fail students whose 
lab reports are not written in proper English, regardless of the experiment's outcome. 
DeVry doesn't shortchange the humanities, because these non-technical abilities will be 
vital to the students' careers. Alumni routinely tell Dean that the technical skills get them 
hired and the reasoning skills get them promoted.</P>
<P>	 A student with a grade point average below a "C" is placed on academic 
probation, and prohibited from taking a relaxed schedule. If the student's g.p.a. remains 
below a "C" average the following semester, he or she is expelled. Every year, 20 percent 
of the student body flunks out. DeVry does not pamper its students en route to the 
diploma. "We have hard classes, but if that is not met with enough commitment to be 
successful, then it is detrimental to this company for that student to stay," Keller says. 
Huening's class is a perfect example: of the 325 students who started, only 94 graduated 
on time.</P> 
<P>	Just as auto manufacturers are constantly reviewing the efficiency of their cars, 
DeVry maintains strict quality control. About a decade ago, DeVry was reviewing each 
course every three years, which was considered swift compared to traditional schools. 
Now it rewrites each course at least once a year. During the summer term, faculty 
members visit hundreds of employers across the nation and find out what their needs will 
be in five to 10 years. Together with information offered by industry leaders on DeVry's 
dozen or so curriculum-advisory boards, the school sets new course requirements. For 
instance, a few years ago most computer-programming courses only taught a 
programming language called COBOL, but professors noted that firms near some of their 
campuses were switching from mainframes to desktop-based systems that require C 
language. After DeVry adjusted its curriculum, businesses responded by hiring more of 
its graduates. Although industry does not dictate DeVry's curriculum, the school must 
measure success and failure by its placement rate.</P>
<P>	The institute's educational audit is exhaustive. DeVry's central headquarters 
evaluates randomly selected writing samples from students on every campus twice a year 
in order to ensure that writing skills remain high. The institute also administers 
standardized tests in electronics to be certain that technical skills are not dropping. 
Finally, administrators also investigate courses with unusual grade distribution.</P>
<P>	The best evidence of the quality of DeVry's curriculum is the on-the-job success 
of its graduates. Bill Buglewicz, a senior manufacturing manager at KLA Instruments, 
recruits at six of the campuses every year. "DeVry students have a great work ethic, 
higher motivation, and initiative," Buglewicz says. "The courseload, in particular the 
exhaustive lab work, makes them wonderful thinkers and troubleshooters."</P> 
<P>	Gary Nuzzi, a 1983 graduate, says the lab work helped him and 1963 graduate 
Bill Blethen develop a revolutionary lighting system that won an Academy Award for 
technical achievement last year. The portable strobe light allows movie cameras to 
capture detail at high speed. "The education was, at times, very challenging, but very 
practical," Nuzzi adds.</P> 

<H3>The Bottom Line</H3>
<P>	Most remarkable, however, is that DeVry makes a profit. By defining its mission 
narrowly, the school has perfected its product and minimized waste. DeVry's cost-saving 
efforts are immediately evident. There are no ivy-laden academic halls or rolling greens. 
Rather, each DeVry campus holds its classes in an office building that is usually 
surrounded by a parking lot. In such a modern facility, little space is wasted, maintenance 
costs are moderate, and classrooms can accommodate professors from various 
departments. And the school runs three cycles of classes--morning, afternoon, and 
evening--to use the space more efficiently. The institute does not own any dormitories. 
Instead, DeVry leases housing near its campuses from local landlords and sublets it to the 
students at a modest profit.</P>
<P>	DeVry also holds down costs by maintaining a narrow academic focus. DeVry 
does not fund any sports teams or clubs that are not directly related to job placement; on 
some campuses, students independently run intramural leagues by securing outside 
sponsors. "We are not trying to be all things to all people," says Kathy Perdue, head of 
the accounting department at the Atlanta campus. "We figured out what we do best, 
concentrating on the academics to get jobs, not filling social needs."</P>
<P>	The school does not grant tenure to any of its professors, allowing it to respond 
quickly to fluctuating enrollments. Moreover, DeVry is not a research or publishing 
institution, so faculty members carry teaching loads two to three times that of other 
college professors. Finally, since the school operates at full capacity, even in the 
summers, professors are expected to work as they would in private industry: year-round.
<P>	DeVry maximizes tuition revenue by actively recruiting students through 
television and newspaper advertising, direct mail, and recruiters. A traveling sales force 
of 200 visits high schools and Army bases throughout North America, while another 100 
salespeople respond to applicants who call DeVry in response to advertising. DeVry's 
$15-million advertising campaign promotes its focus on careers, profiling graduates with 
senior positions in prominent companies like Coca-Cola.</P>
<P>	The individual cost-saving measures add up. The price tag of a DeVry education 
is $6,015 for two semesters, or $26,730 for the complete degree. By comparison, a four-
year degree at public, non-research universities in the same states where DeVry operates 
costs much more in tuition and taxpayer subsidies: $40,148 in California, for instance, 
and $35,440 in Georgia.</P>
<P>	As an accredited school, DeVry participates in all the same financial aid programs 
as public schools. DeVry's loan default rate is 17 percent--better than many for-profit 
trade schools and far below the government's intervention zone of 25 to 30 percent. 
Industry analysts note that the institute's job placement record and bachelor's degree 
program distinguishes it from trade schools.</P>
<P>	For-profit schools such as DeVry are a model for the future of university 
education. As more adults return to school later in life, they will find they prefer the no-
nonsense DeVry degree, which can be finished in three years. Currently the average age 
of DeVry students is 26. In addition, the number of high-school graduates is expected to 
keep rising through 2013. Combine that statistic with downsizing in the military, for-
profit education's top rival for high-school graduates, and DeVry seems to enjoy a rosy 
outlook. In fact, the results are already beginning to show: Enrollment was up 4 percent 
this year, and the company added two new campuses. "Frankly, the demand is growing 
quicker than our ability to supply it," says Norman Levine, DeVry's chief financial 
officer. And two other for-profit college-education companies announced initial public 
offerings this year.</P>
<P>	Despite DeVry's proven track record in securing jobs for working-class students, 
bureaucrats may prevent the school from expanding. In New York City, for example, the 
state's department of education has not yet approved DeVry's 1993 accreditation 
application. Once the department okays the school's academic standards, government 
analysts will determine DeVry's impact on established local schools. Every college in 
New York City will be invited to comment on DeVry's entrance into the market. If area 
schools fear DeVry will steal students from their tuition rolls, they can urge the 
department to reject the application. The Education Department's Bureau of Planning will 
also analyze whether the local job market can accommodate the future DeVry graduates. 
Department officials note that, due to understaffing, it normally takes several years for a 
school's 300-page application to be approved.</P>
<P>	Even skeptics of for-profit education concede that public schools and private non-
profits are unable to expand to meet the growing demand. Public universities would 
require greater tax subsidies to support a larger student base, and private non-profits 
would have to raise even more through alumni giving. "Time and time again, we have 
seen that the healthiest and best systems in the world involve private enterprise 
competing," says Keller. "We're the future of education."</P>

<p>
Suppose you are 20 years old and earning $10,000 a year. You and your employer are paying $1,240 a year in Social Security taxes. That's 12.4 percent of your hard-earned income, for benefits that you will never see.<p>
Suppose instead you could invest that same $1,240, as well as an additional $2.50 a week. By the time you are 65, thanks to the magic of compound interest, you would be a millionaire. You would be assured a comfortable retirement.<p>
This isn't a game-show fantasy. This isn't a lottery jackpot. It is a realistic goal. But unlocking this economic opportunity means revolutionizing Social Security. Every American who earns $10,000 a year or more can become a millionaire over the course of one working lifetime45 years. By the year 2000, there will be over 100 million Americans who fall in this category.<p>
In a recent survey, Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 reported they are more likely to see a UFO (46 percent) than their Social Security benefits (28 percent). They're right. The Social Security trust fund starts running out of money, under current projections, in the year 2013. If you're 20 today, that's when you turn 38. By the year 2030, when you turn 55, the fund will be short $200 billion a year and be unable to meet one quarter of its obligations. By the year 2042, when you turn 67 and reach your so-called normal retirement age, the fund will have an accumulated debt of $4.7 trillion. I'm not making this up. This isn't science fiction. These numbers come from the 1994 report of the trustees of the Social Security system.<p>
You could get all your benefits, of course, if there were an enormous tax increase for your children and grandchildren. According to the Social Security trustees, honoring existing promises for Social Security and Medicare benefits will require a rise in payroll taxes from the current level of 15.3 percent to 25.7 percent in 2030. But that simply isn't going to happen. Americans are already overtaxed. Do you think they'll put up with 25 percent payroll taxes, and federal income taxes, plus state and local taxes on top of that?<p>
Some politicians will tell you not to worry: Social Security is building up a big trust fund that will take care of all those promises. By the end of this year, the trust fund will have $475 billion in assetson paper. By 2020, there will be $3 trillion on paper. The trouble is, when the program needs the money, the money will already have been spent on everything the federal government spends money on. To redeem its IOUs to the trust fund, the federal government will have to borrow money or raise taxesby over $36,000 per familyjust as if the trust fund had no assets at all.<p>
So you and your employer are now paying one eighth of your income to pay for the Social Security benefits of current retirees, and to build up an illusory trust fund. Meanwhile, your own retirement is in jeopardy.<p>
No wonder younger Americans fear they are on a treadmill. No wonder there is so much trepidation about the future of the country. No wonder we have a savings crisis: our savings are being spent. No wonder most Americans now say their children will enjoy less opportunity than they do. <p>
It doesn't have to be this way. Social Security can be saved without raising taxes, and without lowering the benefits or cost-of-living adjustments of existing retirees. Social Security can be saved in a way that will open up opportunity for younger peopleso that their standard of living will be better than that of their parents and grandparents. If we use the principles of democratic capitalism to reform Social Security, the 20-year-old making the minimum wage can become a millionaire by the time he or she retires.<p>
Most Americans are on a treadmill because they have but one source of income: wages. The way to get ahead is to earn income from capital. Money makes money. With capital, you can retire in comfort and bequeath a nest egg to your children.<p>
Here is the beauty of capitalism. Any American currently earning $12,580 or more pays $30 a week, or $1,560 a year, into Social Security. Imagine that, beginning at age 20, you invest that $30 a week at market rates. When you retire, you'll be a millionaire. Whoever earns at least the minimum wage can become a millionaire in 45 years.<p>
The secret is compound interest. Let's assume a long-term return on your investments of 8 percent a year. (This is a prudent assumption; the annual return on the Standard & Poor's 500 over the past 70 years, including the Great Depression, is actually 10.19 percent.) If you can save $30 a week ($1,560 a year), after 10 years the value of your portfolio is $29,000. After 20 years, it is $110,000. After 30 years, it is $318,000. Forty years$822,000. And 45 yearsthe normal working lifetime$1.3 million. After 50 years, if you work until age 70, the value of your portfolio crescendoes to an estimated $2 million.<p>
You wouldn't exactly be a millionaire in today's dollars. If we adjust for inflation of about 4 percent a year, your portfolio of $1.3 million after 45 years would be closer to $230,000. That's still a larger nest egg than most working Americans even dream of. With that amount of capital, you could purchase an annuity at age 65 that would give you $18,256 a year (in today's dollars) during your retirement years.<p>
The way to save Social Security is to make the magic of compound interest work for its beneficiaries. I've been developing a proposal that will save Social Securityand enable 100 million Americans to become millionaires. The plan keeps Social Security as a mandatory, redistributive savings program, but it converts the program from the current pay-as-you-go system to a funded system, in which individuals own retirement portfolios at Social Security and choose private investment managers. Individuals would be allowed to set aside portions of their Social Security payments, together with additional voluntary contributions, in their own personal accounts. They could use their accounts for retirement income and pass on the capital tax free to their children. The plan has four basic elements:<p>
Pay existing obligations to all current retirees. Social Security benefits would be paid to all existing retirees, as promised, without changes, and without reductions.<p>
Divide Social Security into two tiers. If you are working now, you and your employer would continue to pay existing Social Security taxes of 12.4 percent on the first $61,200 of your income. Some of that would go to pay the benefits of existing recipients. Some of your payments would go into your own personal account. Payroll taxes would not rise from their current level. They would be cut by 2 percentage points around the year 2040.<p>
The benefits of current retirees would be paid out of the first tiercurrent payroll taxes. When they retire, current workers would draw benefits from two Social Security sources: income from future payroll taxes and income from their personal retirement accounts.<p>
Create personal investment and retirement accounts for the second tier of Social Security. Every worker who earns at least $4,000 would have his own IRA-like account with Social Security. (Unlike an IRA, you could use your account only for retirement, and could not withdraw from it earlier.) The first $500 that you and your employer pay into Social Security every year would be automatically deposited in your personal retirement account. You could increase the deposit in your personal retirement account by up to $3,000 per year by making voluntary contributions that would be matched by Social Security taxes you are already paying. The size of the match would vary according to income.<p>
Here's an example: If you earn $10,000 a year and you contribute $1,240 per year, the first $500 of this money would be paid into your personal account. If you add a savings match of $130, the Social Security program will deposit an additional $610 of tax money you are already paying into the fund into your personal retirement account, for a total of $1,240 per year. In 45 years, your portfolio will be $1,026,524 and you're a millionaire.<p>
If you are making $50,000, you might wish to put the maximum of $3,000 per year into your personal account at Social Security; $1,500 of the $3,000 comes from taxes you are already paying, and $1,500 comes from additional funds you save from your income, that is, from a personal-savings match. In 45 years, your portfolio would be $2.5 million.<p>
This money would be in your name, you would own it, and you would be in charge of picking an investment manager to invest it for you. Social Security would set up a corporation whose only purpose is to certify and approve private-sector money managers. (Criteria would include performance and experience in money management, years in business, and certfiably good character.) You would pick your investment manager from this list, and could switch to a different one any time you wanted. This sort of system is already working well in Chile.<p>
Use your capital account to increase your retirement income, and pass on your assets tax free to your children. When you retire, you would have two attractive choices of what to do with your capital account. One would be to use income from your capital (5 percent a year) for your retirement benefitsand then, when you die, to pass on your entire capital account tax free to your children or heirs. The second would be to purchase an annuity with your capital account, and receive higher retirement benefits during your lifetime but not pass any assets on to your children or heirs. <p>
Based on current life-expectancy charts, when you reach 65 you can expect to live, on average, to age 83, an additional 18 years. With an annuity you could currently receive an estimated 7.9 percent return per year.<p>
If you have a small portfolio when you retire, your Social Security benefits would be paid as promised out of the income from your capital (5 percent a year), as well as payroll taxes from future workers. Suppose, for instance, you have $100,000 in your personal account, and promised Social Security benefits of $10,000 a year. You would receive $5,000 in Social Security income from your capital, and $5,000 through the regular payroll-tax base. When you die, you would then be able to pass your retirement assets on to your children or heirs.<p>
As portfolios grow through compound interest, however, tens of millions of retirees would have the opportunity to increase their benefits. Twenty-year-olds today earning $10,000 a year will retire at age 65 in 2040. If the wages keep up with expected inflation, their final wages will be $15,236. Their promised present-law Social Security benefits will be $9,121 per year (a 59.9 percent replacement level). If payroll taxes are not increased, Social Security benefits would be reduced 24.4 percentfrom $9,121 to $6,892 per year.<p>
Under the Beard system, these retirees would have $1,026,524 in their personal accounts with Social Security ($182,769 in today's money). If they choose an annuity, their Social Security benefits will be $14,511 per year$5,390 higher than present-law Social Security promises. If they wish to pass the $1,026,524 tax free onto their children or heirs, their benefits will be $9,138.<p>
It would be enormously expensive to move from a pay-as-you-go to a funded Social Security system. Annual deposits into personal capital accounts would begin at over $100 billion per year and climb to over $200 billion per year (in today's dollars) by 2040. And this would be in addition to the massive deficits already projected for Social Security beginning in 2013. How can America possibly afford these expenses? The money would come from five sources. <p>
Over time, the largest increase in Social Security revenue would come from the income of the new capital accounts. By 2040, after 45 years in operation, the estimated value of retirees' capital accounts in today's dollars would be $8 trillion, almost double the current value of the private pension system. If we assume 5 percent income from capital to pay retirement benefits, retirees would receive over $400 billion every year from their capital (in today's dollars).<p>
Social Security payroll taxes currently exceed payments by about $25 billion a year. This surplus would go into the personal capital accounts. So would the $475 billion in assets that have supposedly accumulated in the Social Security trust fund. Those assets don't really exist, but workers have paid extra taxes on the federal government's promise that the surplus would go to a trust fund. Amortized over 20 years, the trust fund could be drawn down at the rate of $30 billion a year. In practice, this will mean that other federal expenditures will have to be cut by the same amount, bonds of $30 billion will have to sold to the public, or taxes will have to be raised by $30 billion.<p>
Some $60 billion a year would be saved through a special debt instrument we call the Liberty Bond. The Liberty Bond would be a voluntary 30-year interest-paying instrument. After 30 years, heirs and designees would receive principal and interest tax free. It would be marketed to retirees who do not need all their benefits to enjoy a comfortable retirement, and would gladly forego some of their benefits if they were sure this would help their children.<p>
I anticipate that five to 10 million Americans would purchase Liberty Bonds. Millions of retirees would gladly set aside $1,000 per year to create a $25,000 tax-free education fund for their children and grandchildren. Many would even set aside their full benefits$10,000 to $15,000 a year for their remaining lifetimeto build a nest egg for their children. The government could create a cap of $95 billion per year on the sale of Liberty Bonds, so that no more money is deferred than necessary.<p>
To make the numbers work, benefits will also have to be reduced for future retirees. There are two fair ways to do this. One is to raise the normal retirement age from the current 67 to 70, a change that can be phased in gradually. We are all living longer and we are in better health as we age. It is fair to extend the normal retirement age as our own lifetimes are extended. And in any case, with individual capital accounts in Social Security and the power of compound interest, Americans will want to work longerbecause they'll have the opportunity to build up even larger nest eggs.<p>
The second way to reduce Social Security benefits fairly is to reduce indexation for real wage growth. It is important to index Social Security for inflation. Once you retire, the cost of living continues to rise as a result of inflation. Without cost-of-living adjustments, the purchasing power of your benefits will decrease an estimated 4 percent per year. But Social Security is indexed again for real wage growthabout 1 percent a year. This is icing on the cake for retirees. It is not necessary, and it could be reduced by 50 percent.<p>
The current pay-as-you-go system is an economic, political, and cultural dead end. It will force us to raise taxes, and then raise taxes again to pay promised benefits, or to cut benefits and then cut benefits again to avoid mammoth tax increases. It will create no new capital opportunities. It will drain a growing amount of America's resourcesour savings and investmentout of the private sector. A shrinking private sector damages our ability to create new jobs and new industriesour future strength.<p>
The current system is also a recipe for conflict. If America is a shrinking pie, the young generation and older generation will fight over the crumbs. <p>
Under a funded, two-tier system, we would cut payroll taxes 2 percentage points in 2040 and then cut them again. As the system matures, we would increase retirement benefits by 25 to 35 percent. We would create 100 million millionaires. We would amass unprecedented savings and investment in America by opening the doors of capital ownership to most Americans. We would create a capital pool that no other nation in the world can equal, and use this investment to finance the high-paying jobs and new industries of tomorrow.<p>
By making every American a capitalist, a funded Social Security system would unleash new economic growth, raise the standard of living of our children, and return America to its historic role as the country of tomorrow, with its best days yet to come.

<title>Why Congress Should Stop Federalizing Private Health Insurance - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>WHY CONGRESS SHOULD STOP FEDERALIZING PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE</h3>
By Carrie Gavora<br>
Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder Update No. 280<br>
September 26, 1996<br>
<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A bipartisan coalition in Congress is set to impose -- for the third time in as many weeks -- yet another federal mandate on private health insurance. Traditionally, insurance regulation is a matter of state responsibility. Nonetheless, Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Representative <a href="http://www.house.gov/ganske/">Greg Ganske</a> (R-IA) are sponsoring legislation to prohibit private insurers from imposing contractual restrictions on physicians' written or oral communications with patients regarding their condition or treatment options. The sponsors in the Senate are seeking to attach this legislation to the FY 1997 omnibus appropriations bill to be voted on before the 104th Congress adjourns.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Wyden bill would prohibit the contractual restrictions -- called "gag clauses" -- by which certain managed care companies limit participating doctors' communications with their patients regarding their patients' condition or treatment options. Some managed care plans use these gag clauses to control costs by limiting referrals to specialists. Many physicians and patients consider these clauses an interference with the doctor-patient relationship and thus unethical.<sup>1</sup> The Wyden bill would prohibit such clauses and assess civil monetary penalties up to $25,000 for each violation by an insuring entity.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The Wrong Solution to a Real Problem.</b> The Wyden-Ganske initiative addresses a genuine concern among doctors and patients alike: their ability to communicate openly with one another about health and treatment options. At the same time, however, Congress should realize that these insurance arrangements are private employment contracts between insurers and participating doctors and are designed to "manage" the cost of care. For this reason, they are attractive to many private employers providing health insurance, though often not to patients. The problem is that under federal tax-supported employment-based insurance, patients normally have only the choice of plans and physicians that employers give them. The solution thus is not to add another layer of regulation to a system in which the patient has little power to choose plans, but to remove the bias in the tax code that effectively prevents patients from leaving plans that are not run in their interests. Moreover, to the extent plans should be regulated, that is the domain of the states, not Washington.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
By enacting such federal mandates, including a clearly desirable and politically popular measure to preserve open dialogue between doctor and patients, Congress is inviting even more government control of America's health care system. Representative Rosa DeLauro (D-CT), for example, is drafting legislation to require private insurance companies to pay for "minimum" hospital stays of two days for a mastectomy and one day for a lymph node removal unless doctor and patient "decide less time is appropriate." Congress thus is getting into the business of benefit setting and legislating, in effect, the kinds and conditions, and even the duration, of medical treatments and procedures Americans must have. This is far beyond either its constitutional or its professional competence.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In commenting on the recently adopted federal health mandates, <I>The Washington Post</I> warns: "Because the estimated cost of these [proposals] is low, the sponsors say the question isn't real, not now at any rate. But sooner or later as Congress yields to the understandable impulses to help people who need it without, of course, appropriating funds, it becomes real. . . . What's troubling about the agreements that have just been reached is not so much what they themselves actually do as what they portend."<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>More Federal Bureaucracy.</b> The bureaucratic and regulatory requirements to implement the Wyden-Ganske policy could be substantial. According to Multinational Business Services, Inc. (MBS), a Washington-based regulatory consulting firm which studied the regulatory impact of Representative Ganske's legislation, <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.2976:">H.R. 2976</a>, the measure would require another new bureau within the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), the federal agency that runs Medicare and Medicaid. In 1993, according to the MBS report, there were 345,562,800 contracts between physicians and HMOs; under the proposed measure, at a minimum, between 0.25 and 0.5 percent of those contracts would be investigated for violations. According to MBS, the bureaucracy required to investigate complaints would consist of five divisions with staffing needs of between 3,640 and 7,142 full-time employees (FTEs): a Policy Unit (21 FTE); a Contract Review Unit (97 FTE); an Investigations Unit (between 2,354 and 4,708 FTEs based on complaint range of 0.25 to 0.5%); an Administrative Adjudication Unit (between 1,148 and 2,296 FTEs); and an Appellate Review Unit (20 FTE). Assuming a 0.5 percent complaint rate, HCFA would have to conduct 1,727,814 investigations per year. MBS insists that this is an "extremely conservative" estimate because it is based only on the HMO population, does not include Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) contracts, and assumes a complaint rate of less than 1 percent.<sup>3</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>More Lawsuits.</b> MBS also says that such a policy change would create incentives for future litigation by doctors and patients against insurers, even when legitimate issues arise regarding appropriate authorization for treatment or referrals: "Accordingly, providers would have the incentive to use the filing of complaints under [this bill] as leverage against plans. Even when confronted with patently unreasonable complaints, health plans could, in many instances face the high cost of defending claims through the investigation, administration adjudication and judicial appeals levels; and the threat of the imposition of multiple penalties arising from multiple communications arising out of single disputes."<sup>4</sup> In addition, "this leverage to physicians would be paid for by the taxpayers of the United States who would have to finance HCFA's new bureaucracy with their tax dollars. . . . Thus, taxpayer dollars and patient premiums would be the linchpins providing physicians with unfair leverage."<sup>5</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Higher Health Care Costs for Workers and Their Families.</b> Under this legislation, the federal government would investigate and adjudicate on behalf of physicians. The insurer would be responsible for picking up the cost of defending these claims and would, in turn, pass that cost onto the consumer in the form of higher premiums. Indeed, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that this legislation would cost federal taxpayers $90 million between 1997 and 2002. This figure, however, does not take into account the administrative cost of investigating violations of the anti-gag clause measure--costs which, judging from the MBS report, could be significant. In a letter to House Commerce Committee Chairman William Bliley (R-VA), the CBO states that "the prohibition on medical communications is sufficiently broad that the bill might prevent health plans from imposing any requirements on medical communications. Depending on how courts interpreted the bill and on the level of enforcement performed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, this limitation could be more important--and costly--that the prohibition of gag rules alone."<sup>6</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Empowering Consumers.</b> Two years ago, Congress and the American people rejected the wholesale attempt by the Clinton Administration to have the government dictate what kind of health care Americans get and how much they should pay for it. Apparently lacking a vision of what kind of health care system it wants, some Members of Congress -- measure by measure, benefit by benefit -- are federalizing and standardizing private health insurance. In effect, they are laying the foundation for the kind of Clinton-style health care system, replete with new bureaucracy and federal regulatory controls, that they once steadfastly opposed. But adopting regulatory expansions on a piecemeal basis does not make the end result more palatable.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress is right to be concerned about the rapid transformation in employer-based health insurance, especially if needed care is being limited or denied. Rather than move steadily in the direction of greater government control of America's health care system, reducing the freedom of doctors and patients alike, Congress should take steps to create a system of consumer choice and competition as proposed by the Heritage Foundation and many others. The best way to rectify inequities in the health care system, including the practice by which some corporations shortchange consumers, is to enable consumers to walk away from a physician or health plan that does not meet their needs.

      As this audience knows only too well, growing concerns about
health care costs and poor access have stimulated the development of
multiple health care reform proposals.  Proposals from members of the
House and Senate, medical specialty societies, public interest groups,
and organizations such as The Heritage Foundation, to name a few
sources, are piling up on the public policy table at a rapid clip.
Yet when all of these proposals are distilled, three models stand out:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>     
 "Single-payer," in which the government runs the health care
      system in one way or another;
<P>
      "Play-or-pay," which mandates employer financial contributions
      to expand access; and
<P>
      "Consumer choice," which involves the use of tax credits or
      vouchers to give consumers a direct financial incentive to
      behave as responsible buyers of health care -- or in other
      words, to put market incentives into the health care system.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
      I support the version of the Consumer Choice approach which is
being actively considered in Maryland as a statewide demonstration.  I
believe it can work in Maryland, and I believe it offers a model for
the nation as well, because unlike the other approaches, it achieves
four critical health care reform goals:
<P>
First, it provides universal and continuous access for all to standard
      insurance benefits without regard to employment or health
      status;
<P>
Second, it moderates costs by using competition to pressure insurers
      and health care providers to operate efficiently, and to put
      more purchasing power in the hands of consumers;
<P>
Third, it is budget neutral and uses an equitable financing
      methodology; and
<P>
Fourth, it preserves what is good about our system  -- a system that
      fosters competition and innovation, encourages the development
      of technology, and allows Americans to keep what they value so
      highly, the right to choose doctors they trust, without long
      waits for care.
<P>
      All four goals must be achieved if we are to see true reform in
this country.  The piecemeal solutions of the past simply have not
worked.  In fact, they have exacerbated our problems.
<P>
      I contend that neither the single-payer  nor the play-or-pay
approach offers viable solutions for fundamental reform.  The single-
payer model forces cost control through global budgeting by price
regulation and capping the volume of services.  As in every other
country where this has been tried, the inevitable result is rationing
and waiting lines.
<P>
      I also believe that this model will discourage innovation in the
development of new medicines and technologies.  Furthermore, consumer
research repeatedly shows that while most Americans want reform, they
do not want a system run by the government.
<P>
      The play-or-pay approach leaves one-third of the uninsured
population uncovered, including many unemployed and part-time workers. 
This model also puts an enormous financial burden on employers,
without offering them any hope of reducing their health care benefit
expenses and becoming more competitive.
<P>
      Finally, both approaches would require a substantial infusion of
funds into a system that already costs too much, at a time when the
country is staggering under the weight of our deficit.  Neither
approach would encourage competition or put market forces to work to
moderate cost increases.
<P>
      It probably goes without saying, that one of the reasons that
health care costs are consistently higher than the Consumer Price
Index is that the end users of the health care services, consumers,
and those who order health care services, health care providers, have
been shielded from the economic consequences of their choices by
insurance.
<P>
      Imagine what would happen if everyone in this country, for the
price of an annual premium, had a food card that provided access to
any grocery store and covered costs, with a deductible or co-payment,
of whatever food products the store manager recommended.  The lack of
marketplace incentives surely would result in a steady escalation of
food prices.
<P>
      Ten Points.  Simply put, we need marketplace incentives in the
health care system that put the consumer in the driver's seat.  The
Consumer Choice Health Plan being debated in Maryland does that.  In
this model:
<P>
1)    All Marylanders, including those currently served by Medicaid,
      and excluding only those already covered by Medicare, would
      purchase a comprehensive standard insurance program from a
      qualified carrier.  Purchase of supplemental insurance would be
      optional.
<P>
2)    Consumers would purchase the standard insurance from their
      employers or shop on the open market.  Those who are unemployed
      could obtain insurance from designated public agencies or
      brokers.
<P>
3)    The standard insurance would be similar to comprehensive
      programs available on the market today and would include
      preventive as well as acute care benefits.
<P>
4)    Issuance of the standard insurance would be guaranteed and
      renewable without regard to health status or claims experience. 
      In other words, no more exclusions on pre-existing conditions,
      and no more loss of insurance when you change jobs.
<P>
5)    All Marylanders, not just those at lower income levels, would
      receive a refundable tax credit or voucher to use toward the
      purchase of the standard insurance.
<P>
6)    The tax credit would be progressive and the amount would be
      geared to pay 100 percent of the estimated cost of the standard
      plan for those below the poverty level, and scaled down to where
      it would provide 50 percent of the cost of the standard plan for
      families with incomes over $100,000 (See Table 1).
<P>
7)    The tax deduction for health care benefits received by
      individuals would be eliminated.  Today, high income individuals
      benefit from a hidden tax subsidy because they do not pay taxes
      on the value of health care benefits paid by their employers. 
      The value of this subsidy is $65 billion nationally and $1
      billion in Maryland.
<P>
          It is important to note that in the Maryland Plan, the
      value of the progressive tax credit is calculated to offset
      taxes in a way that families earning less than $50,000 will
      break even or gain financially from this proposal, assuming the
      employer does not contribute anything to the Plan.  If the
      employer holds the employee harmless, which I believe most will
      do, even those earning $100,000 or more will break even (See
      Tables 2 and 3).
<P>
8)    Consumer protection would be built in.  In order to do business
      in the state, carriers would have to be qualified.  To be
      qualified they would have to offer the standard insurance, meet
      certain financial criteria including caps on administrative
      expenses, and be proficient in managing the cost and quality of
      care.
<P>
9)    The workplace would remain the focus for purchasing health care
      benefits for most consumers.  All employers would offer a
      standard and a supplemental insurance program to their
      employees, but financial contribution to the plan would be
      optional, just as it is today.
<P>
10)   Employers would all pay a 4 percent payroll tax as their only
      mandatory contribution to health care benefits.  This is
      significantly less than the 8 percent to 10 percent of payroll
      they are paying today.  For those employers who are not
      contributing today, it would provide an affordable way for them
      to participate.
<P>
      Let's look at how this would work in an employment setting. 
First, an employer would arrange through a qualified carrier or broker
to offer a standard and supplemental plan at group rates to its
employees, and decide the level of its financial contribution.  We
estimate that employer savings will be between $500 and $1,000 per
employee, depending on the level of health care benefits currently
provided (See Table 4).
<P>
      An employer who wanted to maintain the same benefits program
that was in place before consumer choice would already be financially
ahead of the game, because the cost to the employer to fund the
identical program will be reduced by the amount of employee tax
credits now available to defray the cost.
<P>
      Employer savings could be passed on to employees as increased
wages, invested, or retained as earnings or profit.
<P>
      Employees, knowing the value of their tax credit and how much
the employer would pay (in other words, how much they have to spend),
would decide whether to purchase the standard benefit from the
employer or search for a better deal on the open market, as well as
whether to purchase any supplemental benefits.
<P>
      Value-Conscious Consumers.  Comparison shopping would be greatly
simplified because the standard insurance benefit would be just that
-- standard.  When consumers know how much money they have to spend
and can truly comparison shop, they will be far more value-conscious. 
Insurers will be forced to offer insurance products at or below the
target price associated with the full value of the tax credit to stay
in business.   (Just as an aside, I can tell you from our experience
at Blue Cross and Blue Shield with consumers who purchase insurance
directly, that they are very value-conscious and they put enormous
pressure on us to deliver good insurance values.)
<P>
      Under the competitive pressure generated by the Consumer Choice
Health Plan, qualified carriers will in turn contract with health care
providers in organized delivery systems that can demonstrate the
ability to deliver quality care in an efficient and cost-conscious
manner.  This is managed care in action.  Obviously, selective
provider contracting is happening today, but it will intensify and
become much more sophisticated.
<P>
      Consumer demand for value also will put enormous pressure on the
entire system -- health care providers and insurers alike -- to find
ways to eliminate waste in the system.  The Consumer Choice Health
Plan also assumes the adoption of a uniform bill and installation of
electronic networks throughout the state to eliminate the cost and
burden of today's paperbound processes.  The Plan also assumes that
there will be caps on administrative expenditures.
<P>
      Sources of Funds.  One of the cornerstones of the Consumer
Choice Health Plan is its funding mechanism.  There is enough money in
the system today to expand basic insurance to all and to fund the tax
credit.  The funds just haven't been allocated equitably.  The five
principal sources of funds are as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Individual income taxes associated with the elimination of the
      tax exclusion for health care benefits as well as the deduction
      for out-of-pocket medical expenses.
<P>
      A 4 percent employer payroll tax.  As I said before, employers
      who contribute to health care benefits today pay between 8
      percent and 10 percent of the payroll.
<P>
      Increased corporate tax revenues on any increased profits earned
      to the extent that employee tax credits reduce the level of
      employer expenses for health care benefits.
<P>
      Federal and state public funds currently spent for the acute
      care part of Medicaid and other public health programs.
<P>
      Uncompensated care dollars no longer needed to cover hospital
      bad debt.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
      It all adds up to a program which is budget neutral (See Table
5).  It can be done.  The math works for Maryland and it works for the
nation.
<P>
      Can the Consumer Choice Health Plan be successful?  Yes, I
believe it can.  The current Federal Employees Health Benefits Program
is structured somewhat like the Consumer Choice Health Plan, in that
it offers a specified amount of financial contribution which is known
to federal employees together with wide choice of plans.
<P>
      I believe that the success of the FEHBP program in moderating
costs can be attributed in large part to the design which gives
consumers a clear role in making their purchase decisions.
<P>
      As you can see, this proposal varies in significant ways from
that proposed by President Bush and somewhat from that proposed by The
Heritage Foundation.  The Bush proposal provides a tax credit for
individuals at the lower income scale, but offers no explicit funding
mechanism.  It also continues the tax deduction for employer-based
insurance, which insulates consumers from the market.
<P>
      Employer Participation. The Heritage proposal goes much further,
by repealing the tax deduction for health care benefits, and imposing
an individual mandate, as well as expanding the tax credit to a wider
income band.  However, the Maryland Plan relies much more heavily on
employers to participate through the requirement that all employers
offer insurance as well as help finance the tax credit through the 4
percent payroll tax.
<P>
      In conclusion, I believe that the strength of the Maryland
Consumer Choice Health Plan is that it achieves all four reform goals
in an integrated way.  It provides universal access to a standard
benefit which eliminates the need for a separate public program for
acute care Medicaid.
<P>
      The Consumer Health Plan brings competitive pressures into the
system to control costs.  It reallocates funding equitably so that it
is budget neutral.  And it preserves what is good about our system.
<P>
      Solid and Equitable. Obviously there are aspects of this
proposal that are controversial and details that are subject to
further discussion.  But I believe that the principles inherent in the
Plan are solid and equitable.  The truth is that fundamental reform
requires everyone to give a little to make it work.
<P>
      If the problems of the system are looked at from an integrated
rather than a piecemeal perspective, I think we will have a real shot
at success.
<P>
      At this point, Delegate Casper Taylor and others are working
hard in Maryland to implement the Consumer Choice Health Plan as a
statewide demonstration.  We strongly believe that experimentation at
the statewide level is the way to go because of the dramatic changes
that potentially could occur with a significant part of the national
economy under a permanent change of such scope.
<P>
      It is important to note that when other countries moved to a
form of national health system, health care spending was approximately
3 percent to 4 percent of the GNP.  Ours is now in excess of 12
percent.  We cannot afford to make errors that would dramatically
affect our economy in a negative way.
<P>
      Let me end by quoting Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who said:  "The
test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of
those who have too much; it is whether we provide enough for those who
have too little."  Consumer Choice does just that in the health care
arena.

<p>
It was a horrible tragedy, as much for the mental images it generated as for the death toll. On September 3, 1991, at around 8 a.m., a fire broke out at a chicken plant in Hamlet, North Carolina.  As the grease fire started on a chicken fryer and spread quickly inside the Imperial Foods Products building, workers tried desperately to escape the smoke and flames, clawing at locked exit doors in panic. Twenty-five Imperial employees didn't make it. Fifty-six more were injured in the blaze. The event made national headlines and attracted everyone from network news reporters to Jesse Jackson, who visited in an attempt to link the chicken-plant tragedy to the national civil-rights movement. "I see the same faces here that I saw in Memphis, Tennessee, with Dr. [Martin Luther] King," he said. "Just basic, humble people who want to work and get a fair day's wages for a fair day's work."<p>
Furious voices denounced state and federal safety inspectors, as well as the state's business community. During 1992 and 1993, the Hamlet fire became the cause clbre of politicians and activists seeking tougher workplace-safety laws in Congress, including a greatly expanded Occupational Safety and Health Administration and new mandates on businesses. As Hamlet became a national symbol for corporate irresponsibility in workplace safety, one small but significant detail escaped the notice of many in Congress and the media. Those exit doors that sealed the deathtrap had been ordered closed and locked by the federal government.<p>
The problem with the Imperial plant, a U.S. Department of Agriculture poultry inspector had said the previous June, was flies. "Both doors at the [trash] compactor was [sic] open when I arrived at 8:45 p.m.," the inspector wrote in a deficiency report. "Several flies [were] observed in all areas of the plant." Imperial's response, also written into the deficiency report, was to promise that the outside doors "will be kept locked." The inspector verified that corrective action had taken place.<p>
Imperial Foods was hardly blameless in the tragedyvarious safety problems existed at the time of the firebut heavy-handed government regulation was also partly responsible. The chicken plant was one of the few employers in a poor, rural community. It ran on a very thin margin, using an old building and struggling every week to keep production going. Installing state-of-the-art alarm doors at the side and rear of the plant was an expensive proposition. When forced by federal edict to make a tradeoff between food quality and worker safety, plant managers chose the former, with disastrous results.<p>
Fast forward to 1995. A new Republican majority in Congress, intent on balancing the federal budget, has targeted the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for cuts. In an attempt to defend OSHA, the Clinton administration announced a plan in May to make compliance less onerous to business and to judge safety inspectors on the basis of safety records for companies they oversee, not on the number of citations they write. "This is the new face of OSHA," said Elaine Kamarck, senior policy advisor for Vice President Gore and director of his "reinventing government" initiative.<p>
But a Congress committed not only to budget savings but also to sound policymaking should go far beyond redesigning OSHA's inspection program or, as some GOP lawmakers have suggested, simply cutting its budget in half. There is no need for the federal government to inspect American workplaces, issue regulations, and fine employers for violating federal safety rules, and the attempt to do so has accomplished virtually nothing for American workers except burden their employers with regulations.<p>
A 1991 study by Wayne B. Gray of the National Bureau of Economic Research found that OSHA regulations have "significantly reduced productivity growth in the U.S.," even more than those from the Environmental Protection Agency. Some OSHA standards have put a search for completely risk-free workplaces above common sense. Benzene standards, for example, have cost firms and consumers $23 million per life saved; arsenic standards, $24 million. Standards for asbestos, EDB, and formaldehyde have also cost many millions of dollars per life saved. These huge sums might better be spent publicly or privately on other measures that save lives at dramatically lower costs. Screening programs for cervical and colon cancer, for example, cost about $50,000 per life saved, while measures to increase highway safetysuch as improving lighting, upgrading guard rails, installing median barriers, and improving bridgescost between $100,000 and $200,000 per life saved.<p>
OSHA has required employers to label machines and substances at the workplace with little regard for reason or significant risk. Dr. Michael Segal, of Harvard Medical School, reports that OSHA regulators have ordered suppliers of many of his laboratories' chemicals to label them as workplace hazards, including sodium chloride (table salt): "WARNING: CAUSES IRRITATION. Avoid contact with eyes, skin, or clothing. Avoid breathing dust. Wash thoroughly after handling." Similarly, another chemical's label provides a "Waste Disposal Method: Dissolve or mix the material with a combustible solvent and burn in a chemical incinerator equipped with an afterburner and scrubber. Observe all federal, state, and local environmental regulations." The hazardous material in question, Dr. Segal says, is candle wax.<p>
This year, OSHA will spend about $300 million and send out some 2,000 inspectors across the country. As large as this effort is, its main task is even larger: to inspect 6 million workplaces with 93 million employees. On average, a company can expect to see an OSHA inspector once every 10 years. Even doubling or tripling the number of inspectors, in other words, wouldn't accomplish very much if the means of ensuring worker safety is to be workplace inspection. No doubt when OSHA was created in 1970, with the strong backing of labor unions, the impossibility of its task wasn't yet evident.<p>
In a smaller, performance-oriented, "reengineered"  federal government, OSHA would survive only as an advisory agency, or perhaps wouldn't survive at all. Its role in promoting worker safety has been and will always be dwarfed by private-sector incentives. Companies make bad decisions on occasion, of course, sometimes endangering the safety of their workers. But as the Hamlet case shows, so do regulators. The difference is that companies pay an economic price for their mistakes.<p><center><b>The Workplace Safety Record</b></center><p>
The Hamlet fire, and a few other workplace disasters, are tragic and make good copy or news footage, but they tell us virtually nothing about worker safety in the United States. And the reality is that worker safety has been improving for decades. Companies have undertaken massive campaigns of training, coordination, technological investment, and management innovation to realize tremendous safety gains. Businesses have huge incentives to promote safety, such as lost productivity and workers' compensation or liability insurance costs, that swamp the prospect of regulatory violations. They have found that safe workers are happy workers, and happy workers are productive ones.<p>
Northern Indiana Public Service Company's Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station is far more typical of corporate America's record on safety than Imperial Foods. Each year, all employees must attend two safety-education classes. In addition, the plant holds weekly "safety tailgate sessions" with all its workers to discuss specific safety topics. Accidents and "near-misses" prompt an intensive incident review, whose results are discussed at weekly safety sessions. Workers and managers alike think of safety not as a program but as a process. The plant's motto typifies everyone's commitment: "Safety, Pride, Teamwork." "We were able to make significant strides by having our employees buy into our cause," says J.N. Kocsis, personnel and safety supervisor at the Mitchell station. In just 10 years, from 1982 to 1992, the rate of accidents at the plant fell by 57 percent.<p>
Nationally, the number of people injured annually, at work and home combined, fell by 15 percent from 1970 to 1990, with most of the decrease occurring during the 1980s. Accidental deaths show an even steeper decline; both the rate and the actual number of deaths have been falling for more than 60 years. The number of workplace accidental deaths fell from about 20,000 in the 1930s to less than 10,000 in 1993. Factoring in population growth, the National Safety Council reports that accidental-death rates at work fell from 15.8 to 3.5 per 100,000 peoplea 78 percent drop. Measures of specific hazards also show a steady downward trend. In just the 10 years from 1983 to 1992, the number of firefighters and civilians killed by smoke and flames fell by 34 percent and 20 percent respectively. <p>
Accidental-death rates may well be a better overall guide of safety trends than reports of all injuries and illnesses. There is good reason to believe that the latter may understate safety gains because companies, workers, and individuals have become more likely to report accidents and injuries over time. <p>
These safety gains can't be attributed to regulatory efforts on the part of federal, state, and local governments. Accidental deaths at work adjusted by population, declined at roughly the same rate before and after the passage of the 1970 Occupational Health and Safety Act.<p>
One way to think about the relative efforts of government and business in the safety arena is this: On any given day in America, thousands of local, state, and national safety regulators are inspecting businesses, studying test data, issuing regulations, and adjudicating violations. <p>
But on that same day, millions of American workers, managers, designers, and engineers are working to make their workplaces safer, to maximize sales and revenues, minimize losses, and maintain good, long-term relationships with productive employees. The magnitude of private-sector safety efforts, both in time and money spent, far exceeds that of even today's bloated regulatory bureaucracy.<p>
Safety gains have occurred across the economy, from highway fatalities to child poisonings, but it is at the workplace, over which businesses have greater direct control, where safety gains have been the largest. While accidents still happen and some jobs remain more dangerous than others, there have been very few years in the past six decades in which workplace accidental deaths have risen rather than fallen. To understand why firms might spend a great deal of time and money improving worker safety, you must first get a clear picture of how costly it is to have a serious accident in a workplace.<p>
There are two main private-sector "regulators" of occupational safety. The first is the labor market itself. In the market for workers, perceptions of risk have a significant impact on the wages employees demand. If a profession or individual business is known to be unsafe, potential workers will want more salary or benefits to compensate for the higher risk. Even if workers don't know going in how dangerous a particular workplace is, their subsequent discovery can cost firms a bundle. For example, when a business loses a proficient worker in an accident, even for a relatively short time, that worker must be replaced with a new one, often needing training. The injured employees' coworkers also reappraise their own job risks, sometimes resulting in higher wage demands. The firm's hiring and training costs rise again if disaffected workers quit. The resulting turmoil can wreak havoc on production, costing the firm sales.<p>
The safety risks posed by businesses differ dramatically, but studies have estimated that the labor market adds an average risk premium of about $1,000 to each worker's salarymeaning that, on average, workers demand $1,000 more in salary than they otherwise would to compensate them for the workplace risks they perceive. Finding ways to reduce that cost is clearly a desirable goal for any business, large or smalland keep in mind that this $1,000 is only the mean. Some firms face very high risk premiums and save a lot of money from even modest safety improvements. Occupations such as logging, meat-packing, mining, and construction continue to pose a higher-than-average risk of injury. For these occupations, says Duke University economist Kip Viscusi, "the marketplace generates enormous wage premiums for risk on the order of $80 billion a year in terms of higher wagesthat's where firms get their financial incentive for safety."<p>
In the search for safety gains, employers have a strong ally: the insurance industry. By law, most employers must have workers' compensation insurance for their employees, but can purchase their coverage from the private insurer of their choice. The workers' comp system is at least partially "experience rated"; that is, the premiums bear some relationship to a business's rate of accidents. Firms that find ways to cut their accident rates pay lower insurance premiums. Insurers who help their subscribers cut accident rates and costs are more likely to keep their customers in the future. So both business managers and insurance underwriters have huge financial incentives to improve workplace safety (although unwise state regulation still keeps the system less efficient and safety-promoting than it could be). "If you're a good company with a good safety record, insurance companies are knocking on your door for your business," says Steve Reynolds, safety supervisor at Crowder Construction Company in Charlotte, North Carolina. Many workers' comp insurers employ armies of consultants, engineers, and designers to help their subscribers reduce accident rates and cut the costs of claims.<p>
The cost of mandated workers' compensation coverage on American business skyrocketed during the latter half of the 1980s, not so much because of an actual increase in danger at the workplace, but because of federal court decisions liberalizing eligibility requirements. Workers found it easier to file claims, while state governments made mandatory benefit levels more generous. The result was a surge in workers' claims, pushing the total bill for workers' compensation insurance to $70 billion a year. While this development had many negative consequences for economic growth, particularly for states with higher benefit levels, it also meant that the insurance market became more competitive than ever, as American companies sought ways to cut down of one of their most explosive labor costs.<p>
Compared with the risk premium imposed on firms by the labor market and workers' comp premiums imposed by insurers, the prospect of being fined by OSHA is almost laughably tiny in dollar value. Average OSHA fines per U.S. worker were about 50 cents in the early 1990sup from 35 cents in 1983 but below the peak of 65 cents in 1978, according to Duke's Viscusi. Considering that the likelihood of being inspected, much less found in violation, is low in a given year, these fines obviously play little to no role in business decisions about safety. Increasing OSHA inspection or increasing fines aren't likely to change that underlying economic calculation very much. <p>	<b><center>Gains Through Innovation</b></center>
<p>
Innovative and responsible companies and insurers have spent years learning how to reduce safety-related costs by reengineering workplaces, training employees, and using new technologies. Even small changes can reap big rewards. Take Rosendin Electric, Inc., a San Jose, California-based electrical contractor. Linda Johnson, Rosendin's benefits administrator, says that when she first came to the company in 1991, it wasn't tracking workers' compensation costs in an efficient manner. Rates of accident frequency and severity were soaring to worrisome levels.<p>
Teaming up with the firm's safety director and risk manager, Johnson employed a new computer software package to track the type and total number of injuries, as well as dollars being spent in premiums. She found that approximately 50 percent of total claim costs were for back- and eye-related injuries. Back injuries alone were costing the company an average of $15,000 to $20,000 for each instance. "Many of the injuries could have been prevented if they'd been tracked effectively," Johnson says.<p>
Supplied with up-to-date reports on how and where accidents were happening, Rosendin managers were able to find their biggest risks and address them. The company started a program to train workers about the importance of back-support belts (providing them to the workers for free) and how to work with the least amount of stress on the back. Rosendin managers also found that a major cause of eye injuries was that workers weren't wearing their safety glasses when they needed to. Much of the company's work was done on high ladders, but safety glasses were needed only some of the time. Workers ended up leaving the glasses at the bottom of the ladder rather than balance them precariously at the top, but then didn't bother to climb all the way down to retrieve the glasses when their use was warranted. "Employees needed something to keep their glasses around their necks when they weren't wearing them," Johnson explains. A simple solution followed: Each pair of glasses was equipped with a cord to go around a worker's neck. That one seemingly minor action reduced eye injuries by 20 percent. Between October 1992 and October 1993, Rosendin workers' comp claims decreased in frequency by 35 percent. The severity rate fell by 10 percent, and the company saved 27 percent in claims.<p>
Subaru-Isuzu Automotive found another simple way to achieve safety gains at its Lafayette, Indiana, plant. Twice a day for five minutes, all employees are encouraged to participate in group exercise workouts. Twisting to workout standards like the theme from Rocky, employees stretch their arms, legs, necks, and backs before beginning work assembling cars, moving materials, or even typing on computers. New employees also learn about exercise and physical exertion during their two-week orientations. Of 80 hours of orientation, 45 hours are devoted to physical training. Employees participate in various exercises depending upon their upcoming responsibilities in the plant. In-house physical therapists coordinate these programs, and more than pay for themselves in reduced workers' compensation costs, say Subaru-Isuzu officials. "Our goal is to prevent injuries," says Mark Siwiec, manager of safety and environmental compliance. "If injuries do occur, however, they should be less severe."<p>
Other companies have found similar results from modest changes in operation or training. When too many AT&T workers were getting injured working on telephone poles, the company started a "pole-climbing school" to teach the three-point contact methodmeaning that workers should keep three limbs touching the pole at all times. Once AT&T workers mastered the method, accident rates fell. Similarly, Coca-Cola Bottling Group cut accident rates among its truck operators by instituting warm-up exercises, improving interior lighting in company trailers, adding more trailer hand grips, and lowering the trailers two inches to make it easier for workers to pull out the cases of drinks.<p>
LSG/Sky Chefs, an in-flight caterer based in Arlington, Texas, has realized significant safety gains by experimenting with financial incentives. In the late 1980s, the firm was logging 1,000 injuries a year and losing more than 18,000 workdaysthis at a company with 8,000 employees. Sky Chefs kitchen workers were constantly straining their backs lifting heavy objects, an injury that costs $25,000 in workers' comp claims on average. <p>
New president Michael Kay introduced a safety program in 1991 to address the problem. Employees were taught how to lift objects without back strain. Kitchen workers got a weekly five-minute "safety short" taught by one of their coworkers. And the firm began offering financial rewards to workers with good safety habits. Supervisors passed out $20 Sears gift certificates to employees who lifted or cut in an exemplary way or who took the initiative to clean up a spill. Supervisors, in turn, saw their own compensation change to make safety a priority. A quarter of their bonus was tied to their unit's safety record. These and other changes helped reduce lost workdays at Sky Chefs to 8,500 in 1993 and about 5,000 in 1994. Focusing on rewards rather than punishments was the key to the new program's success, says Kay. "Our old approach was called the Stop program. It was designed to catch employees doing something wrong. This one's had a remarkably better effect."<p>	<b><center>Insurers Play Role</b></center>
<p>
Some of the most sizable gains in workplace safety have take place in recent years under the tutelage of insurance companies. Insurance broker Johnson & Higgins, for example, helped one of its clients, a book publisher, set up a worker safety program that included routine monitoring, goal setting, active involvement by management, strategic planning, and bonuses tied to safety performance. The publisher had seen its accident rate rise and its workers' comp costs shoot up by 41 percent from 1987 to 1990. After Johnson & Higgins helped the company install its new safety program, workers' comp claims dropped by 35 percent and dollar losses by 63 percent the first year. Georgia-Pacific Corp., the forest-products company, worked with insurers in Georgia to reduce accidents by 31 percent in 1991 and 1992, with Georgia-Pacific's sawmills experiencing only one half of the industry's average number of incidents.<p>
Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection & Insurance Company in Connecticut has made a $562 million business out of reducing workplace accidents. The firm is now the leading provider of boiler and machinery insurance in the United States. "Our interests and our customers' interests are aligned," says Wilson Wilde, president of Hartford Steam Boiler. "Both of us are going to be hurt financially if an accident occurs, so we can justify investing time and money in loss prevention." Most of the company's 4,000 employees are  scientists, engineers, and technicians, who work with electric utilities, chemical plants, and paper manufacturers. They have developed an array of devices, processes, and designs to enhance safety, including a device introduced in 1990 to examine hard-to-reach boiler tubes for corrosion. The company has worked with utilities to detect problems with steam-turbine rotors to head off high replacement costs. It used new sensor technology to diagnose a turbine's vibrations and signal when to weld cracks shut. Fixing rather than replacing rotors saved millions for the insurer's utility subscribers while reducing the danger of faulty rotors coming apart in generators.<p>
Reengineering workplaces using principles of ergonomics has become a common strategy for businesses and insurers to reduce worker injuries, particularly cumulative trauma disorders (CTDs) such as wrist strain, elbow strain, or the more serious carpal tunnel syndrome. CTDs are a fast-growing category of both occupational illnesses and workers' comp claims, but the severity of the injuries has been exaggerated significantly by the media. (Carpal tunnel syndrome is the seriously debilitating illness so often mentioned, but it accounts for only 1.4 percent of all work injury or illness cases, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.) Nevertheless, muscle strains caused by repetitive motions or poor posture do cause discomfort and pain, limit mobility, and reduce worker productivity. To address the problem, companies consult ergonomics experts and buy redesigned office furniture and machinery from manufacturers such as Michigan's Haworth Inc., which makes motorized tables that adjust height during the course of a working day, and Nova Office Furniture of Effingham, Illinois, which sells desks with computer monitors built into them so workers peer down at them like newspapers rather than up at them like televisions.<p>
OshKosh B'Gosh, a Wisconsin-based manufacturer of children's clothing, used several strategies to reduce CTDs at its main plant in Oshkosh. The company's employees were performing numerous tasks involving small, awkward motions that require force. Inspectors checked the snap crotch of each pair of pants, pinching 600 snaps per hour. Machine operators developed back trauma from twisting and turning heavy garments, and sustained shoulder and hand problems from bending over to reach different-sized clothing.<p>
The company's safety team decided to purchase 7,000 padded, adjustable chairs at $100 each and redesign many of its own machines. Company engineers devised an air-driven, automatic "crotch-snapper." Mechanical "feed dogs" were installed to dig their metal "teeth" into fabric and pull it through sewing machines. Plant workers were encouraged to report minor pain or discomfort so company engineers could address the problems. They were also rotated through several different jobs within plants, to reduce constant stress on one part of the body. After an initial surge in reported injuriesworkers were being told, after all, to report even minor problems more oftenworkers' comp claims fell as did the severity of reported injuries. From 1992 to 1993, workers' comp costs at OshKosh B'Gosh fell by a third, more than paying for the company's safety innovations.<p>
In the search for workplace safety, even industries considered to be "dangerous" have made great strides. Consider the mining industry, which has posted the most dramatic decline in injury rates during the past 20 years. In 1976, mining had the third-highest rate of total injury cases and the highest rate of any industry for injuries with lost workdays. By 1992, its rate of all injuries and of injuries involving lost workdays had dropped below the rates not only for all the other goods-producing industries but also for parts of the service sector. The efforts of enterprises like Kerr McGee Coal Corp.'s Jacob's Ranch Mine in Gillette, Wyoming, have contributed to this impressive record. The mine's incentive program for zero accidents is a quarterly award of $100 in gift certificates from local merchants. For every accident, each of the mine's 400 workers loses $10 from their awards. "Everyone gets penalized so there's a real incentive to wear safety glasses and do the right things," says safety supervisor Lenny Altenburg. The company spends $205,000 a year on the gift certificates, but the investment is paying off: The firm had no lost-time accidents at all from 1991 to 1994. Other mining firms have introduced new technologies, begun safety training programs, and used similar financial-incentive systems to minimize accidents. Compare the mining industry's typical death toll today (97 in 1992, for example) to the 3,500 annual deaths typical in the first part of the century, and you have some idea of the progress that's been made.<p>
Rail safety is another area where the incentives of the private-sector marketplace dwarf those of the public sector. The E.H. Harriman Memorial Awards, given for railroad safety since 1913, helped to illustrate this point in 1994, as privately owned railroads took prizes and publicly owned or publicly subsidized railroads posted mediocre or poor safety records. Among the largest railroads in the country, Norfolk Southern took first place while Amtrak, the federally subsidized national passenger rail system, came in last. Similarly, among nine medium-sized railroads, the three publicly owned lines ranked 5th, 7th, and 9th. Guilford Transportation Industries Inc., which operates lines in New England, won its category (small railroads) despite allegations of safety problems over the past few years by labor unions and federal regulators (whose ranks are dominated by union veterans). Colin Pease, executive vice president at Guilford, explains that while many publicly owned or subsidized railroads rely on "feel-good programs" to promote safety, private lines must operate safely or go out of business. Insurance costs, replacement costs, and disruption of freight deliveries all skyrocket when lines are unsafe. "There is a major economic impact to whether your workers perform their jobs the right way or not," he says. "But the motive breaks down in the public sector." Pease believes that when workers are working safely, they're working productivelyand naturally, in a competitive enterprise like transportation, productivity gains are the only way to stay ahead of competing rail or trucking firms. Guilford supervisors provide daily safety instruction and perform "test and observation" procedures 24 hours a day, seven days a week.<p>
The efforts of these and many other American companies to reduce accidents and injuries are ongoing and massive. But conscious decisions by corporate managers and workers to address safety aren't the only cause of safety gains. Larger trends in the economy, reflecting innovation and productivity gains linked to goals other than safety, have also contributed to lower rates of accidental deaths and safer workplaces. For example, it now takes fewer employees to manufacture goods in Americaand that means fewer chances for injuries and accidental deaths. Also, the quality of medical care provided both at the workplace itself and in hospitals and urgent-care centers has steadily improved, reducing the severity of injuries and the risk of death from accidents. Furthermore, a great deal of recent job growth has occurred among the smallest businesses in the country, which also have tended to post the best safety records (large businesses post the second-best safety records, while medium-sized firms have traditionally reported the most accidents).<p>
While interpreting safety data and identifying causes and effects of particular trends can sometimes be challenging, the overall message about corporate responsibility in this area shouldn't be obscured. Driven by the pressures of the market to lower costs, keep skilled workers, minimize legal and insurance costs, and avoid bad publicity, American businesses have toiled endlessly to make their workplaces safer. <p>
To a large extent, they've done so. In a real sense, the tremendous reduction in accidental deaths accomplished in the past 60 years represents an advance in the quality of life of workers and consumers no less significant than pay raises or price reductions. Horrible accidents such as the Hamlet chicken-plant fire are human tragedies, but in the context of corporate decisionmaking in a market economy they are also economic disasters. That's why responsible firms today are investing so much time and money trying to avoid them.<p>
OSHA, whether upsized or downsized, reengineered or left alone, has little value to add to the worker safety picture. But its costs, measured in lower productivity and wages as well as higher prices and taxes, are significant. This is one more area where Congress needs to rethink the need for federal government involvement.

<P>

     Facing a crowded legislative calendar before adjournment,
Congress is rushing to complete work on the most sweeping overhaul of
the nation's telecommunications system in sixty years. The pending
legislation takes important steps to deregulate the system by allowing
the Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs), or "Baby Bells," to
enter the long distance and equipment manufacturing markets and by
ending the ban on competition between telephone and cable companies.
Yet disagreement still exists in the Senate over the extent and pace
of deregulation.<P>
     A modified version of the original Senate proposal -- S. 1822,
The Communications Act of 1994, sponsored by Senator Ernest F.
Hollings (D-SC) -- passed the Senate Commerce Committee on August 11
by an 18-2 margin, but controversial elements of the package are
certain to create problems when the bill is debated on the floor.
Although Senators could attempt to amend S. 1822 when it reaches the
floor, they should consider substituting another alternative that may
be introduced. Senator Robert Dole (R-KS) recently has circulated a
staff discussion draft, entitled the "Telecommunications Deregulation
and Competition Act of 1994," which goes much further toward complete
deregulation than any other proposal ever considered by Congress.
Unlike the pro-regulatory proposals of the House and Senate, it would
rapidly eliminate current regulatory barriers without imposing new
requirements and would completely deregulate other sectors not
mentioned in the House and Senate legislation.<P>
     True telecommunications reform offers tremendous benefits for the
economy. If the Senate adopted the Dole proposal instead of S. 1822,
it would radically transform the heavily regulated telecommunications
industry into a much more vibrant, competitive sector of the U.S.
economy. More jobs would be created, prices for telecommunication
services would fall, and consumers would have more products and
services from which to choose. Congress should use the Dole discussion
draft as the foundation of all telecommunications reform, whether it
occurs this year or next and reject any legislation that is the
product of backroom deals whereby today's carriers divide the market
and find ways to exclude would-be competitors.
<P>
THE COMMERCE COMMITTEE'S PRO-REGULATORY COMPROMISE
<P>
     Since passage last month of the House reform package, the Senate
Commerce Committee has been struggling to craft legislation acceptable
to the diverse supporters of deregulation. Negotiations have focused
on a variety of proposals, all of which fall well short of
comprehensive telecommunications reform. The leading Senate proposal,
S. 1822, has been under attack from Senators and industry groups
seeking either to slow down or to speed up the deregulatory process.
Unfortunately, backroom negotiations between Commerce Committee
members and major industry players have produced a compromise that is
deregulation in name only. One indication of this is the growing size
of the bill, which has grown from 106 pages to approximately 200 as
adopted by the Senate Commerce Committee. If implemented, this
"deregulatory" bill would:
<P>
Require extensive waiting periods and entry tests before competition
     is allowed in certain markets. Although Senator Hollings actually
     eliminated more restrictive language from his original draft, the
     current proposal retains requirements that Baby Bells prove to
     the Department of Justice that they will not impede competition
     in the long distance market and that their entry is "consistent
     with the public interest, convenience and necessity." Likewise,
     telephone companies seeking to enter the cable market could face
     lengthy delays, and Baby Bells wishing to enter the alarm
     monitoring services industry would have to wait six years.
     Finally, almost every provider entering a new market must do so
     through a separate affiliate that keeps entirely separate
     accounts. The inevitable bureaucratic delays caused by these
     entry tests and separate affiliate requirements would deny
     consumers the benefits of immediate competition. 
<P>
Impose protectionist manufacturing requirements on the Baby Bells once
     they are allowed to enter the equipment market. The bill would
     prohibit a Baby Bell from manufacturing equipment outside the
     United States. Likewise, all manufacturing components must be
     procured domestically unless companies can prove they first made
     a good-faith effort to buy domestic parts but could not obtain
     them from an American firm; and even if the FCC allows these
     companies to purchase needed foreign components, the amount spent
     cannot exceed 40 percent of the revenue derived from the sale of
     their final product. Besides violating America's trade agreements
     with other countries, these protectionist measures actually could
     raise prices by forcing producers to buy high-cost, poor-quality
     components.
<P>
Expand universal service requirements instead of eliminating the
     massively inefficient subsidization and rate-regulation
     mechanisms that supposedly help Americans gain access to
     telephone service. The package of universal service items that
     must be provided to all consumers is expanded from basic
     telephone service to include every service to which a majority of
     residential consumers will have access. Interpreted broadly, this
     requirement would force the government and private carriers to
     spend significantly more to provide expensive new minimum package
     services. Such costly mandates not only will force up costs, but
     also will make it easier for larger existing carriers to continue
     dominating the market, since generally they will be the only ones
     able to afford the package. 
<P>
Provide public organizations generous access to networks at low rates
     or for free. Private carriers would be forced to dedicate 5
     percent of their network capacity to schools, libraries, health
     care facilities, museums, or 501(c)(3) organizations. (501(c)(3)
     organizations are nonprofit entities, such as The Heritage
     Foundation. Therefore, as currently written, S. 1822 would compel
     private carriers to grant The Heritage Foundation access to their
     networks.) This would place a costly burden on carriers, many of
     whom already are required to carry much public material over
     their networks.
<P>
Allow the Federal Communications Commission to impose arbitrary
     interconnection and other standards on the industry. Such top-
     down interconnection orders rarely are satisfactory to either
     party and often are written poorly. Voluntary contracting and
     mutual industry agreements between carriers would better
     establish workable industry-wide standards. 
<P>
Place numerous restrictions on merger, acquisition, and alliance
     activity. For example, the legislation would limit the equity
     interest of Baby Bells in electronic publishing joint ventures,
     limit their financial interest in nearby cable TV providers to 10
     percent, and prohibit joint ventures between local telephone and
     cable operators. Such arbitrary restrictions would impede the
     efficient operation of the market and deny consumers the benefits
     of such cooperative activity.
<P>
Increase the likelihood that firms will sue each other when faced with
     competition. S. 1822 would allow firms that feel they have been
     injured by new competition to sue competitors and recover damages
     for commercial losses. Firms could seek damages if they could
     prove to any federal district court that the new competitor was
     violating the terms of entry as established in S. 1822. In one
     case, the legislation would allow injured competitors to sue for
     threefold damages plus an attorney's fee. By encouraging an
     onslaught of litigation, the bill would discourage competition in
     the very markets it hopes to make competitive.
<P>
     Overall, the bill grants the Federal Communications Commission
dozens of new rule-making powers, ensuring that any deregulation that
does take place occurs many years after enactment. Not only will
little deregulation take place, but expanded FCC powers will create
new problems that Congress will have to correct in the future.
<P>
THE DOLE SOLUTION
<P>
     Like the other congressional proposals, the Dole discussion draft
addresses numerous issues involving deregulation of the industry.
Unlike the others, however, the Dole proposal could achieve
deregulation more effectively because it:
<P>
Eliminates the Modification of Final Judgment (MFJ) two years after
     enactment. The MFJ, the decree that broke up the telephone system
     in 1982, remains the primary obstacle to telecommunications
     competition because it prohibits the Regional Bell Operating
     Companies, the "Baby Bells," from entering long-distance and
     resale markets and from manufacturing equipment. By scrapping the
     MFJ unconditionally, the Dole proposal would ensure more
     competition in these markets, thereby lowering prices while
     encouraging an increase in jobs and exports. (Four of the Baby
     Bells recently entered a motion with the United States District
     Court for the District of Columbia to vacate the MFJ. In
     accompanying affidavits, the motion received the support of over
     50 respected academics and regulators, including four recipients
     of the Nobel Prize in Economics. The overwhelming conclusion of
     these experts was that the MFJ line-of-business restrictions
     discouraged competition, harming consumer welfare through
     increased prices and lost job opportunities. United States of
     America v. Western Electric Co., and the American Telephone and
     Telegraph Company, Motion of Bell Atlantic Corporation, Bell
     South Corporation, NYNEX Corporation, and Southwestern Bell
     Corporation to Vacate the Decree, United States District Court
     for the District of Columbia, Civil Action No. 82-0192 (HHG).)
<P>
Immediately removes many of the artificial government entry barriers
     to telephone competition and prohibits the erection of any new
     barriers against potential new entrants. The discussion draft
     states clearly that "no Federal, State or local requirement,
     shall prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the ability of
     any entity to provide interstate or intrastate telecommunications
     services." Although S. 1822 also would take this step, the Dole
     proposal goes further by requiring the FCC to repeal a host of
     specific regulations if carriers are subject to competition.
     Regulations that might be repealed include:
<P>
<UL>          the requirement that carriers file rate schedules, or
          "tariffs," with the FCC;

          the regulation of the terms and conditions of service in any
          area;

          the requirement that carriers obtain permission before
          constructing new facilities or expanding others;

          requirements that carriers assign costs from uncompetitive
          services to competitive services.
</UL><P>
          The draft would give the FCC 120 days to determine whether
     or not a carrier which applied for permission to free itself from
     these regulations was subject to competition. A carrier would be
     considered subject to competition "if an entity not affiliated
     with the provider offers at least the same level of service in
     the area to at least the same extent and at least the same rates
     as the provider." If the FCC does not act within 120 days, the
     provider is considered automatically subject to competition, and
     all restrictions are eliminated. In addition, federal loan
     assistance from the Rural Electrification Administration would be
     eliminated for competitive providers. Finally, the draft proposal
     virtually abolishes rate-of-return regulation, which establishes
     the maximum profit a telco is allowed to earn.
<P>
Repeals the Cable Act of 1992, which, by discouraging the expansion of
     cable firms into new markets, also has discouraged greater
     competition between cable and telephone firms. The draft also
     would eliminate the "cable-telco cross-ownership ban," which
     restricts ownership of a cable firm by a telephone company and
     vice-versa and prohibits competition between the two most likely
     rivals in most markets. Therefore, its immediate repeal will
     increase the likelihood of local telephone competition. Finally,
     the states would not be allowed to re-regulate the industry once
     it is deregulated. 
<P>
Begins serious spectrum reform by allowing holders of an
     electromagnetic spectrum license to use their slice of spectrum
     to provided alternative services. Cellular, Personal
     Communication Services (PCS), and other wireless technologies
     currently are adding to consumer options in the wireless market,
     providing increased competition for traditional wireline
     providers. This move toward more flexibility in using the
     spectrum would encourage greater competition from the wireless
     sector as current licensees use leftover spectrum to enter new
     markets such as PCS. The draft also requires the FCC to examine
     further spectrum reform with a view to moving closer to a market-
     based system of spectrum operation.
<P>
Allows other public utility companies to enter the telecommunications
     industry, which they have been restricted from doing under the
     Public Utilities Holding Company Act of 1935. This will encourage
     competition from an entirely different sector and also help
     ensure service to many rural areas, since these firms already
     have the needed infrastructure in place. Simple technological
     modifications can turn these old utilities into new competitors
     within the telephone industry. S. 1822 also would allow utility
     entry into telecom, but not without numerous restrictions on
     their activities that the Dole proposal does not require. (For
     example, S. 1822 would require that any utility entering the
     telecommunications industry do so through a separate affiliate
     and would prohibit any sharing of profits between that telecom
     affiliate and the utility. The bill would require strict rate
     regulations to prohibit such profit sharing. The Dole proposal
     would not require that any new regulations be enforced once
     utilities entered the telecommunications market.)
<P>
Radically reforms the provision of universal service. The Dole
     proposal offers a unique approach to achieve the goal of
     universal service. Instead of requiring the continued
     masquerading of subsidies as rate regulation mechanisms, the
     draft would require that all universal service subsidies be
     explicit to minimize their inefficient or anti-competitive
     effects. Currently, universal service subsidies are arranged to
     siphon off revenues from high-revenue sectors and channel them to
     high-cost areas of service. This arrangement is highly
     inefficient and hides the true cost of service from telephone
     consumers. (For example, subsidies flow from long-distance
     providers to local providers through substantial "access
     charges." Likewise, subsidies flow from urban business users to
     rural residential customers. Therefore, the price of
     long-distance and business service in general is greatly inflated
     through rate regulation to ensure that excess profits can be
     channeled to rural residential areas, which cost more to
     service.) 
<P>
          To eliminate this problem, the proposal creates a single
     Universal Service Fund to which all providers would contribute
     equally. Subsidies then would be taken directly from the fund and
     given to "carriers of last resort" to pay for the difference
     between the low prices charged for rural service and the actual
     cost of providing that service. In addition, states would be
     prohibited from creating new subsidization schemes that might
     favor one provider over another. Most beneficially, all universal
     service subsidization of a carrier of last resort would be
     terminated once that carrier was subject to competition from
     other providers. This new procedure would streamline the
     subsidization process and decrease the likelihood that one
     carrier would be given a substantial advantage over another.
<P>
Creates a sensible interconnection policy for the entire industry by
     requiring carriers to enter good faith negotiations with each
     other. Interconnection will be important in the future as rivals
     seek access to each others' networks. For example, a cable
     provider and telephone provider within a given locality will need
     to agree on a plan to provide one another with access to their
     customers. 
<P>
          Under the Dole proposal, any interconnection problems that
     arise, such as concerns over technical interoperability, will be
     handled through a private dispute resolution mechanism rather
     than through FCC intervention. Because it encourages private
     resolution of technical issues, this approach will prove superior
     to arbitrary FCC rulings, which often are unsatisfactory to both
     parties. (For example, in 1992 the FCC mandated that dominant
     providers physically "co-locate" competitors' equipment on their
     premises to ensure that interconnection was achieved. Yet not
     only was the arrangement unsatisfactory for many within the
     industry, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
     Columbia recently found that such a mandate went beyond the FCC's
     authority and, therefore, could not be enforced. See Bell
     Atlantic Telephone Co. v. FCC, U.S. Court of Appeals for the
     District of Columbia, No. 92-1619, June 10, 1994, and "FCC Lacks
     Power to Order Phone Companies to Set Aside Space for Their
     Competitors," Daily Report for Executives, Bureau of National
     Affairs, Inc., DER 112 d20, June 14, 1994.) 
<P>
Requires the FCC to conduct annual regulatory reviews of all
     telecommunications regulation to ensure that useless or
     uncompetitive rules are scrapped as soon as possible. The review
     would focus on remaining telephone regulations while forcing the
     FCC also to examine the usefulness of restrictions on the
     ownership of radio and broadcast stations. For example, the FCC
     could review uncompetitive foreign ownership restrictions, which
     unwisely restrict ownership of domestic carriers by foreign-owned
     firms, as well as agency rules that arbitrarily limit the number
     of TV or radio stations a single firm can own. 
<P>
 BENEFITS OF THE DOLE APPROACH
<P>
     Compared with the alternatives currently being considered in
Congress, the Dole discussion draft is superior for several reasons.
<P>
The Dole draft does not impose burdensome entry tests upon providers
     hoping to enter new markets. Both the legislation adopted by the
     House and the bill reported by the Senate Commerce Committee
     contain numerous restrictions governing how providers will be
     allowed to enter new sectors. For example, Baby Bells would not
     be allowed to enter long-distance markets unless they prove to
     the Department of Justice that they will not impede competition
     in those markets and that their entry is "consistent with the
     public interest, convenience and necessity." The Dole approach
     wisely rejects such an approach, allowing open competition in all
     segments of the industry once current regulations are repealed.
     This would eliminate bureaucratic obstacles that would delay
     increased telephone competition for years. 
<P>
The Dole draft does not require telecom firms to establish separate
     affiliates for each new service they want to provide or to obey
     exclusive purchasing or domestic production requirements. The
     Dole plan also wisely rejects requirements found in the House and
     Senate bills that would force firms entering new sectors to do so
     through separate affiliates. Such duplication of facilities to
     provide new services is inefficient and unneeded. Instead of
     worrying that cross-subsidization will lead to monopoly, the Dole
     draft encourages increased competition that would discourage
     monopolization of a market. 
<P>
          Likewise, the Dole plan also rejects the crude
     protectionism, found in both these bills, which mandates that any
     equipment manufacturing by Baby Bells be done in America using
     only domestic parts. The Clinton Administration wisely opposes
     such requirements because they betray U.S. trade agreements with
     other countries and encourage other nations to close, rather than
     open, their borders to American goods.
<P>
The Dole draft covers important issues ignored by other proposals,
     ensuring that consumers will benefit from deregulation much
     sooner than under any alternative approach. The Dole discussion
     draft is the only telecommunications reform proposal that can be
     labeled truly comprehensive. Going beyond simple telephone
     deregulation, it eliminates all cable regulation, allows
     utilities freely into the industry, pushes for serious spectrum
     reform, radically reforms rate and subsidy regulation, and
     implements a regulatory review mechanism that will remove
     remaining rules in future years. 
<P>
          With its comprehensive deregulatory approach, the proposal
     will ensure that the benefits of telecommunications competition
     are captured by consumers much sooner than would be the case with
     any other approach. The WEFA Group, a Burlington, Massachusetts,
     economic forecasting firm, found recently that if all
     telecommunications regulations were removed, some 3.6 million
     more jobs would be created by 2003 than would have been expected
     without deregulation. Likewise, the economy would grow, on
     average, some 3.3 percent per year with telecommunications
     deregulation, but only 2.9 percent annually without. (The WEFA
     Group, Economic Impact of Eliminating the Line-of-Business
     Restrictions on the Bell Companies, July 1993.) Consumers would
     also benefit from the increase in services available to them.
     Again, the WEFA study finds that consumers could expect savings
     of approximately $63 billion a year with deregulation. (Ibid.)
     Exports of high-tech telecom products, in which America currently
     has an advantage, also could increase greatly if more companies
     are allowed to manufacture equipment. The Dole approach is
     superior to alternative proposals because it would bring about
     these gains far more rapidly.
<P>
HOW TO IMPROVE THE DOLE PLAN
<P>
     Although the Dole discussion draft is the boldest telecom
deregulation plan now pending, three changes would strengthen it even
more.
<P>
Improving Universal Service Reform. While the Dole proposal improves
     the existing universal service system, it still retains some of
     the current system's structure. For example, the proposal would
     retain a regulatory requirement that rates for rural telephone
     customers be no higher than those for urban customers. While
     "rate averaging," as it is known in the industry, might appeal to
     legislators and regulators in theory, in practice it discourages
     competition in rural areas by artificially lowering the price of
     servicing those regions. Consequently, new providers prefer to
     seek entry into urban markets where prices are kept artificially
     high to subsidize rural areas. Therefore, new entrants are
     discouraged from extending service to rural areas, and this makes
     it difficult to inject competition which could then result in
     lower, more affordable rates. 
<P>
          Any system which attempts artificially to control costs and
     prices will always distort the proper functioning of the market.
     One recent study found that the telephone industry loses from
     $1.5 billion to $10 billion per year by attempting to provide
     universal service in this manner. (David L. Kaserman and John W.
     Mayo, "Cross-Subsidies in Telecommunications: Roadblocks on the
     Road to More Intelligent Telephone Pricing," Yale Journal on
     Regulation, Vol. 11 (Winter 1994), p. 121. Kaserman and Mayo
     argue that these estimates are likely to be too low since "they
     do not consider the incalculable losses resulting from the
     distortion of dynamic market incentives to create and adopt
     technological advances that make more efficient use of the
     long-distance network.") Just as television programming has been
     extended to nearly every American home without government
     mandates -- including 91 percent of poor households (U.S.
     Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration, Housing
     Characteristics 1990, May 1992, p. 115.) -- telephone service
     would be provided even in the absence of federal requirements and
     subsidies.
<P>
Eliminating license fees for alternative users of the spectrum.
     Although the draft would allow holders of spectrum slices to use
     their portions to provide alternative services, in exchange they
     would be forced to pay the federal government a compensation fee.
     The practical effect of such a fee could be to discourage
     spectrum licensees from providing alternative services that
     encourage greater competition. In addition, while the draft
     rightly allows more flexible use of existing spectrum licenses,
     more comprehensive reform is needed. The FCC should be required
     to establish a spectrum privatization plan that would place the
     frequencies in private hands. Once the government's role is
     limited to enforcing property rights in the spectrum, wireless
     technologies would have a much better chance to mount serious
     competition to traditional wireline providers.
<P>
Making deregulation unconditional. The draft would eliminate many
     useless and inefficient regulations, such as requirements to file
     rates or to receive permission before expanding networks or
     constructing new facilities. To gain exemption from these and
     other regulations, however, the FCC would be required within 120
     days to find that a provider faced competition. Although this
     test is less restrictive than similar tests found in other bills,
     it is still unneeded. For example, if the FCC did not find
     competition, it would still require rate or tariff filings, which
     encourages cartel-like activity within the industry by allowing
     firms to price service in tandem. Many economists have suggested
     that this is what is fueling the unified rate increases currently
     seen within the long-distance industry. (See Affidavit of Jerry
     A. Hausman and Affidavit of Paul W. MacAvoy in United States of
     America v. Western Electric Co., and the American Telephone and
     Telegraph Company, Motion of Bell Atlantic Corporation, Bell
     South Corporation, NYNEX Corporation, and Southwestern Bell
     Corporation to Vacate the Decree, United States District Court
     for the District of Columbia, Civil Action No. 82-0192 (HHG).)
     Instead of waiting for the FCC to determine arbitrarily when to
     eliminate regulations, such rules should be scrapped immediately.
     <P>
          Deregulatory legislation also should eliminate foreign
     ownership barriers that restrict foreign investment in the
     American industry, immediately repeal any station ownership laws
     governing how many radio or TV stations a company may own, and
     ensure that merger and acquisition activity within the industry
     is not blocked arbitrarily by regulators or judges. (See Adam D.
     Thierer, "A Guide to Telecommunications Deregulation
     Legislation," Heritage Foundation Issue Bulletin No. 191, June 3,
     1994, pp. 20-22.)
<P>
CONCLUSION<P>
     Senator Dole's bold draft proposal to deregulate
telecommunications would end over six decades of industry micro-
management by the federal government. While the other proposals before
Congress would allow bureaucrats to continue to exercise considerable
power over the industry, the Dole discussion draft would unleash the
competitive forces within the industry and allow consumers the right
to choose freely which telecommunication services are best for them.
Just as the computer industry has prospered without the continuous
intervention of regulators and legislators, so can the
telecommunications industry. The Dole discussion draft represents a
substantial step in that direction.

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">D</FONT></B>uring the coming year, Americans will begin a serious debate over the meaning and value of affirmative action. Among the early signs:
	<P>	A proposed ballot initiative in California aims to amend the state constitution to 
prohibit preferential treatment in public policy based on race, sex, ethnicity, or national 
origin.</P>
<P>	In Georgia, the state legislature considers a bill to end preferences for women and 
minorities in landing county contracts.</P>
<P>	Senator and presidential hopeful Phil Gramm (R-TX) promises that, if elected, he 
will end major set-aside programs on his first day in office.</P>
<P>	President Clinton orders an "intense, urgent review" of all aspects of government 
affirmative-action policy. Veteran Democratic strategist Susan Estrich says that as far as 
affirmative action is concerned, "now is truly the time to move on to some other 
approach."</P>
<P>	The Supreme Court may oblige her. In agreeing to hear Adarand v. Pena, the 
Court threatens to reform, restrict, or undo federal set-asides for minority-owned 
businesses. Policy Review asked several black businessmen to describe the impact of 
race-based government contracting on entrepreneurship, and to offer their own insights 
into establishing successful businesses in an increasingly competitive market. Here are 
their stories:

<H3>Ward Connerly</H3>
<P>	Of all the terms used to describe America, none is more descriptive (and it is my 
favorite) than "the land of opportunity." Opportunity, the chance to advance in life, is the 
centerpiece of our value system. It is this concept that separates us from the rest of the 
world. For opportunity to have meaning, there must be entrepreneurs, people who are 
willing to take chances in order to succeed. True entrepreneurs are created not by 
government, but by God, and their natural talents are stimulated by the marketplace.</P>
<P>	In recent years, our nation has begun to debate the effects and consequences of 
"affirmative action." Affirmative action comes in many forms; some are acceptable, even 
desirable, such as advertising the availability of contract opportunities in minority 
communities, and adopting strong measures to ensure that racial and gender 
discrimination have no place in our society.</P>
<P>	Other forms of affirmative action, however, are very damaging to the nation and 
to those whom such programs and practices are designed to benefit. One of the most 
odious forms of affirmative action is the concept of awarding contracts on the basis of 
racial, ethnic, or gender preferences. There are many variations on this theme, but the 
approach taken in California is fairly representative and instructive.</P>
<P>	Several years ago, the California state legislature passed a law requiring every 
state agency to award 15 percent of all contracts to firms owned by minority business 
enterprises (MBEs), 5 percent to firms owned by women-owned business enterprises 
(WBEs), and 3 percent to firms owned by disabled veterans (DVBEs). Minorities are 
defined as "socially and economically disadvantaged" groups and include blacks, 
Hispanics, Asians, and Native Americans.</P>
<P>	What are the effects of this policy?</P>
<P>	First, the prospect of getting government contracts, as a result of belonging to a 
protected group, is sometimes a false inducement for people to go into business without 
being adequately prepared to be in business. They often are undercapitalized and lack the 
business acumen to remain in business without government contracts. This is not itself a 
sin, but these businesses tend to become an extension of the government agencies 
themselves. Consequently, the agencies often create contract opportunities to sustain 
these businesses rather than acting to meet their needs or those of the taxpayers.
<P>	Second, the costs and headaches associated with administering the MBE and 
WBE programs are significant. A bureaucracy of MBE/WBE coordinators has been 
established in virtually every department of California's state government. This 
obviously increases the cost of government and creates enormous inefficiencies for 
companies that do business with the state. There is great inconsistency across 
departments, and many officials confess that their programs cost more because of these 
set-aside requirements.</P>
<P>	Third, these practices are marginalizing better-established businesses because they 
are forced to share their contracts with MBE/WBE partners. Few businesses can sacrifice 
23 percent from a contract and still make a profit. I hear the argument that 23 percent is 
not being taken off the top, but rather the total pie is merely being sliced differently. 
Sometimes that is true. Our firm, however, is usually able to carry out most portions of 
our contracts. Yet we must often create a role for those whom we are required to include. 
This generally means subcontracting for tasks that we could perform ourselves at lower 
cost. Whenever we take on a state contract, we lose profit, and our private-sector clients 
bear the burden of our higher prices.</P>
<P>	After 22 years in business, I know that government procurement of goods and 
services is less costly when the specifications are clear and private contractors are able to 
fit these requirements into their methods of doing business. Whenever contractors have to 
customize their methods of delivering products, such as aligning themselves with new 
partners, the cost on a per unit basis of doing business inevitably rises.</P>
<P>	Fourth, the quality of the work sometimes suffers. When you are forced into a 
shotgun relationship with firms with whom you do not regularly do business, it is 
inescapable that you lose some management control over the project.</P>
<P>	Fifth, the policy invites deception. For example, there is evidence that some 
women or minorities listed as "owners" exercise no control over the day-to-day 
operations of their businesses. In some instances, the so-called owner rarely sets foot on 
the premises. How is the goal of equality advanced when, say, a man who has owned a 
construction business for decades suddenly switches ownership to his wife?</P>
<P>	Finally, these set-aside programs are blatantly unfair. Consider my own business. 
I own 50 percent of the stock issued by my company. My wife owns the other 50 percent. 
Technically, neither of us "controls" the business, and we qualify for neither MBE nor 
WBE preferences.</P>
<P>	We have chosen not to change the ownership of our business merely to qualify for 
preferences based on my race or her gender. But why should we operate at a competitive 
disadvantage just because we prefer to be considered on the merits of our work? How 
does society benefit when a business established 22 years ago, by individuals who were 
willing to risk their economic futures, is disfavored in order to lure others to go into 
business?</P>
<P>	Minority set-aside programs are creating all kinds of dysfunction in the 
marketplace, they are unfair, and they are based on the false proposition that government 
should be creating business opportunities for women and minorities. What government 
should be doing is ensuring, through advertising and other forms of outreach, that 
opportunities are equally available, and then allowing the marketplace to produce the 
lowest legitimate bids for the goods and services that the government seeks to procure.</P>

<B>WARD CONNERLY <I>is president of Connerly and Associates, Inc., a Sacramento-based 
consulting firm. He serves on the University of California Board of Regents and recently 
testified in favor of the California Civil Rights Initiative.</I></B>

<H3>Daniel Colimon</H3>
<P>	I operate perhaps the largest black-owned litigation-support firm in California. 
We have been in business for 14 years, and our clients include at least 200 law firms from 
Santa Barbara to San Diego. We have never sought a government contract as a minority 
firm, and federal set-asides for awarding contracts to minority-owned businesses anger 
me to no end.</P>
<P>	After our firm did some work for the legal department of a state utility, one of its 
officials told me that if we became a certified minority enterprise, they would make us 
their primary vendor. There was no discussion of the quality of our work--none 
whatsoever. </P>
<P>	They merely needed to rack up points with the state's Public Utility Commission, 
which requires all state agencies to do at least 15 percent of their business with minority-
owned companies.</P>
<P>	I said no. Commission officials called me every other week for two and a half 
months. They warned that if we continued to refuse, they would simply opt for another 
vendor. They did, and I have since lost 80 percent of their business.</P>
<P>	It is time for America to acknowledge that affirmative action doesn't work. There 
are fatal flaws in set-aside programs, which, despite all of the good intentions, hope, and 
government intervention, have produced very few positive changes. If anything, the white 
"backlash" to affirmative action has perpetuated the polarization of America's various 
ethnic groups.</P>
<P>	If affirmative action was to be the vehicle by which we travel the road to racial 
equality, somewhere along the way we lost first the keys and then the map. If affirmative 
action was to redress past discrimination against African Americans and other racial 
minorities, it has failed miserably:</P>
<UL><LI>  White males dominate the social, political, and business landscape as never before.<BR>
<LI>  Racial minorities are still largely absent from the private sector's management or 
executive boardrooms.<BR>
<LI>  Worst of all, affirmative-action programs have established an extremely damaging 
stereotype that places African Americans and other racial minorities in a very precarious 
position. We are perceived as a group of people who--regardless of how hard we work, 
how educated we become, or what we achieve--would not be where we are without the 
preferential treatment afforded by affirmative-action programs.</UL>
<P>	Throughout my life, I have been taught that the best place to look for help is in the 
mirror. I grew up poor and  black and  in a single-parent household. I graduated from a 
predominantly white university. I have worked since the age of 12. I founded an 
extremely successful litigation-support firm that employs people of all races.</P>
<P>	Although I have suffered with the burden of being a businessman who happens to 
be black, never have I been given nor have I expected preferential treatment simply 
because I am black. I defy anyone to put an asterisk next to any of my accomplishments. I 
have always demanded that I receive respect, not by virtue of what I am, but of who I am. 
Conversely, I have always accorded the same treatment to all I have encountered, 
regardless of race, creed, or national origin.</P>
<P>	My personal experiences with affirmative-action programs, in the business 
community and outside it, have all been negative. It is not popular to be black and 
opposed to affirmative action. When discussing this with other blacks, I've been told that 
I have sold out to the white agenda. On the contrary, I argue that we don't need any 
affirmative-action programs precisely because I believe so strongly in my capabilities and 
those of all people of all races.</P>
<P>	Such programs are not the solution to America's race problem. Truly 
"affirmative" action should take the form of equal-quality education, which will help lead 
to equal political access and equal economic opportunity. Additionally, it is imperative 
that we acknowledge the existence of institutional racial discrimination. Rather than 
disavowing responsibility for it or wasting 25 years on programs that have not worked, 
we should aggressively ferret out those who practice clear discrimination and prosecute 
them. </P>
<P>	Only then will we truly be able to say that we have equal opportunity. The 
measure of this will be a society where people can achieve success regardless of race,  
where people "will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their 
character."</P>

based litigation-support firm.</I></B>

<H3>Herman Cain</H3>
<P>	When Pillsbury Co. hired me as president of Godfather's Pizza, one of its failing 
subsidiaries, we  couldn't count on a government contract to revive the chain. Not only 
did we want to rescue the chain from debt and looming bankruptcy; we wanted to have 
the industry's highest average sales per unit and the highest average profitability per unit. 
You don't get that without a commitment to quality and an acute sensitivity to your 
market.</P>
<P>	When Ronald Gartlan and I later led a team of other managers to buy Godfather's 
Pizza, we didn't use a set-aside program. We had to fight and defend and sell the banks 
on our merit as investors. Our success or failure was based on our own raw business 
ability.</P>
<P>	If there were no federal programs to assist minority business owners, the 1 percent 
of businesses owned by the black community would probably be zero. But federal set-
asides are a double-edged sword: Any time you have a guaranteed participation level, you 
may not have the same incentives or the same motivation to perform as in a situation that 
is driven by performance. On the other hand, without set-asides, many minorities 
candidates for contracts, jobs, or services would not even be considered for inclusion.</P>
<P>	Remember, you need capital to start a business. The lack of access to capital is the 
number one reason for the tiny percentage of black-owned businesses. Set-asides do not 
address the capital issue as it relates to starting, maintaining, and running a business.</P>
<P>	One of the most important aspects of being successful is relationship-building. 
The vendor and the customer have to develop a relationship based on trust and 
performance. But you can't legislate relationships; set-aside programs won't build 
relationships between minority businesses and their customers.</P>
<P>	As a businessman and as a black American, I know there still exists institutional 
racism, which tends to exclude people from consideration. As a result, I've practiced 
several principles to help me achieve my goals:</P>
<UL><LI>  Because I am a black American, I've had to perform better than my white counterparts. 
This is a personal standard that I've set for myself: I've got to perform a little better in 
order to get the same opportunity. I can't just be as good; I've got to be better. It should 
not be this way, but it is.<BR>
<LI>  When I come across those barriers, such as racial bias, I have to let my performance be 
my barrier buster. That's just the price you pay for success.<BR>
<LI>  I have to maintain focus and be tenacious in achieving my objectives.</UL>
<P>	I have been very successful in corporate America because I have refused to allow 
any of the normal obstacles--and there have been many--to stop me. Part of my success 
is linked to getting an opportunity, but another part is taking advantage of the opportunity 
by staying focused. That is something you can't legislate or put in a program.</P>
<P>	When I came to Godfather's, I sought the views of the management, the 
operations people, and the franchises on how we got into the mess we were in and how 
we could get out. By focusing on our strengths and on the market niches where we could 
win, we embarked on a path to recovery. In just over a year--and against intense 
competition--store sales increased about 10 percent, with some restaurants running as 
high as 25 percent. More important than the numbers, however, is the fact that over the 
last several years we have built a foundation for sustained profitability.</P>
<P>	I'm a firm believer that we are put on this earth to make a difference. I happen to 
have been blessed in that I have achieved some business success. But what's truly 
important to me is that I'm able to use the position, compensation, and incentives that go 
along with business success to help make a difference in other people's lives.</P>

more than 525 restaurants nationwide. He is the current president of the National 
Restaurant Association.</B></I>

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT></B> tiny "Great Books" college in California, tucked away in a mountain meadow, 
would seem an unlikely minuteman in a struggle for the academic liberty of America's 
colleges, universities, and professional schools. But so it is. Thomas Aquinas College, 
named for the 13th-century Italian saint and patron of Catholic education, was among the 
first to resist the imposition of non-academic standards by regional accrediting agencies. 
Now the accreditors, who grant a scholastic seal of approval--and with it, access to 
federal assistance--are hoping to consolidate and centralize their power over dissident 
institutions.</P>
<P>	Armed with an agenda that includes politically correct notions of "diversity," an 
alliance of accreditors and Washington-based educrats is trying to establish a national 
accrediting body that would oversee every institution of higher learning in the country. 
No school that receives federal money would be immune from attack: By threatening to 
withhold accreditation, and thereby close off millions of dollars in government loans and 
other assistance, a centralized body could impose a political agenda at will.</P>
<P>	This is precisely the lesson in the recent flap over the Accreditation Council for 
Graduate Medical Education, which insisted that medical schools require training in 
abortion procedures or else forfeit accreditation.</P>
<P>	If the move toward a centralized accrediting body succeeds, the private, collegial 
character of the review process will be in peril. Advocates of diversity and multicultural 
standards instead will be pitted against institutions striving to preserve high academic 
standards along with their own distinctive missions. The autonomy and quality of these 
institutions will be put in jeopardy.</P>
<P>	This is not a hypothetical fear. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical 
Education, a nationwide agency, recently voted for ideological reasons to deny 
accreditation to any obstetrics and gynecology program that fails to provide mandatory 
training in abortion procedures. A similar imposition of ideological mandates could occur 
if accreditation of colleges were centralized in one monopolistic organization.</P>
<P>	Accreditation has long been a valuable process in higher education. Until recently, 
it has involved private, professional peer review to make sure that colleges and 
universities actually provide the quality of education they claim to provide. Now 
proponents of "diversity" are using the process to impose politically correct educational 
standards on institutions striving to preserve their distinctive missions. In the name of 
advancing diversity within each institution, they are imposing their own version of 
conformity and threatening true diversity among institutions. At stake is America's 
historical commitment to the integrity, quality, and independence of its colleges.</P>

<H3>The Aquinas Model</H3>
<P>  Since its founding in 1971, Thomas Aquinas has offered only one kind of degree: a 
bachelor of arts in liberal education. Our curriculum is composed of the seminal books of 
Western civilization, and we are unabashedly Catholic. There are no majors, minors, or 
electives. There are no textbooks; we rely only on the original works of those who have 
thought deeply about man, nature, and God. There are no lectures; we hold seminars in 
which professors guide students toward an understanding of the authors before them. 
With its clear and distinctive academic vision, the college offers an exemplary version of 
a classical liberal education.</P>
<P>	We pursue no "affirmative action" for persons or texts. We look for the best 
teachers, the best books, and students willing and able to undertake the life of reason. As 
Catholics, we hold that one intellectual tradition is superior, and we ask our students to 
study in that tradition, as well as to read prominent critics of that tradition such as Marx 
and Nietzsche. We are not about the study of "culture," as the word is used today; we will 
not base our curriculum on authors consciously selected for their race, gender, or sexual 
orientation. Whether the author is St. Thomas or Machiavelli, however, we are studying 
not the man, but what he has to say about the true, the beautiful, and the good.</P>
<P>	Until the 1980s, schools such as Thomas Aquinas thrived under the nation's six 
regional accrediting agencies for senior colleges and universities. These accreditors 
respected their members' independence and judged them in light of their professed 
missions. Countries like France, with their centralized ministries of education, would not 
allow such an enterprise as this. America does, thanks to its tradition of non-
governmental accreditation.</P> 
<P>	The latest mutation in the accreditation process is a story that we at Thomas 
Aquinas College know only too well. Every college and university in the United States 
must periodically submit to a review by one of these private accrediting agencies. 
Without accreditation, schools lose academic credibility among their peers.</P>
<P>	The process in the United States has always been largely in the hands of private 
organizations of accredited schools. After World War II, however, the G.I. Bill and the 
growth of federal aid programs prompted the agencies to take on the additional role of 
approving colleges as the recipients of such funds. And as the gatekeepers of federal 
funds, the agencies in turn had to be approved by the U.S. Department of Education.</P>
<P>	As schools became more dependent upon federal funds, the character of the 
accrediting agencies gradually changed. Control over funds gave them great leverage 
over colleges and universities. They became less collegial associations of institutions that 
testify publicly to the worthiness of a college, and more the rulers and regulators of these 
institutions. Now they are threatening to become the guardians of an ideological agenda 
and to advocate diversity standards and politically-correct curricula.</P>

<H3>Diversity over Quality</H3>
<P>	By 1988, with the rise of multiculturalism in academia, the threat was emerging in 
California. Our accreditor, the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC), 
began promoting more prescriptive standards. These included the following language: 
"The institution demonstrates its commitment to the increasingly significant role played 
by diversity of ethnic, social, and economic backgrounds among its members by making 
positive efforts to foster such diversity."</P>
<P>	Stephen Weiner, the executive director of WASC, wrote in the Chronicle of 
Higher Education that WASC's expectations for diversity "affect virtually every aspect 
of campus life, and, therefore, each of our accrediting standards." In one document, the 
new diversity policy is called "the cornerstone of a major new thrust." In other words, 
standards of integrity and academic quality no longer would form the sole basis for 
accreditation.</P>
<P>	The new policy was part of a national movement among accreditors to leverage 
their influence over federal funds on behalf of the cause of diversity. Specifically, the 
accreditors wanted to mandate race and gender preferences in hiring and admissions, as 
well as multiculturalism in the curriculum, on the grounds that they are intrinsic to 
academic quality.</P>
<P>	Colleges and universities began to worry about accreditation's new thrust. This 
concern was not without foundation. One school discovered that WASC evaluators were 
soliciting racial grievances from the faculty of a neighboring college. Another was told, 
in writing, that it had "failed to grasp the concept of diversity" and that its curricula 
would have to be "restructured." A third was ordered to alter the composition of its board 
of trustees and told that a religious profession required of its faculty was "not in 
conformity with [WASC's] expectations."</P>
<P>	Colleges where multiculturalism, feminist studies, and the like had been matters 
of internal dispute, to be resolved internally, became vulnerable to meddling by outsiders 
with a political agenda. Moreover, the traditional purposes of accreditation--frank, 
collegial criticism and public avowal of academic integrity--were undermined by the 
mistrust generated by this new agenda.</P>
<P>	The threat to our college was plain. If WASC meant what it was saying, it could 
not, in principle, accredit our college. In the eyes of the accreditors, Thomas Aquinas 
College is multiculturally incorrect.</P>
<P>	In a lengthy struggle, Thomas Aquinas College confronted WASC's usurpations. 
We rejected the diversity standards when we came up for reaccreditation in 1992. The 
accrediting team of scholars sent to visit the college came away impressed with our high 
academic standards; in response, WASC reaffirmed our accreditation for eight years. 
When WASC circulated to its members a policy statement purporting to clarify its brief 
and vague standards on diversity, Thomas Aquinas College took the lead in raising 
objections and mobilizing opposition. Other institutions, including the California Institute 
of Technology, the University of Southern California, and Stanford, joined us in 
expressing alarm at the WASC statement. Although WASC formally adopted that 
controversial statement, it now requires colleges only to "thoughtfully engage" the issue 
of diversity.</P>

<H3>The Empire Strikes Back</H3>
<P>	Unfortunately, the story does not end there. Education lobbyists and bureaucrats, 
led by Robert H. Atwell of the American Council on Education, are launching a 
counteroffensive. Atwell co-chairs an ad hoc group called the National Policy Board on 
Higher Education Institutional Accreditation (NPB), which advocates a national 
accreditation organization to police the regional groups and any possible competitors. It is 
being packaged as a way to resist federal regulatory overreach into academia. Don't 
believe it.</P>
<P>	NPB is proposing an organization with unprecedented accrediting clout. It would 
set national standards for all institutional accreditors--in effect, all the agencies that the 
Department of Education uses to determine eligibility for federal money. The 
organization would be both "more specific" in its standards and "more rigorous" in its 
processes. It would establish its own budget, levy dues to be collected by the regional 
accrediting agencies, and wield the authority to impose sanctions against accrediting 
agencies that fail to enforce its standards. This would be the closest thing the nation has 
ever had to a national ministry of education.</P>
<P>	How would Thomas Aquinas, or any college with a distinct mission, fare under 
such a scheme? What would happen to the quality of American higher education?</P>
<P>	The answers are clear from the proposed organization's core standards, which 
include diversity. There is good reason to believe that this new board would promote 
diversity standards nationwide. In fact, the very existence of schools grounded in a 
clearly defined academic philosophy would be at great risk. Atwell has written that 
"diversity among institutions does not satisfy the need for diversity within institutions." 
In other words, colleges and universities whose curricula are specifically dedicated to the 
"great books," a traditional liberal-arts curriculum, a theological focus, or any other 
coherent body of belief would be subject to the multicultural whims of a remote 
bureaucracy.</P>
<P>	Such diversity also could be applied to the internal, everyday workings of all 
institutions that rely upon accreditation: student and faculty composition, trustee 
membership, allocation of resources, and on and on. Atwell has advocated a 
"comprehensive approach that encompasses the makeup of the faculty, student body, and 
staff; the curriculum offered by the institution; and the climate on the campus itself." 
Such a vision invites not diversity, but rather a leveling of the very differences in 
academic emphasis and philosophy that have helped create the finest educational non-
system in the world.</P> 
<P>	Opposition to the new accrediting entity is growing. Among others, American 
University, Boston University, Baylor, Caltech, Holy Cross, John Hopkins, Pepperdine, 
Rice, Stanford, Smith, the University of Dallas, the University of Southern California, the 
University of Missouri, and the University of Vermont all oppose the plan. Congressmen 
William Goodling (R-PA), chairman of the House Economic and Educational 
Opportunities Committee, and Howard McKeon (R-CA), chairman of its higher 
education subcommittee, have written to Education Secretary Richard Riley: "We would 
certainly oppose any attempt to use accreditation--to impose standards unrelated to the 
fiscal interests of American taxpayers which could force schools to change their nature or 
their mission."</P>
<P>	It is not enough, however, to defeat the nationalization plan or fight WASC to a 
stalemate. A genuinely open and collegial system of accreditation, one that allows 
governments to catch fraud and abuse and yet steers clear of political correctness, is 
clearly needed. Like most college presidents, I would prefer to devote my energies to the 
growth and prosperity of my college, to its unique curriculum, and to its ardent, inquiring 
students.</P>
<P>	My experience with accreditation leads me to suggest a policy of decentralization 
and reform to protect the diversity of ideas, programs, and institutions that has served our 
republic so well over centuries.</P>

<H3>An Outline for Reform</H3>
<P>	First, it is essential to restrain the federal government's impulse to govern higher 
education. The federal government may want to promote college and university 
education, for example through subsidies for student loans. But federal aid should permit 
individual students and their families maximum choice, and leave schools free of 
burdensome and possibly ideological regulations.</P>
<P>	Liberal education, with its historical roots in religion and philosophy, deals in 
those ultimate questions that the  American political tradition leaves to associations other 
than the government. That is why, when the G.I. Bill provided federal dollars, the 
gatekeeping function was assigned to non-governmental accrediting agencies.</P> 
<P>	Second, non-governmental accreditation in its present form--regional monopolies 
like WASC--should confine itself to screening out incompetence and fraud. An 
accrediting agency is not, and cannot be, purely private, since it can shut off federal 
money. Recognizing this power, it must show proper restraint. In the short run, such a 
modest role, in which any criticism is non-binding, is less open to abuse than any form of 
regulation, particularly regulation by state governments, which sometimes serve as 
strongholds of the diversity forces.</P>
<P>	The most lasting way to forestall abuse is to break the monopoly. Federal policy 
should therefore favor the formation of high-quality, alternative accreditation agencies, 
perhaps tailored to institutional types: research universities, liberal-arts colleges, or, to 
address the latest outbreak of academic intimidation, pro-life medical schools. Such 
agencies, being genuinely voluntary, can better accommodate their members than one-
size-fits-all monopolies whose standards must measure institutions as diverse as institutes 
of psychology, comprehensive universities, liberal-arts colleges, and research 
universities. Colleges would have an incentive to earn recognition from truly 
independent, private accreditors, since their approval would mean something. The 
resulting competition and emulation would promote quality much more effectively than 
the present system.</P>
<P>	Third, a limited intervention against rogue accreditors who misuse their delegated 
powers can be useful, at least until the monopolies are effectively broken. One instance of 
prudent intervention occurred when Lamar Alexander, then U.S. Secretary of Education, 
restrained the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools when it tried to bully 
Baruch College and Westminster Theological Seminary into accepting diversity 
standards. But it is better to fashion one's own freedom, as we have tried to do within 
WASC, or as would result from the emergence of alternative accreditors.</P>
<P>	Centralization of regional accreditors is exactly the wrong way to go. It was an 
enormous labor for us to alert some of the 145 schools in WASC to the threats posed by 
regional bureaucracy. I seriously doubt that a stronger bureaucratic organization based in 
Washington, D.C., with a membership in the thousands, could ever be moved with a 
similar effort.</P>
<P>	I understand the desire for accountability when federal funds are involved, and I 
understand the natural ambition on the part of the new Congress to reform from the top 
down, but I think it should be resisted. We should remember what happened to the 
national history standards in Goals 2000. First proposed by Lynne Cheney, the head of 
the National Endowment of the Humanities under President Bush, they were hijacked by 
the educators commissioned to execute the project. At the same time, we should move to 
prevent the centralization of the accrediting process.</P>
<P>	The existing national educational bodies that offer to implement reforms tend to 
support fads like the diversity movement, and will try to regiment independent schools. 
Such centralization brought us mandatory training in abortion procedures among 
accredited medical schools.</P>
<P>	We must not set up a shadow national ministry of education under the guise of 
privatization, efficiency, or better standards.</P>
<P>	Its bureaucrats will be no better than government bureaucrats, and even less 
accountable. Above all, colleges and universities will merit the trust of the public and the 
government if they hold true to the timeless standards enunciated by St. Thomas Aquinas 
seven centuries ago: "The study of philosophy is not directed to the various opinions of 
men, but to the truth of things." Truth, not diversity, is the goal of education.</P>

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">P</FONT></B>arents and politicians tend to blame the education establishment for the sorry 
state of learning in American public schools. The educrats are not taking this lying down. 
They've found their own scapegoat: parents. Public-school boosters have decided that lax 
parental involvement is the reason children fail. And so some have begun turning the 
schools into Big Mother.</P> 
<P>	The newest trend in education "reform" is the inclusion of parental-education 
programs and curricula that require parental involvement in student activities. President 
Clinton's Goals 2000, enacted last year, includes an entire section on "parental 
assistance," also called "parent training." Some schools even require parents to sign a 
pledge that they will perform assigned, pseudo-educational tasks, which could include 
playing "Simon Says" or rolling cookie dough with their third-grader.</P>
<P>	Of course parents should be involved in their children's education. And, of 
course, problems at home--messy divorces, absent fathers--can cause problems for 
children at school. But the "parent education" movement seeks to blame all parents for 
academic failure, not just parents who are neglecting their kids or destroying their own 
families. The movement does not seek to make parents more demanding of their children, 
nor, no surprise, of the schools. To the contrary, new curricula urge parents to be 
nurturing and uncritical--sort of the way public-school officials would like parents to 
treat them.</P>
<P>	This philosophy is becoming institutionalized in California. Consider the math 
curriculum rated most highly--a perfect 100 percent--by a state education panel that 
chooses which textbooks should qualify for state subsidies. "Investigations in Numbers, 
Data and Space," from the Dale Seymour Publications Series, appealed to the panel 
because it included home assignments that require parental involvement.</P>

<H3>New New Math</H3>
<P>	Under this curriculum--call it New New Math--which eschews rigorous 
memorization of multiplication tables, teachers send home periodic "Dear Family" 
missives to third-grade parents with the following advice:</P>
<UL><LI>  "Don't worry if your child doesn't use a ruler accurately yet--it's a skill that will 
develop over time, with more and more opportunities to measure."<BR>
<LI>  "Children have very interesting ways to figure out these problems. You can help by 
asking your child to tell you how he or she got an answer. There are many ways to do 
these problems--and no single `right' way. What's important for your child to know is 
how his or her own way works."<BR>
<LI>  "When your child has an assignment to do at home--such as collecting data about the 
ages of pets and oldest relatives--offer your help, and ask your child about what he or 
she is doing in class."<BR>
<LI>  "There is one thing we ask you not to do. We won't be using some of the step-by-step 
methods of addition and subtraction in this unit that may be familiar to you--nor will we 
be teaching borrowing or carrying. All too often, we have found that children this age 
memorize these step-by-step procedures and do not learn how to apply the processes of 
addition and subtraction. This year we will support students in developing several 
strategies for adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing, and we prefer that they do 
not memorize a single set of procedures."</UL>

<H3>Educational Relativism</H3>
<P>	This New New Math adds up to a new way of letting schools off the hook for not 
teaching children. It's not enough that we have moral relativism in English and Social 
Studies. Now we have it in math, too.</P>
<P>	The Dale Seymour third-grade program instructs parents to "make roll-out 
cookies with your child" to explore shapes, include children in family math decisions 
(such as how many floor tiles to buy) and explore "fair shares," which is politically-
correct educratese for "sharing food." Clearly the intent of these instructions is to force 
parents to spend quality time--at least as defined by educrats.</P>
<P>	So what's wrong with that? Supporters argue that parents, especially single 
parents, may not spend enough quality time with their children and would benefit from 
programs that nudge them to do so. But not all parents need this nudge, and some object 
to the schools' sledgehammer approach. And many may object to a pervasive touchy-
feely, there's-no-such-thing-as-a-wrong-answer attitude being foisted upon parents.</P>
<P>	In Petaluma, California, a mandatory high-school course called Human 
Interaction, or HI!, has provoked an angry reaction from some parents.</P> 
<P>	They resent take-home assignments that tell them how to be parents. The 
program's take-home and in-class "teen/parent" worksheets have included these queries 
for ninth-graders:</P>
<UL><LI>  Whether "how much money your parents make" is a private issue or can be discussed in 
class.<BR>
<LI>  Whether any "close relatives" has ever suffered "alcoholism" or "mental illness."<BR>
<LI>  Whether students "feel OK about crying" and "allow" themselves to do so.<BR></UL>
<P>	Other questions explore whether students recycle, eat fast food, use public 
transportation and "accept the way [they] feel about things."</P>
<P>	According to administrators, the course is a hit with kids. You can see why. No 
boring memorization or flexing of the gray cells here. Student assignments encourage 
teens to go with their feelings. "Denying" them, they are told, is passive behavior. A class 
worksheet on "family systems" assures teens that "open" families are "`pure' 
democracy," while "closed" families are "hierarchal."</P>
<P>	Federal law prohibits schools from asking children for highly personal 
information without parents' permission. The district explains that teens are meant to fill 
out the worksheets for their own private use, but at least two teachers in Petaluma told 
students to turn in signed worksheets. And Stephen Collins, the assistant superintendent 
of the Petaluma School District, admitted last fall that, once such worksheets are passed 
out, it is very likely that these topics will be discussed in class.</P>
<P>	Petaluma parents Jay and Tura Avner pulled their two children from HI!. "They 
want to be surrogate parents," Tura Avner complains. She especially resents the district's 
assumption that "unless the schools taught me how to manage my kids, they'd be running 
wild in the streets."</P>
<P>	But the Avners' efforts to liberate their children have not been easy. The district 
would not assign the Avners' son to an alternative, academic class. Instead, he was forced 
to be a counselor's aide for that period. Worse, the district dragged its feet for months 
before granting a "waiver" from this program. So much for "voluntary" parental 
education.</P>
<P>	District administrators sometimes insinuate that dissenters are right-wing religious 
fanatics. These days, that is a standard response to complaints. State law allows parents to 
pull their children from classes for reasons of religious belief or moral conscience. The 
Petaluma district, however, wouldn't let parents remove their children without a fight. 
Last year, the superintendent's cabinet, the district counsel, and HI! officials crafted a 
waiver form requiring parents to list their "reason(s) why they did not want their children 
to attend, and declare that they would provide appropriate alternative educational 
experiences" on HI! topics. This tactic clearly was designed to prompt parents with 
religious objections to proclaim themselves, giving administrators potential grist for the 
anti-fundamentalist mill. Yet California law clearly protects parents' right to keep private 
their reasons for objecting to a class.</P>
<P>	The kicker: Until the Rutherford Institute, a religious-freedom advocacy group, 
threatened a lawsuit, the district proposed that parents sign the waiver forms "under 
penalty of perjury." The penalty for perjury in California is a jail term of up to four years. 
Was the district planning to arrest parents who don't teach their children recycling? "I 
don't know that we were going to do anything," assistant superintendent Collins 
explained at the time. "We knew that when we went into this it was going to be revised."</P>
<P>	Collins was forthcoming in his defense of HI!'s "individual growth, physical 
growth, and social growth" curriculum. It is "pretty generally believed," he said, that 
most parents don't communicate with their children. Then there's the if-schools-don't-
teach-this-children-will-die argument. Collins explained that the board determined that 
HI! "was a matter of life and death." "If students don't have the tools to deal with the 
pressures" and destructive elements in life, he said, the board feared teens "would make 
the wrong choices and it would be fatal."</P>
<P>	This thinking betrays a strong anti-parent bent. Parents, apparently, fail to instill 
their children with self-esteem or AIDS awareness, so the schools must fill the void. 
Educrats have concluded that children who ignore their oafish parents' words on, say, 
safe sex will miraculously heed their teachers. Worse, HI! assumes that teens will build 
more self-esteem by talking about their feelings than by learning to speak a foreign 
language or play a musical instrument.</P>
<P>	Similarly, New New Mathmeisters seem to have a Rousseauesque view that 
children will grasp math intuitively if not distracted by narrow-minded parents or 
teachers. For example, the California math-curriculum panel disapproved of exercises 
that are "generally under the direction of the teacher." That Californian teachers' unions 
have supported this shows how far they have moved from their support of traditional 
pedagogy.</P>

<H3>Why Have Schools?</H3>
<P>	Maureen DiMarco, Governor Pete Wilson's education adviser and a critic of the 
New New Math, is baffled by this natural-learning approach. If kids learn so well by 
themselves, she asks, why have schools? "The assumption that, if children wander 
aimlessly they will automatically find all the prizes that are out there educationally is 
totally ludicrous," she says.</P>
<P>	Despite the rhetoric about parental involvement, administrators favor things that 
parents don't like. A poll by Public Agenda found that 86 percent of respondents want 
students to learn arithmetic "by hand" before they use calculators. But a 1993 survey 
found that 82 percent of math educators thought that "early use of calculators will 
improve children's problem-solving skills and not prevent the learning of arithmetic."</P>
<P>	If educators want parents to be involved in public education, it certainly isn't 
because teachers and administrators value their views. Parents in the Los Angeles Unified 
School District and elsewhere complain they have been systematically frozen out of 
power in school-based councils. The message: Be seen and not heard.</P>
<P>	And maybe cough up some money for a field trip, books, or computers.</P>
<P>	New New Math programs effectively freeze parents out in another way. Even as 
New New Math mavens ostensibly increase parental involvement, many new curricula 
don't even include textbooks. "The concept of what they mean by parental involvement 
in these materials implies the parents should be involved," says DiMarco, "but then tells 
parents not to impose their own math learning styles and knowledge on their children. 
And worst of all, when the student doesn't get what is going on in class and the parent 
has to help with the homework, too often the parent will be confronted with only a 
worksheet. There is no textbook that explains the work to be done--leaving the parent 
and the student without another alternative than just the teacher's explanation."</P>
<P>	Sadly, parents are often the first to embrace parental education, even if their 
parents rarely helped them. A generation ago, it was believed that children learned best 
by working through their studies on their own. Somewhere along the way, educrats 
abandoned that notion and began to insist that parents assist with the homework.</P>
</P>	In addition, the proliferation of AIDS, teen pregnancy, and single-parent families 
have led many to demand that schools take on responsibilities that parents 20 or 30 years 
ago would never have dreamed of giving up. Today, the generation that believed in 
questioning authority is asking the authorities to raise their kids.</P>

<H3>Wrong Target</H3>
<P>	Brace yourselves--things may grow worse. Petaluma has begun a pilot program 
for grade-school counseling called SUCCESS, an acronym for "Self Understanding Can 
Create Everlasting Secure Selves." Counselor Susi Brodie told the <I>Petaluma Argus-
Courier</I> that counseling children often involves counseling parents.</P>
<P>	Big Mother's attention wrongly falls upon functioning families. Neglectful 
parents aren't going to roll out the cookie dough to teach shapes; only families who 
already bond with their children will. Troubled students largely lack structure, not 
attention.</P>
<P>	Two years ago, I rode in a van operated by the San Juan Unified School District, 
in Sacramento. The 35-foot van housed the district's mobile Student Attendance Review 
Board (S.A.R.B.). According to Carolynn Salter, the district's child welfare and 
attendance counselor, the district purchased a van for S.A.R.B. hearings because parents 
frequently failed to show up for their children's truancy hearings.</P>
<P>	The four students the van visited that day were in elementary school. One 
kindergartner had missed 57 days, while his second-grade sister had missed 66. Their 
prognosis was frightful: They were both to be kept back a grade. The boy couldn't even 
use scissors.</P>
<P>	Schools and government should intervene in such clear-cut cases of severe child 
neglect. But Big Mother does not have the stomach to deal with these messes. A bill 
sponsored by the late B.T. Collins, a GOP assemblyman, that would have ended welfare 
benefits for parents with truant children never made it out of committee.</P>
<P>	Instead of getting tough with parents who don't provide their children with basic 
needs--nutrition, shelter, education, stability--the schools have turned their attention 
where it is needed least. </P>
<P>	They target parents who provide for their children and are well-meaning and 
gullible enough to be taken in by faddish curricula. The parental-involvement movement 
seeks to teach parents to  value self-esteem over academics. This is a clever ploy by a 
system that is shortchanging American children. </P>
<P>	As happens in so many areas these days, the government is treating good people 
like bad people, while letting the worst problems fester.</P>

<h3> Making Regulatory Reform A Reality</h3>
<b>By <a href="/heritage/staff/antonel.htm">Angela Antonelli</a>, Hon. <a href="#mcintosh">David McIntosh</a>, <a href="#smith">Fred Smith</a>, and Dr. <a href="#graham">John Graham</a>.</b>
<p>
A Heritage Foundation Symposium, given January 31, 1996.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>ANGELA ANTONELLI:</b> For supporters of regulatory reform, 1995 was both frustrating and disappointing. What began as promise in the Contract With America became a series of reform bills that called for, among other things, the use of sound science and cost-benefit analysis in regulatory decisionmaking. These bills moved rapidly through the House in early 1995 only to wither and die in the Senate late last year.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the Senate debates, supporters of regulatory reform found themselves losing the public relations battle, unable to keep themselves from being portrayed as extremists with a goal of rolling back decades of environmental, health, and safety protections, and desirous of a renewed effort to pollute America and make it unsafe. Alarmists succeeded in convincing the public that a reformed regulatory system would offer less protection -- for example, women would be denied life-saving mammograms and our food supply would not be safe from deadly <I>e. coli</I> bacteria. And legislators could not respond effectively. What we need to help the American public understand is that regulatory reform means more protection, not less. During 1996, the challenge for think tanks, like Heritage, and the academic and the business community will be to figure out how we can get this message out to the public and reclaim the moral high ground in this debate.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The American people have not stopped wanting regulatory reform, but we need to help them understand that the goals of reformers are not different -- we want cleaner air and cleaner water -- but we can do it with less money and less government intervention. Today, the federal bureaucracy supports elaborate programs aimed at reducing tiny risks at huge costs to the taxpayer, while more serious dangers go neglected. At the same time, this huge misallocation of resources means these resources are not available for other purposes -- for example, the local community that must spend millions of dollars to eliminate one chemical from its water supply that poses a negligible or non-existent risk to the public cannot spend this money to put police on the streets or build a school.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Helping people put daily risks in perspective is one of the challenges we face in making regulatory reform a reality. As Dr. Graham points out, today people are suffering from what can be called a "syndrome of paranoia and neglect" about the potential dangers to their health, safety, and the environment. Risk regulation is responsible for the bulk of the nation's $600 billion in annual regulatory costs, particularly those rules affecting the environment. Dr. Graham's work with Dr. Tammy Tengs recently has shown us that a reallocation of resources to more cost-effective programs could save an additional 60,000 lives per year at no increased cost to taxpayers or industry. 60,000 lives!  And we can also save $31 billion. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 We need to help the public understand that the benefits of regulatory reform can be significant. Reformers need to point out that their reforms and solutions actually save more lives. The challenge now is to get reform back on track to accomplish this. And our distinguished panelists can help us understand how we can do this.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
<b>THE HONORABLE DAVID MCINTOSH</b>: Thank you, Angela. I appreciate it, and I appreciate the hard work you have done in this area, both while you were in the Administration and now at Heritage. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I wanted to share with you my perspective on where we've been recently and where we should be going. Speaker Gingrich often uses military analogies to inspire us in the Republican Conference. If I can borrow one of his, I would say that we're somewhere between the Battle of Britain and getting ready to lay the groundwork for Normandy on the question of regulatory reform, which is to say we've come past the crisis stage and have every opportunity in front of us to lay plans for the major siege that will give us the final victory in eliminating unnecessary regulations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I think last year solidified the change in the debate. The Republicans, in the Contract With America, made regulatory reform a key part of their agenda, and the President returned to some of his discussions of the work he had done with Vice President Gore on regulatory reform in their government review. The question is no longer whether we should have regulatory reform, use cost-benefit analysis, or use good science, but how to do that. And that's a major victory for us; we should take stock and be glad about what we have accomplished. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
President Clinton has done one thing that I think is throwing us off guard, and that is raising the issue of the environment and doing it in a very emotional way. His Clean Water Act statement over the summer is probably the classic: He pointed to something everyone who understood the bill knew would not happen -- that we would start having dirtier streams and waters in this country -- and said, "I'm going to stop that."  This made it appear as if there is more going on than what was really happening. Our job is to communicate with the American people and tell them where we want to take environmental protection in this country and our vision of how to do that. I'll talk more about that later, because I think it's a fundamental issue for us. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Politically, we have a very good coalition. We have the Republican majority, with even many of the moderates agreeing with us on the fundamentals of regulatory reform, and we have the conservative Democrats; the "blue-dog" Democrats are very much on our side on these issues and want to participate actively, to help write the bills and help carry them in the Congress. In the Senate, we're still evolving in that majority. I think we have a numerical majority of 50 plus, but they have different rules, and we do not yet have that supermajority of 60 votes to pass a substantial bill.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I think we must return to the basic principles that have been successful for us. We need to explain regulatory reform in terms of what it does for the average American. Reform will help us create more jobs; it will help us get more products; it will lead to a healthier health system; it will help small businesses be more productive and be able to be competitive. I think we need to search out examples of how the current regulatory system works against us. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I talk with people back home in Indiana about working in a foundry. I put myself through college, and I point out that that foundry is now closed down because they could not afford all costs of compliance of the Clean Air Act Amendments. Two hundred people are out of a job, and their families are affected. It has had a terrible effect on the community. I talk about some of the people I have met in hearings, for example, when we looked at FDA's review process. We heard from a wonderful little 8-year-old girl who is a hydrocephalic child, and she is alive because of a miracle of science. They have a shunt that drains the fluid from the back of her head; it's made out of silicone, and the manufacturers are saying they're no longer going to make that shunt because FDA has still not said that silicone is safe for use in the human body. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
These are real regulations having real effects on real people, and we need to continue to paint a picture for the American people about why regulation and regulatory reform are so important. We also need to articulate our principles about using free markets, return to private property rights, use flexible rather than the command-and-control approaches, and explain how our vision of those processes will lead to a better result, including better safety, better health, and a better record on the environment. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This leads me to the key area -- the environment -- where I think we need to more effectively articulate our position. Republicans must lay out their vision of environmental protection. We should start by explaining that in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, as we turned towards the goal of protecting the environment in this country, we did what the Soviet Union did. It used a command-and-control approach, made tremendous strides forward, changed from a peasant economy into a manufacturing economy, but at great cost in individual liberty. And what we now see is that if we continue down that route of a command-and-control approach we run the risk of going the way of the Soviet Union, where the structure collapses in on itself. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
So if we want to have a truly good record of protecting the environment, we need to follow the same principles we follow in the economic world, where you use free markets, you use property rights as the foundation of your policies. I think we can prove empirically that this will deliver a better result on the environment. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Superfund is an example of how a command-and-control approach with significant litigation has failed. I often describe to people an example in Indianapolis of a company called the Heritage Group that has set up a manufacturing process that uses the waste product from Thompson Electronics' etching process. They etch copper and turn it into a computer board that they put in the back of their television sets. The waste product is a fluid highly enriched in copper. The Heritage Group takes that fluid, extracts the copper, and turns it into a food supplement that the pork producers in Indiana use. It's actually better than the existing food supplement for copper.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Now, EPA and the local EPA officials say they love this. They want to see more of it happening. Nationally, they say, "Well this looks like recycling, and our rule is if it's recycling you have to meet all of the federal requirements."  At that point, it's uneconomical, and the company says, "Sorry, we're not going to set up a plan."  Locally, officials say, "Well, maybe we'll take 10 percent of the waste stream, dilute it, and throw it down the drain, and then we don't have to meet the requirements because it's not really recycling."  Now that's nuts. It's nuts from a financial basis; it's nuts from an environmental basis; and I think we need to explain to people that our system is failing on its own terms to protect the environment. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Let me mention what I think will happen in some areas in Congress this year. We have the Contract bills, which are essentially cost-benefit analysis and risk assessments. We've finished those in the House; we have a very good product, one we can be proud of. We had good support and sponsors from the Senate; Don Nickles worked hard, and Senator Dole took the lead on that bill. But getting to that elusive 60th vote has been nearly impossible, and I suppose it won't happen in this Congress because the opposing forces each time will find some reason to pull back on that 60th vote. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Now, what do we do?  Do we simply take that issue to the voters in the next election, or do we try to get some parts of our regulatory reform agenda through?  The leaning now in the House and the Senate is to get a consensus bill through and see what we can do. I'd like some of your input on this. The notions that they're talking about are the codification of judicial intervention in the small business protection bill and regulatory review, some form of a sunset bill, and some form of Senator Nickles's bill, which changes the Senate process for reviewing regulations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
All of those are good things. They put on the table cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment, and I think we need to make an evaluation: Do we take these now and put them into law?  The President would likely sign them. The cost is a political one in that we allow our opponents to have a pro-regulatory relief vote. Are we able to do that and nonetheless articulate to the voters next year in the election that this is only part of the agenda, and there are many more fundamental things we need to do?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What about the agency-by-agency and program-by-program regulatory reform bills?  I think you're going to see more pressure for this Congress to deliver on an OSHA reform bill. Labor unions are fighting that very strongly, obviously, but that is the one area where I hear, particularly from small businesses, that they still have an increasing sense of frustration. In addition, I'm getting reports that FDA, in its administrative decisionmaking, has done an about-face, that they've been much more cooperative with medical device and drug manufacturers. I still believe there are fundamental flaws in the system that we have now, and it is because FDA has to have a checkoff at every step of the way in manufacturing in granting the approval of products. We need to keep the pressure up on that, but I think we also need to acknowledge that things are getting better than they were when there was no pressure from Congress. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
On Superfund, I think there's a good chance for a bill that will make substantial reforms. I think this must be a key element of our Republican agenda on the environment. There are a couple of other important parts of this agenda. We have debated within the House Republicans on whether we should go forward with reform of the Endangered Species Act. I prefer Rep. John Shadegg's market-oriented approach, and it is one of the most principled approaches that has been supported by work that Heritage has done over the years. I can't tell you that it's going to be the majority view, however; at this point, it's very much up for debate. Also, Corrections Day will give us a pre-procedure to pull out some of these individual items, and I would like to have help identifying areas for Corrections Day, helping move them through the Senate, and publicizing the results. We have a record number of bills that were passed last year. We need to use the process and continue to show action on a case-by-case basis.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Finally, I wanted to preview with you where I think we're going to be active in our subcommittee. We've had strategic planning meetings in the last few weeks. I want our subcommittee to be the driving engine for regulatory reform and making the public case for it. The key mechanism we have for that is oversight to show how the agencies fail in their mission and create problems. We will strive to develop a report card on how the Clinton Administration agencies have performed on regulatory reform. I would like to incorporate in that a survey of the outside regulated community. We don't have the resources to do it, so it would have to be conducted by people on the outside. I think we need to be fair -- to acknowledge where progress has been made and commend people. You can get some things by rewarding people for good changes, but I think we also need to be fair in our assessment when we feel the agencies have not gone far enough.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
We should adapt the concept Senator Proxmire made very successful for exposing government waste and spending -- the Golden Fleece Award -- for regulatory excesses. We should highlight agency enforcement or regulatory decisions that, when exposed to the light of day, the American public says is nuts. We've been trying to gather those in my subcommittee. Our most recent fax told us how, in New Mexico, a 14-year-old boy was lost with his scout troop when he was hiking and had been in the woods for two or three days. They sent out a search helicopter. The local police found him and radioed a request to land in the forest and pick up the boy and rescue him. Astonishingly enough, the answer came back negative: This is an area where we can't have any mechanized vehicles; you can't land to do this. What they did do is drop a note that said stay there, and we'll send somebody. When the search teams on land couldn't find him and did more environmental damage than the helicopter would have done, they finally sent back the helicopter and pulled the kid out of there. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This is a ridiculous policy, and it's what the American public is fed up with in government regulations and in the administration of these programs. These are the types of policies we need to identify and expose to ridicule. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Let me just close on a note of optimism. I do think we are at the point of being able to have the fundamental change in the regulatory process that we've been searching for over the years, and I'm very optimistic that public support will be there if we do the right thing in terms of framing the issue in a way that is relevant for the average person. We are also going to need a forceful response to the environmental attack, and I think we can present one that says we can protect the environment better with our principles than the Administration can with its command-and-control approach. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thank you all for letting me come. I really appreciate your work.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <b>FRED SMITH</b>: When David was talking about the military analogies most appropriate to the debate that just took place on the Hill, he mentioned the battle of Britain and the Normandy invasion. Between those two events, as some of you know, there was the abortive incident in which several Canadian divisions were wiped out as we prematurely assaulted a position we were not in place to take. I think we learned from that, also. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A question we need to ask is why a modest bipartisan House bill bogged down in the Senate and then was filibustered to death. At best, the bill required only that government regulators state whether their regulations do more good than harm --sort of a Hippocratic oath for regulators. More important: Why did such a modest reform get such bad press?  Anyone who watches television or monitors the media knows the way this issue was characterized: Mad-dog Republican ideologists join with robber-baron capitalists to regain the right to add poison to baby food bottles. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
That was the bad news. The good news was that we got 58 votes in the U.S. Senate, which suggests two things. One is that the pressures to reform regulations are real and they are growing. We are on the right side of history in this area. The second is that we better become considerably more skillful at marketing and explaining what it is we're about. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I would argue that the environmental debate today is roughly where the welfare policy debate was, say, ten years ago. Then, most felt that the welfare state was cumbersome, costly, bureaucratic, even unsuccessful, yet still necessary. Private alternatives were regarded as largely inadequate to the critical task of helping the nation's poor. If you wanted to help the poor ten years ago, you had to accept and somehow improve the welfare state. The result was reform proposals largely limited to "good government," tinkering at the edges, trying to make the system work a little bit better. The conservative response to the welfare state was to make it more efficient, more effective. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Things have changed. Time and analysis by such scholars as Charles Murray and Marvin Olasky have made more evident the perversities of the welfare state and the value of private charity. Today, the rhetoric of the welfare reform debate focuses on moving beyond, not saving, the welfare state and revitalizing, not ridiculing, the voluntary sector. Our goal should be to accelerate the same shift in the environmental area, to begin to go through the same "re-paradigming" of the situation to make it possible to subject environmental policy to the same scrutinizing debate we're finally achieving in the welfare area. To that end, we must meet three challenges. First, we must move beyond good government reform measures; second, we must develop in much more detail the analytic basis for reform; and third -- and most important -- we must learn how to communicate in a political world. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The first challenge, to repeat, is simply to recognize that tinkering is not enough, as you heard to some extent in the remarks of Congressman McIntosh. If federal regulation is not to destroy all our freedoms, we must find some way to discipline our regulatory leviathan. The bills that are pending in the Senate today, S. 343 and so forth, do not achieve that result. None of them really subjects regulation to the same level of scrutiny that we routinely subject spending bills to in the Congress -- and I don't think many of us are happy about the level of discipline we have on spending yet. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
An agency is created -- Interior, Agriculture -- and it goes forth and comes up with creative ideas on how to spend our money better. But that does not become public policy until those spending bills are sent to Congress and the Congress and the President positively affirm those decisions. Spending bills are subject to accountability; Congressmen have to decide whether to vote for or against these spending bills. Regulations are subject to none of that discipline. We create a new regulatory agency, we send it forth to think of good ideas about how to spend our money, and that's it. There is no formal vote by the Congress, and none really by the President himself.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The problem is that there's a pro-regulation bias in our system that has never been addressed. It's a loophole in the system. No one, I think, among the Founding Fathers believed federal regulation would ever become the massive leviathan it has become today, and unless we require regulatory accountability, all the procedural reforms in the world are likely to do very little good. We're working on that, Heritage is working on that, and a number of organizations are trying to come up with substantive reform measures. We have a lot more work to do. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The second challenge is advancing the analytic basis for reform. I'd like to call your attention to the deregulation battles in transportation in the 1970s. Those victories we did achieve were made possible by earlier analytic work that fell into roughly three areas. First, there were the traditional economic studies of the cost of regulation. Brookings and then AEI and a whole series of groups after that began to examine the cost of regulation, and their conclusion was essentially that government didn't work or was an extremely costly way to achieve sometimes important objectives. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The second kind of study was public choice, rent-seeking analysis which, in effect, undermined the moral legitimacy of transportation regulation. A series of studies found that the ICC was too easily captured by special interests. Building on this approach, <a href="http://www.cei.org">CEI</a>, along with Michael Greve of the <a href="/cir">Center for Individual Rights</a>, produced a book called <I>Environmental Politics</I>, which looked at the way rent-seeking explains much of environmental behavior (although anyone who lives in a city with Archer Daniels Midland and Dwayne Andreas, I think, probably understands that pretty well already). 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There also were case studies demonstrating the feasibility of a private alternative to the regulated transportation sector. California and Texas, as many of you know, had relatively deregulated air travel systems, and that provided some evidence as to what might happen if we moved to a deregulated environment. Private alternatives, the studies found, had been neglected and actually offered creative alternatives to the regulatory state. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There's been very little work of this sort on environmental issues, although the record of government failure is beginning to emerge. The wonderful book <i>EPA: Asking the Wrong Questions</I> is an example of what can be done, and we're doing a number of smaller studies. Superfund is a poster child of regulatory failure, but there has been far too little work demonstrating just how difficult it is to run an eco-socialist state as opposed to just a socialist state. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The research on rent-seeking as an explanation for much of our environmental policy is important because it affects the moral foundation of the regulatory state. In many ways, it is more important than the cost analysis done by think tanks and economist groups. But most important, and least adequately filled today, is the need for research on private alternatives to environmental regulation. Along these lines, CEI's Center for Private Conservation is developing case studies of how private people outside government -- although sometimes encumbered by government rules -- are playing extremely creative roles in expanding and advancing environmental goals. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The third challenge, and certainly the most important, is to develop a communication strategy which is relevant to the political marketplace. If we are to succeed, we must understand how people form opinions about political issues. I don't think this is well enough understood. As consumers in the private sector, when we buy a car, get married, purchase a house, or take a new job, we have every reason to gain some information about that decision, because the decision we make will directly affect our welfare. We are rationally informed in the private marketplace. We spend our energy to the point where the information we derive no longer makes our decision process more reasonable. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the political marketplace, we use that same calculus, but it leads to a quite different result. I can become informed about the Endangered Species Act; I can become informed about risk reform issues; I can spend a lot of time every night taking the <I>Federal Register</I> to bed with me to read laboriously. But whatever views I come to as an informed citizen have very little to do with what actually happens. The linkage between information and the opinions I form and what actually happens is very, very weak. I am one out of millions of Americans. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
America is not a democracy; it is an interest group democracy. It's important to realize the distinction. Some of you have seen the series in the <I>Washington Post</I> where they're very confused about people's lack of enthusiasm for big government and are trying to sort it out. One of the articles that appeared earlier this week was subtitled "Don't Know, Don't Care."  In it was a quote by Jay McCraken, 34, a technical advisor and part-time college student in Clinton, New Jersey: "It's time-consuming becoming informed. Nobody has the time to sit down and read <I>Time</I> every week to find out what the government's doing."  And this is an informed consumer. People don't have the time to deal with the details of government everyday. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Well, guess what: Jay isn't alone in that. Virtually all Americans form their opinions about policies in ways that are very low on the fact component and very high on the other component, and it's perfectly rational for them to do that. In a world of rational ignorance, we do not need an information-rich campaign; we need another kind of campaign. Facts don't form opinion, yet people certainly have them. What does form opinions?  Aaron Wildavsky and others have argued that values dictate most people's views about most political issues, and therefore we need a value-based communications strategy. Reagan understood that very, very well, and Clinton is a genius at this. Why can't conservatives get it? 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What values are we going to use in communicating?  Wildavsky, noting that very few cultures are homogeneous, suggested one useful framework. He had a category that some of you know: fatalist, hierarchalist, egalitarian, individualist. To understand, within this framework, what a values-based communication strategy might look like, let's look again at transportation regulation. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Initially, most Americans probably viewed transportation regulation, the creation of the ICC, as a good thing. Regulation appealed to individualists, to free-market types; it would expand choice by keeping the big boys from hogging all the traffic. Regulation appealed to hierarchalist conservatives, the good science types; it would make possible scientific management of our transportation system, eliminating wasteful competition. And, of course, regulation appealed also to egalitarians, progressives, liberals; it would be fairer to the poor and to rural citizens. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Well, experience and time and analysis eroded those beliefs. Deregulation is now possible and popular among liberals as well as conservatives. It's very important to recall that the transportation deregulation fight was led by Ralph Nader and Ted Kennedy, along with a lot of our types. The changes that happened in the transportation area were vital to economic deregulation as well as to the current rethinking of the welfare state. Our challenge is to conduct the research, education, and advocacy work that will make similar change possible in the environmental field. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Let me briefly analyze how we did not follow this strategy in the recent risk debate in the Senate. We reform types talk largely to ourselves; we made very little effort to reach out to anyone who thought regulation was a good idea. Indeed, the reform message may actually have made it easier for the liberals to mobilize themselves and to become an effective stymier of reform. In contrast, the pro-regulation side targeted clever messages that undermined much of the initial support for regulatory reform. What are the arguments about?  Judicial review?  That will mean more lawsuits, more bureaucracy, as Clinton told us. We don't want big government. They use our language, our rhetoric, our arguments to weaken our support  base for regulatory reform and reform in a number of other areas. They were extremely clever at taking our vocabulary and using value-based arguments to weaken our belief that regulatory reform was a good thing. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The lesson is clear: We must develop and target messages that, while strengthening our troops, also challenge the support base for regulation. We must dramatize the creative strengths of private conservation, private stewardship, private risk management. We must challenge egalitarians by focusing not on cost, but rather on the unfairness and absurdity of the regulatory state, as David has started doing. The rhetoric for that kind of value-based campaign was advanced by the late Aaron Wildavsky. He was the one who told us to talk in terms of risk versus risk as opposed to cost versus benefits, and wealthier is healthier rather than the cost of regulation to business, and to define our goal as a safer, not safe, society. How poor we are because of his loss. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Let me conclude. My suggestions really come down to three points. We must adopt a strategic reform agenda. We're going to get hammered anyway; we lose little by being bold. Our focus must be on regulatory accountability, not on regulatory assessment. Good ideas are important, and we should put forth the best ideas we have, not some watered down version that can persuade the current thinkers to accept them. We must develop a coherent and coordinated plan to dramatize the failure of the regulatory state to rectify its inherent corruption and to publicize the advocacy and creativity of private-sector alternatives. Finally, we must mount an extensive educational effort, including image-based documentaries, to clarify how regulations harm the poor, minorities, women, and the Third World. Some of you know CEI has recently produced FDA television and radio ads, a Science Under Siege documentary, and a risk communication film. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
These are a very small part of what we need to do in this area, and we even have an objective test of whether we'll be successful or not: When Senator Chaffee, Congressman Boehlert, and Greenpeace join Heritage and CEI in calling for the abolition of EPA, we will know we've won. But we have a ways to go. Thank you.
<p><a name="graham"><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>DR. JOHN GRAHAM</b>: Thank you very much. I don't think there's any more passionate advocate of regulatory reform than myself, but I'm very worried about where we are right now in the debate on regulatory reform. I want to share some of my concerns and really focus my remarks on the next year -- what we have to do to get this issue back on track -- and leave discussion of longer-term ideas, such as some of the ones Fred has on the table, until after 1996. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I will start with my experience last weekend. I spent two days at a National Wildlife Federation conference in New Hampshire, a so-called presidential candidates' forum sponsored by the National Wildlife Federation, where all the candidates were invited to come and discuss their approach to the problem of environmental health and regulatory reform. There were only two Republican candidates who showed up -- Congressman Bob Dornan and Alan Keyes -- and Vice President Al Gore and EPA Administrator Carol Browner came and gave passionate speeches. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I make it a point to go and listen carefully to people who feel very differently from me about issues. From the Vice President, we got the message that these people who say they want regulatory reform don't really want reform; they want relief for polluters and special interests. They say they want a smarter regulatory regime, more science, and more analysis, but want to cut back the budgets of these agencies by anywhere from 10 to 30 percent. What they really want to do is roll back 25 years of progress and protection. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
At the heart of what the speakers were arguing is that there's a value difference: The President cares about public health and the environment, but people who believe in regulatory reform don't. I think we have to address ourselves to the question of whether they will be successful in the next year in reinforcing this imprint they've tried to put in people's minds, and there is some rhetoric that people are using in the regulatory reform community that I think is very unfortunate and contributes to this problem. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
First is "regulatory relief."  I think that's a very unfortunate phrase. I think the public feels that we've had public health and environmental agencies at the federal level for 25 years, and we certainly want to have a very strong case before saying that they don't have a strong role to play. I think our message should be that we want smarter, more efficient regulation in order to get more protection at less cost; therefore, the word "relief" is entirely inappropriate. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Second, "free-market environmentalism" is an intellectually interesting and exciting concept, but in the next year I think it also will be too risky a concept, because I think it plays too much to the notion in people's minds that some of these reformers actually want to abolish EPA. I don't know whether it's true or not, but both of these speakers I referred to (Gore and Browner) named Congressmen in this town who had said they wanted to abolish the Environmental Protection Agency. Maybe we're going to get to that some day, but I don't think that's a helpful way to talk about these issues. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Third, we heard today about whether we should have the environment above people or people above the environment. I think this plays on the notion that somehow there's a big value difference between where they are and where reformers are: They really care about children's health more than reformers do, or they really care about the environment, about wilderness, about wildlife more than reformers do. I think that's a big mistake; reformers have to stay away from these kinds of generalizations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Now, what does this mean that we should do?  I think that if we're careful about our steps in the next year, we can make some very substantial progress in advancing the debate on this issue. On H.R. 9, we came through the House debate in very good shape, arguing on principle for sound science, comparative risk, cost versus benefit, and regulatory accountability, not only with Republican votes, but with 60 Democratic votes as well. In the Senate, we stalled, but look at what happened: We ended up with 54 out of 54 Republicans, but the Administration called up the troops and said, "Don't let it happen."  Then Senator Dole made a judgment, which seems to me a reasonable one, that we ought to let Democrats pay the price for that. How big the price is, frankly, depends on how this issue is managed in the next year. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What are the modest steps that we should take?  I think, first, that we need to design a couple of streamlined bills, not big regulatory reform bills, on a couple of key issues and get some more explicit votes on these issues. The first one is the basic concept of comparative risk: Do you believe that government agencies should put their resources on the biggest risks before the little ones and speculative ones?  We ought to make the case that if these agencies were smarter and more scientific, we could reallocate resources, save more lives, and do more for the environment at no increased cost to the taxpayer. As shown by the work of my colleague Tammy Tengs, we can save 60,000 additional lives per year at no increased cost. This basic principle of comparative risk, using our resources better, is one that I think we should force some votes on -- not linked to congressional review of regulations, not linked to costs and benefits, just that specific issue of comparing risks. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The second thing I think we ought to do is take President Clinton's executive order as it exists now -- it has some flaws, and I'd like it to be stronger, but it also has some basic principles that are sound -- and have an up-or-down vote on this executive order as a piece of legislation, as a forerunner of a broader and more ambitious program of regulatory reform. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I think we should ask ourselves, What will Vice President Gore do when confronted with these two prospects?  There are two options: Either vote in favor of these, and have basically a bipartisan consensus behind comparative risk and cost-benefit analysis, or vote no and then recast the debate. I think this is the more likely outcome, and I think it's a good outcome for the people who believe in regulatory reform because it will be clear that reformers share the values of public health and environmental protection but want to use science and economics to achieve them in a more efficient fashion. Reformers have the same values as they do, but can be smarter and more efficient in the way they accomplish these goals. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There are some things I think we should avoid and not do over the next year because they undermine our ability to focus a discussion around these two basic principles. First, I do not think we should cut back the budgets of agencies which are the targets of regulatory reform. I think a flat budget is the right way to deal with this in the next year or two, because we're going to be asking these agencies to do more with what they currently have in terms of budgets. In fact, I heard a rumor at this National Wildlife Federation meeting that President Clinton is hoping he can give in on a big cutback in the EPA's budget. Then someone in the campaign can claim, "Look, they want to have more responsibility for EPA, but then they want to cut them. Isn't that an indication that they really want relief, that they don't really want reform?"  I think some people are cynically hoping that these budget cuts will occur so they can claim that reformers caused a lot of blood-letting out there. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Second, on issues like OSHA reform and Clean Air Act reform, I think the basic message is that if we're smarter or more efficient, we can save more lives and protect the environment better. But the kinds of reforms that radical reformers have in mind require too much discussion in an election year to really get the point across. I don't think they're appropriate at this time. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Third, I think we should make concerted efforts on both the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Superfund law to get good, solid, incremental reform of these laws and, if possible, get them to the President's desk and get them signed. That gives the Republicans a clear record of passing pieces of environmental legislation that embody their principles of sound science, cost-benefit analysis, and risk assessment. By taking this incremental approach over the next year, I think reformers reinforce their commitment to fundamental public health and environmental values. We demonstrate the confidence of our leadership on issues that historically are not Republican issues, and at the same time we build momentum. We build our own morale as a movement to work for larger and more ambitious regulatory reforms at a later time. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In conclusion, I think that we are at a very important point in the movement for regulatory reform. The course we take at this point, and how we represent ourselves as a movement, will be very important in determining how we are portrayed in what we know will be a very vicious election-year campaign on these issues.

<title>SAVE LIVES BY CUTTING RED TAPE: REDEFINE THE FEDERAL ROLE IN WORKPLACE SAFETY AND HEALTH -- Heritage </title>

<h3><i> SAVE LIVES BY CUTTING RED TAPE: REDEFINE THE FEDERAL ROLE IN WORKPLACE SAFETY AND HEALTH</i></h3>
By Mark Wilson<br>
Rebecca Lukens Fellow in Labor Policy<br>
Backgrounder Update No. 259<br>
(Updating <i>Rolling Back Government: A Budget Plan to Rebuild America</i>, The Heritage Foundation, 1995.)<br>
September 5, 1995<br>
</center><p>

<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>
The 104th Congress is considering proposals to reform the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and merge it with the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA). The goal of these reforms is to redefine the federal government's role in workplace safety and health to "refocus the responsibility for ensuring worksite safety and health on the workplace."1  In recent years, the federal government has been perceived as more concerned with maintaining bureaucracies and filling out paperwork than with working cooperatively with businesses to make workplaces safer.
<p>
Although Congress intended for OSHA and MSHA to assure all workers safe and healthy working conditions, the effectiveness of these agencies in carrying out their missions is questionable. From rulemaking to enforcement, the regulatory nightmare that businesses face has made OSHA inspectors as feared as IRS auditors.2  Although most employers maintain relatively safe and healthy workplaces, OSHA maintains an adversarial approach to setting and enforcing standards. Consequently, many employers are reluctant to call OSHA for compliance assistance3 for fear of triggering punitive inspections. Further, the legal requirement that every mine be inspected four times a year makes it virtually impossible for MSHA to target enforcement resources where they are needed most -- mines with poor safety records. 
<p>
Merging MSHA with a reformed OSHA is a sensible first step toward improving workplace health and safety, limiting unnecessary government intervention, and reducing inefficient, wasteful government spending. The National Performance Review recognized that an army of OSHA inspectors is neither necessary nor likely given the federal budget situation, and MSHA's "lengthy approval process delays the introduction of new technologies that may improve mine safety."4  Businesses already have much stronger financial incentives than OSHA penalties, such as the costs of lost productivity, workers' compensation, and liability claims,5 to maintain and continually improve the safety of their workplaces. Thus, the role of the federal government should be redefined from that of heavy-handed regulator to one of cooperative partner.
<p>

<b>CURRENT REFORM INITIATIVES</b>
<p>
A number of bills have been introduced in both the House and the Senate to reform workplace health and safety programs. The leading bill in the House is H.R. 1834, the Safety and Health Improvement and Regulatory Reform Act of 1995, introduced by Representative Cass Ballenger (R-NC). In the Senate, Judd Gregg (R-NH) has introduced the Occupational Safety and Health Amendments of 1995 (S. 526), and Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) has introduced the Occupational Safety and Health Reform Act of 1995 (S. 592). Of these three bills, H.R. 1834 represents the most comprehensive OSHA reform. It also is the only bill that consolidates administrative overhead and ends duplicative costs by merging OSHA and MSHA.
<p>
Legislative changes are necessary to enable MSHA to allocate resources more efficiently and OSHA to work cooperatively with businesses -- for example, by making compliance assistance a permanent, central part of its program and mission. Efforts to reprioritize agency spending or administratively reinvent the agencies would change their bureaucratic culture only marginally and do little to consolidate administrative overhead and eliminate duplicative activities. President Clinton offered to reinvent OSHA after the 104th Congress announced its intention to create a more effective and efficient OSHA.6
<p>
In addition, President Clinton's proposed FY 1996 budget increased funding for compliance assistance by 23 percent while increasing overall OSHA spending by 10.9 percent. However, Congress can accomplish much more by fundamentally redefining the role of the federal government so that it recognizes and more effectively utilizes the incentives businesses already have to improve workplace health and safety.
<p>

<b>What Congress Should Do</b>
<p>
Significantly reform OSHA.
Although executive branch initiatives to reinvent workplace health and safety are welcome, statutory changes are required to redefine the federal government's role and ensure that congressional intent is carried out. Specifically,<P>
<ul>
<li><b>Reform OSHA's regulatory process.</b><br>
OSHA's bureaucratic culture and lawyers have put the search for completely risk-free workplaces and ease of prosecution above common sense. As a result, it can take ten or more years to complete a rule.7  OSHA's regulatory process would be more timely and less burdensome if it focused initially on hazards that pose the greatest risk to the most workers. The development of compliance directives should be made part of the rulemaking process and tied directly to economic analysis. Far too often, compliance directives are more burdensome than the rules themselves. OSHA also should be required to reassess the actual costs and benefits of its regulations after five years.
<p>

<li><b>Enhance and expand compliance assistance.</b><br>
Translating OSHA's confusing jumble of regulations into safer workplaces is difficult at best. Most employers want safe and healthy workplaces if OSHA will just tell them how. Unfortunately, the Department of Labor is more concerned with prosecuting employers than with providing accurate, reliable compliance information. Explicitly redefining OSHA's mission towards compliance assistance will leverage employers' desire for safety and dramatically improve workplace safety and health.
<P>
<li><b>Allow inspectors to issue first instance warnings for hazards that do not pose an imminent danger.</b><br>
OSHA continues its adversarial approach to standard setting and enforcement. Many employers are reluctant to call OSHA for assistance in making their workplaces safer for fear of triggering punitive inspections. First instance warnings will remove a major barrier to voluntary compliance.
<p>
<li><b>Require OSHA inspectors to have some expertise in the industry they are inspecting.</b><br>
OSHA inspectors are called upon to inspect a variety of workplaces, many of which, like mining, involve complex operations.8  Employers and employees deserve to have their workplaces inspected by qualified persons. 
<p>
<li><b>Merge MSHA into a reformed OSHA.</b><br>
Although OSHA and the MSHA were created separately, the rationale for keeping them apart no longer exists. Workplace injury and illness data no longer justify maintaining these agencies as separate entities with practically the same level of resources.9  Merging MSHA with a reformed OSHA and reallocating federal resources will accomplish two important objectives:  It will eliminate administrative overhead and duplicative costs, and increase workplace health and safety in all industries.
</ul><P>
Reforming the Mine Act to require only one inspection per year will enable MSHA to shift its inspection resources from mine operators with exemplary safety records to operators with poor safety records. By focusing on the "bad players," OSHA's new Mine Office will improve mine safety where it is needed most. Mine operators with good safety records will continue to have incentives to remain safe, in addition to fewer inspections and lower workers' compensation costs, and the new Mine Office will be able to use its resources more efficiently to focus on the "bad players."  Further, merging the two agencies will settle jurisdictional questions about enforcement and eliminate the maze of memoranda of understanding that currently exists between OSHA and MSHA. Mine workers and taxpayers will get more mine safety for their hard-earned dollars.
<p>
Heritage Foundation analysts estimate that consolidating MSHA and OSHA could save up to $510 million over five years.10  Merging MSHA and OSHA would eliminate the need for the federal government to write two separate health regulations covering the same workplace hazard, one for mining and one for everybody else. For example, there is no reason to have two separate Hazard Communication Standards, and noise protection for miners is no different from noise protection for other workers. Regional and administrative offices would be combined, and MSHA's Office of Information and Public Affairs could be eliminated.
<p>
Merging MSHA with a reformed OSHA will not reduce workplace health and safety. No MSHA safety or health regulations would be abolished.11  Each underground mine will be thoroughly inspected at least once a year by qualified inspectors, and all workers will be able to request federal inspections if employers ignore their concerns about unsafe conditions. MSHA's imminent danger closure rule will be maintained, and mine workers finally will be covered by OSHA's health regulations. Focusing resources on compliance assistance will improve the ability of "good players" to translate OSHA and MSHA regulations into safer workplaces. Most important, by requiring only one mandatory inspection per year instead of four, a new OSHA/MSHA will be able to reallocate its resources to focus on improving the "bad players" instead of legally having to inspect mines with good safety records.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
Federal workplace health and safety laws should be reformed to redefine the government's role and leverage the strong incentives businesses already have to improve and maintain workplace health and safety. Statutory reform is required to enable MSHA to allocate resources more efficiently and OSHA to work cooperatively with businesses -- for example, by making compliance assistance a central part of its program and mission. Merging MSHA with a reformed OSHA is a sensible first step toward improving workplace health and safety, limiting unnecessary government intervention, and reducing inefficient, wasteful government spending.
<p>
Redefining government's role in workplace health and safety should refocus the responsibility for ensuring workplace safety and health on employers and employees. Common-sense regulations and compliance assistance combined with competitive market pressures to increase productivity, keep skilled workers, and minimize legal and insurance costs will do more to increase workplace health and safety than any army of government inspectors and lawyers. Reforming OSHA and consolidating it with MSHA is a win-win for hard-working American taxpayers. American workers and taxpayers will get healthier, safer workplaces at lower cost.

<title> Deregulating The Housing Market: What Congress Can Do -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>
<h3>
 DEREGULATING THE HOUSING MARKET: WHAT CONGRESS CAN DO </h3>
By<br>
 Carl F. Horowitz, Ph.D.<BR>
           Policy Analyst<P>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder Update No. 177<br>
April 10, 1992<br>
<hr width="50%"></center>
<p> 

 
 
      This year Congress can help make housing more affordable for
American families. 
<P>
      The Bush Administration is presenting to Congress a series of
budget initiatives that will promote deregulation of an overly
regulated housing market, and by this will reduce housing costs. These
initiatives are based on the recommendations of the Advisory
Commission on Regulatory Barriers to Affordable Housing, known as the
Kemp Commission, after Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) Secretary Jack Kemp. Last July the bipartisan Commission issued
its final report, "Not In My Back Yard": Reducing Barriers to
Affordable Housing. (Advisory Commission on Regulatory Barriers to
Affordable Housing, "Not In My Back Yard": Reducing Barriers to
Affordable Housing (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, July 1991).) The report's recommendations give
Congress and the Bush Administration an opportunity to tackle
excessive regulation in the housing market.
<P>
      The Commission, established at the behest of George Bush and
Kemp, was chaired by former New Jersey Republican Governor Thomas
Kean. (Heritage Foundation Director of Domestic Policy Studies Stuart
Butler was a Commission member. As such, he has not contributed to or
reviewed this study.) The Commission heard from expert testimony and
pored over numerous studies. It found that the types of state and
local regulations most adversely affecting housing affordability were:
zoning ordinances that exclude certain forms of reasonably priced
housing; growth control ordinances that impose ceilings on new
construction; rent control ordinances that reduce the incentive to
maintain or build rental properties; and lengthy permit approval
procedures, especially those related to environmental protection, that
delay new construction by months and often years. The Kemp Commission
concluded that the reduction in the supply of housing from this
overregulation makes housing less affordable for millions of
Americans.  
<P>
      Undercutting Expansion. Commission members noted that while
affordability for buyers and renters improved nationwide during the
1980s, it did so largely because of Reagan Administration economic
policies. The problem is that excessive regulation worked against this
trend, undercutting the expanding supply of houses and apartments.
This was especially so in major metropolitan areas in California and
the Northeast, where prices and rents, especially of new dwellings,
still remain well above those elsewhere.
<P>
      Like previous federal housing task forces, the Kemp Commission
recognizes that the tacit purpose behind much of this regulation is to
raise the market values of existing properties. Established residents
of a community, once having benefitted at the expense of newcomers,
pressure local officials to keep these regulations, and often to make
them more stringent.
<P>
      This exclusionary impulse, more than, say, a laudable desire to
protect the environment, is the motive behind such local and state
regulations. Often, new construction of any kind causes existing
residents to warn developers and local officials alike: "Not in my
back yard!" The acronym for this expression -- NIMBY -- is firmly
established in housing policy debate.  
<P>
AN AGENDA FOR CHANGE: LINKING REGULATORY REFORM TO FEDERAL HOUSING AID
<P>
      HUD wants to make the granting of federal housing subsidies to
state and local governments contingent upon the removal of excessive
regulation of land use and housing, especially of new housing. HUD
wants to make any state or local government recipient demonstrate
beforehand that it is making progress in reducing burdens upon
developers who seek approvals of proposals for residential
development. This especially would affect HOME, a block grant program
created by Congress in 1990 as part of the National Affordable Housing
Act. HOME is budgeted at $1.5 billion in the current fiscal year; the
Administration proposes spending $700 million on the program in fiscal
1993.
<P>
      Kemp and his colleagues at HUD understand that local government
officials, vulnerable to voter hostility toward new development, are
not going to remove these barriers voluntarily. They thus need
encouragement from Washington. Such incentives are contained in the
Bush Administration budget package. The most important of these
initiatives requires action by Congress. This would give HUD greater
authority to review grants made in accordance with the newly created
Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS). 
<P>
      The National Affordable Housing Act requires every state and
local government receiving federal housing assistance to submit a CHAS
document to HUD. A CHAS applicant must meet fifteen statutory
requirements. The most important is a demonstration by the applicant
that it is taking steps to make housing more affordable. The applicant
must reveal the extent to which its own regulations and policies drive
up the cost of housing, and must present a strategy to remove these
barriers to affordability. The Act, however, explicitly made a
regulatory barrier-removal plan the one element in a CHAS application
that HUD could not use as a basis for disapproving a request for
funding.
<P>
      Wrong Message. HUD officials argue that congressional exclusion
of the removal of regulatory barriers requirement from the HUD review
process sends the wrong message to state and local governments: They
can continue to pursue exclusionary policies with impunity. HUD
insists that this criterion for grant submission, like the fourteen
others required in a CHAS, should be subject to HUD review. 
<P>
      Kemp and other HUD officials, however, have the unenviable task
of trying to convince Congress, generally favoring increased
government regulation and subsidies as ways of promoting housing
affordability, of this view. For example, despite the repeated failure
of rent control, Representative Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat,
opposes any proposal that would deny federal housing assistance to
communities with rent-control ordinances, such as San Francisco, which
is in her district. (Conversation with Carolyn Bartholomew,
Legislative Director, Representative Nancy Pelosi, April 2, 1992.)
<P>
      Those opposed to linking federal housing assistance to removing
regulatory barriers erroneously argue that government deregulation is
only a minor factor in driving up the cost of housing. John
Gilderbloom, Associate Professor at the University of Louisville
College of Urban and Public Affairs, for example, claims that charges
of overregulation are wildly exaggerated, and that there is no
guarantee that builders and landlords would pass on the savings of
deregulation to the consumer anyway. (See testimony by John
Gilderbloom, "The Bush/Kemp Housing Commission: The Good, the Bad, and
the Ugly," U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Banking,
Finance and Urban Affairs, Subcommittee on Policy Research and
Insurance and Subcommittee on Housing and Community Development,
Report by the Advisory Commission on Regulatory Barriers to Affordable
Housing, 102nd Congress, First Session, July 17, 1991 (Washington,
D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1991, pp. 145-178).) Such
researchers also maintain that any program of deregulation, whatever
burdens it lifts from the shoulders of builders, landlords, and
homeowners, must be accompanied by a massive increase in housing
subsidies. William C. Apgar, Jr., executive director of the Harvard
University Joint Center for Housing Studies, asserts: "Regulatory
reform does not negate the need for expanded Federal subsidy
programs." (Quoted in ibid., p. 44.) 
<P>
      Such arguments are flawed. The Kemp Commission findings
demonstrate convincingly that housing overregulation has been a major
contributor to rising housing prices and rents since the 1970s. It is
not coincidental that areas of the country subject to the heaviest
housing regulation, such as the California and Northeast coastal
metropolitan regions, have by far the nation's highest housing prices
and rents. According to William M. Connolly, Director of the New
Jersey Department of Community Affairs, Division of Housing and
Development, the percentage of the price of a new home that the
Commission attributed to housing and land use overregulation in New
Jersey -- 25 percent to 30 percent -- is, if anything, on the low
side. (Statement of William M. Connolly, in ibid., p. 47.) 
<P>
      The claim that more federal spending on housing is needed also
is without foundation. Under the Reagan Administration HUD spending
rose from $14.9 billion in fiscal 1981 to $19.7 billion in fiscal
1989. By fiscal 1991 this figure climbed to $22.8 billion, and is
projected to reach $24.2 billion and $28.1 billion, respectively, in
fiscal 1992 and 1993. Moreover, between 4.5 million and 4.6 million
low-income American households currently receive housing subsidies.
Apgar's own research at Harvard indicates that subsidized poor renters
pay about one-half the rent that unsubsidized poor renters pay, and
that even unsubsidized poor renters pay rents less the overall median.
(William C. Apgar, Jr., et al., The State of the Nation's Housing 1990
(Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Joint Center for Housing Studies,
1990), p. 21. Subsidized poor renters paid (1989 dollars) $188 in
rent; unsubsidized poor renters paid $360. Further undercutting
Apgar's argument is the fact that much of the income of poor
households is uncounted by the Census Bureau. See Robert Rector, "How
the Poor Really Live: Lessons for Welfare Reform," Heritage Foundation
Backgrounder No. 875, January 31, 1992, p. 3.) 
<P>
ADDITIONAL DEREGULATORY INITIATIVES
<P>
      Making future federal housing assistance contingent upon state
and local governments removing regulatory barriers is not the only
initiative HUD is proposing. HUD already has recommended or
established the following measures:
<P>
1)    Make grants to states for barrier removal and reform efforts.
      HUD is proposing $10 million in fiscal year 1993 Community
      Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds for states to assist them
      in removing regulatory barriers to housing markets. The Kemp
      Commission report emphasizes that the states, more than federal
      or local government, can exercise the best judgment over the
      economic impact of government regulations that extend beyond
      local boundaries. Empowering the states to exercise and act on
      this judgment while using federal grant money would require
      congressional legislation.
<P>
2)    Create a Regulatory Reform for Affordable Housing Information
      Center. The Center, estab-lished earlier this year, is HUD's
      clearinghouse for information and ideas to state and local
      governments, the housing industry, nonprofit housing
      organizations, and the general public. (The Center's toll-free
      number is 1-800-292-3472.)
<P>
3)    Create an Interagency Affordable Housing Regulatory Review
      Board. This proposal, which does not require action by Congress,
      already has been approved by the White House and the Office of
      Management and Budget. The new Board will waive federal
      regulations that apply to housing proposals in states and
      localities demonstrating a commitment to regulatory barrier
      removal. These regulations cover environmental, transportation,
      labor and other federal requirements, even on many unsubsidized
      projects. Currently, states seeking such waivers must go through
      a cumbersome and time-consuming federal review process. The
      Board would be composed of sub-Cabinet officials from federal
      agencies, including HUD, the Veterans Administration, the
      Department of the Interior, and the Army Corps of Engineers. It
      would expedite reviews, ensure that the states receive full
      consideration of their requests, and make recommendations to
      federal agencies on the granting of waivers.
<P>
4)    Better coordinate federal efforts to promote affordable housing.
      HUD already has appointed its Assistant Secretary for Policy
      Development and Research, John C. Weicher, to oversee the
      removal of regulatory barriers to affordable housing. He and his
      staff will meet with builders, state and local officials, and
      non-profit and citizens' groups to discuss ways of reducing
      these barriers. 
<P>
      Taken together, these administrative and legislative measures
will remove some of the more onerous forms of housing regulation that
needlessly raise housing prices and rents. Where legislative action is
required, Congress should act forcefully on behalf of Kemp's
initiatives.
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
      The HUD anti-regulatory package will help reduce the cost of
housing. HUD officials justifiably are telling those state and local
governments that receive or wish to receive federal housing aid to
cooperate in making housing more affordable for American families.
Local governments already have shown a willingness to work with state
and federal officials in reducing land use and other housing cost
burdens. (In the 1980s, HUD sponsored a nationwide project known as
the Joint Venture for Affordable Housing. Local governments, working
with HUD and builders, were able to substantially cut per-unit costs
in new developments, especially through allowing higher dwelling
densities. See U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development,
Office of Policy Development and Research, The Affordable Housing
Demonstration: Case Studies (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development, January 1985).) Congress can speed up
this progress by adopting HUD's anti-regulatory initiatives. The
strategy of linking federal aid to state and local governments'
removal of regulatory barriers can succeed, especially where HUD
provides technical assistance to state and local government and to
builders. 
<P>
      The cost of housing has not risen appreciably -- in some areas,
not at all -- since the onset of the recession in mid-1990. Contrary
to what big-government housing advocates have been saying for years,
there is no crisis either in the cost of the housing itself or in the
cost of mortgage money to builders, landlords, and homeowners. There
is thus no justification for boosting federal housing subsidies. 
<P>
      But there is much justification for reducing excessive
regulation. Much of the cost of America's housing still remains
artificially high, at least in several of the largest and most heavily
populated metropolitan areas of the country. Jack Kemp and his
colleagues at HUD want to give states and localities incentives to
remove excessive housing and land use regulations. Congress can
realize this objective by requiring that federal housing assistance be
granted only upon the eventual elimination of these regulations.

<B><FONT SIZE="+2">C</FONT></B>rop subsidies for the 400-acre farm that we rent here in northwest Missouri 
average $10,000 a year, and I've gotten in the habit of spending it all. But Pat Roberts, 
congressman from Dodge City, Kansas, and the new chairman of the House Agriculture 
Committee, assures me that I won't have to wear bib overalls with a scarlet "S" for 
"subsidy" on the front. Well, that's a relief.</P>
<P>	Roberts's sense of humor is as dry as the West Kansas wind. And this year he'll 
need it, because 1995 will see the reauthorization of the Farm Bill, the huge piece of 
legislation that will govern federal agricultural programs for the next five years. As a 
defender of the existing subsidies, Roberts may find himself as lonely as a Dodge City 
vegetarian.</P>
<P>	Several rounds of budget-cutting have pared farm programs by half, or $14 billion 
annually, since 1989. Roberts intends to protect what is left, and that may take more than 
a good sense of humor. He will have few allies. The Clinton administration has no 
interest in agriculture, except for a desire to turn the Midwest into a gigantic wetland, and 
to do whatever the poultry industry wants. Bob Dole, normally a roadblock in the way of 
farm reform, will be busy running the Senate and his presidential campaign. The new 
leadership of the House of Representatives includes Dick Armey, who looks at farm 
subsidies the way a dog looks at a bone. Richard Lugar, the chairman of the Senate 
Agriculture Committee, has opened the debate with a list of 53 questions about farm 
policy. His first one: "Should we have a farm program at all?" (Roberts likens Lugar to 
Lizzie Borden, taking 53 whacks at farmers.) Farm programs have been on the defensive 
for years, but Lugar is the first leading farm-state legislator to question their very 
existence. Roberts is circling the wagons to do what agriculture-committee chairmen have 
always done--protect the subsidies--but this time he may lose.</P>
<P>	Although I have long been a critic of farm subsidies in principle, Lugar's 
questions and the programs' unpopularity have suddenly turned a philosophical question 
into a frighteningly personal one. In addition to his 53 questions, the 54th and most 
important one is: How would I replace the $10,000 in subsidies that I receive each year?</P>
<P>	Well, for one thing, I'd grow more beans. My corn crop is directly subsidized, but 
my soybean crop isn't. So guess which crop I grow more of. Without corn subsidies, 
growing soybeans would be more profitable for us here in Westboro, and in many years 
beans are more profitable even after we receive our green government checks. But we 
consistently plant more than half our acres in corn to protect our corn base. Base is the 
number of acres planted to a subsidized crop, and is used to determine the size of 
government payments.</P>
<P>	If we plant more soybeans to take advantage of their greater profitability, we lose 
some eligibility for future corn subsidies. Fathers pass many important lessons along to 
their sons. Here in the Corn Belt, a 60-year-old lesson is: Protect your base!</P>
<P>	We could offset some of these lost subsidies by reducing our costs of production. 
Soybeans are cheaper to plant, and their yield is less dependent on timely rains. We could 
save on the expensive insecticides we have to apply to the 20 percent of our land that is in 
continuous corn.</P>
<P>	We could also save on commercial fertilizer. Soybeans "fix," or capture, nitrogen 
from the air and leave it in the soil. Some of that nitrogen is available as nutrient for the 
following year's crop. By increasing our soybean acreage, we could do with less 
fertilizer. (The two crops compete for the same acres in this region; if soybean prices 
dropped because lots of other farmers made the same decision, then corn would become 
more profitable.)</P>
<P>	Another thing we'd do without farm subsidies is grow more. In order to qualify 
for government payments, we must leave part of our farm idle. This spring, for instance, 
we will plant on only 380 of our 400 acres. We could plant those other 20 acres without 
any additional investment in tractors, or combines, or rent. Without the acreage 
limitations imposed by farm programs, we would spread our fixed costs over more acres.</P>
<P>	And perhaps most important of all, there is gumbo. Gumbo is the soil that makes 
up much of our river-bottom ground. The spring after we plant corn on gumbo, the soil 
has the consistency of well-cured concrete. There are only two solutions to this problem: 
fall plowing, which is terribly expensive, or rotation to soybeans.</P>
<P>	Without the program, we could increase our average yields through better crop 
rotation. Corn after soybeans consistently yields 10 to 20 percent more than second-year 
corn. So part of the lost subsidies would be replaced by higher yields.</P>
<P>	The largest single expense for any farmer is the cost of his land. And this is where 
the farm program has its biggest impact. The first thing farmers want to know when a 
neighbor's farm comes up for sale is the size of its crop base. Farms with a large corn 
base are eligible for higher subsidies, and so are worth more than those with a smaller 
one--another reason to protect the base. When farm subsidies diminish, the price of land 
falls. Farmers compete with one another for land.  Farm policy has the effect of 
subsidizing established farmers who own much of their land, and making it more difficult 
for younger farmers to buy or rent land to establish themselves. Farm programs are often 
touted as an attempt to save the family farm. But when the capitalized value of subsidies 
raises the costs to families who want to farm, the programs serve as a barrier to entry. Not 
surprisingly, the average age of farmers is well over 50. Cuts in farm subsidies would 
allow easier entry into farming, and less expensive transfer of farms between generations.</P>
<P>	Without subsidies, we would be freed of a number of bureaucratic burdens. This 
spring, we will have to trek to the local Consolidated Farm Services Administration office 
to receive approval for our crop plan. After all of our crops are planted, we must return to 
certify that we did what we said we would. Government planes fly over our farm to take 
photographs and make sure that our corn plantings are within the limits. (Since we 
farmers don't have antiaircraft batteries, the USDA needn't resort to spy satellites.) We 
also have to file conservation plans and plan our crop rotations years in advance.</P>
<P>	How much of the $10,000 that I've become so attached to would be replaced if I 
could farm without all these constraints? I don't know. If full-scale production led to 
huge surpluses, and crop prices fell to extremely low levels and stayed there, then I would 
suffer a great deal. But without the guarantee of protection from Uncle Sam, surpluses 
might not be as much of a problem as in the past. Loan rates (the floor under the market 
price) were set above the cost of production in the 1980 farm bill, and huge surpluses 
were the result.</P> 
<P>	But sometimes we learn from our mistakes: Since 1990, loan rates have been 
below market-clearing levels. Record harvests in 1992 and 1994 have not produced a 
huge carry-over of grain. In fact, prices are slightly higher now than after the 1992 
harvest, even though corn production in 1994 was considerably higher. And in years of 
short supply, my profits might well rise without farm programs, because the government 
sells its grain stocks to set a ceiling on prices.</P>
<P>	Senator Lugar wants to know why some crops are subsidized and others are not. 
He also wants to know whether unsubsidized crops are consistently less profitable than 
subsidized ones. As I've pointed out, we can make as much profit on soybeans, which are 
not directly subsidized, as on corn. The greenhouses where we grow unsubsidized 
geraniums are the most profitable enterprise on my farm, and I don't have to wait for a 
government check. Cattle and hogs have no subsidy programs, yet hogs are consistently 
among the most profitable of agricultural commodities. Florida oranges receive no 
government support, while California oranges are grown under government rules that 
constrain supply and raise prices. Are Florida growers selling out and heading for 
California? I hardly think so.</P>
<P>	Any government subsidy increases costs in the subsidized industry, and any 
government-provided profits tend to be bid into the factors of production. There is little 
evidence that subsidies boost profits in the long run, and the fact that some crops are 
subsidized and others are not is an accident of history and politics.</P>
<P>	In the last two years, farmers witnessed two events that will make more difference 
in the long run than any farm bill could: the passage of GATT and of NAFTA. These 
trade agreements will raise agricultural exports and prices by large amounts. GATT will 
require the European Union to cut subsidies by 36 percent. Export subsidies for more 
than 8 million tonnes of European exports will have to be cut. American farmers are the 
low-cost producers of most of the commodities that Europe subsidizes, and we stand to 
gain most of that business.</P>
<P>	GATT is expected to raise incomes worldwide by as much as $5 trillion in the 
next 10 years. Many of those dollars will be spent to improve diets, as consumers 
worldwide boost their consumption of meat. Since the passage of NAFTA, agricultural 
exports to Mexico have risen by 22 percent, or $670 million, in the first 10 months of 
1994.</P>

<H3>New Farmers' Market</H3>
<P>	That giant sucking sound you hear emanates mainly from Midwestern grain bins, 
busily shipping corn and soybeans south of the border. When Mexico recovers from its 
peso crisis, NAFTA is expected to boost U.S. agricultural exports annually by $2.6 
billion.</P>
<P>	As trade barriers around the world fall, the number of people who can afford to 
buy what I produce is increasing. China has a middle class 100 million strong. With 22 
percent of the world's population, and an economy growing at 10 percent per year, 
China's potential as a market for food is mindboggling. As NAFTA expands to include 
Central and South America, more new markets will open. When the decline in trade 
barriers is combined with growth in worldwide incomes, U.S. farmers may well be 
entering a golden age for agriculture. And here on my farm in Westboro, I may find that 
being part of a freer world market pays better than farming for Uncle Sam.</P>
<P>	I've thought a lot about Senator Lugar's questions. I've tried to figure out how it 
would affect me financially if the answers to those questions persuade Congress to end or 
drastically reduce farm programs. And I think the answer is clear. I can survive without 
subsidies. In some years, I might even be better off. And there is one more question that 
Lugar asked that goes to the crux of the matter: "What is the rationale for transferring 
public funds from taxpayers, most of whom have moderate incomes, to all farmers, 
including those whose incomes--are substantially above--average?" Well, I don't 
know how you justify that.</P>
<P>	Recently, my brother took his 15-year-old son along with him to the local USDA 
office. One of the employees behind the counter pointed out that my nephew was the 
fourth generation of our family that she had worked with. I'm a little uncomfortable with 
being on the dole for that length of time, and I'm particularly uncomfortable knowing that 
my income and assets would qualify me as solidly middle class. The lady behind the 
counter retired shortly afterwards. I don't imagine it was the thought of another 
generation of Hursts that drove her into retirement, but I do believe that maybe four 
generations of middle-class welfare is enough.</P>
<P>	As Congress scrutinizes farm programs, it needs to keep one thing in mind. Pat 
Roberts tells the story of one of his constituents, who said, "I don't care what you do to 
me, as long as you let me know."</P>
<P>	Farmers have planned their businesses with the expectation of continued farm 
payments. Any reform of agricultural policy must keep those expectations in mind. We 
have been adjusting to lower subsidies for five years, and have made those adjustments 
fairly easily. Perhaps we should allow another five years to wind down this 60-year-old 
experiment in central planning, retire our overalls with the red "S," and let farmers do 
what we do best: produce the cheapest and most plentiful food supply the world has ever 
known.</P>

Backgrounder Update No. 252<br>
June 7, 1995<br>
 (Updating Rolling Back Government:  A Budget Plan to Rebuild America, May 1995)
</center>
<HR>

<P>

The Davis-Bacon Act was enacted during the Depression explicitly to prevent low-skilled nonunion workers -- chiefly blacks and Hispanics -- from competing for federally funded construction jobs. Unfortunately for these workers, it has succeeded.
<P>
Congress once again is considering repeal of the Davis-Bacon Act. And thanks to the shift in power in Congress, this year's budget process offers a real opportunity to end this Depression-era law that protects racial discrimination in the construction industry, needlessly costs taxpayers billions of dollars each year, stifles productivity, and subsidizes special interests. If the facts were the only issue, there would be no need for debate -- the Davis-Bacon Act would have been repealed long ago. However, this effort may be undermined once more by intense pressure from special interests seeking to preserve generous subsidies at the  expense of taxpayers and minority workers. Congress must withstand this pressure, act in the interests of all American taxpayers, and repeal the Davis-Bacon Act. 
<P>
The Davis-Bacon Act was adopted in 1931 when the United States was mired in the Great Depression and Congress was under a great deal of pressure to protect wages and jobs. The Act was intended to protect local unionized contractors from outside nonunionized contractors using lower cost itinerant labor, typically black workers from the South and immigrants. Davis-Bacon accomplished this by requiring contractors to pay local "prevailing" wages -- as defined by the U.S. Department of Labor -- to workers on federally funded construction projects valued at more than $2,000. Where union wage rates and benefits are specified as prevailing in a particular locality, nonunion firms and workers lose an important cost advantage in bidding for federally funded construction contracts. Further, the Department of Labor's implementing regulations continue to impose rigid craft-based job classifications and restrictive apprenticeship regulations that inflate costs by reducing productivity and sharply limit an employer's ability to hire or train       unskilled minority workers. 
<P>

<h3>FOUR REASONS WHY CONGRESS MUST REPEAL DAVIS-BACON </h3>

<b>Reason #1: Davis-Bacon was enacted out of fear and racism and continues to penalize minorities. 
</b><p>
A review of the Congressional Record reveals clearly that passage of Davis-Bacon was motivated by fear that blacks and immigrants were taking jobs from native-born white Americans. Ever since its adoption, Davis-Bacon has led to discrimination against minorities in the construction industry. In 1932, one year after enactment, only 30 of the 4,100 workers employed on the Boulder Dam project were black Americans. In 1962, two years before the landmark Civil Rights Act was passed, local construction unions in Washington, D.C., prevented black electricians from working on one of the capital's premiere building projects:  the Rayburn House Office Building.1
<P>
Even after 30 years of federally required reverse discrimination and minority set-asides, Davis-Bacon continues to keep minorities out of the construction industry. In 1994, black workers accounted for 10.4 percent of total employment but only 6.4 percent of construction industry jobs.
<P>
Davis-Bacon restricts the potential for minority-owned firms to compete for federal construction contracts. Nona Brazier, a minority co-owner of Seattle-based Brazier Construction Company, explains that to win Davis-Bacon contracts, firms not only must pay inflated wages and adopt inefficient work practices, but also must expose themselves to heavy compliance costs, threats of litigation, and union harassment.2  Well-capitalized companies can afford union wages, but their unions historically have excluded blacks. Black businesses -- often not as well capitalized -- are less able to pay Davis-Bacon prevailing wage rates. Few minority-owned firms win Davis-Bacon contracts, and many give up trying.
<P>
On May 8, 1995, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia denied a Department of Justice   motion to dismiss a constitutional challenge to the Davis-Bacon Act. The suit charges that Davis-Bacon would not have passed Congress if not for racial discrimination and that it continues to discriminate and deny economic opportunity today. In allowing the case to move forward, Judge William B. Bryant agreed that the case has merits that require a hearing.
<P>

<B>Reason #2:  Davis-Bacon costs taxpayers at least $1.5 billion each year through inflated construction costs.
</B><P>
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated that Davis-Bacon costs the American taxpayers at least $1.5 billion per year. This is primarily because the prevailing wage determinations made by the    Department of Labor do not reflect market wages. In Oakland, California, carpenters get about $28.00 an hour on federally funded projects; the pay in private construction is about $15 per hour.3
<P>
The CBO estimates that repealing Davis-Bacon would save American taxpayers $2.7 billion to $5.3 billion from 1996 to 2000.4  These funds could be used for such things as reducing the federal deficit or increasing the number of construction projects. Repealing Davis-Bacon also would reduce significantly the construction costs for state and local government projects that involve matching federal funds.
<P>

<b>Reason #3:  Davis-Bacon imposes unnecessary regulatory burdens and heavy paperwork requirements.
</B><P>
By requiring strict assignment of workers and payroll reporting on a craft-by-craft basis, Davis-Bacon  impedes normal industry practices that improve productivity and efficiency. For example, Davis-Bacon regulations frustrate the practice of working across craft lines and discourage the use of semi-skilled helpers by requiring that all workers be paid journeymen's wages.5  This raises the cost of federally funded   construction projects.
<P>
Repealing Davis-Bacon and the related Copeland Act6 would free up an estimated five million labor hours per year that contractors now must spend completing weekly payroll requirements that Department of Labor bureaucrats admit they ignore.7  This is the equivalent of 2,400 full-time, year-round workers that could be doing something more productive. The cost of complying with these paperwork burdens is not borne by the contractor, but is passed on to the taxpayer as part of the project cost.
<P>

<b>Reason #4:  Davis-Bacon needlessly and unfairly subsidizes unions.
</b><p>The 1931 Davis-Bacon Act predated virtually all of today's basic worker protections, so its work protection provisions are unnecessary or obsolete. Today, minimum wage laws and overtime provisions prevent the exploitation of workers. Construction safety standards protect worker health and safety. State licensing requirements and building codes ensure quality construction by qualified workers. Further, the government now has an elaborate procurement process that screens out unscrupulous and incompetent contractors.
<P>
While the rest of the country pays competitively determined wages for high quality construction projects,8 Davis-Bacon requires that taxpayers pay more for federally funded construction projects. There is no reason for government to subsidize the wages of construction workers earning an average of $27,500.  Without Davis-Bacon, construction workers still would be earning on average more than $26,000.
<P>
The only significant groups that actively support retention of Davis-Bacon in its present form are the building and construction trade unions and their allies in the Congress and the Clinton Administration. But Congress should be looking out for the interests of taxpayers and all workers, not just those who gain from a restrictive law.
<P>

<B>CONCLUSION
</B>
Repealing Davis-Bacon would:
<P>
<ul><li>Remove a major impediment to unskilled minority workers entering the construction industry and minority firms competing for contracts.
<P>
<li>Allow federal, state, and local construction dollars to go farther because costs would be lower and productivity higher. Taxpayers would get more for their money.
<P>
<li>Allow free markets, not bureaucrats, to determine wages on federally funded construction projects.
</ul><p>
If Davis-Bacon were not already law it would never be passed today. Proponents of such a law would be denounced as supporting discrimination. It would be pointed out that worker-protection provisions in the legislation are unnecessary because they exist in other statutes. And lawmakers would object to the heavy, unnecessary budget costs imposed by the legislation.
<P>
Unfortunately, the legislation is already on the books. It is time to remove it.

<H2>Medicare: The Sequel</H2>
</center>







<h5>[ <a href="/townhall/spotlights/6-4-96/">Graphics On</a> ]</h5>



<blockquote>

<P>On Wednesday, June fifth, the battle over Medicare will begin
anew.  On that day, the Medicare trustees are expected to release
a report showing that Medicare is going broke even faster than
was reported last year.  This means that a solution to the Medicare
dilemma is more urgent than ever.

<P>We are all aware of the bitter fight that occurred last summer
over Medicare.  Led by the <A HREF="http://www.aarp.org">AARP</A>,
the <A HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov">Clinton Administration</A>
and the <A HREF="http://aflcio.org">AFL-CIO</A>, a media scare-campaign
was conducted, the likes of which had never been seen before.  Recently 
on C-Span, House Speaker <A HREF="http://www.house.gov/mbr_dir/GA06.html">
Newt Gingrich</A> declared that Medicare ads designed to scare 
85-year olds were and are despicable.  And that is just what these
groups tried to do: scare the elderly away from the reform proposals
of the Republicans.

<P>What these great defenders of the elderly neglected to mention was the
fact that when Medicare goes bankrupt, no one will have Medicare.  Instead,
liberals lied atrociously, claiming that a Republican-proposed 6.7% growth
in Medicare per year was actually a draconian cut that would starve the
elderly, and was proposed in order to pay for tax breaks for the rich.  
Eventually, the terror efforts were successful: although Congress succeeded
in passing <A HREF="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/L?d104:./list/
d104sh.lst:341[341-342](Medicare_Preservation_Act_of_1995">Medicare Reform
</A>, Clinton vetoed it.  Even <A HREF="http://www.washingtonpost.com">The 
Washington Post</A> lamented that nothing would be done to help save the 
entitlement program.

<P>The arguments wont change this time around.  John Sweeney, president of
the AFL-CIO, has already launched a 35 million dollar campaign and a <A HREF=
"http://www.townhall.com/townhall/spotlights/6-3-96">"union summer"</A> 
against Republicans.  Adding Republican support of Medicare Reform to his 
list of complaints would suit him fine.  And the AARP receives so much funding
from the federal government (to the tune of seventy-six million dollars)
that swatting down Republican efforts can be done with what must seem to 
them spare change.  

<P>But we cannot let them win this time.

<P>The reforms that Republicans are proposing would substantially improve
the current Medicare system.  Perhaps most important would be granting 
recipients of Medicare the option of choosing from either private plans or
the government program.  Another important reform would be altering the way
benefits from Medicare are distributed: rather than an open-ended system 
which delivers a certain set of benefits, the new program would send a 
defined amount of money in the form of a voucher to recipients, that they
might spend the money as they chose.  Both of these measures would allow 
for greater consumer choice and, through competition, reduce the costs of 
Medicare without reducing the quality of services provided.

<P>For the sake of both the elderly today and the elderly tomorrow, we cannot
lose this fight. Regardless of the political consequences, be they good or
bad, our politicians are called first to serve this nation: they must ignore
the PAC scare-campaigns and enact solutions to our most important problems.
Caving in on Medicare would be a sign of a nations leaders adrift in 
extraordinary political impotence.

<H2>What YOU Should Know About the Congress as they Reconvene
to Debate their Fall Agenda</CENTER></H2>
<HR>

<P>
The 104th Congress' Fall session is peeking its head around the
corner and hopefully America is looking. The last full session
of the year has historically been a provider of memorable moments
in our nation's legislature. This year will not disappoint. Issues
such as welfare reform, Medicaid, Medicare, education legislation
and the United States' involvement in the Bosnian civil war will
be discussed until the time the autumn leaves give way to winter
snow.
<P>
In our representative democracy an educated populace is imperative.  The result is a public with
informed, yet differing, opinions. The theory behind a representative democracy
is that citizens, out of their own free will and privilege, vote another citizen to represent them in
our nation's capital. Understanding the political process is essential if we are to hold politicians
accountable. When public opinion coalesces into consensus, legislators take notice.  <p>

The problem is that private citizens are
just that--private. They work, provide for their families, spend
time with their loved ones and raise their children. Many simply don't have the time to acquire,
much less absorb, the mass of information detailing how the system works and impacts their
lives.
<P>
For your convenience, Town Hall has assembled a guide to the 104th Congress and how
legislation becomes law.  Democracy is fragile.  It is absolutely necessary that it be nurtured by
private citizens.  It has never been easier.

<H2>What YOU Should Know About the Congress as they Reconvene
to Debate their Fall Agenda</CENTER></H2>
<HR>

<P>
The 104th Congress' Fall session is peeking its head around the
corner and hopefully America is looking. The last full session
of the year has historically been a provider of memorable moments
in our nation's legislature. This year will not disappoint. Issues
such as welfare reform, Medicaid, Medicare, education legislation
and the United States' involvement in the Bosnian civil war will
be discussed until the time the autumn leaves give way to winter
snow.
<P>
In our representative democracy an educated populace is imperative.  The result is a public with
informed, yet differing, opinions. The theory behind a representative democracy
is that citizens, out of their own free will and privilege, vote another citizen to represent them in
our nation's capital. Understanding the political process is essential if we are to hold politicians
accountable. When public opinion coalesces into consensus, legislators take notice.  <p>

The problem is that private citizens are
just that--private. They work, provide for their families, spend
time with their loved ones and raise their children. Many simply don't have the time to acquire,
much less absorb, the mass of information detailing how the system works and impacts their
lives.
<P>
For your convenience, Town Hall has assembled a guide to the 104th Congress and how
legislation becomes law.  Democracy is fragile.  It is absolutely necessary that it be nurtured by
private citizens.  It has never been easier.

<H3>A look at the White House staff who have been accused of wrong doing</h3>

<blockquote> 
Scandal and corruption in politics has become, unfortunately, something that the public has grown accustomed to.  However, even the numbest and most cynical citizens have been overwhelmed by the criminal activities of the unscrupulous Clinton White House.  From Whitewater, to Travel-Gate, to the recent discovery of the misuse of FBI files, the American public has been witness to a seemingly endless stream of information concerning the illegal escapades of the Clinton administration.<p>  
Because the onslaught of information has been so relentless, so complicated, we here at Town Hall thought it might be useful to present a list of Clinton personnel who have been accused or convicted of wrong doing.  The following is exactly that, with especially bad little monkeys being marked with a banana next to their names.<p>
The information for this spotlight was provided courtesy of <a href="http://dolphin.gulf.net">Washington Weekly</a>, an Internet publication dedicated to presenting both unbiased news and boldly conservative editorials.  Our special thanks go out to them for their help on this project.<center><p>

Robbing Peter to Pay Grandma
 -- Heritage </title><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<h2>August Insider -- Robbing Peter To Pay Grandma</h2>
<i><b>by John Liu</b></i>
<hr>

<p>Sunday, July 30, 1995, marked the 30th birthday for one of the federal government's largest and most costly programsMedicare, the huge national health insurance program that covers over 37 million elderly and disabled Americans. Medicare was heralded by proponents as both "historic" and "fiscally responsible." Now, however, Medicare is essentially bankrupt, and its ability to maintain the quality of its services is in doubt. What is not in doubt, is the harsh reality that liberals must face up toMedicare is anything but a fiscally responsible program. The hospitalization insurance (HI) trust fund is projected to be insolvent by the year 2002. Equally important, the cost of the Medicare Supplemental Medical Insurance (SMI) program is exploding. 
Furthermore, U.S. demographics guarantee enormous future burdens on working families. In 1965, when Medicare was enacted, there were almost six workers to every retiree. Today, there are only four. And by 2030, when the nation's 77 million "baby boomers" are well into their retirement, there will be only two workers for every retiree.
<p>
There is a solution to this looming crisis. A solution based on free market principles allowing for consumer choice among competing plans offering different benefits. One prominent model for the reform of the Medicare program, recommended by Heritage scholars, is the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), the system that currently serves 1.6 million retired Members of Congress and federal workers.
<p>
<br>
<h3>Planning and Price Controls</h3>
<p>
While federal government officials have not been successful in accurately projecting the true costs of the Medicare program, they have had even less success in controlling them. Government bureaucrats have embarked on a quest to find the "right price" for thousands of different medical procedures and treatments or specialists and other providers. In some instances, Medicare pays doctors and hospitals and other health care "providers" too much; in other cases, "too little." Such a system encourages doctors and hospitals and other medical "providers" to engage in more or less elaborate attempts to "game" the price control system. Given its current structure, taxpayers should not be surprised that Medicarecannot control costs. The incentives of the current Medicare system conspire to drive costs up.
<p>
Just how expensive will it be to fund Medicare fully under the current system? The 1995 Medicare Trustees (a federal government board) Report provides some sobering information on how payroll taxes (which finance the HI program) would have to rise to keep the program afloat without reform. "To bring the HI program into actuarial balance even for the first 25 years," a new 1.3 percent payroll tax would have to be added to the current 2.9 percent Medicare payroll tax. Based on the trustees' estimates for revenues under the current tax rate, this would raise payroll taxesand hence the cost of employing Americansby an estimated $263 billion over five years and $388 billion over seven years. A worker earning $45,000 would have to pay an additional payroll tax of $585 per year. To achieve long-term actuarial balance of the HI trust fund without reforming the programthat is, to put it on a permanently sound footingan immediate additional payroll tax of 3.52 percent would need to be levied on top of today's 2.9 percent rate. That would raise taxes by $711 billion over five years and $1.050 trillion over seven years. The payroll taxes of a worker earning $45,000 would increase by $1,584 per year.
<p><br>
<h3>A New Model</h3>
<p>If Members of Congress want to retain the single payer, government-run structure of the Medicare program, then they must resort to either much higher taxes or even more draconian controls on doctors and hospitals, including a direct limitation of available services, in a fashion not unlike the British National Health Service.
<p>
If private employer-based insurance is not the best model for the reform of the Medicare system, Members of Congress can always examine their own system, the popular Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). This is the option proposed by The Heritage Foundation as a model for reform. It is also the model now proposed by the American Medical Association (AMA). 
Unlike Medicare, congressional and federal retirees do not have a government standardized benefits package imposed on them with the FEHBP program, but can pick and choose from a wide variety of plans and options. Medicare, on the other hand, offers almost no meaningful choices. And, in terms of economic efficiency, Medicare's bureaucratic and highly centralized system cannot even begin to compete with the market-based system that currently covers retired Members of Congress and federal employees.
<p>
While Medicare costs have been rising almost 11 percent per year, this year's overall private sector costs rose just 4.4 percent and FEHBP premiums costs actually declined by 3.3 percent. Since the free market forces have proven to work well for Members of Congress and retired Members of Congress, there is no reason why the FEHBP model can't work for our nation's elderly.

<h2><i>TH Spotlight on The Leader</i></h2>
</center>
Some say that true statesmanship is dead in America.  But sometimes there is an exception to the rule.  Whether championing the flat-tax proposal, writing his book, "The Freedom Revolution" or pushing the <i>Contract with America</i> through Congress, Representative Dick Armey is a true leader.  Consistently advancing the ideas of Ronald Reagan -- less government, more freedom, lower taxes and strong families -- Armey is in the vanguard of the "conservative revolution."
<p>
This week's Town Hall Spotlight focuses on the first Republican Majority Leader since 1954.  Town Hall has selected the speeches which get to the core of Armey's philosophy.  Bashing the "arrogant political order," and declaring that now is "not a moment for the timid,"  Armey is paving the way towards a true "Freedom Revolution."  Find out why Empower America's Vin Weber describes him as, "a one-man think tank in cowboy boot."

<H2><CENTER>Internet Law and the Communications Decency Act</CENTER></H2>

<h5>[<a href="/townhall/spotlights/6-13-96/">Graphics On</a>]</h5>



<p>
<blockquote>
The first blow against government control of the Internet was struck on Wednesday, June 12, when a three judge panel in Philadelphia unanimously ruled that the <a href="http://www.seamless.com/rcl/iplaw/decact.html">Communications Decency Act</a> was in violation of the First Amendment.  The case could go to the Supreme Court as soon as next fall, if the Justice Department decides to appeal, and it is clear that this issue will not be decided in any definitive way until it is adjudicated upon by the highest court in the land. 
<p>
The controversy began when the White House signed the <a href="http://www.technologylaw.com/techlaw/act.html">Telecommunications Bill of 1996</a> on February 8 of this year.  Included as an addendum was the Communications Decency Act, sponsored by <a href="http://www.senate.gov/senator/exon.html">Senator Exon</a> (D-Nebraska), which formally restricts "indecent" material transmitted on the Internet.  This material is specifically defined by the Act as "any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other communication which is obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent, with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass."  This issue united both sides of congress and passed by an overwhelming majority in both the House and the Senate.  
<p>
However, despite the apparently clear cut nature of the issue in the minds of the members of congress, a number of people were outraged by the passage of the Act.  Internet, free speech, and human rights groups began immediately protesting and filing <a href="http://ruby.ils.unc.edu/~koyam/lawsuit.html">lawsuits</a>.  A number of Internet users altered their Web pages, changing their backgrounds to black, or displaying blue ribbons, as a sign of protest and solidarity.  Congress heard testimony from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/corpinfo/bill-g.htm">Bill Gates</a>, representatives of the <a href="http://www.aclu.org">ACLU</a>, and others, but were unswayed by the arguments against censorship.
<p> 
And that is what this issue is really all about.  Do the citizens of the United States really want the government to intervene on their behalf and protect them from things that they shouldn't see?  The issue is further complicated by the fact that the Act was intended to protect the many children who utilize the Internet daily, and because of the extreme obscenity of the material available on the Internet.  People have been divided along the traditional lines of the First Amendment debate: those who feel the right to free "speech" must be protected above all else, and those who feel that they have a right and a duty to control the disbursement of material which they find to be grossly offensive.  Obviously, this is a complex issue with powerful arguments being made by both sides, but as it stands, those opposing censorship have won the first battle of what looks to be a long and grueling war over the valuable territory of Cyberspace.

<H2>The Great "Train Wreck" on Pennsylvania Avenue:<BR>
The Debate over the 1996 Budget</CENTER></H2>
<HR><center><a href="#Misc">Spotlight on the Budget Battle</a></center>
<P>
If you listen to the rhetoric coming out of Washington D.C. these days, you might think that a natural disaster was bearing down on our nation's capitol.  What is actually happening is quite the opposite.<p>
This Week the <b>Town Hall Spotlight</b> will focus on the issues constituting the budget battle.<P>
As opposed to past years, where the Congress has been irresponsible, the 104th Congress is taking on the tough choices in order to achieve a balanced budget.  Conservatives are in control of the purse-strings and do not plan to let go.  In fact,  Republican leadership has taken a "no-summits" stance in order to avoid the catastrophe that ruined George Bush in 1990.<p>
Because there is little chance of the Congress passing appropriations bills that the President will sign before October, the President must be willing to give in on spending levels or risk a government shut-down. It may sound like a natural disaster to many liberals whose policies are being scrutinized, but conservatives cannot help but enjoy having the upper-hand in the big debate.  When October 1st goes by, Clinton will have to convince the Congress to pass  continuing resolutions in order to keep the federal government working.  As long as the Republicans do not give in,  America will come out of this budget battle having taken the biggest step toward fiscal responsibility in decades.<p>
Throughout the week,  Town Hall will be releasing several spotlights brought to you by the many conservative organizations that make up Town Hall.

<h2>Education: A Conservative Primer <br>
</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
This week Town Hall is pleased to bring you an exclusive spotlight on education in America.  
<p>
Everyone agrees that the success of the tomorrow's Americans is dependant on a good education today; however, the type of education is an ongoing debate between liberals and conservatives.
<p>
No one disagrees that educational progress in the last thirty years is embarrassing.  Low test scores and rankings as compared to other countries, poor discipline in the classroom and violence in school have been the results of liberal ideology on the school system.  Instead of focusing on the immediate purpose of primary education--educating our youth in history, mathematics, social science, and language-- enlightened members of academia have determined that diversity, multicultural curriculum, and self-esteem programs represent the true focus of the American educational experience.  
<p>
What is the solution? Well, in Town Hall's exclusive spotlight this week, you'll discover that leading conservative organizations have developed numerous programs to combat the current state of American education.  Along with raising standards and restoring a sense of order and discipline in the classroom, other policies include school choice, market-based reform, and privatization.  Best of all, these policies are now the central components of the ongoing debate, which is a victory in itself for conservatives.

<h2>Education: A Conservative Primer <br>
</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
This week Town Hall is pleased to bring you an exclusive spotlight on education in America.  
<p>
Everyone agrees that the success of the tomorrow's Americans is dependant on a good education today; however, the type of education is an ongoing debate between liberals and conservatives.
<p>
No one disagrees that educational progress in the last thirty years is embarrassing.  Low test scores and rankings as compared to other countries, poor discipline in the classroom and violence in school have been the results of liberal ideology on the school system.  Instead of focusing on the immediate purpose of primary education--educating our youth in history, mathematics, social science, and language-- enlightened members of academia have determined that diversity, multicultural curriculum, and self-esteem programs represent the true focus of the American educational experience.  
<p>
What is the solution? Well, in Town Hall's exclusive spotlight this week, you'll discover that leading conservative organizations have developed numerous programs to combat the current state of American education.  Along with raising standards and restoring a sense of order and discipline in the classroom, other policies include school choice, market-based reform, and privatization.  Best of all, these policies are now the central components of the ongoing debate, which is a victory in itself for conservatives.

<HEAD><TITLE>1996 Convention Spotlight</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY background="/townhall/background.jpg" BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<center><H2>THE 1996 REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION</CENTER></H2>
<BR>
 Although the Founding Fathers warned against partisan party politics, US political history has taken a different course.  Partisan strife has evolved from the 1790's with the Anti-Federalists vs. the Federalists to the the current day two party division.  National nominating <a href="http://www.rnc.org/convention/history.html">conventions</a> 
have historically been the clearest demonstration and showcase of party politics and they continue to be a staple in American politics even today.  Political conventions, held by numerous parties beginning in the 1820's and 30's, underscored the fervent party politics of the past and created the traditions we witness every fourth summer.  <p>
In 1856, after only two years in existence, the Republican Party held its first nominating national convention in Philadelphia.  Since that time the Republican National Convention has grown from a delegate count of 600 to approximately. 2500 and attracted the interest of the public and media along the way.  This year's GOP faithfuls will arrive in San Diego, CA for the <a href="http://www.rnc.org/convention">1996 Republican National Convention</a> (Aug. 12-15) and, as expected, debate the key issues in the campaign in the hopes of creating a successful winning platform for the nominee.  Come the 15th the balloons will be on the ground, the money will have been spent and the reporters will go home, but the candidate and the platform which depart the San Diego Convention Center victorious will serve as historical reminders of this important political tradition.<p>
The convention, throughout the years, has provided an opportunity to define the GOP, and at times change the course of its ideological direction.	In 1964 the convention nominated arch-conservative Barry Goldwater, and despite his loss in the general election, spearheaded the influx of conservatives into the national political sphere and culture.  This, some say, contributed to the careers of many prominent conservatives and the the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980.  Speeches, of course, are the main centers of attraction at the convention and they have historically done the most to altar the direction of the party.  From Lincoln to Buchanan, the words said at the podium have left an everlasting impression at each convention since 1856. <p>  
The main issues this year center around familiar areas of debate: abortion, taxes, education and  a host of other economic and social concerns.  The question still remains whether a conservative agenda will arise as the dominate ideology in the platform. Recently, conservatives in the GOP have been fighting for a traditional GOP platform, one which is sensitive to the changing times as well as preserving core conservative values.  Only the results of the convention will tell which direction the Republican party is heading.  <p>

<title>Minimum Wage Spotlight</title>

<h2>The Minimum Wage and Election-Year Politics</h2>
</center>


<h5>


[ <a href="/townhall/spotlights/6-12-96/">Graphics On</a> ]<p>






</h5>



<P>With House passage of the minimum wage bill (HR 1227) two weeks ago, the Democrats have proven successful in their attempts to find their voice for the upcoming '96 elections.  Although the Democrats had the opportunity to raise the minimum wage when they were in the majority during the first two years of the Clinton presidency, they chose not to.  They knew that the increase does more harm than good for the poor working families they claim to represent.  But now, with the elections a few months away, it is time to play politics by blaming American businesses and gaining favor with voters.  The Democrats have managed to dredge up one of their favorite liberal pet issues in the minimum wage debate.</p>

<p>On May 23, House Republicans stood divided over the minimum wage issue.  As reported by <i>Congressional Quarterly</i>, the final vote was 281-144 for a bill that increases the federal minimum wage from $4.25 to $4.75 an hour effective July 1, and then to $5.15 an hour a year later.  In all, this is a 21% increase in the wage.  Ninety-three Republicans broke ranks with the conservative House leadership to vote with 187 Democrats in agreement with the measure.  The debate on this issue is not over; this week the bill goes to the more deliberative Senate.  Nothing would please the Democrats more than to have this issue alive up until the November elections.</p>

<p>Why does an increase in the minimum wage hurt American workers more than it is intended to help?  Conservatives refer to prominent economic studies which, according to the <a href="/sbsc/">Small Business Survival Committee</a>, continually conclude that increasing the minimum wage has a direct result in the decrease of the number of entry-level employment opportunities.  "The General Accounting Office, the 
<a href="http://www.brook.edu/">Brookings Institution</a>, the Employment Policies Institute Foundation, the Congressional Budget Office and 
various presidential commission's have all reached this universal conclusion," reports the <a href="/sbsc/">Small Business Survival Committee.</a></p>

<p><a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation's</a> Mark Wilson points out several reasons why the "emotionally appealing" arguments for an increase in the minimum wage are misleading.  For one, increasing the wage will raise the price of consumer goods and eliminate over 200,000 entry-level jobs by 1999.  In addition, a higher wage does not help low income households on the whole, when you consider that over one-half of those individuals who earn the minimum wage are teenagers and spouses living in well-to-do families.  What's more, an increased minimum wage fails to help poor working families when, "of the 23.5 million Americans in poor families, just over 2 percent are working and paid $4.25 an hour."</p>  

<p>Conservatives take a different approach toward raising the level of take home pay for all American workers.  That is, getting the government out of the way of small businesses in terms of the excessive taxes, regulations, and mandates which hamper productivity and growth.  Mark Wilson lists items of the conservative policy: "cut payroll taxes . . . cut the capital gains tax . . . balance the budget . . . increase the skills of the future work force . . . increase the skills of the current work force . . . and enact regulatory reform."  These measures remove the burdensome barriers currently faced by small businesses, allowing them to accomplish extraordinary things in contributing to a robust economy.</p>

<H2> Getting an Internship in Washington, DC </H2>

<blockquote>





<p>

So you want to be an intern in Washington, DC?  The key to having an enjoyable internship experience is finding one in an area that you are interested in.  A genuine interest in the work of your office will enable you to maintain your sanity while executing many mundane tasks.  In this spotlight, I will give some pointers on why anyone would ever consider interning and how to go about finding a position that you will enjoy.  These are not just tips from a creative mind, but from an intern here at <a href="/townhall/">Town Hall</a>.  This summer marks my third internship experience, so I figure I'm qualified to give advice on this matter.  Looking back, I realize how much I have benefited from my experiences and how little I knew about finding a position when I first got started.  I hope that you will find this information beneficial.

<p>Interning can be an immeasurable benefit to an academic and vocational development.  Whether an internship involving an area related to your academic concentration, or just an interesting diversion, it can give you experience and contacts for future job searches.  At the same time, you will be able to see how the real world works.  Your experience may guide you along your educational trail or abruptly halt it and point you in the opposite direction, but the more you find out about the job market the better off you will be. <p>





While enhancing your education greatly, most internships will hurt you financially.  I would estimate that nearly three out of every four internships are unpaid, particularly in Washington, DC.  And many of the paid positions will not provide enough income to cover your living expenses.  To make matters worse, the internships that are paid are also the most competitive.  Long story short, nobody gets rich interning.  It's an investment in the future; down the road, the financial toll of your internship experience will be rewarded with a well paid job.<p>

There are ways to ease the financial burden.  One of the most popular is to find friends or family in the Washington, DC area.  Not only will your housing expenses disappear, you should be able to mooch numerous meals.  There are also scholarship opportunities out there for those in need; so search them out.  Also, there are many free meal opportunities in the District.  Keep your eyes open for receptions with food.  They're everywhere, just look for them. <p>





If you are willing to put the time in to looking for an internship, there will almost certainly be one that suits your interest.  Washington, DC is ripe with internship opportunities in every field of interest.  The most difficult part is getting started.  I found that searching for what's available was the easiest way to start.  Finding the opportunities that are available will motivate you to put together the necessary paper work.  There are many places to look:

<p> <ul> <li>Who do you know?  Family and friends are often the best sources of internship opportunities.  Figure out who you know and where they work.

<li>There are <a href="http://www.carleton.edu/campus/career/bibliography.html">books</a> which list internship opportunities.  I recommend Peterson's Guide to Internships. 

<li>Keep an eye out for internship opportunities in magazines and newspapers.  Check the classifieds.

<li>Look into the <a href="http://www.american.edu/other.depts/washsem_worldcaps/">American University Internship Program</a> for a summer in Washington, DC.  For a fee, they will help you find a place to work, provide you with housing, and usually you will be able to get course credit.

<li>Go to your career center at school.  Most schools provide some kind of assistance for finding internships.  Be careful not to limit yourself to what your school recommends.  There are many more opportunities available than just what your school will point you towards.

<li>Search the web.  There are numerous sources out there.  I found a few, but this is not a comprehensive list.
<a href="http://www.fga.com/twc/intern.html">The Washington Center</a>, 
<a href="/heritage/intern_program/intern.html">The Heritage Foundation</a>,
<a href="http://www.med.ufl.edu/oihp/students/intern.html">National Council for International Health</a>,
<a href="http://www.tvjobs.com/intern.htm">Radio and Television Internship Opportunities</a>,
<a href="http://www.si.edu/youandsi/ofgfel.htm">The Smithsonian Institution Opportunities</a>,
<a href="http://www.americanexpress.com/student/moneypit/getjob/intern/intern.html">American Express University</a>,
<a href="/discovery/educate.html">The Discovery Institute</a>,
<a href="/conservative/intern.html">American Conservative Union</a>,
<a href="/lead-inst/eps.html">The Leadership Institute</a></ul>

It is essential to apply to several internships that you are interested in, as the competition is fierce, especially in the summer.

<p>Once you have composed a list of internship opportunities that you would like, you are ready to put together the necessary materials.  At the very least you will need a <a href="/townhall/spotlights/interns/6-7-96/resume.html">resume</a> and <a href="/townhall/spotlights/interns/6-7-96/coverltr.html">cover letter</a>.  The key to a good resume and cover letter is to distinguish yourself.  Emphasize any experiences, accomplishments, leadership positions, etc. that will set you apart.  In addition, if you are applying to different types of positions you may want to emphasize different experiences and accomplishments accordingly.

<p>You will often be asked to submit additional information, such as a transcript, writing samples, recommendations, and applications.  Recommendations can be very helpful, depending on who writes them.  This is partly luck, but try to find someone that has a talent for emphasizing and/or creating your special talents.  In a writing sample, look for something that relates to the work of the office you are interested in.  In addition, originality is good.  These people will see many writing samples, make yours stand out.  Keep in mind it doesn't have to be a paper, I found that brochures and advertisements I created for a previous job worked well.  The key is to make your materials as personal as possible.  It is important to give the impression that you are putting a lot of effort into the materials you send.  The process can be time consuming and frustrating.  However, it is definitely worth the effort.

<p>After you have submitted all the necessary materials, you may be contacted for an interview.  Interviews are a nerve-racking experience for most people.  The key is to be yourself.  After all, the purpose of the interview is for your potential employer to get to know you.  At the same time, keep in mind what they want to here.  Do the little things that can impress them.  Pay attention to name, highlight experiences that relate to the work they have described, and anything else that will help.  It may take some practice to figure out what to do.  To get a start, try this <a href="http://www.kaplan.com/career/hotseat/"> practice interview</a>.

<center><h2>On The Job in D.C.</h2></center>

<h5>[ <a href="/townhall/spotlights/interns/7-10-96/">Graphics On</a> ]</h5>






<p><br><b>What To Expect</b><br>
Working in Washington in D.C. as an intern is not glamorous. Interns 
invariably get the jobs that no one else in the office wants; that's why 
they hire interns. Licking postage stamps, sorting diskettes, running 
errands, and other sometimes monotonous activities are par for the 
course.
<table><tr>
<td>



</td><td>
<center><h3>Important Mindless Skills To Cultivate</h3>
</center>
<ul>
<li>photo-copying
<li>faxing
<li>delivering messages 
<li>stuffing envelopes
<li>filing
<li>kissing up to the boss
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><i>How the rest of the employees view interns.</i></td></tr></table>

<HR>
<p>Fortunately, there are brief moments of interesting activities 
interspersed between the doldrums. Be careful to not discount activities
that may be beneficial in gaining more responsibility; doing a poor
job on one task does not recommend you to more interesting activities.
Not everyone can make policy decisions or author position papers.
If your job is kind of boring to start just live with it; things will improve.
<p>
The office staff will most likely enjoy having some one around to do the grunt 
work, but do not expect them to invite you out to lunch. Watch and learn are intern 
necessities; on the job training is a fundamental feature of an internship. Make sure 
you pick up skills from co-workers; sometimes there is a much easier process for accomplishing mindless tasks.
<hr>

<tr>

<h3>Ten Worst Washinton D.C. <br>Intern Positions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Fry cook for Bill Clinton.
<li>Marion Barry's Pharmacist
<li>Ted Kennedy's Chauffeur
<li>Tree trimmer for Al Gore
<li>Accountant for Al D'Amato
<li>Newt's Dietician
<li>Hillary's Psychic Channeler
<li>Political Correctness Tutor for Jesse Helms
<li>Personal Trainer for Strom Thurmond
<li>Bob Dole's Campaign Manager
</ol></td>




</tr></table>
<hr>

<p><br>




<b>Caveats</b><br>
<ol>
<li>Be on time- The only thing worse than D.C. traffic in the mornings is D.C. 
traffic in the evenings. Allow a time cushion or face the consequences. 
<li>Dress nicely- Unlike in Seattle, grunge is not regarded as a viable
fashion option in D.C.
<li>Don't whine- Interns willingly enlist in peonage for the summer; 
the bottom rung on the ladder is not the place for grandstanding.
<li>Be respectful- Especially to people who you don't know. It's not always obvious 
who's a big shot. (example: Who in their right mind in 1990 would have thought Slick Willie would become President?)

of hazardous waste facilities and Boilers and Industrial
Furnaces (BIFs) that burn hazardous waste. To date the bill
has been revised and passed with bipartisan support through
the House and out of Senate committee for Senate floor
action. Originally a strongly pro-business bill, it now
includes several plusses for the environment:</P>
<H4>-Increased public participation on permit modifications
brought before the OEPA</H4>
<H4>-Increased strength of the evidentiary process in
appeals. Citizens can now introduce evidence for the record
in public hearings that can serve as a basis for
appeals.</H4>
<H4>-BIF's have been brought into full review by HWFB, the
key siting agency in Ohio, thus expanding HWFB's important
regulatory role in the haz-waste playing field.</H4>
<P><BR>
 Our efforts have been well received by the
regulatory community and the legislature.</P>
<HR>
<H2>Forging a Green Link</H2>
<P>How many times have we duplicated previous effort to
locate the right OEPA official or legislator? How many times
have we desperately needed ready access to the other
environmental groups in Ohio on an important issue? GEC is
hoping to solve the problem through the wonders of the
internet. We are readying an information exchange program,
called GreenLink, that will help all groups committed to the
environment. Some features:</P>
<H4><EM>-GreenNews</EM>: Environmental news from around the
country</H4>
<H4>-<EM>GreenWatch</EM>: An eye on legislation affecting
the environment</H4>
<H4>-<EM>GreenForums</EM>: Open discussion forums on
environmental topics</H4>
<H4>-<EM>GreenGuides:</EM> A grassroots guide to who's who
in the legislature, the regulatory agencies, and the advocacy
organizations</H4>
<H4>-<EM>GreenLinks:</EM> Links from our server to other
environmental resources on the internet.</H4>
<H4>-<EM>Other Services:</EM> GreenLink will also host
interactive home pages for other environmental advocacy
organizations and provide special E-Mail addresses to
GreenLink members at a nominal fee.</H4>
<HR>
<H2>Equalizing E-Check</H2>
<P>GEC has decided to appeal a recent EPA decision that
undermines OEPA's air pollution program (E-Check). While most
are familiar with the required auto emissions testing in
several Ohio counties, many may not be aware that gas
stations in these counties must also provide special gas
pumps to minimize emissions. Ohio EPA Director Shregardus has
proposed new rules to exempt stations selling under 100,000
gallons per month. We say, if cars are to be held in
compliance, regardless of the amount driven or the ability of
the owner to pay, then service stations must be held to the
same standard! </P>
<P> <BR>

<P>We invite folks to work with us on this project. We will
need your help in a variety of ways as this project develops.
Call us at 513-767-2109 or contact us at our E-Mail address:
gec@greenlink.org </P>
<HR>
<H2>Gracias, Gracias, Gracias</H2>
<P>GEC extends special thanks to two friends of the
environment. Carl Root, owner of Copy Depot in Yellow
Springs, and Bob Bingenheimer, graphic arts designer in
Yellow Springs, have made important contributions to the work
of GEC that enable us to do our job more effectively. Carl
and Bob, you have our grateful thanks!!!!</P>
<HR>
<H2>Dumping Rad Waste...in Ohio???</H2>
<P> In 1995 the Ohio legislature passed a bill in which Ohio
agrees to build a gigantic dump for low-level radioactive
waste generated not only in Ohio but in five other states as
well. GEC believes Ohioans should decide by direct vote
whether to allow Ohio to become a host state for the Midwest
Compact's low level radioactive waste dump. We are therefore
working to support the petition drive to get this issue on
the ballot. Voters can then decide the fate of this issue.
</P>
<HR>
<H2>Stepping Up to the Environmental Plate</H2>
<P>In addition to the initiatives already mentioned, GEC has
been active in the following issues in recent months:</P>
<H4>-Providing input and comment on the Ohio's Clean Air Act
Rules (which was largely ignored). </H4>
<H4> -Participating (unsuccessfully) in OEPA rule-making on
scrap tire disposal.</H4>
<H4>-Testifying and working with legislators and the OEPA to
block the implementation of the so-called anti-degradation
bill (the rules passed, but barely- Some of our legislatures
were paying attention).</H4>
<H4>-Working with the OEPA and Southdown Co. concerning a
new air permit for the company's nearby cement kiln. GEC is
opposed to any increased air emissions and the burning of
tires at this Southdown facility.</H4>
<HR>
<H2>Bonner Scholars at GEC</H2>
<P>Antioch College students interested in the environment
intern with the GEC through the college's Bonner Scholar
program. Each quarter several young people pursue their
interests and fine-tune their skills with our group. We are
grateful for the students' commitment and contributions to
our mission.</P>
<HR>
<H2>Coalition Affiliate Hard at Work</H2>
<P>In nearby Clark County, a very busy affiliate group, the
Clark County Citizens' Coalition, has been working hard in
the community of South Charleston. Among their
activities:</P>
<H4>-Working to keep the Little Miami River, which
headwaters in their area, a resource of great natural
beauty</H4>
<H4>-Developing a Clark County Re-Use Recycling Center</H4>
<H4>-Monitoring health conditions in the village</H4>
<H4>-Monitoring fire and other problems in a local wood
mulch facility</H4>
<HR>
<H2>Do Air Force Bases Have HazMat Problems?</H2>
<P> The answer is yes, at least at nearby Wright Patterson
Air Force Base. Of the 65 sites that have been identified so
far, 31 remain for remediation. Sites include landfills,
spill sites, fire training areas, disposal/burial sites, and
earthfill disposal zones. GEC President, Tracy Slayton,
serves on the Restoration Advisory Board, which oversees the
identification and remediation of these sites to prevent
adverse effects to human health or the environment. </P>
<HR>
<H2>Calling All Grassroots Groups</H2>
<P>We look forward to networking together as we address
mutual concerns in our localities, in Ohio and beyond. Please
send us your own newsletter if you have one and contact us

<HR>
<H5><EM>Organization Purpose and History</EM></H5>
<P>The Greene Environmental Coalition (GEC) is a Greene
County, Ohio non-profit corporation with 501 C3 status. In
1991 the organization grew from a weekly discussion and
action group to a formal corporation organized to provide a
clearinghouse for information relating to environmental
matters. GEC focused its efforts on a nearby hazardous waste
burning cement kiln in Greene County, Ohio. As a result of
its efforts two industrial ash dumps polluting surface and
ground water are being cleaned up. The cement kiln was denied
its permit to handle hazardous waste and in November of 1994,
formally moved to exit the hazardous waste business at all
its facilities around the country.<BR>
 </P>
<P>In early 1995, the organization established a structure
more suited to &quot;peace time&quot; activism. GEC is
serving as a small umbrella organization for local grass
roots groups and has taken an active role providing statewide
support for environmental legislation and rulemaking.
Currently the group is working on air and solid waste rules
and hazardous waste legislation.<BR>
 </P>
<P><B>Structure<BR>
</B>Our corporate structure requires a
Board and officers. While the Board approves major
expenditures, the decision making body is the membership.
Most of the current members have been with GEC for several
years. Our average age is over 40. We are gender and
politically balanced. <BR>
 </P>
<P>We maintain an office, meeting room, and library.
Currently we keep office hours from 9 to 12 daily. We can be
reached by telephone at 513.767.2109 or by <A HREF="mailto:gec@sprynet.com">
E-Mail </A> .<BR>
</P>
<P><B>Staff<BR>
</B>GEC has no paid staff, although it has
recently contracted for a project coordinator. Volunteers
from the membership and an occasional intern from the local
university have given thousands of hours to the organization.
The group has recently contracted with a long standing member
to provide six months coordination on expanding our role
within the advocacy community. <BR>

Program (brownfields) rules until <strong>Oct. 10, 1996</strong>. The extension was granted in response to several 
requests from representatives of industry and environmental interest groups.</p>
<p>The proposed rules will be refiled with the legislature's rule review committee(JCARR) by early 
October, enabling the rules to be on JCARR's <strong>October 22 </strong>agenda.</p>

<p>The Ohio Chapter of the Sierra Club was chartered in 1968 and has an extensive history of 
grassroots environmental activism in Ohio. More than 16,000 members make up seven regional 
volunteer-driven Sierra Club Groups that work on environmental issues in their areas. These 
Groups meet regularly and sponsor a variety of conservation oriented activities including outings 
events, activist campaigns, and environmental educational programs. </p>
<p>Volunteers work on several campaigns, including the Clean Water Campaign, the Radioactive 
Waste Campaign, the Protect Ohio's Wilds Campaign and the Livable Communities Campaign. To 
find out more about these campaigns &amp; how to get involved in them, please contact the Chapter 
Office. Contact information is found below. </p>
<p>In addition to the volunteer activists, the Ohio Chapter employs two full time professional staff. The 
staff in Columbus work as partners with the volunteers in addressing critical environmental issues in 
the state. This structure is unique to environmental groups in Ohio and well suited to influence 
Ohio's state government. Jeff Skelding is the Chapter's lobbyist and works in the Ohio General 
Assembly to promote the Sierra Club's state legislative agenda. To find out more about the 
legislative program please contact the Chapter office. Margaret Koran directs the Chapter's 
Liveable Communities Campaign . More about this campaign is found below. </p>
<p><a name="Regional Groups"><b>Regional Groups</b></a></p>
<p>Each regional group conducts outings and meetings and publishes its own newsletter bi-monthly.

<p>Margaret Koran is a transportation policy analyst and the staff person to contact regarding the 
Livable Communities Campaign. The Ohio Chapter of the Sierra Club through the Livable 
Communities Campaign seeks to support transportation policy, land-use planning and economic 
development which is environmentally sound, safe, economical, and socially just. The Campaign is 
also working to increase public participation at all levels of transportation planning. The Ohio 
Chapter encourages environmentally friendly modes of transportation as a way to minimize our 
dependence upon the automobile. </p>
<p>The federal transportation funding law, ISTEA (Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act 
of 1991), will be reauthorized in 1997. ISTEA focuses on linking various modes of transportation 
and encouraging environmentally friendly modes of travel, especially in areas with poor air quality. 
Highway funding still dominates though. There are several current Congressional proposals pending 
which could dramatically affect transportation funding and policy in Ohio. The Ohio Department of 
Transportation favors changes to increase the amount of federal gas taxes that the state gets back. 
Unfortunately, the same bill would end small set asides for projects like bike paths and historic 
preservation. <i>For more information on these bills, please contact the chapter office.</i> </p>
<p>One of ISTEA's best provisions is mandatory public participation at all stages of transportation 
planning, on a local level and state level. In Ohio there are 16 metropolitan planning organizations 
(MPOs) that develop land use and transportation plans for their areas. You can get involved by 
attending meetings to learn more about the planning process. Many have citizen advisory councils 
which you can be a part of. <i>For more information about becoming active at your local MPO, 
please contact the chapter office.</i> </p>
<p>Statewide land use laws are weak and contribute to problems of urban and suburban sprawl. 
Farmland is lost while simultaneously urban centers decay. Halting this pattern will improve the 
quality of life for all Ohioans. An upcoming conference will focus on ways to curb this spiraling 
growth to make a better Ohio. <i>For more information on this conference and other initiatives 
regarding urban sprawl, please contact the chapter office.</i> </p>

<p>Rivers Unlimited is a statewide organization that works to protect and restore Ohio's 61,000 miles 
of rivers and streams. Since 1972, we have supported the efforts of citizens and groups working to 
protect their local waterways, and worked on over 100 projects in 36 counties.</p>
<p>In June of 1996, Rivers Unlimited launched its &quot;<a href="http://www.greenlink.org/rivers/twenty.html"> Twenty in 2000 </a>&quot; campaign, which is designed to 
double the number of scenic rivers in Ohio by the turn of the century. Though the Ohio Scenic 
Rivers Program was proactive during its founding decade of the 1970s, no waterways have been 
added since 1984. Rivers Unlimited will help citizens generate local support in their communities to 
qualify a waterway for scenic river status.</p>
<p>Rivers Unlimited has also emerged as the statewide leader in developing greenways. Greenways 
are open spaces that connect people, parks, historic sites, and natural areas and frequently follow 
streamside corridors and abandoned rail lines. The organization has recently hired a coordinator to 
direct a two-year statewide <a href="http://www.greenlink.org/rivers/greenway.html">Greenways Initiative </a>.</p>
<p><br>
With the relocation of our statewide office to Columbus in mid-1995, Rivers Unlimited has become 
active in influencing a variety of <a href="http://www.greenlink.org/rivers/legislat.html">state legislation </a>. We are currently opposing a takings bill and the 
environmental audit privilege bill, and supporting a bill to overturn the antidegradation statute.</p>
<p>Members of Rivers Unlimited receive the newsletter Rivers Quarterly, invitations to special events, 
and regular updates about timely river issues. Network and training opportunities are provided to 
both member organizations and individuals. Join Rivers Unlimited today and join in the growing 
movement to protect and restore Ohio's 61,000 miles of rivers and streams.</p>
<p>Rivers Unlimited also supports a number of <a href="http://www.greenlink.org/rivers/local/index.html">local river organizations</a>. </p>

<p>Rivers Unlimited is a statewide organization that works to protect and restore Ohio's 61,000 miles 
of rivers and streams. Since 1972, we have supported the efforts of citizens and groups working to 
protect their local waterways, and worked on over 100 projects in 36 counties.</p>
<p>In June of 1996, Rivers Unlimited launched its &quot;<a href="http://www.greenlink.org/rivers/twenty.html"> Twenty in 2000 </a>&quot; campaign, which is designed to 
double the number of scenic rivers in Ohio by the turn of the century. Though the Ohio Scenic 
Rivers Program was proactive during its founding decade of the 1970s, no waterways have been 
added since 1984. Rivers Unlimited will help citizens generate local support in their communities to 
qualify a waterway for scenic river status.</p>
<p>Rivers Unlimited has also emerged as the statewide leader in developing greenways. Greenways 
are open spaces that connect people, parks, historic sites, and natural areas and frequently follow 
streamside corridors and abandoned rail lines. The organization has recently hired a coordinator to 
direct a two-year statewide <a href="http://www.greenlink.org/rivers/greenway.html">Greenways Initiative </a>.</p>
<p><br>
With the relocation of our statewide office to Columbus in mid-1995, Rivers Unlimited has become 
active in influencing a variety of <a href="http://www.greenlink.org/rivers/legislat.html">state legislation </a>. We are currently opposing a takings bill and the 
environmental audit privilege bill, and supporting a bill to overturn the antidegradation statute.</p>
<p>Members of Rivers Unlimited receive the newsletter Rivers Quarterly, invitations to special events, 
and regular updates about timely river issues. Network and training opportunities are provided to 
both member organizations and individuals. Join Rivers Unlimited today and join in the growing 
movement to protect and restore Ohio's 61,000 miles of rivers and streams.</p>
<p>Rivers Unlimited also supports a number of <a href="http://www.greenlink.org/rivers/local/index.html">local river organizations</a>. </p>

<p>Apparently there have been changes made to the rules on
Brownfields since the last filing. According to a memo form
Jenifer Kwasniewski, dated Oct. 3, 1996, the pulic comment period
is extended until the end of business (5:00 pm) on Oct. 15, 1996.
The OEPA expects to refile the rules with JCARR later in October
and is likely to be on the Nov. 19th JCARR agenda. To request a
copy of the rules, contact Jenifer Kwasniewski at (614) 644-2279
or e-mail: <a
href="mailto:jenifer_kwasniewski@central.epa.ohio.gov">jenifer_kwasniewski@central.epa.ohio.gov</a>.</p>

<p><a name="Of Special Interest:"><strong>Of Special Interest:</strong></a></p>

<p>An unusual alliance of environmentalists and industry is
concerned about the Hazardous Waste Identification Rule (HWIR).
This legislation will reduce the exit level on 376 hazardous
chemicals. The materials would no longer be treated as Subtitle C
requiring oversight by RCRA (Resource Conservation Recovery Act),
but instead will be reduced to Subtitle D. This new
classification would allow the waste to be disposed of in
municipal landfills.</p>

<p>To read more about this important issue and learn why several
groups oppose it, contact <a href="http://www.environment.net">P.E.P</a>.'s
web site. <a href="http://www.greenlink.org/forum/REG-AGENCIES/">Regulatory
Agency Forum </a>(<strong>The forums are available to all
GreenLink members.</strong> If you are not a GreenLink member,
please <a href="http://www.greenlink.org/signup.html">Sign up</a>
now. It's free!)</p>

<p>The September issue of <u>Ohio Environmental Protection Agency
Agenda 96 </u>states: &quot;As chairman of the Environmental
Council of States' waste committee, Director Schregardus has
committed the Agency to assist in this federal rule making, which
potentially will declassify large amounts of low toxicity waste
from hazardous waste management requirements. Contact: Mike
Savage, (614) 644-2917.&quot;</p>

<h1 align=center><strong>Brownfields Issues</strong> - Ohio 
Environmental Council</h1>
<hr>
<p align=center><br>
<b>ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY MUST OPPOSE RULES NEW 
BROWNFIELDS RULES</b></p>
<p align=left>Please plan to attend one of three public meetings the week of September 3, 1996. The 
meetings will be held in West Cleveland, Columbus, and Dayton. No specific dates or 
locations have been set yet. The purpose of the meetings is to learn more about the 
Brownfields rules and the public comment period which ends on September 9. The Joint 
Committee on Agency Rule Review is scheduled for September 24. By that time we would 
like to have people tell the Joint Committee on Agency Rule Review why the new rules are 
a very bad idea.<br></p>
<p align=center><b>WHAT IS BROWNFIELDS</b></p>
<p align=left>Brownfields refer to properties that are contaminated with hazardous waste. Many 
Brownfields are located in Ohio's inner cities urban areas.</p>
<p align=center><b>WHAT ARE THE NEW BROWNFIELDS RULES<br>
</b></p>
<p align=left>The Ohio EPA has created a program called a Voluntary Action Program (VAP). This 
program allows private developers to redevelop Brownfields sites. While redeveloping 
these sites is a good idea, the new rules that apply to the VAP program do three things:<br>
<br>
</p>
<ol>
<li>The new rules <b>drastically reduced the cleanup requirements</b> for these properties 
as an incentive to the developers. </li>
<li>The new rules <b>release private property redevelopers from liability</b> if any 
problems arise in the future from contamination left on the property. </li>
<li>The new rules <b>have secrecy provisions </b>in them that will prevent citizens from 
getting critical information about the amount of contamination on the property and 
the way the cleanup is being done. </li>
</ol>
<p align=center><b>ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUES OF THE VAP</b></p>
<p>Many of the contaminated properties are located in low-income and minority communities 
that have little or no political power. Many of these communities are already overburdened 
by heavily polluting industries, hazardous waste landfills and hazardous waste incinerators. 
The VAP program will allow Brownfields property, after cleanup, to still have high levels of 
very dangerous contaminants in the groundwater and the soil. These contaminants will 
migrate into drinking water and emit pollutants into the air. Susceptible populations like the 
elderly, children, and the ill will be exposed to these contaminants on a daily basis. 
Remember that you do not have to live in the inner city to be affected. These toxic 
contaminants get into underground water and the air and affect all of us.<br>
<b></b></p>
<p align=center><b>WHAT CAN YOU DO TO STOP THE ENVIRONMENTAL INJUSTICE<br>
</b></p>
<p>It is extremely important for the environmental community to quickly organize and stop this 
environmental injustice. This is poor public policy and it will lead to our inner cities 
remaining permanently contaminated. Brownfields can be successfully redeveloped without 
relaxing the clean up requirements. Redevelopment of our inner cities does not have to be 
at the expense of human health.<br></p>

<h3 align=center>Testimony For Public Record </h3>
<h3 align=center>Ohio EPA Certification of Corps of Engineers Nationwide Permits</h3>
<p>November 4, 1996 on behalf of:</p>
<p>Sandy Buchanan - Ohio Citizen Action, Vicki Deisner - Ohio Environmental Council, Elaine Marsh 
- Friends of the Crooked River, Clara Marus - League of Women Voters of Ohio, Louis Adams - 
Environmental Network, Julie Sibbing- National Audubon Society, Great Lakes Regional Office, 
Edith Chase - Concerned Citizen, Jeff Skelding - Ohio Chapter of the Sierra Club, Tod Ambs - 
Rivers Unlimited, Tony DiNovo - Izaak Walton League/Ohio Division, (Other signatories will be 
added during the public comment period)</p>
<p>My name is Julie Sibbing, I am the Wetlands Coordinator for the Great Lakes Regional Office of 
the National Audubon Society. I come here tonight to present a unified front on behalf of the 
environmental and conservation community in Ohio with regards to the Ohio Environmental 
Protection Agency's re-certification of Corps of Engineers' Nationwide Permits under Sections 404 
and 401 of the Clean Water Act. The Corps of Engineers has requested Section 401 Water 
Quality Certification for 37 existing and 4 new nationwide permits. We appreciate and take very 
seriously this opportunity to contribute our input into the Ohio EPA's decision on whether to certify, 
certify with conditions, or deny each of these permits. </p>
<p>The state of Ohio should take its responsibilities with regards to protecting wetlands, streams, and 
other waters very seriously. Failure to do so will result in damage, not only to ecological systems, 
but to our state's economy and quality of life as well. Where the Federal government leaves our 
resources unprotected, the state needs to step in and pick up the slack. The 401 certification 
process for NWPs gives Ohio a chance to adjust permitting processes to the needs of our state. 
Since we are second in the nation in percentage of original wetlands loss, we need to be a leader in <br>
protecting our wetland and other water resources. </p>
<p>A National Audubon Society Report &quot;The Impact of Individual 404 Permits on Ohio Wetlands 
1990-1995&quot; revealed a net loss of Ohio wetlands, even under the most stringent individual 
permitting requirements. It therefore concerns us greatly that state agencies are not even involved in 
the majority of permits issued for wetland impacts in Ohio. We ask the Ohio EPA to carefully 
consider the impacts to our state's waters of delegating responsibilities to the Corps of Engineers 
through NWPs.</p>
<p><strong><u>General Comments:</u></strong></p>
<p>We are seriously concerned that the Corps of Engineers has completely failed to document the 
impacts of NWPs on our state's aquatic resources. Such information is needed in order for the 
Ohio EPA to make informed decisions about the reauthorization of existing NWPs. We strongly 
encourage the Ohio EPA to work closely with the Corps to make sure that all future impacts to our 
state's aquatic resources are well documented and that significant degradation is not allowed to 
occur.</p>
<p>An overall concern we have with the implementation of the Nationwide permit program in Ohio is 
that currently, several NWPs can be &quot;stacked&quot; (used in combination) to allow bigger impacts than 
allowable under any one NWP. A housing development may use one nationwide for houses, 
another each time a road is crossed, and a third to put in water sewer and power lines. The impacts 
add up quickly. We therefore request that the Ohio EPA do a careful analysis of any extant or 
potential abuses of &quot;stacking,&quot; and to disallow the use of these permits in combination with any 
other NWPs. </p>
<p>Some areas of the state and some types of aquatic habitats deserve special protection from 
degradation. What may be considered an insignificant impact in some areas or in some habitats is 
highly significant in other areas or habitats. We therefore request that the Ohio EPA carefully 
consider denying the use of most or all NWPs in certain targeted areas, including, but not limited to: 
Sandusky Bay and adjacent wetlands, Lake Erie and adjacent wetlands, the Pond Brook 
Watershed, wetlands designated as Category 3 under the soon-to-be completed Wetland Water 
Quality Standards, and streams which are designated as Coldwater, Exceptional Warm Water, or 
Seasonal Salmonid aquatic life habitat in Ohio's water quality standards.</p>
<p>In order to adequately protect water quality in the state, several NWPs that have been certified in 
the past will need to be denied and many others conditioned. This will entail more work for the 
Ohio EPA's Division of Surface Water. Yet current staffing levels in this division are woefully 
inadequate. We request that Director Shregardus dedicate sufficient resources to Surface Water to 
enable them to handle permit applications, enforcement, and follow-through on permits. Inadequate 
staffing levels should not be an excuse to allow continued degradation of our state's waters. <br>
</p>
<h4><strong><u>Specific Comments:</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>NWP 26 Headwaters and Isolated Wetlands. </strong></p>
<p>Our biggest concern related to the re-issuance of Nationwide Permits centers around NWP 26. By 
focusing this permit on headwater wetlands and isolated wetlands of under 10 acres, the Corps has 
managed to expedite the processing of the vast majority of wetland permits. Unfortunately this has 
been accomplished at the expense of many valuable wetlands and in flagrant violation of Section 
404 (e) of the Clean Water Act.</p>
<p>The Corps, recognizing the highly controversial nature of this permit has offered several options for 
its re-issuance. Yet, already, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, <br>
Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, New York, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, 
Vermont, Washington and Wyoming have stated their intention to reject certification of NWP 26 in 
any form. We request that Ohio follow the lead of these 18 states.</p>
<p>The Corps has not proven that impacts under NWP 26 have been minimal, especially on a 
cumulative scale. Since neither the Ohio EPA nor any of the Corps Districts operating in Ohio keep 
records on such impacts, it is hard to determine the extent of the impact to waters of the state. A 
study conducted by the USFWS Sacramento Field Office found that at least 725 acres of wetlands 
were filled under NWP 26 in the Sacramento region from 1987-1992. This cannot, in anyone's <br>
terms, be considered a minimal effect. The state of California has decided to deny certification to 
NWP 26. Ohio should follow suit. </p>
<p>Even if the Corps, in their re-issuance of NWP 26, reduces its coverage to 3 acres of impact, with 
anything under a third of an acre not requiring notification, significant degradation of water quality 
could occur. One third of an acre is nearly a mile of headwater stream 3 feet across. Three acres of 
wetlands covers an area the size of four football fields. Such vast destruction contributes greatly to 
the degradation of our Ohio wetlands, streams, and lakes and the wildlife that depend upon them. </p>
<p>NWP 26 discriminates against waters based on location and size, a concept that the National 
Academy of Sciences' National Research Council in their report on Wetlands, Characteristics and 
Boundaries has found to be scientifically indefensible. &quot;[t]he scientific basis for policies that attribute 
less importance to headwater areas and isolated wetlands than to other wetlands is weak.&quot; The 
study points out that both isolated and headwater wetlands perform many of the same functions and 
values as wetlands located adjacent to larger waterways, including that of water quality 
improvements.</p>
<p><strong>NWP 29 Single Family Homes:</strong></p>
<p>Another permit that greatly concerns us is NWP 29. Although this permit has not been used 
extensively to date, we anticipate that it will be used much more frequently in the future as 
developers become aware of its availability. Although various Corps districts have interpreted 
&quot;attendant features&quot; differently, a draft memo from Michael Davis, Chief of the Regulatory Branch 
of the Corps, dated August 25, 1995 states the following: &quot;We have listed several examples to be 
considered by the districts as attendant features. These include garage, driveway, storage shed, and 
septic field. In addition, we consider ponds, vegetable gardens, swimming pools, and tennis courts 
as allowable attendant features. Although we also believe that a yard is an appropriate attendant 
feature of a single-family home, we have not identified a size that is acceptable. Corps districts 
should work with the applicant to ensure that adequate, but not excessive, yards are authorized.&quot; 
The memo also states that no regional or case-specific conditions can be made to NWP 29 by 
Corps Districts. The memo also clarifies that attendant features can qualify for NWP 29 
independent of any construction of a single family home and allows for its use in <br>
the construction of a second home on the parcel in several cases.</p>
<p>Taken to this ridiculous extreme, NWP 29 can be used to fill up to a half acre of wetlands for a 
pond, a swimming pool, a tennis court, a second home, or simply to make a yard or vegetable 
garden. Already, on a nationwide basis, NWP 29 has been used to permit a pool, a deck, a boat 
shed, a workshop, and a septic field in wetlands adjacent to Lake Superior in Michigan. If the 
Corps will not condition the use of this permit to a reasonable level, then the Ohio EPA must do so. 
Beyond the geographical restrictions currently in place, and the restrictions on wetlands types, we 
request that the Ohio EPA condition the use of NWP 29 to apply only to the construction of 
single-family homes and to disallow attendant features altogether.</p>
<p>In addition, we request that the maximum fill size be reduced to 0.1 acre. If this permit is to be used 
for single family homes, no greater area should be necessary to accommodate construction.</p>
<p><strong>NWP 12 Utility Backfill and Bedding:</strong></p>
<p>We support all current restrictions on the use of NWP 12 and ask that the Ohio EPA further 
condition its certification by requiring complete revegetation of disturbed areas. This would provide 
an incentive to those performing the work to ensure that sufficient topsoil is backfilled into trenches 
to once again support aquatic vegetation. We also request that the Ohio EPA prohibit the use of 
this permit in conjunction with any other NWPs. </p>
<p><strong>NWP 13 Bank Stabilization:</strong></p>
<p>The Corps has proposed to eliminate the Pre-construction Notification requirement of NWP 13. 
The Ohio EPA should insist that pre-construction notification of impacts under NWP 13 continue. 
This is critical to allowing the Ohio DNR and the U.S.Fish and Wildlife Service to determine if a 
proposed project could negatively affect habitat for threatened and endangered species. Sediment 
loading resulting from such projects can pose a great risk to our state's many declining mollusk 
species. We support the continuation of all current conditions on the permit, with the exception of 
allowances for projects greater than 500 feet in length and in excess of one cubic yard per foot. 
Since the Corps has failed to enforce the conditions on NWP 13 in many areas, we ask that the 
OEPA limit the size of the project permitted to under 500 feet in length and one cubic yard per foot 
of material.</p>
<p><strong>NWP 14 Road Crossings:</strong></p>
<p>We request that conditions be attached to this NWP disallowing its use more than once per 
subdivision and limiting its impact to a third of an acre for a complete project. Without these 
conditions, developers are able to destroy highly significant amounts of wetlands by using the permit 
numerous times in one subdivision, when a shared crossing could be incorporated into the site. 
Another special condition should be that this permit not be used in conjunction with any other 
NWPs. </p>
<p><strong>NWP 18 Minor Discharges and NWP 19 Minor Dredging:</strong></p>
<p>We request that these permits not be used jointly, or in conjunction with any other NWP.</p>
<p><strong>NWP 32 Completed Enforcement Actions:</strong></p>
<p>Since the Corps is seeking to expand this permit to cover administrative settlements, which do not 
have a public notice requirement, we request that the Ohio EPA deny certification for this permit. 
We object to Corps administrative settlements occurring without any state or public scrutiny.</p>
<p><strong>Proposed NWP A - Moist Soil Management for Wildlife:</strong></p>
<p>This NWP should not be used to convert one wetland type to another for the enhancement of 
wildlife habitat. Each wetland type has unique characteristics, functions and values. We request that 
this permit be limited to maintenance of existing management regimes and that the Ohio EPA 
consider including a size limit. Enhancement activities should be permitted under individual permit 
processes due to the potential for significant changes in wetland functionality.</p>
<p><strong>Proposed NWP B - Minimal Effects :</strong></p>
<p>We request that the Ohio EPA deny certification to this proposed permit. Since this NWP is based 
upon USDA rules that have yet to be finalized, the Ohio EPA cannot determine what the effect 
would be on water quality in the state. Without this information, certification should not be 
considered.</p>
<p><strong>Proposed NWP C - Recreational Mining:</strong></p>
<p>We request that the Ohio EPA deny certification to this proposed NWP. Sand and gravel mining 
can be very detrimental to water quality. Furthermore, under the provision for recreational mining, 
the definition of &quot;recreational&quot; is left up to the District Engineer. Mining approved under this permit 
could allow for significant lowering of water quality and uncompensated destruction of fish habitat <br>
in Ohio's wetlands and streams.</p>
<p><strong>Proposed NWP D - Flood Control Structures:</strong></p>
<p>It is uncertain whether this permit is necessary, given the presence of NWP 3 which authorizes the 
repair, rehabilitation, or replacement of any previously authorized structure or fill. Many flood 
control projects were authorized and constructed many years ago, prior to widespread 
understanding and appreciation of the flood control and water storage function of wetlands. As a 
result, projects authorized in the past may not be supported by current natural resource 
management practices. Those projects that are no longer considered appropriate should not be 
perpetuated. The Ohio EPA should very carefully consider the effects of certification of this permit 
and/or any appropriate conditions that may reduce its potential negative impact. </p>
<p><strong>Other Problem NWPs:</strong></p>
<p>We request that the Ohio EPA continue to deny the following NWPs as they have tremendous

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"> Why a Constitutional Amendment?</H3></CENTER>
<P><BR>
 </P>
<P>On June 7, 1995, the Ohio legislature passed a law,
Substitute Senate Bill 19, </P>
<P>which forces Ohio to become the disposal site not only
for its own radioactive </P>
<P>wastes but also that of five other states: Minnesota,
Missouri, Iowa, Wisconsin </P>
<P>and Indiana.</P>
<P><BR>
 </P>
<P>Most (98% of the radioactivity) of the so-called
low-level radioactive wastes </P>
<P>are produced by the ten nuclear power plants in these
Midwest Compact States. </P>
<P>Some of these wastes are tainted with plutonium, one of
the deadliest materials </P>
<P>known. All are extremely hazardous to life. Many
substances in these wastes </P>
<P>remain radioactive for thousands of years, yet the law
requires monitoring for </P>
<P>only 500 years.</P>
<P><BR>
 </P>
<P>The Senate Bill requires Ohio to take these radioactive
wastes for 20 years or </P>
<P>until a limit of 2.25 million cubic feet of wastes is
reached. Should the time </P>
<P>expire or the capacity be reached, the decision can be
made without citizen vote </P>
<P>to extend both limits. No community is exempt from being
considered as the final </P>
<P>site for the Midwest Compact's Low-Level Radioactive
Waste Disposal Facility. </P>
<P>Many Ohio communities will be endangered by the
transportation of these wastes </P>
<P>on our highways and railways.</P>
<P><BR>
 </P>
<H3> Citizens Respond by Organizing</H3>
<P><BR>
 </P>
<P>Driven by concerns for the health of our families and
communities, the health of </P>
<P>the environment, and the safety of travelers sharing the
highways, Ohioans have </P>
<P>formed a citizens' advocacy group. </P>
<P>This alliance, Citizens Protecting Ohio, has developed an
Initiative Petition to </P>
<P>place a Constitutional Amendment on the ballot to prevent
the storage or </P>
<P>disposal of out-of-state radioactive wastes in Ohio. The
Amendment also states </P>
<P>that all Ohio wastes must be stored or disposed of in a
manner that prevents </P>
<P>any contamination of the environment. It further requires
that generators of </P>
<P>the radioactive wastes, not the taxpayers, take financial
responsibility for </P>
<P>the storage or disposal of those wastes. The Amendment
allows for the storage </P>
<P>of wastes for medical treatment and other scientific
uses.</P>
<P>Citizens working together across Ohio can prevail over
the clamor of nuclear </P>
<P>special interests.</P>
<P>Radiation exposure causes cancer, birth defects and
weakened </P>
<P>immunity. </P>

<title>JCARR's four reasons</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>

<body>
<h1 align=center>The Four Reasons JCARR May 
Recommend the Invalidation of a Rule:</h1>
<hr>
<p>1.	The rule exceeds the scope of the agency's <strong>statutory authority</strong> to make rules;</p>
<p>2.	The rule conflicts with the <strong>intent of the legislature</strong> in enacting the statute under which the rule 
is proposed;</p>
<p>3.	The rules <strong>conflict with another rule </strong>of that agency or a different rule-making agency; and,</p>
<p>4.	The agency has not proposed a<strong> complete and accurate rule summary and fiscal analysis </strong>of 
the proposed rule.</p>
<p>Also due to S.B. 33, if the rule summary and fiscal analysis is inadequate and those rules have a 
fiscal impact on school districts, counties, townships, or municipal corporations then, JCARR may 
<strong>on a one-time basis</strong> order an agency to revise the rule summary and fiscal analysis and re-file the 
rule at a later date.</p>

<hr>
<h3 align=center>Chemicals may pollute groundwater in Brownfields Cleanup </h3>
<hr>
<p>By Laura Yeomans<br>
P.O. BOX 8 <br>
Dover, OH 44622-4008<br>
</p>
<p>By Laura Yeomans, Citizen Action Research Director</p>
<p>Ohio EPA is asking for comments from the public on proposed rules for the cleanup of 
Brownfields sites, which are abandoned properties polluted by past industrial use, Under 
the program established by a new state law passed in 1994, companies will be able to 
clean up polluted properties voluntarily, In exchange, Ohio EPA will promise not to sue 
these companies. </p>
<p>The new rules should be changed because they will allow companies to leave pollution on 
properties that could pollute groundwater and present health problems for local residents 
and workers on site </p>
<p>&quot;Groundwater is not going to get cleaned up under this program, &quot; said Marilyn Wall, clean 
water coordinator for the Ohio Sierra Club. Wall served on an Ohio EPA groundwater 
subcommittee writing the Brownfields proposed rules. &quot;They have created loopholes with 
urban settings and loopholes with risk assessment. &quot; </p>
<p>Under the proposed program, a company could ask to have an &quot;urban setting designation&quot; 
for a polluted property, This is a label based on the number of people who depend on the 
groundwater at the site for drinking water. An urban setting designation would mean that 
the company will not have to clean up pollution contaminating groundwater. </p>
<p>In the past, all groundwater resources in Ohio had to be treated as precious resources that 
might some day be used for drinking water. Contamination had to be cleaned up. The 
urban setting designation is part of a new system where certain groundwater resources will 
no longer be protected from pollution. </p>
<p>Wall expressed concern that companies will not have to notify neighbors that a plume of 
chemical contamination is streaming their way and may contaminate their drinking water. </p>
<p>&quot;The industrial faction on the advisory committee didn't want to notify people that a plume 
may be headed in their direction. Companies plan to clean up contamination on site to 
whatever level they choose, &quot; Wall said. &quot;Because of the secrecy provisions of the 
program, the nearby property owner may never know that their property may be 
contaminated. If they do find out, they may not be able to prove where the pollution came 
from, because there is no public record showing pollution found at the Brownfields site. &quot; </p>
<p>Twenty-four Ohio EPA staff people wrote a letter to Ohio EPA iDirector Donald 
Schregardus stating that the volunteer company cleaning up a site &quot;maybe inclined to make 
an `Urban setting' determination based on the best interests of the Volunteer, but not 
necessarily on the best interests of the community or the future economic viability of the 
area. &quot; They recommended, &quot;It is essential that the public be allowed to voice their 
objections or approval when a property is scheduled to receive this designation. &quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Communities have been working to protect groundwater and develop wellfield protection 
programs over the last ten years. This urban setting designation and these Brownfields rules 
will turn back the clock, &quot; said Jane Forrest, a member of the Browntields advisory 
committee and environmental projects director for Citizen Action. </p>
<p>The 24 Ohio EPA staff also urged the director to improve the risk management plan for 
Brownfields sites, saying &quot;.. .The higher risk levels being proposed may result in inadequate 
protection of human health and the environment. &quot;</p>
<p>Jeff Fisher is a toxicologist from the Dayton area. &quot;From a scientific point of view, we don't 
know what the effects of low level contamination are on the human population, &quot; Fisher 
said. The Brownfields program allows companies to leave pollution on site that may cause 
cancer at a level of one cancer per 100,000 people exposed. Many programs use one in a 
million as the risk reduction goal. </p>
<p>&quot;Are people willing to live with levels of contamination that are higher by a factor often?&quot; 
Fisher said, &quot;In the real world, there will be multiple chemicals in the soil. Because the 
Brownfields plans don't address groundwater and don't address mixtures of chemicals, the 
standards will not be very useful. The public needs to get involved and decide what they 
think is appropriate. &quot; </p>

<TITLE>Testimony of Robert M. Soderstrom,
MD</TITLE>

<BODY>
<CENTER>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Testimony of Robert M. Soderstrom, MD</H2>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">
</H2>
</CENTER>I am very pleased to be invited on behalf of the Genesee
County Medical Society 
<P>of Flint, Michigan, to testify on the issue of so-called
low-level radioactive </P>
<P>waste disposal in Ohio. (The Genesee County Medical
Society appointed an </P>
<P>Environmental Health Committee, which I chaired, in the
fall of 1989, and one of </P>
<P>the committee's first actions was to review the issue of
radioactive waste </P>
<P>disposal.) In November 1989, the Board of the Genesee
County Medical Society </P>
<P>unanimously adopted a position in opposition to such a
site in Michigan. Our </P>
<P>reasons were several and were originally outlined in an
article we published in </P>
<P>the July 1990 issue of Michigan Medicine, the official
publication of the </P>
<P>Michigan State Medical Society. The Genesee County
Medical Society is made up of </P>
<P>the 500+ practicing physicians in Genesee County and our
purpose in focusing on </P>
<P>this issue is the preservation of the environment and the
protection of the </P>
<P>public's health. The reasons for our opposition are
several.</P>
<P><BR>
 </P>
<P>The terminology of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste
Compact is misleading and </P>
<P>confusing. The average person, seeing the title, assumes
that the radiation </P>
<P>levels of the waste to be stored by the Compact are
&quot;low-level&quot; and therefore of </P>
<P>no significant health concern. Nothing could be further
from the truth.</P>
<P><BR>
 </P>
<P>When one speaks of biologically low levels of radiation
exposure one might be </P>
<P>speaking of the radiation in some medically diagnostic
x-rays, perhaps half a </P>
<P>rad (the rad being a unit of measurement of radiation).
When the Nuclear </P>
<P>Regulatory Commission speaks of &quot;low-level&quot;
waste they mean all that waste from </P>
<P>a nuclear power plant that emits &quot;low-levels&quot;
of radiation in comparison to the </P>
<P>very highly radioactive nuclear fuel itself. Thus, by
their definition, a </P>
<P>non-fuel reactor component emitting 1000 rads/hour is
&quot;low-level&quot; for it is not </P>
<P>a high-level fuel component. However, if 500 rads/hour is
enough to kill a </P>
<P>person, and it is, then 1000 rads/hour is biologically
high-level radiation </P>
<P>indeed! It is critical to the current debate over
&quot;low-level&quot; radioactive waste </P>
<P>disposal to understand this crucial difference in the use
of the term </P>
<P>&quot;low-level&quot;. &quot;Low-level&quot; in Nuclear
Regulatory Commission terminology means only </P>
<P>that the waste to be sent to Ohio is not the very highly
radioac!</P>
<P>tive nuclear fuel itself. However, virtually everything
else from a nuclear </P>
<P>power plant can be sent here and much of it is highly
radioactive, long-lived, </P>
<P>and certainly a significant public health threat. Highly
radioactive products </P>
<P>that therefore qualify for a &quot;low-level&quot; waste
dump include components of the </P>
<P>nuclear reactor itself, filters, filter sludges, and
various absorptive resins. </P>
<P>It is this material that constitutes the great majority
of the radioactivity to </P>
<P>be placed in such a dump. While medical radioactive waste
for the most part has </P>
<P>half-lives of minutes, hours, and days, the radioactive
materials from nuclear </P>
<P>power plants have half-lives of tens and hundreds of
years.</P>
<P><BR>
 </P>
<P>To be more specific, let me list the major isotopes used
in medical diagnosis </P>
<P>and therapy. It is a general rule of thumb that one
should multiply the </P>
<P>half-life of a radioactive product by approximately 10-20
to determine the time </P>
<P>it takes for it to decay to a non-detectable level. Some
of the major isotopes </P>
<P>used in medical diagnosis and therapy are technetium-99m
with a half-life of 6 </P>
<P>hours, gallium-67 with a half-life of 78 hours,
thallium-201 - 73 hours, xenon- </P>
<P>133 - 5 days, indium-ill - 2.8 days, Iodine-123 - 13
hours, 1-125 - 60 days, I- </P>
<P>131 - 8 days, chromium-Si - 28 days, and phosphorus-32 -
14 days. On the other </P>
<P>hand, one of the most common radioactive waste
contaminants from a nuclear power </P>
<P>plant is cesium- 137 with a half-life of 30 years years,
requiring 300 years or </P>
<P>more to decay. Other radioactive waste products include
strontium-90 with a </P>
<P>half-life of nearly 30 years and even some nickel-59 with
a half-life of 80,000 </P>
<P>years and neptunium-237 with a half-life of 2,000,000
years.</P>
<P><BR>
 </P>
<P>To further demonstrate the immense discrepancy involved
one only needs to look </P>
<P>at the Rogers and Associates Engineering Corporation
study completed for the </P>
<P>Midwest Compact. The study characterized the
radioactivity of the materials to </P>
<P>be stored by the Compact. The study stated that over 20
years utilities will be </P>
<P>disposing of 207,000 curies of radioactive waste in the
dump</P>
<P>site, 84% of the total. Medical sources, however, will
account for only 130 </P>
<P>curies medical waste therefore making up just 0.05% of
the total curies </P>
<P>disposed. Even more importantly, the study showed that
Class A radioactive </P>
<P>waste, which is the least concentrated, constitutes only
20% of the waste coming </P>
<P>from utilities while it makes up 90% of the waste coming
from all other sources </P>
<P>and virtually all of the waste to come from medical
diagnostics, therapeutics, </P>
<P>and research. On the other hand, Class C waste, which is
highly concentrated and </P>
<P>very toxic, constitutes 42% of the radioactive waste
utilities want to put in </P>
<P>&quot;low-level&quot; radioactive waste sites.</P>
<P><BR>
 </P>
<P>It becomes apparent, then, that the debate should not
focus on the very small </P>
<P>contribution of radioactive waste that medicine will make
to such a dump site. </P>
<P>Nor should the need to dispose of short-lived radioactive
materials from </P>
<P>medicine and research serve as a cover for the very, very
different kinds of </P>
<P>radioactive materials utilities want to put in such a
site. Rather, the debate </P>
<P>should focus on the immense amount of long-lived
radioactive materials that </P>
<P>utilities want to call &quot;low-level&quot; in
comparison to their very highly </P>
<P>radioactive nuclear fuel.</P>
<P><BR>
 </P>
<P>Two of these isotopes from power plants are of real
public health concern, </P>
<P>especially in the first 100 years or so. Cesium- 137 is
very biologically </P>
<P>active, being concentrated from soil and water by plants
and from plants by </P>
<P>plant-eating animals and it therefore represents a
significant threat to the </P>
<P>food chain. It is greatly biomagnified, meaning that it
occurs in greater </P>
<P>concentration in animals higher in the food chain. It was
cesium-137 that was </P>
<P>responsible for the destruction of the reindeer herds in
Scandinavia and the </P>
<P>sheep herds in England following the Chernobyl disaster.
Cesium- 137 has now </P>
<P>been confirmed in great concentration in many fish in
Swedish lakes and in some </P>
<P>areas fishing will not be safe for decades. Cesium-137 is
a major nuclear </P>
<P>reactor contaminant. As previously mentioned, it has a
half-life of 30 years and </P>
<P>requires 300 years to decay to insignificant levels.
Strontium-90 is another </P>
<P>isotope with food-chain implications. Strontium-90,
ingested from gro!</P>
<P>und contamination, is excreted in cow 5 milk and is thus
ingested by human </P>
<P>beings. Strontium-90 also has a 300 year decay
requirement. Either one of these </P>
<P>isotopes, escaping into the environment through land,
water, or air </P>
<P>contamination, represents a significant public health
threat.</P>
<P><BR>
 </P>
<P>The experience with zinc-65 is a good example of what can
happen when a </P>
<P>radioactive element is biomagnified in the food chain.
During the 1950's and </P>
<P>1960's, coolant water from the Columbia River was
routinely passed through the </P>
<P>nuclear reactors at Hanford, Washington and returned to
the river. The river </P>
<P>water was thereby contaminated with some short-lived
radioactive corrosion </P>
<P>products. One of the Hanford workers was found to have
detectable amounts of </P>
<P>zinc-65 in his tissues as a result of having eaten
contaminated oysters from an </P>
<P>ocean bay on the Washington coast some 200 miles from
Hanford and 30 miles north </P>
<P>of the Columbia River's mouth. The zinc-65, which has a
half-life of about eight </P>
<P>months, was entering the river in the effluent from the
Hanford reactors, then </P>
<P>being carried some 360 river miles to the Pacific where
ocean currents carried </P>
<P>it northward into the bay in extremely minute
concentrations. Oysters, however, </P>
<P>are filter-feeders with a particular chemical affinity
for either stable or radioactive</P>
<P> zinc, and they were concentrating the </P>
<P>zinc-65 at 200,000 times its concentration in the
seawater.</P>
<P><BR>
 </P>
<P>The health risks of exposure to low-levels of radiation
are well-documented. It </P>
<P>is a complicated and extensive topic and I am only
touching upon it here, but </P>
<P>suffice it to say that in December 1989, the National
Academy of Sciences </P>
<P>published the BEIR V report, &quot;Health Effects of
Exposure to Low Levels of </P>
<P>Ionizing Radiation&quot;. On page six of the report it
says this, quote, &quot;The cancer </P>
<P>risk estimates used in this report are about 3 times
larger for solid cancers </P>
<P>and about four times larger for leukemia than the risk
estimates presented 10 </P>
<P>years earlier. These differences result from a number of
factors, including new </P>
<P>risk models, revised A-bomb dosimetry, and more extended
follow-up of A-bomb </P>
<P>survivors.&quot; It also says, on the same page,
&quot;the risk of exposure in childhood </P>
<P>to radiation is estimated to be about twice as large as
the risk for adults.&quot; </P>
<P>Obviously, this well-documented and extensive national
study demonstrates a </P>
<P>major change in risk estimates for low-level radiation
exposures and the human </P>
<P>organism. Unlike so many other toxics where the risk of
cancer might be</P>
<P>theoretical, the risk of cancers from s~called low-level
radiation exposures</P>
<P>is a definite one.</P>
<P><BR>
 </P>
<P>We have other concerns about the radioactive waste
disposal site. The Nuclear </P>
<P>Regulatory Commission intends to license these surface
facilities for 100 years </P>
<P>even though they readily admit that such sites will be
radioactive far beyond </P>
<P>100 years, even beyond 500 years. Such a licensing policy
is not responsible. We </P>
<P>feel strongly that if the license is for only 100 years,
then the people of Ohio </P>
<P>should at least be assured that all the radioactivity
will have dissipated by </P>
<P>100 years.</P>
<P><BR>
 </P>
<P>The site is to close after accepting radioactive waste
from 10 or more </P>
<P>midwestern power plants over a period of 20 years. The
waste management</P>
<P>company will remain on site for five more years and then
leave. Ownership of </P>
<P>and liability for the site then reverts to the people of
the state of Ohio and any </P>
<P>problems that occur at the site after will belong to the
people of Ohio to </P>
<P>solve. Those who have generated the radioactive waste --
those very groups who </P>
<P>are assuring you right now that these sites will not leak
over hundreds of years </P>
<P>-- will be gone from the place, lock, stock, and barrel
in 25 years.</P>
<P><BR>
 </P>
<P>In 1981, the Environmental Protection Agency published
this statement: &quot;At the </P>
<P>present time, it is not technologically and
institutionally possible to contain </P>
<P>wastes forever or for the long time periods that may be
necessary to allow </P>
<P>adequate degradation to be achieved. Consequently, the
regulation of hazardous </P>
<P>waste land disposal must proceed from the assumption that
migration of hazardous </P>
<P>wastes and their by-products from a land disposal
facility will inevitably </P>
<P>occur.</P>
<P><BR>
 </P>
<P>In February 1991, the Congressional Office of Technology
Assessment published </P>
<P>its study which focused on the problems inherent in
cleaning up the many </P>
<P>contaminated radioactive waste sites that already exist
around the country, some </P>
<P>of which, as you know, are in Ohio. It said, and I quote,
&quot;It may be impossible </P>
<P>with current technology to remove contaminants from
ground water and deeply </P>
<P>buried soils near many of the installations.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
 </P>
<P>What we have, then, is the Environmental Protection
Agency telling us, on the </P>
<P>one hand, that such a radioactive site is bound to leak
sooner or later, and , </P>
<P>on the other hand, we have the Office of Technological
Assessment telling us </P>
<P>that when it does leak we have no proven way of cleaning
it up.</P>
<P><BR>
 </P>
<P>It needs to be noted that several nations with major
nuclear programs already </P>
<P>have decided against the use of surface facilities for
so-called low4evel </P>
<P>radioactive waste. Great Britain, West Germany, and
Sweden have officially </P>
<P>stated that only deep geological repositories are
acceptable sites for </P>
<P>radioactive waste of the type the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission wants to put in </P>
<P>an Ohio landfill facility. L. J. Carter, author of
Nuclear Imperatives and </P>
<P>Public Trust, says, on page 367, discussing radioactive
waste surface disposal </P>
<P>facilities, &quot;Although such a disposal method is
consistent with those now </P>
<P>favored in the United States, it compares poorly with the
much more robust </P>
<P>solutions for low-level waste isolation adopted by the
Germans and the Swedes.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
 </P>
<P>While there have been many problems associated with the
previously failed </P>
<P>efforts to store radioactive waste, the major culprit has
been water. It is </P>
<P>water that eventually seeps into storage vaults. It is
water that corrodes </P>
<P>storage containers and casks. It is water that carries
radionuclides off site. </P>
<P>Ohio is a water-rich state with a high water table. It is
criss-crossed by </P>
<P>streams and has a long Great Lakes shoreline. No place in
the United States has </P>
<P>stored radioactive waste without ground or water
contamination for, even 20 </P>
<P>years, let alone 25, 50, 100, or 500 years. Ohio has had
its own experience with </P>
<P>this sorry circumstance. The infamous Fernald site is the
nation's third largest </P>
<P>radioactive waste dump and it has, of course, leaked.
Private drinking wells </P>
<P>south of the Fernald site have had some radiation
readings as much as 250 times </P>
<P>greater than maximum levels set by the EPA. Surface
waters which drain into the </P>
<P>Great Miami River have also been contaminated.
Monitori!</P>
<P>ng has revealed that groundwater has been contaminated
near radioactive</P>
<P>waste burial sites at the Portsmouth, Ohio uranium
enrichment complex. At the </P>
<P>Mound Laboratory near Dayton contaminafion of water
supplies with radioactive </P>
<P>tritium has been a problem.</P>
<P><BR>
 </P>
<P>I am not suggesting that any of this contamination
occurred purposely. I'm sure </P>
<P>it did not, but it underlines the extreme difficulty
faced when one speaks of </P>
<P>storing radioactive waste for hundreds of years in a
water-logged environment. </P>
<P>I'm sure that in each of these cases the state of Ohio
was assured that leakage </P>
<P>would not be a problem and yet each site today represents
an environmental </P>
<P>catastrophe with complex and costly clean-up problems.
Now the state of Ohio is </P>
<P>being asked to establish yet another radioactive waste
dump site. Now the state </P>
<P>of Ohio is once again being assured that all the problems
associated with </P>
<P>storing radioactive waste over hundreds of years have
been solved. The Genesee </P>
<P>County Medical Society would advise extreme caution in
the face of these </P>
<P>assertions.</P>
<P><BR>
 </P>
<P>So what do we think should be done? We would ask the
state of Ohio not to </P>
<P>proceed with siting a new dump under the faulty 1980
federal legislation. </P>
<P>Rather, we would ask that Ohio join Michigan and other
states in returning to </P>
<P>Congress and asking for more sensible legislation,
legislation which recognizes </P>
<P>the threat these isotopes represent to the environment
and to human health. The </P>
<P>1980 &quot;low-level&quot; radioactive waste legislation
was passed by the U.S. Senate in </P>
<P>a flurry of bills before the Christmas recess of that
year. The Congressional </P>
<P>Record shows that Senators were assured the dump sites
would not include </P>
<P>radioactive materials from nuclear power plants! Perhaps
we should insist upon </P>
<P>reviving that assurance and craft some new national
legislation.</P>
<P><BR>
 </P>
<P>We should propose that the very short-lived radioactive
waste from universities, </P>
<P>research laboratories, and medicine be uncoupled from the
much more long-lived </P>
<P>waste held by nuclear power plants. Since the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission has </P>
<P>stated that disposal sites developed by state compacts
will be licensed for 100 </P>
<P>years, we would suggest that the federal legislation be
amended to state that no </P>
<P>waste can be placed in these sites which would still be
radioactive after 100 </P>
<P>years. Such a change would allow these compact sites to
accept truly low-level </P>
<P>radioactive waste from universities and research centers
and at the same time </P>
<P>this change would eliminate the possibility of storing
much longer-lived waste </P>
<P>at such sites. Waste which would still be radioactive
after 100 years would be </P>
<P>re-classified as &quot;high-level&quot; waste and would
require the greater control and </P>
<P>isolation placed on other high level radioactive
wastes.</P>
<P><BR>
 </P>
<P>In our opinion, this single change would do much to
resolve the current </P>
<P>controversy. We are very appreciative of the opportunity
to present our position </P>
<P>today. Thank you.</P>

Re: Comments on Second Wave Rules, Voluntary Action Program<br>
<br>
We regard the Voluntary Action Program (Brownfields), to be of vital interest to the people of Ohio, in 
terms of its environmental and economic consequences and possibilities. The Greene Environmental 
Coalition therefore welcomes the opportunity to comment in open forum on these important rules that 
set forth the implementation requirements of the program. We support the effort to bring as many 
stakeholders as possible together in the preparation and revision of these rules. If environmental 
equity is to be achieved, the Agency must continue to enlarge its effort to bring representatives of the 
public interest into the legislative and rule-making process. While this process is not an easy one, for it 
is usually much more difficult economically for representatives of the public and for environmental 
groups to participate than it is for business interests, we commend the Agency for its effort in this rule 
development process. While certainly a learning process for all involved, and a process with 
significant group process challenges remaining, it does represent a step forward in bringing true citizen 
participation onto the playing field.<br>
<br>
The Coalition believes that the process has resulted in the development of rules that are generally 
protective of the environment in many areas. However, we do have concerns in several areas which we 
feel remain unaddressed in the rule package and that adversely affect the assurance of environmental 
integrity in our State. We have particular concerns in the area of ground water protection, as well as in 
other areas, some of which we will address below. <br>
<br>
<br>
<em>3745-300-01 Definitions</em><br>
<br>
Concern: No reference is made to urban setting in the main definitions chapter. Urban setting 
designation is a crucial concept in the Brownfields program and should be clearly defined as early as 
possible in the rule package.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Recommendation: Include definition of urban setting in the definitions chapter.</strong><br>
<br>
<em><br>
3745-300-02 Eligibility for Participating in the Voluntary Action Program. (Corrected version to be 
refiled with JCARR); Subparagraph D(6), pp.10+. <br>
</em><br>
Concern: The two-year default eligibility provision for the VAP program for properties receiving an 
enforcement letter is not sufficiently protective of the environment. It provides a back-door opening for 
sites that have serious problems which should be cleaned up. Our reading does not detect any 
provision for property owner response to the receipt of an enforcement letter. We feel that all the 
responsibility for follow-up lies with the OEPA, none with the owner. This is unacceptable 
environmental policy.<br>
<br>
<strong>Recommendation: Establish an owner response requirement within a specific time period upon the 
issuance of an enforcement letter. Otherwise the default eligibility provision should be null and void.<br>
</strong><br>
<br>
<em>3745-300-03 Certified Professionals</em><br>
<br>
Concern: It is unclear if there is any promised or implied immunity from tort liability for certified 
professionals in the proposed rules. Full tort liability for professional error must exist.<br>
<br>
<strong>Recommendation: Clarify the rule to include full tort liability.</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
<em>3745-300-09 Property-Specific Risk Assessment Procedures; Subparagraph (C), (1), (a), (i), p. 10.</em><br>
<br>
Concern: The Coalition believes that the carcinogenic risk of one in 10,000, or 10(-4), for industrial 
property is less than federal standards call for, even considering the provision for off-property 
receptors. We believe that risk requirements should meet federal standards.<br>
<br>
<strong>Recommendation: Make sure that risk requirements at a minimum meet Federal standards.<br>
</strong><br>
<br>
<em>3745-300-10 Ground Water Classification and Response Requirements</em><br>
<br>
Introductory Comments: Next to the air we breathe, ground water, particularly that designated for 
drinking water purposes, is our most precious environmental resource. Preserving the quality of our 
drinking water must be a primary concern of all stakeholders in the program. We believe, therefore, that 
assuring the purity of current or potential drinking water sources must be of the highest priority in 
developing VAP rules.<br>
<br>
Concern 1: The Coalition believes that the proposed rules create a disproportionate negative impact for 
those persons living in areas designated urban settings. In particular the one-half mile limit for which 
ground water integrity must be assured in urban settings is not reflective of the realities which exist in 
these areas. In some cases the one-half mile limit may work fine. In other cases, it will almost certainly 
open the door for abuse and threat to persons living in the area. This provision appears to be 
consistent with an effort to tie the Agency's hands with finite limits. We find this is this case to be 
unacceptable.<br>
<br>
<strong>Recommendation: Rework the one-half mile limit provision to provide the Agency sufficient flexibility 
to protect the drinking water resources of those persons who might be affected now or in the future. 
We believe in responsible clean-up enticements, but not those which arbitrarily endanger water 
safety.<br>
</strong><br>
<br>
Concern 2: Subparagraph (E) Urban Setting Designation Criteria and Process, (1) (c), p. 8<br>
<br>
The provision which waives the wellhead protection requirement if the wellhead owner consents in 
writing is too subject to political pressure. The public is not sufficiently protected.<br>
<br>
<strong>Recommendation: Remove the waiver provision.</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
Concern 3: Subparagraph (E) (1) (e) (iii), p. 9.<br>
<br>
The provision that not less than ninety percent of the area within one-half mile of the property is 
connected to a community water system is unclear. Does this represent ninety percent of existing 
households or total area or what? And what about the remaining ten percent that is not connected? 
And what about the area beyond the one-half mile limit?<br>
<br>
<strong>Recommendation: Clarify the language in the rule and ensure that no one living in the area nor any 
sole source aquifer that extends beyond the one-half mile limit would be subject to increased risk of 
potable water contamination.<br>
</strong><br>
<br>
Concern 4: Subparagraph (E) (2) (b), p. 11<br>
<br>
No requirement exists for a legislative body to reply to the Director's notice that an urban setting 
designation is under consideration. And without a requirement for a public meeting or other public 
input, it is possible that an urban designation could be obtained by default. <br>
<br>
<strong>Recommendation: Strengthen the public input provisions in all cases in which urban setting 
designation is being contemplated. <br>
</strong><br>
<br>
Concern 5: Subparagraph (E) (2) (c) and (d), p.13.<br>
<br>
The requirement in these two subparagraphs that limits public hearings to the Director's discretion is 
not sufficiently protective of the public interest. <br>
<br>
<strong>Recommendation: Require a public hearing </strong><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<em>3745-300-13 Content and Scope of No Further Action Letters</em><br>
<br>
Concern 1: (A) (1) p.1.<br>
<br>
This provision provides for the possibility of an &quot;immaculate conception&quot; of a hazardous waste release 
after the no furhter action letter has been issued. Does this get the Certified Professional off the hook, 
so to speak?<br>
<br>
<strong>Recommendation: Clarify this language early on in the chapter</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
Concern 2: (E) (4), p. 2.<br>
<br>
The removal of the Ohio Revised Code as the highest regulatory source provides an inappropriate 
standard of assurance to the public.<br>
<br>
<strong>Recommendation: Restore the ORC as the primary regulatory source. </strong><br>
<br>
<br>
<em>3745-300-15 Remediation</em><br>
<br>
Concern 1 Subparagraph (D) (1)<br>
<br>
We feel that the five year time frame for attaining applicable standards is too long.<br>
<br>
<strong>Recommendation: Reduce the time frame to three years</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
Concern 2 Subparagraph (F) (1)<br>
<br>
It is not clear who is the responsible party. Is it the owner or the volunteer?<br>
<br>
<strong>Recommendation: Clarify the responsibility issue. </strong><br>
<br>

<H1>&quot;TWENTY IN 2000&quot;</H1>
</CENTER>
<P>Twenty in 2000 is a Rivers Unlimited campaign
designed to double the number of rivers in the Ohio Scenic
River Program. There are currently 18 segments of 10 rivers
(a total of 641 miles) that have scenic river status. The
goal of this project is to add ten more rivers to the system
by the year 2000, along with funding for staff to handle the
system's expansion.</P>
<P>The process of designating a river generates
community awareness of the economic, recreational, and
environmental benefits of the stream, and serves as a
reminder of the waterway's value. In addition, any public
projects that affect scenic rivers must be approved in
advance by the Division of Natural Areas.</P>
<P> Although Ohio's Scenic Rivers Program was proactive
during its founding decade of the 1970s, no waterways have
been added since 1984. Many of the streams that qualify are
facing threats and could clearly benefit from
designation.</P>
<P> The Scenic Rivers Program has identified 44 waterways
that meet the basic criteria for designation. Rivers
Unlimited is working with both the Program and with river
advocates across the state to identify the most likely
candidates for addition. Already, two streams are being
studied to determine if they qualify for a scenic river
designation--the Black River in Lorain County and the
Kokosing River in Knox County.</P>

&nbsp;I. INTRODUCTION<BR>
</P>
<P>The Sierra Club supports restoration and revitalization of distressed communities through 
the&nbsp;use of incentives based on sound planning processes. Well designed brownfields 
cleanup and&nbsp;redevelopment can offer an adjacent community better health, family-wage 
jobs, and a more&nbsp;secure future.<BR>
</P>
<P>What Are Brownfields?<BR>
</P>
<P>Brownfields are contaminated sites, sources of pollution in the heart of communities which 
no one is taking responsibility or for which no clean up is likely in the foreseeable future. 
They are typically former industrial sites and may be abandoned. Although usually less 
polluted than federally classified Superfund (NPL) sites, parts of some brownfields sites 
have levels of contamination quite close to those found at NPL sites. It is important to 
recognize that designation of NPL sites is highly dependent on a host of -&nbsp;subjective 
judgments by both state and federal bureaucrats, so there is no assurance of consistency 
from state to state. Brownfields are often located within current urban boundaries and have 
many elements of the infrastructure needed for economic development - roads, utilities, 
water, and sewers. Because they are in place, redevelopment of these sites may cost 
society less to provide these services.<BR>
</P>
<P>Further, many communities have few available sites for industrial development,&nbsp;particularly 
sites that already have the infrastructure in place. Cities want brownfields to&nbsp;developed 
because vacant land does not contribute to the k base. The areas provide no&nbsp;jobs, attract 
crime, cost the city in terms of police and social services, and discourage&nbsp;development 
adjacent to them. An important use of &quot;brownfields funds&quot; is for testing&nbsp;to see whether a 
site is really contaminated or whether there is only a perception of&nbsp;contamination.<BR>
<BR>
</P>
<P>The EPA defines a brownfield as A site or portion thereof that has actual or 
perceived&nbsp;contamination and an active potential for redevelopment or reuse. w EPA's 
&quot;Brownfields&nbsp;Initiative&quot; strategies include finding pilot programs and research efforts, testing 
for&nbsp;contamination, clarifying liability issues, entering into partnerships, conducting 
outreach&nbsp;activities, developing job-training programs, and addressing environmental justice 
and lender&nbsp;liability concerns.<BR>
</P>
<P>Brownfields redevelopment differ from voluntary cleanups in that there is little 
funding&nbsp;available and in that there should be government involvement because regulatory 
flexibility&nbsp;and other incentives require increased oversight.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</P>
<P>What Is Being Proposed For These Contaminated Industrial Sites? <BR>
</P>
<P>Federal and state regulators, developers, advocacy organizations, and communities&nbsp;housing 
such sites, are proposing that they be expeditiously redeveloped for, 
primarily,&nbsp;industrial/commercial uses as an alternative to siting new development on 
&quot;greenfields&quot;&nbsp;(undeveloped, generally suburban sites). It is argued that the benefits of 
&quot;brownfields&quot;&nbsp;redevelopment include: reuse/recycling of abandoned properties with the 
resulting economic&nbsp;revitalization of the urban core, the protection of less-contaminated 
areas and the avoidance&nbsp;of suburban sprawl. Concentration of industrial activity may also 
facilitate and lower the&nbsp;costs of pollution monitoring.<BR>
</P>
<P>The EPA provides grants for pilot projects to help communities work together to agree&nbsp;on 
brownfields redevelopment plans and create cleanup funding mechanisms. The intent is 
to&nbsp;make use of Community Empowerment Zones, Community Development Banks, and 
the&nbsp;Community Reinvestment Act, which was passed to address the lack of adequate 
lending in&nbsp;low-income areas. Congress is now proposing grants and low interest loans on 
the&nbsp;order of $45 million for cities help clean up brownfields sites.<BR>
</P>
<P>IL SIERRA CLUB RECOMMENDATIONS<BR>
</P>
<P>What Are The Sierra Club's Concerns With Brownfields Proposals? <BR>
</P>
<P>Unless properly time-limited and maintained under agency control, &quot;brownfields&quot;&nbsp;programs 
could serve to' encourage the creation of new &quot;former&quot; contaminated industrial sites&nbsp;by 
weakening clean-up standards, releasing responsible parties from liability and in other&nbsp;ways 
easing the risks currently associated with sloppy management. Reading a&nbsp;&quot;brownfields&quot; 
legislative proposal in the present, one imagines a weedgrown, fenced tract&nbsp;left behind by 
the defunct gas station or steel fabricating plant of an unregulated yesterday.&nbsp;However, if 
passed, these laws will presumably be on the books for years, and often nothing&nbsp;in them 
ensures that freshly contaminated sites won't come into existence 5, 10 or 20 years&nbsp;hence 
precisely because a &quot;brownfields&quot; clean-up option will be available. <BR>
</P>
<P>A key component of &quot;brownfields&quot; redevelopment proposals is that the contamination 
at&nbsp;these sites need only be cleaned-up to levels commensurate with the new 
proposed&nbsp;industrial/commercial use. The Sierra Club believes that lowering clean-up 
standards&nbsp;for contaminated sites threatens the health of current and future populations 
exposed to those&nbsp;sites. It also increases the possibility that unremediated contaminants will 
migrate off-site,&nbsp;contaminate groundwater, and cause health and environmental damage 
over time. At best,&nbsp;superficial clean-ups transfer risks and costs to future generations in 
order to suit the&nbsp;convenience of today's political constituencies -- precisely the same 
short-sighted,&nbsp;self-serving logic that got us into this mess in the first place.<BR>
</P>
<P>We have spent years trying to establish nondegradation policies for our ground water, 
surface waters, air, and lands. The stick that drives this policy is the knowledge that it 
is&nbsp;cheaper to prevent pollution than to clean it up. If we now say that some degradation 
is&nbsp;acceptable for certain sites, the incentive to prevent pollution could be 
drastically&nbsp;undermined. Although an absolute nondegradation policy is difficult to reconcile 
with the&nbsp;economic and ongoing pollution problems associated with some already degraded 
sites, this is&nbsp;not a rationale for abandoning standards that are fully protective of public health 
and the&nbsp;environment.<BR>
</P>
<P>A. Regulation Of Brownfields Cleanups<BR>
</P>
<P>All states should have strong, well funded hazardous waste cleanup programs. 
Any&nbsp;brownfields program must be part of this and regulated under the same state and 
EPA&nbsp;program as other contaminated sites. Certification of private contractors for&nbsp;making 
major cleanup decisions such as delisting sites is not acceptable.<BR>
</P>
<P>Some state Brownfields bills have resulted in weakening the basic framework of 
existing&nbsp;clean-up laws. Presented as redevelopment proposals that also protect 
greenfields,&nbsp;brownfields proposals have been made so appealing that many dangerous 
changes have&nbsp;slipped in unnoticed. Several states have already had their cleanup standards 
weakened by a&nbsp;shift to reliance on risk assessment.<BR>
</P>
<P>B. Cleanup Standards<BR>
</P>
<P>A state's clean up standards must be as protective as possible, preferably to nondetect 
or&nbsp;background levels, in order to maintain nondegradation policies, and more importantly, 
as&nbsp;the stick to drive pollution prevention programs in the first place. Brownfields laws must 
set&nbsp;clear contamination thresholds defining which sites may not be considered for 
a&nbsp;&quot;brownfields&quot; program because they represent a significant threat to public health or&nbsp;the 
environment.<BR>
</P>
<P>Land use designations can be useful in restricting activities at sites but must not be used&nbsp;to 
justify lower levels of protection. Cleanup levels must protect on-site workers,&nbsp;customers, 
and all users of the area. DayCare centers and recreational areas such as jogging&nbsp;paths are 
often part of industrial sites. Many industrial areas contain small areas of&nbsp;residences and 
these citizens must be protected.<BR>
</P>
<P>Cleanup method decisions will be determined by the nature of the 
redevelopment.&nbsp;Contamination, particularly hot spots with high levels, are generally best 
removed totally so&nbsp;that monitoring or institutional controls will not be future considerations. 
Containment is&nbsp;rarely better than removal or treatment. If a &quot;natural recovery&quot; approach 
through&nbsp;biodegra&amp;tion is considered, the problems and costs of restrictions and monitoring 
must be&nbsp;considered. <BR>
<BR>
</P>
<P>C. Reductions In Cleanup Standards<BR>
</P>
<P>Reductions in cleanup standards or variances from requirements can only be granted:<BR>
</P>
<P>1) to sites where the pollution releases occurred prior to the enactment of the bill,&nbsp;and 
where the contaminated former industrial site is located in an economically&nbsp;blighted, urban 
neighborhood/developed area and a redevelopment area assessment&nbsp;has indicated that the 
area will directly benefit from the site's expeditious&nbsp;redevelopment.<BR>
</P>
<P>2) to abandoned sites where there is no financially viable party to conduct a full&nbsp;clean up, 
failure to act will result in avoidable risks to public health and/or the&nbsp;environment, and a 
variance is the only way to get economic redevelopment of the&nbsp;site.<BR>
</P>
<P>An incentive for cleaning up brownfields may be a site-specific variance process. Where&nbsp;a 
variance is granted, the contamination should be delineated and cleaned up or controlled&nbsp;to 
levels that protect human health and the environment both for any present proposed 
site&nbsp;uses and for the future. Weak containment features, such as fences, covers and 
landscaping,&nbsp;can and will fail with time and are unacceptable for brownfields site 
remediation. Any&nbsp;variances must include monitoring, and then &quot;reopener&quot; procedures 
remedy failure, changes&nbsp;of land use, or the emergence of new information about the 
contaminants that necessitate a&nbsp;more stringent standard for adequate health protection.<BR>
</P>
<P>D. Brownfields Benefits Must Be Limited To Past Contamination <BR>
</P>
<P>Proper delineation of what qualifies a site for brownfields benefits is critical to any 
sound&nbsp;program. It is essential to limit brownfields programs to past contamination so that 
the&nbsp;program does not encourage more pollution and the creation of NEW &quot;former&quot; 
contaminated&nbsp;industrial sites. Reduced clean-up standards must never be applied to 
current&nbsp;industrial/commercial operations. If an expectation is created that anytime there 
is&nbsp;an economic &quot;need&quot;, a variance will be granted, then every standard becomes 
meaningless,&nbsp;or at best, subject to cost-benefit analyses of industry. `<BR>
</P>
<P>E. Risk Assessments<BR>
</P>
<P>Legislative proposals to set-up &quot;brownfields&quot; programs often seek greater or exclusive&nbsp;use 
of risk assessments for establishing clean-up levels. The Sierra Club's guidance on 
risk&nbsp;assessment should be consulted for a discussion of problems with this technique 
because it&nbsp;has many limitations.<BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;Risk assessments&quot; are at best inadequate and imprecise estimates of actual risk. They 
attempt to assess only a few of the many risks associated with contaminant exposures. 
They&nbsp;almost always ignore the complex interactions among the many chemicals to which 
potential&nbsp;victims are always exposed, and the outcomes are always heavily influenced by 
the biases of&nbsp;the risk assessors. It is easy to bias an outcome through inappropriate use of 
overly&nbsp;favorable assumptions.<BR>
</P>
<P>Site-specific risk assessments can underestimate real-world risks in that they allow the&nbsp;risk 
assessor to exclude from the calculation risks that can be &quot;cut off&quot; by a cap or a fence&nbsp;or a 
land use that assumes that no one ever will go there.<BR>
</P>
<P>Risk assessment procedures based on an identical set of realistic assumptions and 
using&nbsp;laboratory data of equal quality (objectives rarely achieved in real world situations) 
can&nbsp;sometimes be of limited value in comparing a several different clean-up alternatives, but 
only&nbsp;for those limited impacts actually assessed. They are scientifically incapable 
of&nbsp;&quot;proving&quot; that one particular option is &quot;safe&quot; or &quot;safe enough&quot;.&nbsp;Appropriate use of risk 
assessment techniques will be very expensive, especially for&nbsp;small sites. Instead of basing 
decisions on risk assessments, the emphasis should be on&nbsp;eliminating or minimizing 
exposure. It is easier to describe exposure than risk. Combining&nbsp;this with information about 
health effects can be a good argument for treatment or removal&nbsp;of the source of the risk.<BR>
</P>
<P>F. Deed Restrictions<BR>
</P>
<P>If less than the most protective health-based cleanup standards are used, 
site-use&nbsp;restrictions based on the level of clamp achieved must be attached as a deed 
restriction (or&nbsp;similar land title notice) to prevent future land uses that would be 
inappropriate to the&nbsp;achieved clean-up level. If the deed-restricted site is subsequently 
cleaned up to fully&nbsp;protective levels, the restrictive covenant can be removed if the public 
and the agency&nbsp;approves. Deed restrictions must be binding on all successive owners. 
Penalties for&nbsp;violating deed restrictions or using land contrary to landuse restrictions should 
be established.&nbsp;They should apply to owners, subsequent owners and Realtors who do not 
disclose and abide&nbsp;by the restrictions.<BR>
</P>
<P>Deed restrictions are sometimes placed on an adjacent neighbor's property if&nbsp;contamination 
has migrated onto it. The property owner responsible for the damage can&nbsp;offer an 
indemnity in exchange for a deed restriction preventing the property's use for inconsistent 
purposes.<BR>
</P>
<P>Redevelopment<BR>
</P>
<P>Brownfields projects that receive financial assistance, reduced cleanup levels or&nbsp;reductions 
in liability must be founded on a formal public and private sector commitment to a&nbsp;specific 
level of redevelopment. Taking this position puts us in the mainstream of wanting to support 
genuine economic development, and will highlight any industry goal of wanting&nbsp;reduced 
clean up standards without being willing to invest in redevelopment or&nbsp;give communities 
anything in return. Local government or local businessmen should&nbsp;demonstrate support for 
the redevelopment by participating in and facilitating community oversight and by 
establishing a redevelopment fund. The redevelopment agreement&nbsp;should say that if the 
development is successful, some of the profits should be returned to the&nbsp;redevelopment 
fund or to the community, as applicable.<BR>
</P>
<P>Because factors other than toxic contamination limit or are barriers to 
redevelopment,&nbsp;identifying and dealing with these barriers should be a major element of the 
redevelopment&nbsp;plans. The planning should consider use of government partnerships, EPA 
&quot;empowerment&nbsp;zones&quot;, the Community Reinvestment Act, and special job training at local 
colleges to&nbsp;prepare the area's workers for new businesses. In addition to using land for 
commercial&nbsp;projects, programs should consider cleanup and conversion to noncommercial 
open space,&nbsp;which can also benefit quality of life in the community.<BR>
</P>
<P>H.<BR>
</P>
<P>Site redevelopment plans must include the following conditions: <BR>
</P>
<P>1) Protective buffer zones between the site and adjacent areas that might have 
homes,&nbsp;schools, or daycare centers. In order to serve as a buffer, an area would have to be 
as&nbsp;clean as residential standards.<BR>
</P>
<P>2) Requirements for ongoing community involvement in the redevelopment, which&nbsp;should 
include toxics use reduction plans and regulations and other programs to make&nbsp;sure the 
area does not become polluted again.<BR>
</P>
<P>3) Specification of who will pay for monitoring of air, water, and soil.<BR>
</P>
<P>4) A financial mechanism that will guarantee funding to cover future crests associated&nbsp;with 
maintenance of the site or additional clean-up.<BR>
</P>
<P>5) A provision that off-site testing and any needed remediation will be done&nbsp;concurrent with 
the onsite work.<BR>
</P>
<P>Liability<BR>
</P>
<P>A major incentive offered in some brownfields proposals is the easing of&nbsp;clean-up/pollution 
liability for &quot;former&quot; industrial operators or &quot;current&quot; developers and the&nbsp;shifting of the 
financial burden for cleanup onto taxpayers, thereby substantially reducing one&nbsp;of the few 
effective incentives current and future operators have for preventing contamination&nbsp;-- 
liability for clean-up and for pollution-related damages.<BR>
</P>
<P>Sierra Club does not support relief from&nbsp;incentive strategies are now being identified,<BR>
</P>
<P>liability as a redevelopment tool. Many other&nbsp;and relieving parties of liability at brownfields 
sites opens the door to such relief for all polluters. We also do not support establishment 
of&nbsp;&quot;proportionate share liability&quot; as a standard procedure, because it makes the 
taxpayer&nbsp;responsible for contribution which cannot be assigned to polluters who can pay. <BR>
</P>
<P>Programs to speed cleanup should not abandon pursuit of responsible parties.&nbsp;Partnership 
in the redevelopment could be proposed as an incentive to pay their share. If&nbsp;responsible 
parties are completely financially insolvent, other ways of participating in the&nbsp;redevelopment 
effort could be explored. Brownfields cleanup funds horn the taxpayer should&nbsp;not be a gift 
to polluters/owners of contaminated sites who refused to cleanup the site without&nbsp;a 
brownfields program.<BR>
</P>
<P>The Sierra Club supports fair mechanisms for protecting truly innocent and&nbsp;noncontributing 
parties. Banks and other lenders must be held responsible for contaminated&nbsp;property they 
acquire, but should be given incentives to be involved in financing well&nbsp;planned 
redevelopment projects. Some states are clarifying those situations in which banks&nbsp;and 
other lenders can be exempt from liability for cleanup costs, such as when they do&nbsp;not 
participate in the daily management of the property.<BR>
</P>
<P>&quot;No further action letters&quot; and other documents providing relief from liability are used 
to&nbsp;encourage those who would clean-up and redevelop these properties to do so. On any 
such&nbsp;certification, there must be reopener to restore liability if fraud, or if the extent 
of&nbsp;contamination is beyond what was acknowledged in the agreement.<BR>
</P>
<P>L Public Involvement<BR>
</P>
<P>Full involvement of affected communities in the establishment of site clean-up levels, 
the&nbsp;selection of clean-up methods, and planning for future use of the property is&nbsp;absolutely 
essential. If these projects are supposed to &quot;revitalize&quot; areas, the people who live&nbsp;and work 
there must be informed and involved from the start. Secrecy is unacceptable.&nbsp;Community 
values, as well as public and environmental health, must be considered and&nbsp;protected. 
Legislation establishing a brownfields program must set standards for public&nbsp;notification, 
public meetings, and consideration of public input on all aspects&nbsp;of the proposed remedial 
action prior to any final approvals being granted. Use of local&nbsp;government processes can 
help make sure that the entire community, including local&nbsp;organizations, have input. <BR>
</P>
<P>Community stakeholders, especially the disadvantaged, must be funded from 
the&nbsp;&quot;redevelopment project&quot; so that they can have meaningful participation and advice 
from&nbsp;technical experts of their own choice (lawyers, scientists, facilitators). Access 
to&nbsp;science by citizens is an issue because many scientific consultants get most of their 
work&nbsp;from polluting industries. University scientific researchers are funded heavily 
by&nbsp;industries now. Dealing with technical issues &quot;disempowers&quot; many citizens from 
the&nbsp;beginning. Really helpful &quot;green&quot; consultants spend some of their time teaching citizens 
how&nbsp;to read documents and how to be confident of their own good judgment. <BR>
</P>
<P>Local residents are in the best position to decide what level of economic incentives 
are&nbsp;appropriate, and what level of remaining contamination they are willing to put up 
with.&nbsp;These decisions should be made by and for the benefit of the local community, not by 
and&nbsp;for the benefit of those seeking to benefit (financially or politically) from redevelopment 
of&nbsp;&quot;brownfields&quot; sites. Affected communities include those near the clean-up site&nbsp;and those 
affected by plans to dispose of waste recovered as a result of proposed clean-up&nbsp;activities.<BR>
</P>
<P>In many cases, communities which would most like to take advantage of a 
brownfields&nbsp;redevelopment program, as well as those most likely to be affected by disposal 
activities,&nbsp;may well be economically distressed communities, communities of color, and 
other&nbsp;politically disadvantaged communities. We believe that the clean-up proponents 
and&nbsp;regulators have an obligation to assure that affected citizens have access to adequate 
technical&nbsp;and legal resources of their choice to permit meaningful participation in complex 
legal and&nbsp;technical clean up debates.<BR>
</P>
<P>Full disclosure to the public of the types of pollutants found at a given site, their levels&nbsp;and 
their sources must be provided. As new information continues to emerge about the&nbsp;hazards 
of certain pollutants, so it is very important to know what specifically is to be found&nbsp;at a 
given &quot;brownfield&quot; site. (At one time, for example, it was not known that whenever&nbsp;there 
are PCBS in a fire, dioxins and furans are created/emitted and contaminate the 
site.&nbsp;Community Right-to-Know should in no way be limited by &quot;brownfields&quot; laws 
and&nbsp;regulations. Pollutants found at the site should remain discoverable and 
information&nbsp;about their presence admissible in court.<BR>
</P>
<P>J. Environmental Justice<BR>
</P>
<P>Applying reduced clean-up standards to contaminated sites, and subsequently&nbsp;redeveloping 
such sites for industrial uses, may raise environmental justice issues for workers&nbsp;at the site 
and residents in the surrounding communities.<BR>
</P>
<P>The Sierra Club does not believe it is fair or wise to concentrate additional 
polluting&nbsp;industrial development in minority and/or economically-deprived inner city 
neighborhoods or&nbsp;in areas that already suffer from a disproportionate burden of polluting 
facilities.<BR>
</P>
<P>If parties agree to a cleanup method that will achieve background or the most 
protective&nbsp;standards, there should be public notice, information, and the opportunity for 
comment. If&nbsp;they want to cleanup to a weaker standard or use risk-based standards and/or 
a waiver of&nbsp;liability, a much more extensive public involvement program is medal. If the 
issue involves&nbsp;a community economic development project, the entire community, not just 
those who are&nbsp;immediately affected and immediate site neighbors, should be involved the 
decisions about&nbsp;zoning, cleanup standards, loans, the type of industry to locate there.<BR>
<BR>
</P>
<P>K. Funding Brownfields Programs and Cleanups<BR>
</P>
<P>Finding finds for cleanup of sites with no economically viable party is potentially easier&nbsp;if it 
is part of an important and attractive redevelopment proposal. Funds might come 
from&nbsp;philanthropic investments, foundation grants, a tax on water users in the area, disposal 
fees,&nbsp;the lottery, hazardous substance taxes, pollution fines or a surcharge on 
nonessential&nbsp;products. Other options might be government cleanup and sale of land or use 
for&nbsp;government facilities after site is cleaned up. It makes sense to include a provision 
that&nbsp;whoever pays for the clean-up, often the taxpayer, should end up having some 
interest&nbsp;in the money-making activity that occurs there.<BR>
</P>
<P>The EPA used the following criteria for funding their cooperative agreement 
brownfields&nbsp;redevelopment programs:<BR>
</P>
<P>1. Environmental and economic impacts of brownfields on the community&nbsp;2. Existing 
community commitment to brownfield cleanup and redevelopment&nbsp;3. Proposed use of the 
cooperative agreement&nbsp;4. National replicability of the proposed project&nbsp;5. Assurance of the 
necessary legal authority and government support for&nbsp; Brownfields proposals&nbsp;6. Flow of 
ownership plan&nbsp;7. Community involvement plan&nbsp;8. Environmental justice plan&nbsp;9. Proposed 
measures of success&nbsp;10. Environmental assessment plan<BR>
</P>
<P>L. Things to Watch Out For in the Language of the Law<BR>
</P>
<P>1. Does it allow major decisions, relief from liability, reduced standards, substitution&nbsp;of risk 
assessment for standards, to be made during rulemaking, rather than specified&nbsp;in the 
statute?<BR>
</P>
<P>2. Does the program eliminate incentives for pollution prevention? <BR>
</P>
<P>3. Does it weaken the basic cleanup law that is already in place? <BR>
</P>
<P>4. Does it weaken the `polluter pays&quot; principle?<BR>
</P>
<P>III. GLOSSARY OF TERMS<BR>
</P>
<P>LUST - Leaking Underground Storage Tanks<BR>
</P>
<P>RBCA - Risk Based Corrective Action - An EPA adopted framework developed for 
LUST sites for considering both the contamination and the site-specific factors to determine 
the&nbsp;danger to human health and the environment from a given release. EPA is training&nbsp;state 
UST program staff so that they can create systems appropriate for their states.&nbsp;Deed 
restrictions --Conditions attached to the deed that restrict uses of property, 
particularly&nbsp;when contamination and engineered controls remain. Restrictions can require 
that future&nbsp;owners must maintain the controls and abide by the restrictions.<BR>
</P>
<P>Voluntary cleanups - Cleanups of identified contamination that are not court or 
agency&nbsp;ordered. If agencies listed the site, they are usually notified that the cleanup is 
complete and&nbsp;perform some sort of review to ensure that the site has been cleaned up to 
appropriate&nbsp;standards. No voluntary cleanup system should exist without final review of the 
cleanup by&nbsp;the appropriate state agency.<BR>
</P>
<P>Ecological risks - damage to ecosystems that can be described as loss of a species, loss 
of&nbsp;diversity, rather than death or damage to individual organisms.<BR>
</P>
<P>Site-specific risk assessments - risk assessments based on pathways for risks. If an 
exposure&nbsp;pathway can be ruled out by an engineered control (a cap or a fence) or a land 
use&nbsp;determination (only adult workers will use the site for only 8 hours per day, 5 days a 
week)&nbsp;that risk number can be reduced or excluded. <BR>
</P>
<P>Institutional controls - Restrictions for protecting people and the environment 
from&nbsp;contamination left at a site. These may include &quot;keep out&quot; signs, deed restrictions, 
and&nbsp;rerouting or speed limits for boats near underwater caps.&nbsp;Engineering controls - 
physical barriers, which may include landfill covers, caps, and fences,&nbsp;used to control 
contamination left in place. <BR>
</P>
<P>Hot spots -relatively small areas where the contamination is very high.&nbsp;action&quot; (NFA) letters 
- document from government saying that nothing else needs to be done because a cleanup 
has met their standards or otherwise complied with the&nbsp;cleanup plan.<BR>
</P>

<h3 align=center>How clean is clean for abandoned sites?</h3>
<hr>
<p>By Laura Yeomans<br>
P.O. BOX 8 <br>
Dover, OH 44622-4008<br>
</p>
<p>By Laura Yeomans, Citizen Action Research Director<br>
</p>
<p>Neighbors may inhale some of the airborne chemicals that drift from abandoned industrial 
properties found throughout Ohio. Children who climb the fence may absorb the 
cancer-causing chemicals through their skin. Some chemicals seep into the ground 
contaminating water resources used for drinking water.<br>
</p>
<p>In 1994 the Ohio legislature passed a law designed to encourage redevelopment of these 
abandoned Brownfield sites. Under the plan if a new property owner voluntarily cleans up 
the wastes on an abandoned site, Ohio EPA d promise not to sue them in the future. How 
clean should a site be before an owner can build a supermarket, apartment building, or new 
factory?<br>
</p>
<p>Who will cleanup chemicals left in the ground that may migrate into groundwater resources? 
Early in 1996 Ohio EPA will release proposed cleanup standards for abandoned sites, 
after listening to hours of presentations and arguments from an advisory committee of 
county end city government officials end industry and environmental representatives <br>
</p>
<p>In November, Ohio EPA Director Donald Schregardus recommended that cancer-causing 
wastes in abandoned sites be cleaned up to a level scientists estimate would allow no more 
than one additional cancer death for 100,000 neighbors exposed.<br>
</p>
<p>Jon Reid, a toxicologist from the University of Cincinnati Medical Center and an advisory 
committee member, wanted a higher cleanup standard, but is supporting Schregardus' 
cleanup standard. &quot;Ohio EPA doesn't have sufficient resources to treat all the Brownfields 
in the state,&quot; Reid said., &quot;They would just sit there idle until EPA could work with the 
owners to make sure the sites were cleaned up, The idea of this law is to expedite that part 
of the process without sacrificing the health of people in Ohio. In my opinion there is 
enough incentive here for owners to cleanup their sites and have a guarantee that Ohio EPA 
won't cause them to go back and dig up their soil again. &quot;<br>
</p>
<p>&quot;People are already exposed to a variety of cancer-causing chemicals in their communities. 
Another cancer-risk of one in 100,000 is an unacceptable level to add to workers and the 
communities,&quot; said Chris Trepal, co-director of the Earth Day Coalition. &quot;I'm most 
concerned with chemicals left on the site under asphalt or diluted and left on site. A one in a 
million standard for cumulative cancer risk would be more protective of workers health and 
the health of communities surrounding abandoned sites. &quot;<br>
</p>
<p>Several advisory committee members are urging a lower standard. &quot;We have two to three 
dozen Brownfield sites we would like to address in the Springfield area,&quot; said Matt Kridler, 
city manager of Springfield. &quot;We need a realistic [cleanup] goal, that is protective of human 
health that makes economic sense for developers to come forward and remediate their 
sites. As to this date, standards have been so high, so unrealistic, most developers will walk 
away. The end result is that agricultural land is destroyed,&quot; Kridler recommended a one in 
10,000 cancer risk cleanup level.<br>
</p>
<p>In a variety of programs, Ohio EPA uses risk levels that range from one in 10,000 to one in 
a million for allowable additional cancer risks. There are several reasons why .Ohio EPA 
should create high standards, such as one in a million cancer risk level, when setting generic 
standards for the Brownfields program. The Brownfields program will be conducted largely 
without oversight from the public or Ohio EPA. Firms hired by property owners will 
conduct site analysis and cleanup. Only one-fourth of cleanup projects will be audited by 
the agency. </p>
<p>The proposed generic cleanup standard will be used as a guide for the cleanup of industrial 
facilities that are in the middle of industrial parks miles from residential neighborhoods and 
those industrial facilities right next to residential housing. The generic standard must include 
protection for residential communities adjacent to abandoned sites. </p>
<p>There are a number of ways proposed in the rules to allow individual facilities to qualify for 
a lower cleanup standard. For information about the location of public hearings that will be 
held on the proposed cleanup standards March 4-14, write to <em><strong>Ohio EPA ATTN.:

<H2>FACT SHEET: WHAT IS LOW-LEVEL RADIOACTIVE
WASTE</H2>
</CENTER>
<P><BR>
 </P>
<P><EM>Definition</EM></P>
<P>&quot;Low-level radioactive waste,&quot; according to the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), is &quot;radioactive
waste not classified as high-level radioactive waste,
transuranic waste, spent nuclear fuel, or by-product material
(i.e.: uranium or thorium mill tailings)...&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Low-level radioactive waste&quot; includes
everything from slightly radioactive trash such as gloves and
booties to highly radioactive-activated metals from inside
nuclear reactors.</P>
<P>&quot;Low-level radioactive waste&quot; includes both
short-lived and long-lived radionuclides.</P>
<P><BR>
 </P>
<P><EM>Sources of &quot;low-level radioactive
waste&quot;</EM></P>
<P>Low-level radioactive waste is generated by most of the
facilities licensed by the NRC for commercial handling and
use of radioactive materials. By far the single largest
source is the nuclear power industry, which in 1989 accounted
for over 80% of the volume and 95% of the radioactivity of
all low-level radioactive waste shipped for disposal. Other
sources include radio chemical manufacturers, research
laboratories, government agencies other than the Department
of Energy (DOE), universities, medical schools, and
hospitals.</P>
<P>All waste generated from the commercial nuclear fuel
cycle is classified as low-level radioactive waste, except
for uranium mill tailings and spent nuclear fuel. The bulk of
this waste (about 80% of 1989) is generated by nuclear
reactors as leaked fission products from fuel rods and as
radioactive-activated products that were originally
non-radioactive elements inside the reactors.</P>
<P>The cooling water of nuclear reactors, which absorbs
leaked fission products from fuel rods, is cleaned of
radioactivity by ion exchange resins and demineralizer
filtration units. The resins and filters themselves are
contaminated with radioactivity and are disposed of as
low-level radioactive waste. The resins and filters can be
highly radioactive and are sometimes capable of delivering a
lethal dose of radiation (exceeding 1,000 rems per hour).</P>
<P>Non-radioactive components inside a nuclear reactor can
become radioactive because of continuous neutron bombardment.
These items, such as fuel channels and instrumentation placed
inside the reactor core, are removed from time to time and
disposed of as low-level radioactive waste.</P>
<P>Maintenance and clean-up of nuclear reactors generates
low-level radioactive waste such as workers' protective
clothing, mops, etc.</P>
<P><BR>
 </P>
<P><EM>Classifications of waste</EM></P>
<P>Low-level radioactive waste is divided into four classes
by the NRC: Classes A, B, C, and Greater-than-Class-C. Class
A is the least radioactive and contaminated by
&quot;short-lived&quot; radionuclides. Class B may be
contaminated by greater amounts of &quot;short-lived' and
&quot;short-lived&quot; radionuclides. Greater-than-Class-C
is much more radioactive and generally considered
unacceptable for near-surface disposal.</P>
<P>Classes A, B, and C are generally disposed of in
near-surface, shallow-land burial.</P>
<P>The average radioactivity concentration is current
Greater-than-Class C low-level radioactive waste is about
three times that of military high-level radioactive
waste.</P>
<P>A number of nuclear physicists are advocating a
reclassification of radioactive wastes since the above
classes include some high-level wastes, e.g., plutonium 239,
a highly toxic substance, even in Class A. The new
classification recommendations are based on longevity and
concentration of the radioactive materials which provide for
better control mechanisms.</P>

<b>OEPA Puts Public Health and 
Groundwater at Risk</b></h1>
<p align=center><font size=5>by Jane Forrest, Environmental Projects Director for 
Ohio Citizen Action<br>
</font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>The proposed rules by OEPA to clean up brownfield sites went too far. Even OEPA staff are not happy 
with how the rules are being proposed and environmental leaders are outraged. After 20 months of 
Steering Committee meetings and public meetings by OEPA, they have come up with rules that will 
undermine protection of groundwater, local government involvement, and lastly will not protect public 
health and the environment.<br>
</font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>We need to aggressively push OEPA to set a stringent clean up standard of 1 in 1,000,000 for all sites 
to protect workers, the community at large, and groundwater.<br>
</font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>Although OEPA has worked over the past ten years developing a groundwater strategy, pushed local 
governments to adopt wellfield protection and require that no new production wells be in a 
contaminated area. OEPA has developed a classification system that will undermine all of that work 
and commitment towards protecting groundwater.<br>
</font></p>
<p align=left><font size=2>The OEPA must protect groundwater and should require clean up of the groundwater at 
non-detectable levels to protect future water resources for over 40% of the Ohioans that are dependent 
on it. In the case of co-mingled and off-site plumes they should do those assessments on a case by 
case basis. If there are people drinking the water, the developer should clean up the contamination not 
just provide bottled water or treatment at the tap. No site should be able to get approved by the 
program if there is not adequate monitoring and clean up of groundwater contamination.<br>
</font></p>
<p align=left>This program will undermine clean up of all sites in Ohio, if we do not let our voices be 
heard. Write OEPA by<strong> September 9 </strong>and attend one of the three hearings in the State to 
voice your concerns. If you would like to testify at the upcoming JCARR hearing, call 
OEC, Sierra Club, or Citizen Action and they can alert you to the process and the format 
of the hearing:<font size=4><br>

Subject:Notes from Conference Call with EPA on October 1
Regarding Environmental Audit Privilege and Immunity Policies

Recently, some members of the Network conducted a conference call with
USEPA. Participants included Richard Parks and Kevin Williams, (WORC),
Sanford Lewis (Good Neighbor Project and NACS), Mike Fogelberg (Network
Against Corporate Secrecy), Mark Woodall (Sierra  Club), David Dempsey
(Michigan Environmental Council,Carol Andress (EDF), and Brian Riedel and
Eric Schaeffer of EPA, Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance.

Agenda: The purpose of the call was to discuss EPA's delegation 
activity, petitions to EPA, the direction that environmental audit privilege 
issues are heading, activity in the states and possible federal legislation.

Federal Legislation: EPA does not expect anything to move in Washington
through the conclusion of 1996.  1997 will likely see activity. There is
some indication that a federal bill on privilege may be akin to the South
Carolina law where "facts" and data are not privileged but "analysis" is.
In such an event, EPA will oppose it.  No language is floating yet.  If the
EPA policy is introduced as legislation, EPA not sure what its position will
be. 

Some conservatives may also approach audit legislation from a states' rights 
standpoint, seeking to bar EPA's program delegation-related challenges 
to state environmental audit laws, as described below.

Late session riders on appropriations bills are not likely to be a vehicle
though they are always a possibility.

Delegation: EPA is actively challenging environmental audit privilege and
immunity laws in  Texas, Utah, Idaho and Michigan.  It appears that EPA is
giving priority to challenging corporate secrecy  laws in states where a
delegated federal environmental program is  pending EPA approval OR in
states where citizens file a petition  with the EPA for the removal of a
federal program.  Some states with audit laws and new federal program
approvals have slipped through the cracks however. EPA is responding to
concrete cases to declare its positions on specific types of audit privilege
and immunity provisions in the states under the various environmental
frameworks (CWA, CAA, RCRA), rather than drafting a general statement.

EPA's evaluation of a state's audit law is significantly influenced 
by the interpretation of the law by state attorney generals.  In New 
Hampshire, the AG declared that the statute does not apply to federal laws.
In Virginia, a similar interpretation is likely.  If the states officially
declare that their laws do not apply to situations involving federally
delegated programs, then EPA officials believe they may no longer have
jurisdiction to challenge the audit laws.

EPA has not initiated over-filing in any state but it is apparently under
active consideration.

Any Title V decision will be made at headquarters, through the audit 
privilege task force which includes regional EPA officials.  The regions are 
reportedly pushing very hard for strong action.  EPA plans to exercise
caution in this area and is taking steps to ensure that any action is not ad
hoc, that any  actions be consistent region to region and legally credible.
EPA headquarters is involved in review, as wel as the regional offices.

EPA will continue to review pending state legislation and comment.  
EPA's position offers incentives for states to pass an EPA-type policy.  

Specific state delegation issues
o       Idaho:  Idaho has been informed in an EPA federal register notice
that it will not receive final Title V clean air act delegation unless it
repeals or revises its audit law. The Idaho AG is interpreting the audit law
as Confidential Business Information rather than privilege, an odd position
which is likely to be unacceptable to EPA.   Kevin Williams reported that a
source within the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality  informed him
that Idaho's audit law will likely be extended (it's up for  sunset review
in 1997) unless it poses a serious  threat to state delegation from EPA.
EPA was informed that there may be a petition from organizations in the state. 

o       Colorado:  EPA was informed that there may be a petition from
organizations in the state. NPDES approval is pending in the state so that
timing of the petition may be important.  

o       Michigan:  Dave Dempsey reported that there have been 2 voluntary 
disclosures on minor issues related to materials storage under the state
law. EPA is in the process of responding to a petition filed by
organizations in Michigan.

o       Texas: Texas has been informed in an EPA federal register notice
that it will not receive final Title V clean air act delegation unless it
repeals or revises its audit law. EPA is reviewing a petition by EDF and the
Oil, Chemical & Atomic Workers International Union in Texas challenging the
state's deep well injection permitting program, partly on grounds that TX
audit law impedes state enforcement capabilities.

Survey by National Conference of State Legislators:  EPA indicated that the 
National Conference of State Legislators might conduct an EPA funded survey
of audit bills and practices, their implementation and results.
Environmental groups will be invited to participate in the survey's design.
EPA also plans to have an intern examine violations that have been
voluntarily disclosed in each state that has an audit law on the books.

Federal Audit Disclosures:  EPA reported that there have been 76 
voluntary disclosures under the federal audit policy encompassing 150 
violations. Settlements have been reached in 15 cases.  Brian Riedel is
writing a report. These numbers indicate that companies will to come forward
and disclose violations without the benefit of sweeping  privileges and 
immunities, which do not exist in the EPA policy.    

National Governors' Association Resolution: Eric and Brian said the 
EPA is not significantly concerned by the final  resolution on environmental 
audit privileges adopted by the  National Governors' Association.
Apparently, the resolution asks that the EPA not step in and challenge a
federally delegated  environmental program unless there's an enforcement
issue or the state is not able to meet federal requirements.  EPA feels this
is exactly what they are in fact doing.  

U.S. Supreme Court broadens Privileges in a different context:  On a general
legal note, Eric and Brian informed us that the U.S. Supreme Court recently
decided to extend the psychiatrist/patient privilege to social workers and
their patients by a vote of 7 to 2.  Interestingly, Justice Scalia authored
a blistering dissent. 

EPA committed to providing backup documentation regarding many of the items
discussed. Contact Mike Fogelberg (mfogelberg@igc.org) if you need specific
documentation or Brian Riedel at USEPA: riedel.brian@epamail.epa.gov.

Notes from conference call prepared by joint effort of Kevin Williams, 
Mike Fogelberg and Sanford Lewis.

Re: Additional Comments 

	The Greene Environmental Coalition reiterates its support for  
reasonable incentives that may encourage the clean-up and development of 
so-called Brownfields properties in Ohio.  However, review of the proposed rules 
released on October 3 leaves us with ongoing concern about both the rules and 
the process for embracing the public.  

	With only one exception, none of the comments we submitted at the public 
hearing in Dayton on September 5 have been addressed in this proposed rule 
package.  In 3745-300-10 (E) (1) (iii) the agency clarified the area served by a 
community water system.  Thank you for recognizing the need for clarity.  
Although we did not comment on the issue of flow rates, the agency strengthened 
3745-300-10 (C) (2) (b) (ii).  Again, thank you.  

	It does not appear that our comments, and apparently others who 
commented during the early September public hearings, were not given serious 
consideration.  Therefore, we must assume that the next version of rules will 
address these concerns and the concerns of the many other citizens that 
testified during the public hearing process.   

While some are suggesting that the Agency does not have the time nor the 
personnel to address the concerns of the many Ohioans who commented on these 
rules, we must believe the Agency will not yield, and will aggressively pursue 
its charter to provide for the protection of the public health and environment. 
 Knowing you will give serious consideration to the carefully researched 
comments received during the last 45 days, we look forward to seeing a rule 
package that we can support to the members of the JCARR.  

Thank you again for the opportunity to comment.  

Bruce Cornett for the Greene Environmental Coalition.

Alert Alert Alert Alert Alert Alert Alert Alert Alert Alert 

A memo dated October 3, 1996 (and received today, October 11, 
1996) from Ohio EPA extends the Brownfields Rules public 
comment period until Tuesday, October 15th.  Ohio EPA 
suggests that they will file the latest version of the rules 
with JCARR on October 23 or 24.  

The package from Ohio EPA contained the latest version of the
proposed rules, including summary pages outlining changes 
from the July, 1996 version.  In addition, the rules contain 
strike-out and red-lined text to show the sections changed.  

Each of the rule summary pages includes references to changes 
made as a result of public comments taken through the month 
of September, 1996.  Unfortunately, the package does not 
contain a responsiveness summary detailing OEPA's response to 
issues posed by the public.  It is important to remember that 
some of the persons commenting were not environmental 
advocates.

We have not performed an analysis of the changes as yet.  
Cursory review and newspaper accounts lead us to believe that 
many of the issues concerning the advocacy community have not 
been adequately addressed.  

It does not appear that the changes to the rules have been 
posted on the EPA Web site.  We will attempt to get the 
summary pages scanned and posted to  
<a href="http://www.greenlink.org/brown/index.html">http://www.greenlink.org/brown/index.html</a>
before the weekend is over. We will also post details about 
the JCARR rule acceptance process next week.    

If you have not received a copy of the rules, call OEPA at
(614)644.2292 or e-mail Jenifer Kwasniewski at
jenifer_kwasniewski@central.epa.ohio.gov

If you have comments please post them to the legislative 
forum on GreenLink.

Ohio EPA proposes illegal air emissions increase for 
Fairborn's Southwestern Portland Cement Company

This week the Ohio EPA proposed to increase air emissions for 
one of the largest air polluters in the Miami Valley.  
Southwestern Portland cement Company, owned by Houston, 
Texas-based Southdown Corporation, pressured the Ohio EPA to 
increase its emissions of dangerous particulates from 48 tons 
per year to over 200 tons per year.  This is over a 400 
percent increase.  

The Ohio EPA also proposes to increase the "visible 
emissions" from 15 percent to 20 percent.  This means more 
smoke out of the stack. 

The Agency also proposes to remove all emissions limits on 
cancer causing heavy metals and organic hydrocarbons.

The Ohio EPA claims that this change just takes the facility 
back to its original permit before it started burning 
hazardous waste.  Unfortunately, that is exactly what this 
illegal change does.  It throws our air program right back 
to the 1980s when the Miami Valley enjoyed some of the worst 
air in the nation. 
 

"There is an ongoing question about the company's 
competence," said Michael Jones of GEC.  "Citing 'sloppy 
science' and inconsistencies in the risk analysis, the Ohio 
Hazardous Waste Facility Board voted in 1994 to deny the 
company the right to handle hazardous waste at the Fairborn 
facility, and we don't think anything has changed with regard 
to the company's competence," he continued. "It looks like 
the OEPA is just trying to lower the permit standards 
to a point where the company just won't be in violation so 
often." 

The proposed permit also gives the company the right to 
incinerate tires.  The company proposes to bypass the 
recently adopted Ohio EPA rules on "recovering energy" from 
tires which requires shredding the tires in order to mix them 
with coal.  The company proposes to simply toss the whole 
tire into the end of the burner and let the smoke and 
unburned hydrocarbons go up the stack.  This "sham 
recycling" has the potential to release thousands of pounds 
of cancer causing chemicals into the Miami Valley.  
Ironically, if the tires contain any chlorine, dioxin may be 
created by the very air pollution control equipment put in 
place to protect us.  The company's air pollution control 
equipment operates at the same temperature as the notorious 
Montgomery County incinerator's equipment, which was the 
source of extremely high dioxin emissions.  But this permit 
will not test for dioxins, or organic hydrocarbons.  It won't 
even check for heavy metals during tire burning, as long as 
the total increase in metals emissions is less than 2000 
pounds per year.  2000 pounds of Arsenic, Beryllium, Cadmium, 
Chromium VI, Lead, Mercury, Nickel, and Zinc.  

Knowing the public will not accept this rollback in 
environmental protection, the Ohio EPA has proposed this 
change without holding a public hearing.  Review of the 
agency files reveal that Southdown, their lobbyists,  and the 
Agency have been collaborating on this change since the 
company failed an air emissions test last summer.  


There is no legal precedent for rolling back and allowing 
such dramatic increases in air emissions.  In fact, it is 
specifically against Federal law.  The clean Air Act clearly 
states that significant increases in air emissions are 
cause for the stringent New Source Review (NSR) mandates of 
the Clean Air Act (On April 12 Ohio EPA incorporated the 
Federal Requirements for NSR into its own rules; thus the 
Agency is violating its own rules in addition to the Federal 
Rules.) 

Bruce Cornett, Program Coordinator for the Greene 
Environmental Coalition said," we first learned of this 
permit by closely monitoring the official journal of 
OEPA Director, Donald Schregardus.  We have asked the agency 
to remove the conditions allowing the sham recycling of 
tires, to remove the increase in particulate emissions. We 
have also asked for a public hearing, so the people of 
the Miami Valley can speak up about the dangers to their 
health as well as the danger to their economic well being if 
the US EPA steps in and places sanctions on the entire Miami 
Valley.  And furthermore, citizens would be afforded the 
opportunity to testify against giving such a pollution permit 
increase for the benefit of one Texas corporation that wasn't 
fit to handle hazardous waste and now can't even meet its 
permit conditions."   


* The Greene Environmental Coalition has been extensively 
involved in litigation concerning Southdown's environmental 
transgressions.  Currently the group has brought the company 
into Federal Court to ensure the proper cleanup of a landfill 
that has been leaching dangerous chemicals into a Greene 
County stream near the Fairborn wellfields.

<p>Re: Getting EPA's information organized</p>
<p>Date: Nov 21, 1996</p>
<p>The U.S. EPA is requesting public comments on what is potentially the most far reaching reform of 
environmental information the agency has ever attempted. EPA is considering how to establish an 
electronic pointer system linking all data collected under Federal environmental statutes. The 
agency is both accepting written comments and holding public meetings for people to speak. The 
meeting will be on:</p>
<p>December 10 in Chicago (at U.S. EPA Regional HQ, 77 West Jackson Blvd, Metcalfe Bldg.); 
andDecember 12 in Washington, DC (at U.S. EPA Education Center Auditorium).</p>
<p>TO SPEAK AT EITHER OF THESE MEETINGS YOU MUST REGISTER BY DECEMBER 
5 BY CALLING EPA AT 703-218-2700.</p>
<p>Below are an article and sample letter to EPA. For additional information see the Federal Register 
notice at 61 FR 52587 or at http://www.epa.gov/opptintr/key_id/index.htm.</p>
<p>INFORMATION REFORMS NEED HELP</p>
<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is requesting public comments on what is 
potentially the most far reaching reform of environmental information the agency has ever 
attempted. If successful, EPA's &quot;facility identification&quot; (or key identifiers) initiative will set up an 
electronic pointer system for linking all data collected under Federal environmental statutes.</p>
<p>Despite spending over $300 million each year on environmental information, EPA cannot Readily 
form an environmental profile of an industrial facility or link information across more than a dozen 
separate program offices. What is more, facilities must often report information to the states rather 
than to EPA.</p>
<p>So how can EPA link-up information reported under the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, Toxics 
Release Inventory, Safe Drinking Water Act, and many other requirements? EPA wants to start by 
establishing a reliable identification number for every regulated facility in the country, together with a 
core set of &quot;key identifiers&quot; for each facility. These basic identifiers include facility name, address, 
contact name, parent company, industrial sector, geographic coordinates, regulatory status (permit 
numbers), etc. EPA discusses 10 such elements in its notice. These elements will enable people to 
readily obtain environmental information on, for example, a local factory, its parent company, an 
entire industry, or a zip code or watershed. The initiative also furthers consolidated &quot;one-stop&quot; 
reporting.</p>
<p>However, the effort suffers from a lack of strong direction. EPA is considering alternatives that 
simply won't achieve the goal of integrating information-such as an option that would set up 50 
separate state systems! The agency's notice presents five major alternatives, but only one, a formal 
rule (option D), can provide the commitment and stability of decision-making needed to succeed. 
Further, several important identifiers are missing from EPA's notice (see sample letter). </p>
<p>Please send EPA a short letter to move the initiative forward.</p>

<p>Re: Docket OPPTS-00186</p>
<p>The [name of organization] urges EPA to move forward with its facility identification (key 
identifiers) information reform initiative. Our [# of] members rely on information collected by states 
and EPA for effective protection of public health and the environment.</p>
<p>EPA's facility identification initiative will enable people to readily find information on environmental 
conditions where we work, live, and play. The initiative should let people easily obtain information 
from any of EPA's data collections on any regulated facility, parent company, industry, chemical, 
geographic area, or regulatory requirement. </p>
<p>However, we are troubled by EPA's lack of strong direction, and urge the agency to move forward 
with reforms that:</p>
<p>[1] Establish an effective national registration system for every facility that EPA regulates, and 
collect basic key identifiers information from each.</p>
<p>[2] Establish a unified national system, not multiple, inconsistent state data systems.</p>
<p>[3] Develop a formal rulemaking that establishes EPA's commitment, guarantees state compliance, 
and makes facilities responsible for maintaining their information.</p>
<p>[4] Include information reported under all Federal environmental laws, whether collected by states 
or EPA.</p>
<p>[5] Add critical elements not addressed in EPA's notice, including tax identification number, 
effective date, and certifying corporate officer, and assure easy links to data elements and files on <br>
chemicals (CAS number), permit numbers, and accidents.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<P>Rivers Unlimited works to influence public policy and legislation when it relates to the health of Ohio's rivers and waterways. </P>
<P> Anti-degradation (Section 6111.12 of Ohio Revised Code): The anti-degradation rule, passed as a hidden rider in the 1993 budget bill, would allow increased levels of pollution in 96% of Ohio's 61,000 miles of rivers and streams. Rivers Unlimited organized a coalition of 30 conservation, environmental, and recreation groups to oppose these rules. Additionally, Rivers Unlimited, with the backing of seven other groups, filed a lawsuit in December 1995 which would prevent the EPA from implementing these destructive new rules. </P>
<P> Environmental Audit Privilege (S.B. 138): This bill, under consideration in the 1996 legislative session, would allow industries that do voluntary audits to shield any civil violations that they find from public view. Rivers Unlimited strongly opposes this bill because most responsible businesses already have good environmental audit programs. The only effect this law would have is to encourage unscrupulous companies to do business in Ohio where they can hide their shady activities from the public and regulators and potentially dump illegal pollutants into our waterways.</P>
<P> Takings (H.B. 533): This bill was drafted and circulated by the Ohio Farm Bureau, who along with other proponents, argue that environmental regulations which restrict a property owner's ability to develop her/his land have had that land &quot;taken.&quot; However, there are no documented cases of takings in Ohio. Takings legislation would create a huge bureaucracy which would conduct cost/benefit analyses each time any local or state government considers an action that would protect public health, safety, or the environment that involved private land.</P>

<p>Action Alert!</p>
<p><strong>Expand Community Right-to-Know</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. EPA has announced in an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) that it 
intends to expand community right-to-know about the use of toxic chemicals at industrial facilities. 
This important step will support pollution prevention and inform people about potential toxic 
exposures on the job, in consumer products, and from transportation accidents.</p>
<p>We have advocated this step for years. Now that EPA has taken it, public support is essential. The 
proposal faces immense opposition from the chemical industry. To show support send short 
comments to EPA by December 30 (sample outline below).</p>
<p>Comments can be short. We suggest:</p>
<p>1. Support EPA's intention to add chemical use and worker exposure data to the Toxics Release 
Inventory (TRI) and urge the agency to move forward without delay.</p>
<p>2. Explain that the information will help you (the community, workers, consumers, environmental 
managers, government, etc.) to better understand toxic exposures and prevention opportunities.</p>
<p>3. Give one or two examples of how you would use the data. For sample ideas see the list of &quot;uses 
of use data&quot; on the reverse.</p>
<p>Send three copies to:</p>

<p>EPA's announcement is available from:</p>

<p>The Federal Register, October 1, 1996, page 51322.</p>
<p>Uses of Use Data</p>
<p>Chemical use data, or &quot;materials accounting,&quot; tracks the flow of chemicals through an industrial 
facility. It will fill holes in current right-to-know programs for measuring pollution prevention and 
assessing potential toxic exposures on the job, in consumer products, and from transportation 
accidents. Basic materials accounting and related TRI expansion will help the public, industry, or 
government to:</p>
<p>[1] understand where toxic chemicals go (in products as well as in waste);</p>
<p>[2] assess potential toxic exposures not covered by TRI, to workers on the job, to consumers 
through products, and to communities from transportation of raw materials brought on-site;</p>
<p>[3] develop prevention opportunities inside the factory and shift attention from managing pollution 
to preventing it;</p>
<p>[4] verify and improve confidence in TRI emissions data and pollution reports filed under other 
laws (such as the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, etc.);</p>
<p>[5] assist prevention planning by providing measures of source reduction and chemical use 
efficiency (e.g. changes in waste per unit of chemical used);</p>
<p>[6] link use of the chemical to its life cycle of costs and impacts, both &quot;upstream from the factory 
(for chemicals brought on-site) and &quot;downstream&quot; (for use and disposal of chemical in products);<br>
</p>
<p>[7] demonstrate competence to manage chemicals;</p>
<p>[8] identify facilities with the greatest need for extended producer responsibility programs;</p>
<p>[9] encourage transfer and use of cleaner technologies; and,</p>
<p>[10] improve public understanding and worker-community-industry dialogue by giving all parties 
more equal information for environmental decision making.</p>

<p>RIGHT TO KNOW EXPANSION STALLED AT WHITE HOUSE</p>

<p>A sample letter follows this brief explanation:</p>

<p>In August of 1995, President Clinton directed the EPA to
expand the public's right to know, including to sources of
pollution that are currently exempt from Federal toxics release
reporting requirements. EPA acted accordingly, and last summer
proposed to add seven new industries -- all major sources of
toxic pollution -- to the Community Right to Know reporting
requirements. </p>

<p>In June 1996, Vice President Gore and EPA Administrator
Browner held a press conference together to announce this major
expansion of right to know. These new sources of pollution
include hazardous waste incinerators, utilities, chemical
distributors, and major sections of the <br>
mining industry.</p>

<p>Well over 2,000 citizens and organizations from across the
country commented to EPA in support of this proposal. EPA worked
to finalize this proposal and make it law by the end of 1996 so
that polluters could begin their public reporting for the 1997
calendar year.</p>

<p>However, the proposal is now &quot;stuck&quot; at the Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) -- the agency that serves as a
last stop in approving all major regulations. Generally,
regulations get &quot;stuck&quot; at OMB when industry complains
about them loudly enough. We need to ensure that the White House
stands up for expansion of community right-to-know, which Clinton
campaigned for last year.</p>

<p>SAMPLE LETTER TO VICE PRESIDENT GORE ( <a
href="mailto:vice.president@whitehouse.gov">vice.president@whitehouse.gov</a>)</p>

<p>The Honorable Al Gore</p>

<p>The White House, Office of the Vice President</p>

<p>Washington, D.C. 20501</p>

<p>Dear Vice President Gore:</p>

<p>I appreciate your efforts to expand the public's right to know
about toxic pollution, but am concerned that the Environmental
Protection Agency's proposal to add currently exempt industries
to the Community Right to Know Act has become stalled. We need
your help to ensure that this regulation is finalized promptly
and not weakened.</p>

<p>I was thrilled last summer when you and EPA Administrator
Browner announced the proposal to add seven new industries to the
Community Right to Know Act. The June 26, 1996, announcement said
that EPA hoped to finalize the regulation before the end of 1996
so that the newly added companies could begin reporting for the
1997 calendar year. We may only be in the first weeks of 1997 but
the Administration's failure to meet the 1996 deadline means that
the data on toxic pollution from these new industries will be
delayed for another full calendar year. As a result, the public's
right to know about major sources of toxic pollution, such as
hazardous waste incinerators, utilities and important sections of
the mining industry, will not be fulfilled until well into 1999. </p>

<p>EPA's proposal is sound and important. I am concerned that
industry pressures are slowing the process down. Please work to
ensure that this rulemaking is finalized promptly. Thank you
again for you continued efforts to expand the public's right to
know.</p>

<p>Please send me a written response.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>[Your name, organization, and address]</p>

Budget, Old Executive Office Building, Room 350,Washington, DC

<H1>GREENWAYS INITIATIVE</H1>
</CENTER>
<P><BR>
In March of 1996 Rivers Unlimited received a
grant from the George Gund Foundation for a two-year project
to generate momentum for a statewide greenways initiative. In
June of 1996 the organization hired long-time river advocate
Elaine Marsh of Bath Township to direct the project. Elaine
can be reached at ohgreenway@aol.com</P>
<P> <B>What are greenways?</B></P>
<P>Greenways are linear open spaces that tie together
people, parks, historic sites, and natural areas. They follow
streams, abandoned rail lines, canals, and other
transportation corridors. Greenways serve as buffer strips
and are rivers' last line of defense against pollution and
runoff. They also provide wildlife with habitat and migration
corridors. </P>
<P>Some greenways are created as commuting/recreational
corridors. This brings economic, cultural, and ecological
benefits to the communities in which they are created. </P>
<P><B>Rivers Unlimited's Greenways Initiative</B></P>
<P>Rivers Unlimited completed an Ohio Greenways Scoping
Study in in conjunction with the Conservation Fund. This work
has effectively brought together the major stakeholders in
Ohio, mapping existing and planned greenways. The study also
recommends new and extended greenways along rivers to connect
many of Ohio's 500 parks, historical sites, natural wonders,
and other attractions.</P>
<P> The greenways project will focus on four goals over the
next two years:</P>
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>Completing a report detailing the economics
of greenways in Ohio;</LI>
<LI>Collecting case studies on greenways in Ohio;</LI>
<LI>Convening a statewide conference in 1997;</LI>
<LI>Creating an Ohio Greenways Blueprint for Action.</LI>
</UL>
<P><B>The Greenways Project Management Team, which is made up
of leaders of various conservation and recreation groups,
helps to guide the project. The Team includes:</B></P>

<H2>LEGISLATION INTRODUCED TO TRANSFER DISPOSAL
RESPONSIBILITY TO THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR</H2>
</CENTER>
<P>On May 7, 1996, a bill (H.R. 3394), the
Low-Level Radioactive Waste Federal Responsibility Act of
1996, was introduced by Representative Jerry Lewis (R-CA).
The bill would transfer the disposal responsibility for
commercial low-level radioactive waste (LLRW) to the US
Secretary of the Interior for &quot;waste generated within
any state <B>outside</B> a sited compact region.&quot; </P>
<P>The proposed legislation mandates that the Secretary
establish a disposal facility on land owned by the federal
government. The Secretary could contract with the Department
of Energy (DOE) for temporary storage of LLRW at a facility
established by DOE, and may contract with DOE for disposal,
or may contract with any state for the same services at their
licensed facility. The Secretary would take physical
possession of LLRW beginning on January 1, 1997, whether a
contract with the Secretary of Energy has been completed.</P>
<P>A sited compact region, i.e., a region in which there is
located an operating disposal facility (Barnwell, SC and
Richland, WA), will continue to be such until it ceases to
accept waste. Any state that is not in a sited compact region
may provide in-state disposal of LLRW within its borders, and
is not required to accept out-of-state LLRW except under
contract to the Interior Secretary.</P>
<P>The rates are to recover the actual costs (disposal,
administrative, and contractual) and may be based upon volume
or radioactivity, or a combination of the two, but not to
exceed $500 per cubic foot of waste disposed.*</P>
<HR>
<P>*LLW Notes, Idaho National Engineering Laboratory,
May 1966.</P>
<P>Comments: H.R. 3394 may hold some possibilities for the
disposal of LLRW (I commit to further study):</P>
<P>1. The responsibility for disposal falls first to a
congressional decision to transfer control</P>
<P>to the Department of the Interior;</P>
<P>2. The control of the &quot;free state&quot; wastes would
be under one federal agency;</P>
<P>3. Standards can be prioritized;</P>
<P>4. Classifications of wastes can be established on the
basis of radioactivity and longevity</P>
<P>(rather than the current classifications of A, B and
C);</P>
<P>5. Consistent surveillance and liability can be
established and supervised by an agency</P>
<P>with expected long-life term; and </P>
<P>6. Consistent health and safety measures can be
established across the states.</P>

<BODY>
<H2>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION OPTION</H2>
<P>At an All Employee's Meeting of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC) on October 18, 1994, Chairman Ivan Selin
spoke to many of NRC's issues including those issues in
planning stages and in implementation phases.</P>
<P>One issue among the many of significant concern, was
directed toward the development of low-level radioactive
waste disposal facilities. He indicated that progress was
being made, though slow and too expensive, and that within
the next few years, the &quot;compacts will be well underway
to building low-level waste sites adequate to handle all of
the low-level waste generated in the United States. The
reason for my confidence is mostly that there isn't that much
low-level waste; two or three sites could handle all the
waste if it weren't for the politics.&quot;*</P>
<P>Selin's recommendation of consolidation was most alarming
to state officials of Pennsylvania which is close to choosing
a site for its low-level radioactive waste disposal, and
could end up as one of the three sites. According to Bruce
Dallas, spokesman for the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Resources, &quot;The consolidation recommended
by NRC could hamper a project that already is years behind
schedule and highly distrusted by the public.&quot;**</P>
<P>California could be one of the three sites since it has
chosen Ward Valley as its site, pending transfer of title of
federal land to the state of California. Bills are pending in
both the US Senate and US House of Representatives for
transfer of the title.*** Further investigation of the site
is being required, since Ward Valley has similar soil
characteristics as the Beatty, NV site where leakage is
already occurring.</P>
<P>Texas may be one of the three, since they have vowed to
build a site whether under a Compact or not, or whether
Congress approves their Compact plans or not.</P>
<P>Ohio, as the first host state of the Midwest Compact,
faces the possibility of being named a consolidation site
with its designation of a disposal site in 1998.</P>
<P>While the NRC has no authority to stop construction of a
disposal site, it can use persuasion to convince a state to
accept waste from other states.</P>

<P>*** LLW Notes, Vol. 11, Number 4, May 1996. The bills

<P>S. 1596, introduced on March 7, 1996, and sponsored by
Senator Frank Murkowski </P>
<P>(R-AK) and Bennett Johnston (D-LA);</P>

<HR>
<P>Note: California and the other states in their
compact have cited the LLRW disposal site at Ward Valley as
&quot;desparately needed&quot; by cancer and other patient
groups, the medical and academic communities, and the
biotechnology community. The truth is -- that by requiring
the Department of the Interior to do independent in-depth
studies of the leaks at Beatty, NV (where the soils are
similar to Ward Valley) the Interior Department and the
President are taking prudent precaution to protect California
citizens directly, and indirectly to protect citizens of
other states across the United States.</P>

<BODY>
<CENTER>
<H2>FACT SHEET: THE ISSUE OF RADIOACTIVE ASTE
DISPOSAL IN OHIO AN OHIO INITIATIVE PETITION, 1996</H2>
</CENTER>
<P></P>
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>On June 7, 1995 the Ohio General Assembly
passed Sub. S.B. 19 enabling Ohio to receive commercial
low-level radioactive wastes from five other states (Indiana,
Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri and Wisconsin) as the first Midwest
Compact host state.</LI>
<LI>The capacity of the disposal site has been designated
2.25 million cubic feet with expansion permitted by decision
of the Midwest Compact Commission, the Ohio Low Level
Radioactive Waste Development Authority and its Board of
Directors in the event a second host state fails to meet its
schedule.</LI>
<LI>The designated period for receiving radioactive waste is
20 years, and an extension of that time period is solely the
decision of the Commission, the Development Authority and
their Board of Directors.</LI>
<LI>Likewise, the decision to import wastes from states
other than the five above is the decision of the Commission,
the Development Authority and their Board of Directors.</LI>
<LI>The co-mingling of short- and long-lived radioactive
wastes, whether Class A, B, or C will require that Ohio
assume liability after the expiration of Long Term Care
Funds.</LI>
<LI>Radioactive medical treatment and research wastes are
being exploited as the preponderant reason for the disposal
siting, regardless of the fact that 80% by volume and 95% by
radioactivity (1989 figures) is generated by the nuclear
power industry.</LI>
<LI>The allowable levels of radioactivity at the disposal
site are designated as ALARA (as low as reasonably
achievable), and the Director of Health and the Public Health
Council rather than the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
determine solely the achievable level.</LI>
<LI>All decisions regarding the disposal facility siting,
operations, monitoring, and closing are to be made by the
Commission, the Development Authority, its Board of
Directors, and its appointed Councils, Review Boards, and
other appointees with only the most minimal input by a few
designated citizens.</LI>
<LI>Ohio children and future citizens will be faced with the
variables of ALARA, the uncertainties of nuclear waste
transport, the whims of political appointees to Boards and
Councils, and the questionable integrity of a closed
system.</LI>
</UL>
<P><B>IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT:</B></P>
<P>1. Citizens
participate in decisions whether Ohio can accept radioactive
wastes from other states for disposal at a facility on its
soil;</P>
<P>2. Citizens support the Initiative Petition of 1996 to be
able to vote in the November 1998 ballot to prohibit the
establishment of a disposal facility in Ohio which would
receive radioactive wastes from the five states as named
above and other states in addition.</P>

become involved in unbalanced presentations on the low-level
radioactive waste issue.</P>
<P><BR>
 </P>
<P><B>Ohio State University Research Foundation</B> was
awarded on June 10, 1992 a one-year Phase I contract in the
amount of $274,722 from the Midwest Low-Level Radioactive
Waste Compact to educate Ohio residents on the low-level
radioactive waste issue. This was the first phase of a four
phase &quot;Statewide Educational Program on Low-Level
Radioactive Waste.&quot;* If the University's intent is to
educate and inform, neutrality is essential. OSU's production
of a colorful edition on glossy paper may be attractive, but
it fails to present information objectively on both sides of
this complex issue, even failing to utilize the radiation
standards as presented in the BIER V Report of 1990. Rather
it promotes the pro-Compact policy choice to the exclusion of
other choices available. Such one-sided presentations are
neither defensible as appropriate expenditure of funds nor
supportable as worthy activities of an institution of higher
education where rigorous thought and critical examination of
information is said to be a priority.</P>
<P><B>The Ohio Cooperative Extension Service</B>, as the
University's &quot;communication network&quot; to the people
of Ohio, is also in danger of being used as a public
relations tool for promoters of one policy choice within the
low-level radioactive waste issue.</P>
<P><B>The League of Women Voters</B> has publicly endorsed
the Midwest Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact. In November
1987 the League of Women Voters Education Fund announced that
it had received a major grant of $274,287 from the Department
of Energy for citizen education on nuclear waste issues.**
Further funding has come from developers and Compact
Commissions. The League is clearly partisan on this issue and
therefore cannot be regarded as a neutral, impartial
presenter of balanced information. Though chosen for this
project because of the League's &quot;national membership and
familiarity with legislative process,&quot; the League is
clearly demonstrating a partisan position of the nuclear
waste issue.</P>
<P>Recently, the League of Women Voters indicated its
oposition to the proposed Constitutional Amendment as
certified by Ohio's Attorney General on April 12,
1996.***</P>

<H2>History of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste
Legislation and Its Impacts</H2>
</CENTER>
<P>In 1980, just before the Christmas recess, the
U.S. Senate, in a flurry of bills, passed
&quot;low-level&quot; radioactive waste legislation. This
law, the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act (P.L.
96-578), made each state responsible for providing for the
disposal of low-level radioactive waste generated within its
borders. The States were permitted to enter into such
compacts as seemed necessary to provide for disposal
facilities for low-level radioactive waste.</P>
<P>Low-level radioactive waste was defined as radioactive
wastes not defined as high-level radioactive waste,
transuranic waste, spent nuclear fuel, or by-product
material.</P>
<P>The consent of Congress was granted in 1982 creating the
Midwest Low-Level Radioactive Waste Commission with a voting
member from each state. The selection and expenses of each
member became the responsibility of each member's respective
state. Each state was permitted to levy a surcharge on all
users of a regional facility to cover the annual budget, and
the Commission was to develop a management plan to accomplish
the tasks and to designate a host state. A host state could
request relief as host if no appropriate site existed within
its boundaries. If a host state was to fail to fulfill its
obligations as a host state, it could have its membership in
the Compact revoked. Sixteen states were eligible to be in
the Midwest Compact. Seven joined: Indiana, Iowa, Michigan,
Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, and Wisconsin.</P>
<P>By late 1984, it was evident that regions without waste
sites were not progressing rapidly enough to have new
facilities operating by the deadline of 1986. A change in the
law appeared necessary in order to allow time for the
construction of the additional disposal sites foreseen in the
1980 Act. Of the three eligible sites, Hanford, Washington
and Beatty, Nevada were both temporarily closed, and
Barnwell, South Carolina had reduced the annual volume of
waste it would accept by 50 percent. The three sited states
agreed to continue to make their sites available to the
entire country for an additional seven years -- but only if
the unsited states and regions showed specific progress
toward developing new disposal capacity. The final date when
sited States could exclude waste from outside their regional
borders was extended to January 1993. In exchange, the
unsited States were required to meet a series of specific
dates, or milestones, in order to avoid penalties and
possible loss of access.</P>
<P>The Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of
1985 (P.L. 99-240) provided for a deadline in naming the
first host state, a deadline of January 1, 1993 for the host
state to take title to wastes with a deadline of January 1,
1996 for waste disposal. Michigan was named the first host
state in the Midwest Compact. By January 1, 1990, the host
state was to have applied to the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission for a license to operate. On May 5, 1992, the
&quot;take-title&quot; provision was declared
unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court.</P>
<P>Article VI provided that if a party state found that no
potential facility site exists within its borders the
Commission could relieve that state of its responsibility.
Michigan so claimed this disability and was relieved of
membership in the Compact in July 1991. Ohio was then named
the host state, with the proviso that it too could withdraw
by 1997. Its membership in the Compact could then be revoked
by the Commission for withdrawal. Penalties would be
calculated for Ohio, as they were for Michigan.</P>
<P>NRC's rule making for regulating low-level radioactive
waste disposal resulted in the addition of a new part to
Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations -- 10 CFR Part
61, &quot;Licensing Requirements for Land Disposal of
Radioactive Wastes.&quot;. It set forth the procedures,
criteria, terms and conditions on which the NRC will issue
licenses for new disposal sites. In general, it covers the
following topics: </P>
<P>* the performance objectives;</P>
<P>* technical requirements for the siting, design,
operations, environmental monitoring, and closure activities for a near-surface facility;
</P>
<P>* classification of wastes;</P>
<P>* technical requirements on waste form;</P>
<P>* institutional requirements;</P>
<P>* financial assurance requirements, and</P>
<P>* administrative and procedural requirements for
licensing a facility.</P>
<P>The Midwest Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste
Commission established its own set of By-Laws which were
adopted on March 1, 1984; amended April 17, 1985; amended
February 12, 1986; amended May 1, 1986; amended December 5,
1986, effective January 1, 1987; amended June 30, 1987. Among
the items outlined in the By-Laws are: eligibility for
membership, representation on the Commission, officers,
meetings, procedures, voting, committees, finances, reports,
availability of information to the public, amendments,
adjudication, etc. The By-Laws were again amended in June
1993, redefining some terms, and, in general, stating
requirements in more definitive terms.</P>
<P>On June 7, 1995, the Ohio Legislature passed by partisan
vote Substitute Senate Bill 19 (Sub. S. B. No. 19) to
establish an administrative structure and process for the
siting, development, and operation of a regional low-level
radioactive waste disposal facility, including the
establishment of siting criteria, to amend the Midwest
Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact, and to
authorize the Department of Health on behalf of the state to
seek agreement state status with the United States Nuclear
Regulatory Commission.</P>
<P><B>Within this law are provisions which are of particular
concern:</B></P>
<P>1. The import and export of radioactive wastes -- the
Commission by vote can, (a) import</P>
<P>for disposal within the region, waste generated outside
the region, (b) export for disposal </P>
<P>outside the region, waste generated inside the region,
and (c) dispose of waste generated</P>
<P>within the region at a facility within the region that is
not a compact facility.</P>
<P>2. States to be required to fill unfunded remedial action
and long-term care funds -- the </P>
<P>question is whether any of the generators will exist
throughout the 500 years of the care</P>
<P>period to be able to pay into the fund. Citizens will be
the only other resource.</P>
<P>3. The acceptance period may be extended beyond twenty
years and the capacity of the </P>
<P>facility may be increased -- the decision to extend
either the period or the capacity will be</P>
<P>made by the Commission, the Ohio Low-Level Radioactive
Waste Development Authority </P>
<P>and its Board of Directors -- not by a consent of a
majority of Ohio citizens.</P>
<P>4. If the Compact is dissolved, the host state can
continue to operate the facility -- the host</P>
<P>state has the option to continue operating a facility or
in opening and operating a previously</P>
<P>closed facility as a non compact facility. No
specifications are given as to who in the host </P>
<P>state makes the decision to continue to operate the
facility, or who will give the necessary</P>
<P>surveillance.</P>
<P>5. The Compact prevails over state laws -- if the law of
a party state conflicts with this </P>
<P>Compact, the Compact shall prevail to the extent of the
conflict. The host state citizens </P>
<P>have no voice in the matter.</P>
<P>6. The waste classifications are Class A, B, and C -- all
of the classes of wastes contain</P>
<P>some high-level wastes, e.g., plutonium-239, a highly
toxic substance, even in Class A.</P>
<P>A reclassification of the wastes would permit a more
appropriate surveillance period for</P>
<P>each classification.</P>
<P>7. The definition of &quot;low-level radioactive
waste&quot; as radioactive waste that is not </P>
<P>classified as high-level radioactive waste is
inappropriate -- a non-fuel reactor component</P>
<P>emitting 1000 rads/hour is thus classed as low-level
waste since low-level is defined as</P>
<P>any waste that is not spent nuclear fuel, transuranic
waste, or by-product material (uranium</P>
<P>and thorium mill tailings). If 500 rads/hour is enough to
kill a person, then 1000 rads/hour</P>
<P>is biologically high-level indeed.</P>
<P>8. Appointments to the Ohio Low-Level Radioactive Waste
Facility Development </P>
<P>Authority (of 12 members) are by the Governor (4
appointments), the Speaker of the </P>
<P>House (4), and the President of the Senate (4) -- though
educational qualifications are</P>
<P>named for most members, the appointees to the Authority,
being political appointees,</P>
<P>suggests a closed system.</P>
<P>Legislation was introduced on May 7, 1996, H.R. 3394
called the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Federal Responsibility
Act of 1996, to repeal the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy
Act of 1980 and to provide for the Secretary of the Interior
to have the authority and sole responsibility of disposing of
the commercial low-level radioactive waste. The disposal
would be on federal lands, or a contract could be made with
the Department of Energy (DOE) to store or dispose of the
radioactive wastes at a facility established by DOE. Any
state that is not in a sited compact region (Barnwell, South
Carolina or Richland, Washington) may provide for in-state
disposal of low-level radioactive waste generated within its
borders, and, if so, it may not be required to accept
out-of-state low-level radioactive waste except under
contract with the Interior Secretary -- This bill may be the
opportunity to reclassify the radioactive wastes by longevity
and concentrations of radioactivity, a safer and more
manageable disposal and surveillance process.</P>

<p>The Coast Alliance is a non-profit corporation formed in 1979 by a number of groups and 
individuals concerned about the effects on the U.S. coasts of unprecedented development pressure. 
The Coast Alliance was founded for the purpose of increasing public awareness of the coast&#146;s 
immense value, bringing new and important scientific facts about coastal ecology to public attention, 
encouraging groups across the country to work for protection of valuable coastal resources, and 
urging federal, state and local governments to strengthen policies and programs to protect coastal 
ecosystems. </p>
<p>With many issues of immense importance facing the coasts today, the Coast Alliance is dedicated 
to increasing public awareness of the problems and prospects of this country&#146;s coasts. Through its 
network of concerned activists on the Atlantic, Pacific, Gulf of Mexico and Great Lakes coasts, the 
Coast Alliance provides information on activities affecting our nation&#146;s invaluable shores, lakes and 
ocean waters. </p>
<p>For more information please contact us at the following address: COAST ALLIANCE, 215

<p>On Saturday, September 21, 1996, the &#147;Charting the Course&#148; workshop was held in Cleveland, 
Ohio. The purpose of this full-day workshop was to bring together concerned organizations and 
citizens to evaluate the draft Ohio Coastal Management Program (CMP) and to prepare for the 
ODNR public hearings on the draft coastal program document, which were held in October. </p>
<p>Prior to the workshop, participants were asked to review one of the following sections from 
Chapter 5 of the draft Ohio Coastal Management Program: </p>
<p>1) Coastal Erosion and Flooding; Ecologically Sensitive Resources </p>
<p>2) Ports and Shore Area Development; Recreation and Cultural Resources</p>
<p>3) Fish and Wildlife Management; Water Quality and Water Quantity </p>
<p>4) Environmental Quality; Energy and Mineral Resources </p>
<p>Copies of the draft 300-page program document are available free of charge from the State of 
Ohio. You may mail in your request for the document at the following address: Ohio Coastal 
Management Program Office Ohio Department of Natural Resources 1952 Belcher Drive, Building 
C Columbus, OH 43224-1386 FAX: 614/267-2981 Public Comments on the Ohio Coastal 
Management Program must be submitted by November 15, 1996 to the following address: Joe 
Uravitch Coastal Programs Division SSMC-4, Room 11109 1305 East-West Highway Silver 
Spring, MD 20910 301/713-3155 x 195 </p>
<p>Coast Alliance will be preparing public comments, which will be drafted by late October. If you 
would like to see our comments, to sign onto them or to use them to draft your own comments, 
please call, write or e-mail us at: Coast Alliance 215 Pennsylvania Ave, SE, 3rd Floor Washington, 
DC 20003 (ph) 202/546-9554 (fax) 202/546-9609 (e-mail) coast@igc.apc.org </p>
<p><strong>Top Ten Priority Actions </strong>That Should Be Taken to by the Participants of the Ohio Coast 
&#147;Charting the Course&#148; Workshop, Ohio, Sept. 21, 1996 </p>
<p>*Numbers in the parentheses indicate the number of votes received* </p>
<p>(23) All Wetlands are Important - so few are left, encourage restoration in lieu of mitigation 
(unproven) of wetlands - restore wetlands (diked)</p>
<p>(19) Resolve Problem of Inter-agency Conflicts; - local governments, public, IJC, LWV, OEC 
should work together </p>
<p>(19) Educate Local Officials, Planning Commissions, etc., About Coastal Zone Management 
Program - mandatory education </p>
<p>(17) Public Ignorance and Apathy - educate politicians, civic leaders, churches, teachers, realtors, 
developers, media, farmers - emphasize and promote economic benefits of ecotourism - encourage 
public participation in political issues and campaigns - promote stewardship - 4 E&#146;s: economy, 
environment, ethics, aesthetics</p>
<p>(15) Nonpoint Source Pollution: Plan is Lacking; Implementation Is Needed When There&#146;s a Plan </p>
<p>(14) Protect Supply of Native Fish by: - water quality protection - predator species elimination and 
the control of damaging exotics - stocking to restore viable levels of fish - creating artificial reefs 
(14) Shoreline Protection - ODNR should purchase shore areas - enhance staff of ODNR (13) 
Public Assess (the following ways could be used to obtain public property) - brownfields - state 
acquisition - regional planning - liability and litigation issues addressed (13) Encourage 
Nonstructural Measures for Erosion Control - use technical assistance to encourage nonstructural 
measures </p>
<p>(12) Recreational Development versus Natural Areas - protect and add to natural areas, using 
multiple financing - regional planning and cooperation - protect and preserve inland lakes so less 
pressure on Lake Erie The Following are the Remaining Issues Discussed at the Workshop as 
Possible Problems in the draft Ohio Coastal Management Program That Need to be Addressed 
*The numbers in the parentheses indicates the number of votes received by each issue* </p>
<p>(11) Request final public review and comment of the final revised draft of the coastal erosion areas 
(after property owners appeal) </p>
<p>(9) Need a coordinating body, for cooperation of agencies &#150; formal structure needed - example: 
Lake Erie Commission: has no power, could coordinate if empowered </p>
<p>(8) Encourage conservation easements (conservancy district)</p>
<p>(7) Lack of cooperation and planning among all &#147;players&#148; (government, interest groups universities) 
- identify players - encourage cooperation and coordination </p>
<p>(7) Lack of collection and dissemination of information - up-to-date inventory of flora and fauna, 
especially endangered - work with universities - use of technology, i.e. lands at, website - data 
must include all costs (social and environmental) </p>
<p>(7) Reduce impermeable surfaces in the coastal zone </p>
<p>(6) EPA part of problem &#150; not controlling bioaccumulative chemicals of concern </p>
<p>(5) Water quantity: Need (soon) an Inventory of water resources - inventory of water quality </p>
<p>(5) Provide education and easy access to the public - public participation enhancement </p>
<p>(5) Encourage alternative sources of energy: wind, conservation</p>
<p>(4) Develop incentives to encourage compliance with erosion goals and policies - local and state 
cost share - state could develop incentives - North Carolina limits impermeable surfaces to less 
than 20% of developed area in coastal areas </p>
<p>(4) Prohibition on oil and gas development (in Lake Erie) </p>
<p>(3) Enforcement of US regulations on commercial fishing </p>
<p>(3) Enforcement clarification needed throughout the program - need to increase enforcement 
capacity over areas not now included (in coastal erosion area) </p>
<p>(3) Nuclear power plants should not be used for weapons production</p>
<p>(3) If power plants change mission or ownership, state consistency review should be required </p>
<p>(2) No water diversion </p>
<p>(2) Coastal zone is drawn too narrowly </p>
<p>(2) Erosion increases with high lake levels - wind set-up leads to erosion - calculate erosion risk 
including wind set-up </p>
<p>(2) Need to identify decision makers who can be made accountable</p>
<p>(2) Encourage and enforce public access to natural lakeshore areas and developed areas</p>
<p>(2) reintegrate wetlands with the Lake Erie ecosystem</p>
<p>(1) What is the Ohio Safe Drinking Water Act? </p>
<p>(1) Discourage solid, infectious and hazardous waste facilities siting near shorelines and watersheds </p>

<p>Source: Coast Alliance, State of the Coasts: A State-By-State Analysis of the Vital Link Between 
Healthy Coasts and a Healthy Economy, 215 Pennsylvania Ave., SE, Washington, D.C. 20003. 
202/546-9554 </p>
<p>Physical Setting Ohio&#146;s coastal area covers 3,774 square miles bordering Lake Erie. </p>
<p>Ohio&#146;s Economy Depends on Clean Lake Water. Ohio&#146;s tourism and fishing industries are 
dependent upon clean water. According to a 1993 Sierra Club report, the Ohio Department of 
Development calculates that the Lake Erie recreation industry alone generates $8.5 billion per year 
and supports both directly and indirectly 152,080 jobs. </p>
<p>Three lakeshore counties - Erie, Lorain, and Ottawa - attract six to eight million visitors annually, an 
influx that generates $200 million per year. The Perry&#146;s Victory National Park alone has 186,172 
visitors annually, generating over $2 million in revenue. </p>
<p>According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Ohio commercial 
fishermen landed 3,438,000 pounds of fish, worth well over one million dollars, in 1988. </p>
<p>Recreational fishermen had bountiful catches, as well. A 1991 survey by the Department of Interior 
revealed that Ohio sport fishing has grown into a $862 million industry that provides 29,000 jobs. </p>
<p>All these fishermen need licenses, so it&#146;s not surprising that revenue from fishing licenses alone 
brought in $12 million, and registered boats in the state number 383,000. In fact, sales tax on all 
those goods brought by fishermen totals $49 million. </p>
<p>The fishing and tourism industries are completely dependent upon clean and healthy waters. 
Pollution leads to swimming advisories and fishing prohibitions. When the public perceives that the 
waters are not clean enough to be enjoyed, and the fish are not healthy enough to eat, tourism to 
Lake Erie&#146;s shore is dramatically affected. </p>
<p>The Ohio shipping industry also benefits form clean water. Ohio boasts four of the 10 busiest Great 
Lakes ports: Toledo, Cleveland, Lorain, and Ashtabula. A recent University of Toledo study 
showed that port-related activities generated 5,000 jobs and a $100 million payroll in the area. </p>
<p>But dredging costs in all four of these ports are dramatically affected by the additional expense of 
handling contaminated sediments. Pollution in water inevitably makes its way to the lakebottom, 
creating a human and ecological health problem and a threat to commerce. The dredging and 
disposal of contaminated sediments is and issue facing many of the Great Lake&#146;s ports, and many 
agree that pollution prevention is the best means of addressing this contentious issue. </p>
<p>Environmental Regulations Do Not Stop Development </p>
<p>Seventy-five percent of the Ohio shoreline is developed and that trend is expected to continue. A 
lot of that development took place in the years directly following Earth Day 1970 and the 
regulations that it prompted. According to NOAA, from 1970-1989, more than 206,000 
residential units were built in the coastal counties, and 14,492 retail, hotel, industrial and 
recreational buildings went up. </p>
<p>There are several hot spots of growth among Ohio&#146;s coastal counties. Cuyahoga, Lucas, Lake and 
Lorain counties are being developed most quickly. Obviously, regulations designed to protect 
water quality and habitat have not prohibited coastal development, as is often alleged. This puts to 
rest the myth that environmental management stops development or &quot;takes&quot; private property. </p>

Department of Interior; &quot;Clean Lakes, Clean Jobs,&quot; Sierra Club, 1993; &quot;Fisheries of the United 
States 1988&quot;, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. </p>
<p><strong>Population Pressures Threaten the Ohio Coast </strong></p>
<p>Ohio&#146;s coastal area has a population of 2,736,000, or 8,892 people per square mile. This is 25 
percent of the state&#146;s total population. In 1988, 8,892 people per mile lived along Ohio&#146;s coast. 
That number is expected to increase to 9,006 by the year 2010. This increase in coastal population 
will place additional pressures on the state&#146;s lands and water - areas that are already stressed from 
current uses. </p>
<p><strong>Great Lakes Pollution Threatens Ohio&#146;s Economy </strong></p>
<p>According to Ohio&#146;s 1992 Water Quality Report to the EPA, 236 miles of Ohio shore are only 
partially supporting of aquatic life, meaning that at times the water quality fails to meet designated 
use criteria. Metals, organics and low dissolved oxygen are the major causes of impairment. </p>
<p>Sediment contamination will raise dredging costs for Ohio ports unless measures are taken to 
prevent pollution. Runoff and contaminated sediments poison the fish that support the state&#146;s $862 
million sport fishing industry. Without a doubt, the coastal tourism and shipping industries will falter 
if they are unable to boast clean, healthy waters. </p>
<p><strong>Ohio&#146;s Shores Need Coastal Management </strong></p>
<p>Ohio has recognized the need to protect its coastal zone and is currently developing a Coastal Zone 
Management Plan which will make it eligible for federal funds needed to implement its coastal 
management measures. If its coastal zone plan is approved, the state will also develop a Coastal 
Nonpoint Pollution Control Program, dubbed &quot;Section 6217,&quot; which holds promise for the future. </p>
<p>But time is running out on both the CZMA and Section 6217 programs. The laws expire this year 
unless Congress continues them. [CZMA was reauthorized for three years.] </p>
<p>It is up to Congress to determine if protecting and restoring Ohio&#146;s Great Lakes coast is important 
enough to stay the course with these programs. At a time when Ohio has recognized the need for 
additional coastal management measures, it is important that the federal government provide the 
leadership needed to protect the Coastal Zone Management Act. The decision will directly impact 
the state&#146;s economy &#150; and its coasts. </p>

<p>Dear CANOE members,</p>
<p>As if Tinker's Creek wasn't insult enough, today we had to file comments to oppose a 404 permit 
by Martin Marietta to move Indian Creek in Butler County so that the company could enlarge their 
gravel mining operation!! This trendis outrageous. I thought you would find the comments we filed 
today to be of interest.</p>
<p>Stay tuned....</p>
<p>November 22, 1996</p>
<p>Lee Anne Devine, CEORL-OP-FN</p>
<p>U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Louisville District</p>
<p>P. O. Box 59</p>
<p>Louisville, KY 40201-0059</p>
<p>Dear Ms. Devine:</p>
<p>We are writing regarding Public Notice Number 199601200 to register in the strongest way 
possible our complete opposition to this absurd idea to move a creek for the sake of a gravel 
mining operation. Nothing could be further from the intent of the federal Clean Water Act and 
therefore in more direct violation of federal law.</p>
<p>At the outset, we must also note that our comments would be more extensive if we had more time 
to prepare them. Despite several change of address notices, your office still sent the public notice to 
our old address. As a result, we did not even receive the notice until this week. With that <br>
said, we would like to offer a couple of points for consideration.</p>
<p>This proposal to actually move 1200 feet of Indian Creek, at the mouth of the waterway, seriously 
undermines the public interest. The &#147;benefits&#148; of this hair-brained scheme do not in any way begin 
to approach the devastating effects. Detrimental effects include:</p>
<p>&#183; This proposal is antithetical to the premise of conservation and assumesthat Indian Creek is 
nothing more than a movable sewer.</p>
<p>&#183; The aesthetic values of this stream would be totally destroyed by channelizing and putting in the 
eyesore that is riprap.</p>
<p>&#183; The economic detriments of loss of habitat, increased sedimentation and erosion costs to the 
creek and the Great Miami River and downstream water treatment concerns far outweigh the 
temporary economic benefits of one greedy company.</p>
<p>&#183; How do you place an historic value on a natural stream channel constructed by nature? What 
possible justification do we as humans have to play God?</p>
<p>&#183; Impacts to fish and wildlife would be enormous. The new stream channel being proposed is a 
simple ditch that would destroy aquatic habitat and produce devastating effects downstream.</p>
<p>&#183; This new stream channel would increase flood damage. By straightening the channel, flow would 
be increased, erosion would accelerate and any flood waters would surge through this opening into 
the Great Miami River with devastating results.</p>
<p>&#183; This whole project turns the whole concept of responsible land use on its head. There is no 
justification to move a natural stream channel purely for the economic gain of one private entity.</p>
<p>&#183; There is no benefit to navigation from this project.</p>
<p>&#183; Recreational detriments are numerous.</p>
<p>&#183; Increased sedimentation and erosion from this project will increase water supply treatment costs.</p>
<p>&#183; Water quality would be needlessly devastated.</p>
<p>&#183; There is no energy need benefit.</p>
<p>&#183; Safety concerns would soar. The new channel would be unstable and flood damage would 
increase.</p>
<p>&#183; This project does nothing for the overall needs and welfare of the people.</p>
<p>Overall, granting a 404 permit for this project would directly contradict the federal Clean Water 
Act. We urge the Corps to hold public hearings on this matter and ultimately to reject this absurd 
proposal. Our organization will not hesitate to fight this proposal with every resource at our 
disposal.</p>
<p>We respectfully ask the Army Corps of Engineers to deny this permit.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Todd L. Ambs</p>
<p>Executive Director</p>

<H2>Nuclear Power Deception</H2>
</CENTER>
<P><BR>
 </P>
<P>&quot;I am sure we are agreed that the ultimate survival
of America</P>
<P>is dependent on intellectual vigor and on spiritual
deeprooting --</P>
<P>not on specific devices which are always for the moment.
The</P>
<P>atom has no ethics of its own any more than it has
politics. The</P>
<P>future of the scientists' America, and yours and mine,
lies</P>
<P>fundamentally with education -- that which is taught to
the young </P>
<P>in our schools -- that which is taught throughout life in
the media</P>
<P>of general communication by the contemporary writers.
Funda-</P>
<P>mental are respect and zeal for scholarship, a lively
regard for</P>
<P>moral values, and a love of truth. And of these the last
is, of</P>
<P>course, the greatest.&quot;</P>
<P>-- Lewis Strauss, AEC Chairman, 1954</P>
<HR>
<P>Society must face the harsh realities of an
environment and a way of life which is threatened by the
products and wastes of its own ingenuity. Technology alone
cannot tell what a quality of life is, nor can it provide
that life. It cannot tell what a just society is, nor can it
produce such a society apart from the insight and commitment
of those within it who value the life of people and the
environment. Personal choices, group choices, religious
influences, cultural factors including educational choices
all can affect societal quality.</P>
<P>A technology that is imposed upon a people, particularly
that which also imposes a waste of enormous toxic qualities
must awaken to the truth of its deeds. For example, of the
six disposal sites that have accepted low-level radioactive
wastes in the past or are currently accepting waste, all six
are leaking radioactivity to the environment. The six sites
are: Beatty, NV; Richland, WA; Barnwell, SC; West Valley, NY;
Maxey Flats, KY; and Sheffield, IL. The question can and
should be raised about the whole process of radioactive waste
disposal -- whether it is the disposal method, the
containment method, the siting process, the level of
radioactivity, or the licensing process. And then there is an
issue which has been kept until an appropriate time to go
public, i.e., the intent to press into effect an array of
&quot;Inherently Safe&quot; Reactors -- commercial nuclear
power's second generation of reactors -- before the public
becomes aware of the truth. Threats of varying levels of
energy shortage will be used as a promotion of revamped
reactors and new reactor systems regardless of the question
of safety and the nuclear waste disposal problems.</P>
<P>According to Thomas B. Johansson et al,* &quot;It will
not be possible to provide the energy needed to bring a
decent standard of living to the world's poor or to sustain
the economic well-being of the industrialized countries in
environmentally acceptable ways, if the present energy course
continues. The path to a sustainable society requires more
efficient energy use and a shift to a variety of renewable
energy sources.&quot; </P>
<P>Any society acquiring a technology should have the
democratic possibility to say yes or no, and should take on
the responsibility to think through its consequences and to
make the judgment as to whether it will really enhance life
for all people in the society. Simultaneously the full truth
about the technology should be revealed to the people as they
make their decision. This is the only way to have and
maintain an ethical and democratic society.</P>

A SITE FORSTORAGE OR DISPOSAL OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM
OUTSIDE THESTATE OF OHIO, INCLUDING WASTES WHOSE
RADIOACTIVITY IS PRODUCED AND USED OUTSIDE OF OHIO.Paragraph
(B). IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO A HEALTHFUL
AND SAFE ENVIRONMENT FREE FROM RADIOACTIVE CONTAMINATION, IT
IS THE POLICY OF THE STATE OF OHIO THAT RADIOACTIVE WASTES
MUST BE SAFELY STORED AND DISPOSED OF IN </B></P>
<P><B>SUCH A MANNER AS TO PREVENT ANY CONTAMINATION OF AIR,
SOIL OR </B></P>
<P><B>WATER.Paragraph (C). RADIOACTIVE WASTES RESULTING FROM
MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS OR TREATMENT OR BIOLOGICAL OR EARTH SCIENCE
RESEARCH ACTIVITIES CONDUCTED WITHIN OHIO MAY BE STORED
INLICENSED DISPOSAL FACILITIES WHICH OHIO HAS THE AUTHORITY
TO REGULATE AND WHICH COMPLY WITH PARAGRAPH B OF
THISAMENDMENT.Paragraph (D). THE FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR
STORING AND DISPOSING OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES SHALL REMAIN WITH
THE GENERATORS OF THE WASTES.Paragraph (E). IN THE EVENT THAT
ANY PROVISION OF THIS </B></P>
<P><B>AMENDMENT IS DECLARED BY A COURT TO BE INVALID, SUCH

<HR>
<P><B>SUMMARY</B></P>
<P>The proposed amendment to the constitution would prohibit
any facility within the state </P>
<P>that receives radioactivewastes created in another state.
The proposed amendment would </P>
<P>allow facilities within the state that manage radioactive
wastes resulting from medical </P>
<P>diagnosis or treatment or from biological or earth
science research conducted within Ohio, </P>
<P>provided that the facilities are licensed and regulated
by the state and are designed to </P>
<P>prevent contamination of the environment. The amendment
also would require that the </P>
<P>financial responsibility for radioactive wastes managed
within the state could not be </P>
<P>transferred from those persons who generated the wastes
to other persons. Each provision </P>
<P>of the amendment is severable from the others, so that if
any one part is rescinded</P>

<P>*These States are currently host States or are
former host States to a commercial low-level radioactive
waste disposal facility.</P>
<HR>
<P>Approximately two million shipments classified as
radioactive materials are made each year. Of this amount only
a small fraction is classified as low-level radioactive waste
(Note that commercial low-level radioactive waste would be an
even smaller fraction. Garcia does not separate commercial
shipments from Department of Energy shipments.).</P>
<P>Of the 53 transportation accidents listed by Garcia, only
four involved the release of radioactive waste (for example,
a package opening). Out of a total of 48 packages in those
four shipments, 22 were damaged severely enough to release
some of the contents. All of these packages were Type A
packages designed for transport conditions, not accident
conditions.</P>
<P>However, in another report, the US Department of
Transportation, Radioactive Incident Reports, 62 radioactive
accidents for Ohio alone were recorded between 1971 and 1995;
the total for the United States was 1629 accidents during the
same years. The total for Ohio includes accidents, spills,
leaks, and theft. Of the 62 accidents in Ohio, at least 22
resulted in release and 7 were theft.</P>

<p>In the spirit of Thanksgiving, on Saturday, November 16, citizens will gather at Settler's Landing 
Park on the Cuyahoga River in downtown Cleveland to offer thanks for the life-giving benefits of 
clean water and to appeal for strengthening Ohio's Great Lakes Water Quality Rules. Ohio EPA is 
in the process of drafting rules for the implementation of the Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative. 
The rally will encourage stateofficials &quot;to take the high road&quot; and enact strong protections for <br>
human health. Sponsors of the rally are Ohio Citizen Action, Rivers Unlimited, Friends of the 
Crooked River, Ohio Environmental Council and others. The purpose of the rally is to attract 
media attention, and generate community support for stronger laws to regulate dumping into the 
Great Lakes. </p>
<p>Canoeists will arrive at the park by way of the old river channel. Pedestrians will arrive via the new 
RTA Waterfront rapid-transit line. Both walkers and paddlers are needed. Paddlers must have 
their own boats and be experienced. </p>
<p>For more information about the rally contact Elaine Marsh at 216/657-2055 [work] or 
330/666-4026 [home].</p>

<p>President Clinton recently signed a bill that is designed to safeguard all of America's waterways 
from non-native species. The bill expands upon existing rules that already prohibit foreign ships 
from releasing ballast waters in the Great Lakes.</p>
<p>The &quot;National Invasive Species Act of 1996&quot; was introduced to protect American waters from 
foreign invaders. Lake Erie and its wetlands have been highly impacted by alien species, including 
zebra muscles, purple loosestrife and &quot;elephant grass.&quot; Invasive alien species, which can obliterate 
sensitive indigenous plant and animal life, have had a devastating effect on biodiversity in many 
areas of the Great Lakes. </p>
<p>For more information about the effects of alien species and what you can do, contact Ohio Sea 
Grant at 216/350-2582.</p>

<p>In late September, Congress designated the Ohio &amp; Erie Canal corridor in northeast Ohio as a 
National Heritage Corridor. Early this week, the City of Barberton, a southern suburb of Akron, 
announced plans for its portion of this 87 mile federal corridor. The city's plan calls for improved 
trails,new visitor facilities, historic interpretative amenities and a new bike route. The City will seek 
federal, state and private funds to cover the $3.5 million price tag.</p>
<p>For information on other developments along the Ohio &amp; Erie Canal, contact Dan Rice, Executive 
Director of the Ohio &amp; Erie Canal Corridor Coalition at 330/434-5657.</p>
<p>The CANOE system is a project of Rivers Unlimited, made possible by generous funding from the 
Storer Foundation and Recreational Equipment, Inc. (REI)</p>

<h3 align=center><strong>RIVERS UNLIMITED NAMES NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR</strong></h3>
<p>Rivers Unlimited, the nation&#146;s oldest statewide river protection group, today named Jeff Skelding to 
serve as executive director of the organization. Skelding will replace Todd Ambs who resigned to 
move to Madison, Wisconsin at the end of this month.</p>
<p>&#147;We are delighted to have someone of Jeff&#146;s experience and ability,&#148; said Rivers Unlimited 
President Mike Fremont. Todd has done an excellent job putting the organization in a position to 
lead the effort to protect Ohio&#146;s waterways. Jeff will be able to carry that momentum forward into 
the new year and beyond.&#148;</p>
<p>Skelding has spent a decade working on environmental and conservation issues for a variety of 
groups in New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Currently, Jeff is state program coordinator of the 
Ohio Chapter of the Sierra Club. Before that, he worked as communications coordinator for the 
Coalition for Sustainable Agriculture in Castile, N.Y. Prior to that, Skelding worked as program 
director for Pennsylvania Citizen Action and the Citizens Campaign for the Environment in Albany, 
N.Y.</p>
<p>Skelding said he was enthusiastic about the opportunity to work on behalf of Ohio&#146;s rivers and 
streams. &#147;I look forward to working with the Rivers Unlimited board and members as we battle to 
protect our natural rivers and streams. As an avid fly fisherman, I am particularly aware of the need 
for clean, healthy waterways,&#148; Skelding said.</p>
<p>Jeff has an MA in environmental communications from Antioch/New England Graduate School and 
a bachelor&#146;s degree from New England College in New Hampshire. He will start in his position on 
January 13 of next year. </p>
<p>Rivers Unlimited was founded in 1972. The organization has worked on over100 projects in 38 
counties in Ohio. Current projects include generating support for a statewide greenways initiative, 
writing to double the number of scenic rivers in Ohio by the year 2000 and fighting to invalidate the 
state antidegradation statute that will allow increased pollution in over 95% of Ohio&#146;s waterways 
with no requirement for public hearings or testimony. </p>

<p>The Community has a Right-to-Know More about Toxic Pollution</p>
<p>By Andrea Askowitz</p>
<p>Ohio's very own Congress member, Representative Michael Oxley (R-4), among others, is bowing 
to polluter pressure in his attempt to block the public's right to know about toxic emissions. Rep. 
Oxley, of District 4, also home to British Petroleum which is ranked number one for toxic releases 
via underground injection, recently signed on to a letter urging President Clinton to keep the 
polluting practices of the oil and gas exploration and production industry hidden from the public.</p>
<p>Seventy-eight percent of Americans believe they have a right to know about toxic pollution in their 
communities, even if the cost is passed on to the consumer reveals a nationalsurvey taken by Peter 
D. Hart Research Associates&#160;and Research&#160;Strategy Management&#160;Inc. The administration, 
environmentalists and many industry leaders claim that the Community Right to Know Act provides 
the best source of public information about toxic pollution and is one of the best environmental 
protection laws on the books.</p>
<p>The Community Right to Know Act, passed in 1986, requires large manufacturing companies to 
track and report emissions of 343 toxic chemicals known or reasonably expected to cause acute or 
chronic health effects or environmental degradation. The EPA posts reports of a company's toxic 
emissions into water, land, air and off site transfers on a national on-line database called the Toxics 
Release Inventory. </p>
<p>By publicly exposing a facility's emissions, the Community Right to Know Act gives local 
community members and activists powerful information to pressure industry and has encouraged 
some companies to clean up their acts by lowering emissions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Right-to-Know Act is currently limited and does not give the full pollution 
picture. More than 72,000 chemicals are on the market today, many of which may cause cancer, 
birth defects and the deterioration of the earth. Surprisingly, the public receives information about 
fewer than 1 percent of these toxics. Non-manufacturing facilities, many of which are major sources 
of toxic emissions, have been left out of the Right-to-Know reporting program. Also, chemical use 
within a facility and transportation of chemicals through a community are still carried out <br>
behind the public curtain.</p>
<p>Close examination of operating procedures shows that real pollution prevention is not happening. 
Instead of retooling and discontinuing the use of toxic chemicals, many companies simply alter the 
chemical properties of the toxics flowing out of smoke stacks or water pipes. The altered chemicals 
are no longer subject to TRI reporting lending the appearance of lowered emissions while blinding 
the public to the danger and quantity of releases of the altered chemicals.</p>
<p>Chemicals might also be transferred into products. Currently, consumers have no way of knowing 
the potential risks of toxic products they bring into their homes, such as children's toys made of 
plastics that may leech onto skin, or adhesives under carpets that may release harmful vapors that 
are then inhaled.</p>
<p>The Community Right to Know Act tells us that while toxic emissions to air and water may have 
decreased nationally, other types of toxic waste have increased by 5 percent. This is another great 
indication that pollution is not being prevented. Contrarily, in Massachusetts and New Jersey, 
where state law requires that information about toxic use be tracked and reported, waste has been 
reduced by 14 percent.</p>
<p>Even in the face of overwhelming public support and undeniable evidence of its worth, 
Right-to-Know is under constant political strain to survive and expand. Thechemical and 
manufacturing industries have launched a multi-million dollar lobby and media campaign to diminish 
the Right-to-Know Act. The most recent assault on Right-to-Know came up in the House 
Appropriations bill which attempted to axe $1.5 million from the EPA for Right-to-Know 
expansion and existing programs. An amendment to retain funding for Right-to-Know won by a 
voice vote. Of course citizens can not expect profit-motivated industry to put health and the 
environment first, but they can expect and demand that of their law makers.</p>
<p>Congress must not be bought by special interest polluters. Instead, Congress needs to support 
legislation to expand the Right-to-Know. Citizens have a right to know what toxics are used and 
produced in their neighborhoods, what chemicals are in the products they bring into their homes 
and what polluters are emitting toxic chemicals in their communities.</p>
<p>Call your Congress Members and urge them to support legislation to expand Right-to-Know to 
include toxics use reporting. Senate Switchboard (202) 224-3121; House Switchboard (202) 
225-3121.For more information contact Ohio PIRG at 791-1116.</p>

<p><a name="OHIO EPA FAVORS PARKING LOT OVER WATERWAY"><strong>OHIO EPA FAVORS PARKING LOT OVER WATERWAY</strong></a></p>
<p>In a devastating decision for the future of waterways in Ohio, the Ohio EPA last week approved a 
proposal for a developer to move 1000 feet of Tinker's Creek in Twinsburg. The developer plans 
to put in a parking lot for a strip mall where this natural stream corridor now exists. Rivers 
Unlimited, the Tinker's Creek Land Conservancy and a host of other organizations all testified in 
opposition to this hair-brained scheme, but Ohio EPA Director Don Schregardus decided that a 
parking lot for a strip mall was more important than the wishes of the overwhelming majority of 
people in the area or the health of the waterway. The organizations involved in the fight to stop the 
project are considering an appeal of the decision to the Environmental Board of Review.<br>
</p>
<p>The CANOE system is a project of Rivers Unlimited, made possible by generous<br>
funding from the Storer Foundation and Recreational Equipment, Inc. (REI).<br>

<title>Affinity - Mustard Seed Market & Cafe Expand</title>
</head>

<body>

<h2 align="center"><font size="2">Mustard Seed Market &amp; Cafe
Expand</font></h2>

<p><font size="2">Months of anticipation will soon be over when a
locally owned business becomes one of the largest natural food
stores in the nation. Long recognized as one of the best natural
food retailers in the country, Mustard Seed Market &amp; Cafe has
now expanded by 3 1/2 times its previous size.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Our growth has been so incredible that we
reached the point where our customers virtually demanded that we
expand,&quot; says Phillip Nabors, who co-owns the store with his
wife, Margaret. &quot;When we started this business, we could not
find many items that met our standards, now we offer an entire
supermarket full of them. It&#146;s a celebration of
purity,&quot; said Margaret Nabors.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">And Mustard Seed&#146;s standards are strict
indeed. All foods sold in the store and served in the Cafe are
free from unwanted food additives. They are free from unwanted
chemical additives, harmful chemical preservatives, artificial
flavorings and colorings, growth hormones (meat and poultry),
animal testing, saccharin or aspartame and irradiation.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Of course, all the special products and
services that have made Mustard Seed market so popular are still
there, only more so. There is an even larger selection of
organically grown produce, in fact, it&#146;s Ohio&#146;s
largest. There is a complete juice bar serving both fruit and
vegetable juices. The meat department where all meats are
naturally raised and free of growth hormones, has also been
expanded. There is also a fascinating selection of organic wines.
There are more natural health care products and other
health-oriented goods than ever before.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Not only will customers benefit, but so do
local and organic farmers. One of the store&#146;s primary
philosophies is the support of sustainable agriculture. Organic
farming is the most familiar form of sustainable agriculture. It
includes such practices as crop rotation, organic fertilization
and biological pest control. This form of farming is considered
&quot;sustainable&quot; because it can be practiced continuously
without causing damage to the environment.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Now that the current expansion is complete, the
store is now the largest natural-foods retailer in the state of
Ohio. In fact, it is matched by only a few stores in the entire
United States. For more nformation call Margaret Nabors at (330)
666-7333.</font></p>

<h3 align=center>PCB Exposure Linked to Low IQs</h3>
<h5 align=center>By Peter Montague, National Writters union, UAW Local 1981/AFL-CIO</h5>
<p>A study published last week confirms that children exposed to low levels of PCBs in the womb 
grow up with low IQs, poor reading comprehension, difficulty paying attention, and memory 
problems.[1] PCBs are a family of toxic industrial chemicals commercialized in 1929 by Monsanto, 
and now found in all humans on earth. This latest study, published in the NEW ENGLAND 
JOURNAL OF MEDICINE, describes a group of children--now 11 years old --whose mothers 
ate PCB-contaminated fish from Lake Michigan more than once a week for several years before 
giving birth. The children's mental, physical, and emotional growth has been followed since birth. 
The mental deficits are most obvious in the 11% of the children with the most PCBs in their 
blood.[2]</p>
<p>Starting 15 years ago, Joseph and Sandra Jacobson, husband-and-wife psychologists at Wayne 
State University in Detroit, Michigan, looked at babies born to women who had eaten trout and 
salmon from Lake Michigan. Fish from polluted lakes, rivers, and coastal waters are a 
well-established source of PCBs and other contaminants. The Jacobsons asked several thousand 
new mothers about their fish-eating habits and studied the children of more than 200 of them. </p>
<p>The Jacobsons analyzed the PCB levels found in the bloodof each baby's umbilical cord as an 
indicator of PCB exposure before birth. At birth, they found, children who had higher exposures to 
PCBs had smaller heads and lower weights. At seven months, they tested the babies for mental 
function by showing them two identical photos for about 20 seconds. One of the photos was then 
paired with a new photo and shown to the baby again. The normal response for an infant is to 
spend more time looking at the new picture, indicating that it recognizes the familiar one. The babies 
who had the highest exposure to PCBs, however, spent as much time looking at the old photo as 
the new one, suggesting either deficits in short-term memory or attention problems.</p>
<p>When the children were four years old, they were given a battery of mental tests.[3] Again the 
highly exposed children showed memory impairments, this time in tests that asked them to recall 
progressively longer strings of words and numbers. The differences in scores between unexposed 
and the highest-exposed children, says Joseph Jacobson, &quot;would be like ten points on an IQ test. 
We're not seeing mental retardation, but we are seeing that the children are just not doing as 
well.&quot;[4] </p>
<p>The latest study, published last week, shows that these mental deficits last at least until age 11. 
These children were not living next to a toxic waste dump, and their mothers had not eaten 
PCB-laden fish every day during pregnancy. Their exposure to PCBs, while on the high side, is still 
considered to be within the range of normal background exposure levels, says Jacobson. Other 
possible causes, such as lead exposure or the mother's intake of tobacco or alcohol, were ruled 
out. (Unfortunately, maternal exposure to methyl mercury was not assessed by the Jacobsons, <br>
weakening their study.)[5] </p>
<p>Two other studies of children have found similar problems from PCB exposures. In the 
Netherlands, researchers found that 18-month-old children born to women who carried relatively 
high but still &quot;normal&quot; levels of PCBs were more likely to be neurologically &quot;nonoptimal.&quot; In fact, the 
higher their exposure to PCBs, the lower their neurological scores. In that study the mothers had 
eaten normal diets; they got their contaminants through their food and probably from water and 
air.[6]</p>
<p>In the United States, researchers at the State University of New York (SUNY) at Oswego have 
found that babies born to &quot;high fish eaters&quot;--women who in their lifetimes had eaten at least 40 
pounds of fish from Lake Ontario--tested worse on several scales than did babies born to &quot;low fish 
eaters&quot; and &quot;non-fish eaters.&quot; [7] Fish in Lake Ontario are highly contaminated with PCBs, dioxin, 
hexachlorobenzene, DDT and its breakdown product DDE, mirex, and other chemicals. </p>
<p>&quot;We looked at the kind of stuff a pediatrician assesses in a newborn,&quot; explains Edward Lonky, a 
developmental psychologist at SUNY Oswego. &quot;One of our main findings was in regard to 
habituation, which is a measure of neurological intactness. It's one of the tests we use to assess fetal 
alcohol babies, crack cocaine babies, and babies exposed to environmental contaminants. You 
shine a light through the eyelids of a lightly sleeping newborn and you get a startle response. When 
the body settles down, you repeat the light. The startle response should habituate, or diminish, over 
repeated administrations.&quot;[4] Normally an infant will show better habituation on the second day of 
testing. Lonky and his colleagues found that infants from the high-fish-eater group showed poor 
habituation responses as well as a greater number of abnormal reflexes and stress responses.</p>
<p>Such effects may not be rare. &quot;These were not people who were eating fish every day,&quot; stresses 
Linda Birnbaum of the EPA (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency). &quot;I believe the data suggest 
there are subtle changes going on in at least a portion of our population.&quot; [4] </p>
<p>The Jacobsons'latest findings have been mirrored in several animal studies,[8] and in studies of 
Taiwanese children accidentally exposed to high levels of PCBs.[9] Joseph Jacobson told the 
NEW YORK TIMES that brain damage caused by low-level exposures to PCBs was comparable 
to the damage found in children exposed to low levels of lead.[10] The difference is that lead has 
only afflicted industrial societies; PCBs have contaminated and damaged human populations of all 
kinds, including the Inuit people in the Arctic and other native groups who eat fish and fish-eating 
mammals like seals. (And, of course, the damage from PCBs is added on top of whatever brain 
damage has been done by lead, mercury, pesticides, and other chlorinated hydrocarbons.[11])</p>
<p>It has been known for some years that children are more susceptible to damage from PCBs and 
other toxics than adults are. Some of the reasons:</p>
<p>- children absorb chemicals better than adults, through their skin, their gastrointestinal tract, and 
their lungs;</p>
<p>- children --especially prior to, or shortly after, birth --have poorly-developed systems for 
detoxifying chemicals;</p>
<p>- infants get much of their nutrition from one source, mother's milk, which is rich in fat, and many 
toxins, such as PCBs are fat soluble. (Nevertheless, breast feeding remains far more beneficial to 
the child than any alternative.)</p>
<p>- children take in more calories per pound of body weight, compared to adults;</p>
<p>- children have more skin contact with the outside and household environments, compared to 
adults, and exhibit hand-to-mouth exploratory behavior.</p>
<p>These factors can add up to much greater exposures for children. For example, a nursing infant 
typically takes in 10 times as much dioxin each day as an adult does. When this is calculated on the 
basis of &quot;dioxin taken in per pound of body weight,&quot; the infant takes in 100 times as much dioxin as 
an adult.[12] </p>
<p>Between 1929 and 1989, total world production of PCBs (excluding the Soviet Union) was 3.4 
billion pounds, or about 57 million pounds per year. Even after the U.S. banned PCBs in 1976, 
world production continued at 36 million pounds per year from 1980-1984 and 22 million pounds 
per year, 1984-1989. The end of PCB production is still not in sight.[13]</p>
<p>The whereabouts of 30 percent of all PCBs (roughly a billion pounds) remains unknown. Another 
30 percent reside in landfills, in storage, or in the sediments of lakes, rivers, and estuaries. Some 30 
percent to 70 percent remain in use. The characteristics of PCBs (their stability and their solubility 
in fat) tend to move them into the oceans as time passes. Nevertheless, it is estimated that only one 
percent of all PCBs have, so far, reached the oceans.[13] Without major efforts to locate, capture, 
and destroy the one-to-two billion pounds of PCBs that are &quot;out there,&quot; future generations will 
continue to be poisoned by PCBs, at great social (and individual) cost.</p>
<p>We hear much of late about the good intentions of the Monsanto Corporation. Some of our friends 
tell us this corporation has turned over a new leaf, and is committed to behaving responsibly. If this 
is so, Monsanto could demonstrate its awakening by leading an effort to locate and destroy PCBs. 
Monsanto created (or licensed the creation of) all the PCBs in the world. This corporation could 
demonstrate its commitment to environmental sustainability by cleansing the planet of this 
brain-damaging substance, to the extent possible.</p>
<p>An obvious first step would be to undertake a comprehensive inventory of the problem, assessing 
the damage done so far and cleanup-costs, as a demonstration of good faith and serious intentions.<br>

</strong><br>
The Monday Creek Restoration Project recently received a 1996 EPA grant<br>
for $300,000 plus matching funds for 1996-98 to reduce stream bank erosion<br>
and acid mine runoff on Rock Run, a major tributary of Monday Creek. The<br>
Creek flows through Hocking and Perry Counties before draining into the<br>
Hocking River in northwest Athens County.<br>
<br>
&quot;We have a lot of work ahead of us,&quot; said Nancy Roberts, who helps to<br>
coordinate the Monday Creek Restoration Project. &quot;It will be great to see<br>
our plans finally put into action.&quot; The citizen driven project is<br>
coordinated by Rural Action, a Southeast Ohio community redevelopment<br>
organization.<br>
<br>
The Monday Creek Restoration project is a long-term effort to deal with<br>
the aftermath of dozens of abandoned underground coal mines. When material<br>
was extracted from these mines, the unused portion was typically dumped near<br>
the mine, creating what is referred to as a 'gob pile.' When water washed<br>
over these gob piles, it becomes highly acidic and once it washes into a<br>
waterway becomes a major pollutant. Monday Creek, like many streams in<br>
Southeast Ohio, have been severely impacted by this acid mine drainage.<br>
<br>
Contributing to the reclamation efforts in the grant are Rural Action,<br>
Ohio Department of Natural Resources-Division of Mines and Reclamation, USFS<br>
Wayne National Forest, Ohio University, American Electric Power, and the U.S.<br>
Bureau of Mines.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="NATIONAL RIVERS POLICY ACT "><strong>NATIONAL RIVERS POLICY ACT </strong></a><strong>GAINS MOMENTUM FROM RIVERS 
UNLIMITED</strong><br>
<br>
Movement toward developing a National Rivers Policy gained momentum this<br>
month when Rivers Unlimited founder and President Mike Fremont released a<br>
draft policy statement to the national rivers community. Fremont stated that<br>
the thrust of a national rivers policy would be based on the understanding<br>
that natural river systems have significant economic value, in addition to<br>
the cultural and environmental benefits they provide.<br>
<br>
Very few rivers in the U. S. today provide more than a fraction of the<br>
functions that they could--high quality drinking water, a full range of<br>
recreational uses, a diverse collection of aquatic species, enhanced property<br>
values and thus tax base, and attractive park corridors that attract<br>
tourists, to name a few. Fremont stated that the National Wild and Scenic<br>
Rivers Act, protecting only one out of every 350 river miles in the country,<br>
is symbolic rather than consequential.<br>
<br>
&quot;The prospect of a national rivers policy could inspire support of river<br>
protection groups, environmental organizations, and many of the millions of<br>
Americans who fish,&quot; said Fremont. &quot;A national policy would permit Congress<br>
to legally recognize the practical values of rivers and enact laws<br>
accordingly.&quot;<br>

Athens, Ohio, is sponsoring a seminar about Ohio Wetlands on October 5 at<br>
Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio. The event, which is<br>
co-sponsored by Rivers Unlimited, will cover the values and functions of<br>
wetlands, a history of wetlands in Ohio, and a specific campaign to save an<br>
urban tract of wetlands in Toledo.<br>

<p>Rivers Unlimited joined a grassroots alliance of local residents,neighborhood organizations, and 
environmentalists to influence the plan for developing of the riverfront in downtown Columbus. The 
alliance, called the Urban Oasis Coalition, formed in response to the Riverfront Commons 
Corporation's project to redevelop six miles of the Olentangy River corridor from Ohio State 
University to south of downtown at Rt. 104.</p>
<p>Members of the coalition participated in the first of three Riverfront Forums this Tuesday, and 
requested that the City of Columbus do the following:</p>
<p>* Retain all public parks and natural areas and convert additional city properties to these uses;</p>
<p>* Complete the low impact recreational trail system along the river corridor;</p>
<p>* Create a 'Capital Park for the Capital City' on the Whittier Peninsula, with 1000 foot setbacks.</p>
<p>The Riverfront Commons Corporation is the non-profit group spearheading riverfront planning for 
the City of Columbus. One piece of the redevelopment already underway includes construction of a 
controversial floodwall around the Franklinton neighborhood, which is designed to allow further 
development in the area. Rivers Unlimited is urging the planners to enact 300 foot setbacks along 
the entire 6-mile length, and to protect the designated uses of the Olentangy for fishing and 
swimming.</p>

<p>Rivers Unlimited received word yesterday that the Nord Family Foundation in Lorain has approved 
a grant request of $30,000 to help fund its statewide greenways initiative. This grant will 
complement funding received earlier this year from the George Gund Foundation that allowed 
Rivers Unlimited to hire a Greenways Coordinator to generate momentum for theproject.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Greenways Initiative was kicked off in early 1996 and has four goals:</p>
<p>* Complete a report that details the economics of greenways in Ohio; </p>
<p>* Collect case studies where greenways have been successfully developed in Ohio;</p>
<p>* Convene a statewide conference on greenways in 1997 to mobilize support for a statewide 
initiative;</p>
<p>* Create an Ohio Greenways Blueprint for Action that recommends a course of action.</p>
<p>This grant from the Nord Family Foundation's assures that the project will successfully accomplish 
its goals.</p>

<p>After several years of debate, the Apple Grove Pulp and Paper Co. received its final permit this 
summer to build an integrated pulp and paper complex near the community of Apple Grove, WV. 
The town is situated near the banks of the Ohio River, 25 miles south and across the river from 
Gallipolis, OH. The Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition and the Buckeye Forest Council both 
filed appeals to contest inadequacies of the permit, including the failure of the West Virginia Office 
of Air Quality to adequately protect public health, wildlife, and forests.</p>
<p>The Mill, which would be situated on farmland along the Ohio River, is permitted to emit toxic 
chemicals such as dioxins and furans, both of which are known cancer-causing chemicals. Although 
other companies in the U.S. use methods other than chlorine to whiten wood fiber, the technology 
used by the mill relies on chlorine bleaching. Discharges into the river could further degrade the 
already highly polluted Ohio River, upon which millions of people rely for drinking water.</p>
<p>Labor unions, area citizens, and environmental advocates have raised concerns that the plant has 
made no commitments to providing quality jobs to local workers, and that it uses outdated, 
dioxin-producing technology.</p>

<p>The Cuyahoga River Remedial Action Plan (RAP) conducted a $105,000 study of the cost and 
methodology of reaerating the 5.6 mile navigation channel. This waterway is dredged to a depth of 
27 feet and has a number of problems. In 1991, the Stage One Report of the RAP identified 
several difficult issues in the navigation channel, including combined sewer overflows, habitat 
obliteration, industrial discharges and contaminated sediment which is constantly stirred up by ship 
passage. However, the report identified the altered hydrology as the primary dissolved oxygen 
problem. Without sufficient dissolved oxygen, migrating fish cannot survive the waterway. This 
situation hinders healthy fish populations both in the River and in Lake Erie. The RAP called for the 
reaeration study when Ohio EPA established a fish passage Use Designation.</p>
<p>The study reviews several strategies to increase the dissolved oxygen, including artificial waterfalls 
and bubblers. The capital investment for the three strategies outlined in the report range from $8 
million to $30 million. The annual operating costs are estimated at between $203,000 and 
$450,000. But given the costs and the fact that there are no identified funding sources, 
implementing the study may be difficult. One important cost not quoted in the study is the $2-$3 
million dollars taxpayers currently spend each year to dredge the navigation channel. </p>
<p>Reaerating the Navigation Channel is extremely Good News for the Cuyahoga River and for 
fisheries in all of Ohio&#146;s water. The study will be released at a public meeting on December 11, at 4 
PM at the Cleveland City Club, 850 Euclid Ave. State the case for Ohio&#146;s fish! Attend the meeting.

</a>PROTECTION FROM NEW INDEX DEVELOPED FOR RIPARIAN 
CORRIDOR STUDY. </h3>
<p>ACRT, Inc., an engineering firm in Cuyahoga Falls, recently released a riparian study of Tinkers 
Creek commissioned by the City of Twinsburgh. The firm developed a new methodology to 
identify and prioritize the land-based natural resources in the study area. The methodology, called 
the Index of Environmental Integrity, collects and interprets data gathered from studying the botany, 
soils and current development. Used in combination with existing indices, including various habitat 
evaluation models, this method will be a valuable tool in providing scientific basis for defining 
criteria for floodway zoning. What this may mean is that consistently applied zoning based on this 
model could stand its own ground in landuse conflicts. It could be just the help that municipalities 
need to protect river corridor.</p>
<p>For more information, contact Karen Wise at ACRT, Inc. 330 945-7500. </p>
<p>P.S. Too bad the study area did not include the 1000 feet of Tinkers Creek that is currently 
scheduled to be moved to make room for a parking lot for a strip mall.</p>

<h3 align=center><strong>C.A.N.O.E News from Oct. 11, 1996</strong></h3>
<p><strong>STATE TURNS ITS BACK ON CLEAN WATER</strong></p>
<p>(The following is excerpted from a Rivers Unlimited press release that went<br>
out on October 1.)<br>
Thanks to a <strong>new law</strong> that went into effect today the most pristine waterways<br>
in Ohio may be subject to more pollution, Rivers Unlimited announced. High<br>
quality, scenic waters could all get further degraded despite assurances to<br>
the contrary by the Ohio EPA. This would include such Ohio treasures as the<br>
Darby Creeks in central Ohio, the Little Miami River in the Dayton area, the<br>
Chagrin River near Cleveland and Little Beaver Creek in eastern Ohio. This<br>
new law will allow more pollutants in the 61,000 miles of rivers and streams<br>
in Ohio. It is going into effect today even though none of these high quality rivers have been 
classified under the rules for the new system. Furthermore, thanks to the new statute<br>
and rules there will no longer be any requirement for public hearings for<br>
most of the requests to dump more pollution into Ohio water.<br>
<br>
&#147;<strong>This is a very sad day for people who care about clean water in Ohio</strong>,&#148;<br>
Rivers Unlimited President Mike Fremont said. &#147;We already knew that these<br>
rules stole the public&#146;s right to have a voice in most decisions to increase<br>
pollutants into the water they drink. Unfortunately, we have just learned<br>
that Ohio EPA is moving forward with this plan despite the fact that they<br>
have not yet created the water classifications needed to protect our most<br>
pristine waterways. Every scenic river in Ohio could get trashed because<br>
Ohio EPA is rushing this process before any of these rivers have been<br>
classified under the rules for the new system,&#148; Fremont continued.<br>
<br>
Under the new law and rules, known as the antidegradation law, all of the<br>
waterways in Ohio will be reclassified into six categories. Approximately<br>
95% of the waterways in the state will be classified into the bottom two<br>
categories -- either as general high quality waters or limited resource<br>
waters. From now on, when wastewater treatment operators or other industrial<br>
dischargers apply to dump more toxins into these waters there will no longer<br>
be any requirement for public hearings or testimony. The remaining 5% of the<br>
waterways in the state that are in the top four categories would receive<br>
additional protections, Ohio EPA has repeatedly assured the public.<br>
Unfortunately, those classifications are not yet completed. As a result,<br>
each waterway is still classified under the old system. This could subject<br>
even the ten rivers in the state scenic river system to more pollution.<br>
<br>
&#147;We are doing everything we can to stop this ill-conceived, polluters<br>
protection permitting process,&#148; stated Rivers Unlimited executive director<br>
Todd Ambs. &#147;Our lawsuit to stop this statute is still pending at the<br>
Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. We plan to demand a public hearing<br>
for every single permit application regardless of the stream category. At<br>
those hearings we will insist that a comprehensive cost benefit analysis be<br>
conducted and shared with the public.<br>
Any time there is a proposal to add more pollutants to a stream we want<br>
detailed information to justify how the benefits of more pollution will<br>
outweigh the detriments of lower water quality,&#148; Ambs concluded.	<br>

<P><A HREF="#401">Section 401 Water Quality Permit</A></P>
<P><BR>
<B><A NAME="Yellow">YELLOWSTONE SAVED FROM DISASTROUS MINING PROJECT</A></B></P>
<P>     Though the environment has been under attack by both the 104th Congress<BR>
and the White House, a landmark victory for the nation's natural resources<BR>
occurred on Monday when President Clinton rescued Yellowstone National Park<BR>
from a disastrous mining project on adjacent land.<BR>
     With the backdrop of Yellowstone Park, Clinton announced that the Crown<BR>
Butte Mining Company has agreed to abandon its mining project, slated for the<BR>
mountains next to Yellowstone Park, in exchange for other federal lands.<BR>
     The proposed mine was a threat to Yellowstone and the Clark's Fork Wild<BR>
and Scenic River because of acid mine drainage, an inevitable by-product of<BR>
hard rock mining.  Acid mine drainage lowers pH of water bodies.  This<BR>
creates an environment too acidic for life, and results in a &quot;dead&quot; waterway.<BR>
 This fate for the Clark's Fork Wild and Scenic River was narrowly averted by<BR>
the agreement.<BR>
     Rebecca Wodder, President of American Rivers said &quot;this agreement<BR>
protects natural resources treasured by the American people from the<BR>
nightmare of a large acid-generating mine in the mountains of Yellowstone.&quot;</P>
<P><BR>
<B><A NAME="Hocking">DO SAFER ROADS MEAN A COMPROMISE FOR QUALITY OF LIFE?</A></B></P>
<P>     At a public hearing on July 29, local environmental advocates from<BR>
Southeast Ohio urged the EPA to carefully consider a Section 401 Water<BR>
Quality Permit application by the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT).<BR>
 ODOT proposes to re-route 700 feet of the Hocking River and destroy 3 acres<BR>
of wetlands in order to widen Route 50 into a 4-lane highway.<BR>
     The permit is required by the federal Clean Water Act for any entity<BR>
that wishes to discharge dredged or fill material into bodies of water,<BR>
including wetlands.<BR>
     This stretch of Route 50 has a calculated fatality rate three times as<BR>
high as the state average.  Conservancy groups and citizens from the area and<BR>
across the state are supportive of the efforts to improve safety, but the<BR>
proposed project by ODOT does not work to prevent negative impacts to the<BR>
waterways that can be easily mitigated through minor changes in the proposed<BR>
plan.<BR>
     Mary Stoertz, President of the Hocking River Commission, expressed<BR>
concern about the part of ODOT's proposal to shorten the channel.  Stoertz<BR>
said that &quot;by shortening a channel, you create a hydrologically unstable<BR>
situation.&quot;  This instability causes sediment deposition which leads to<BR>
massive amounts of future dredging costs to keep the channel free from silt.<BR>
 &quot;There is a natural length of a channel that must be maintained to have a<BR>
self-maintaining system that won't cost taxpayers a fortune.&quot;<BR>
     At the public hearing, Jason Tockman of the Buckeye Forest Council<BR>
suggested that ODOT consider lifting the highway off the ground where it<BR>
crosses the rivers and creeks.  He calls this a common sense solution that<BR>
would make the road safe without jeopardizing the quality of the environment.<BR>
     The Ohio EPA is slated to make a decision on ODOT's permit sometime this<BR>
month.</P>
<P><BR>
<B><A NAME="401">NOTICES OF PUBLIC NOTICES</A></B></P>
<P>     According to the federal Clean Water Act, whenever an entity, be it<BR>
governmental or private, wishes to discharge dredged or fill material into<BR>
bodies of water, a Section 401 Water Quality Permit is required from the EPA.<BR>
     When it is determined by the Ohio EPA that a proposal would result in<BR>
the degradation of the existing water quality, as is the case with the<BR>
re-routing of the Hocking River as seen above, the Ohio EPA is required to<BR>
provide an opportunity for public comments on the proposed project.<BR>
     Weekly, Rivers Unlimited receives stacks of notices for public hearings<BR>
around the state.  We will be alerting you about public hearing opportunities<BR>
in counties around you.  <BR>
     Because of the magnitude of notices that Rivers Unlimited receives, we<BR>
will only alert you to public hearings for projects that we believe would<BR>
pose a serious threat to water quality.  If you would like a complete list of<BR>
all the public hearings, contact Rivers Unlimited at the address below.</P>

<p><a name="ENVIRONMENT WINS HALF A LOAF IN THE LEGISLATURE"><strong>ENVIRONMENT WINS HALF A LOAF IN THE LEGISLATURE</strong></a></p>
<p>On the last day of this year's legislative session, Ohio's environment won one and lost one. The 
legislature failed to pass the ill-conceived &quot;takings&quot; legislation but passed the environmental audit 
bill. Rivers Unlimited worked closely with several groups including Citizen Action, Great Lakes 
Audubon, the Ohio Environmental Council and the Sierra Club to defeat both of these proposals.</p>
<p>In the end the takings bill could not get voted off the floor of the Ohio Senate. The bill will have to 
be officially reintroduced next session. The takings legislation nearly passed despite the fact that the 
proponents of the legislation were unable to produce one single example of a regulatory taking in 
Ohio. This prompted the environmental community to label this bill a, &quot;solution deparately seeking a 
problem.&quot;</p>
<p>Unfortunately the environmental audit bill, better known as the Polluter's Protection Act, did not 
meet the same fate. This secrecy measure will nowallow companies to conduct voluntary audits of 
their facilities and shield what they find behind a cloak of immunity from civil prosecution. In 
addition all violations, including criminal violations, can be labelled privileged information and kept 
from regulators and the public. This bill is sure to be a green light for unscrupulous companies that 
want to hide their environmental misdeeds behind a wall of immunity provisions, courtesy of the 
Ohio General Assembly. The bill passed 62-29 in the House and passed on party lines in the 
Senate with all Democrats opposing the bill.</p>
<p><a name="THE ECONOMICS OF RIVER PROTECTION"><strong>THE ECONOMICS OF RIVER PROTECTION</strong></a></p>
<p>People who enjoy using rivers for canoeing, fishing, and swimming typically do not need or want an 
economic study to justify why they are worth saving--for them, rivers are priceless. However, 
public officials who must choose between many competing interests need economic information to 
make decisions. Therefore, in addition to the obvious cultural, environmental, and recreational 
benefits they provide, the economics of our rivers and watersheds provide some of our strongest 
arguments for river protection.</p>
<p>It is becoming clear that natural environments, such as natural river systems, provide many values 
and functions free of charge. For instance, greenway corridors and river floodplains soak up and 
store stormwaters and reduce flood damage. When we eliminate these natural aspects of our rivers, 
we often create additional costs downstream as a result of flooding.</p>
<p>Fortunately, state and local governments are increasingly recognizing the value of leaving natural 
river corridors intact, and of restoring them to more natural states. Their decisions are not based on 
any environmental thinking but on the economic advantages to communities fortunate enough to 
have waterways flowing through them. Communities that have preserved and restored their 
waterways benefit economically in the following ways:</p>
<p>&#183; Increased Tax Base. Waterways that are clean and have forest cover along their banks have 
higher property values than polluted, human-altered streams.This is true not only of residential lands 
but also commercial, institutional and industrial properties.</p>
<p>&#183; Recreation and Tourism. Clean, natural waterways attract visitors and recreationists of all types. 
The Little Miami Scenic Trail is used by over 200,000 people per year and the river itself by over 
100,000 canoeists. These activities bolster the local economy and provide business for restaurants, 
motels, and specialty shops.</p>
<p>&#183; Lower Costs for Drinking Water. Most mid-size and large cities spend millions of dollars each 
year to purify water for drinking and for residential and commercial use. Natural stream corridors 
act as buffers by filtering toxic pollutants, highway salt, and agricultural runoff before these reach the 
waterway, which ultimately lowers the cost of treating the water for human consumption.</p>
<p>&#183; Minimize Flood Damage. Natural river systems absorb the energy of floods in their meanders and 
marshes and floodplains when allowed to flow freely. When rivers are straightened or dammed, or 
have their adjacent wetlands filled, their natural ability to limit flooding is severely limited. Thus, 
downstream landowners suffer much greater economic losses and taxpayers often foot the bill in 
the form of bailouts and federally subsidized insurance to flood victims.</p>
<p>Recognizing there is great value to having economic information about rivers and their watersheds, 
Rivers Unlimited is commissioning an economic study of specific greenways in Ohio. Greenways 
are linear open spaces that frequently run along river corridors, and have quantifiable economic 
value. The economic study is part of a larger two-year effort to build momentum for a statewide 
greenways initiative and to secure the necessary public and private funds to protect greenways in 
Ohio.</p>
<p>Very few urban, suburban, or rural waterways are enjoying more than a fraction of their economic 
potential, which is highest when rivers are not polluted, dammed, channelized, or cleared of trees. 
When we can collectively understand not only the environmental but the economic benefits of river 
protection, we can make the strongest argument for keeping rivers &#147;unlimited.&#148;</p>

<p>Yesterday, the preliminary hearing was held for the appeal of the Ohio EPA Director's decison to 
allow a developer to move 1000 feet of Tinker's Creek in Twinsburg. As faithful readers of 
CANOE will recall, this developer has a very good reason for wanting to destroy a natural stream 
channel - he wants to build a parking lot for a strip mall. The hearing before the Environmental 
Board of Review was rather uneventful as both parties agreed to review legal documents and 
gather more information before another hearing to be set in mid-January. </p>
<p>We did learn that the Tinker's Creek project is not precedent setting. Silly us, we thought such a 
ludicrous idea as moving a natural stream corridor solely so that an individual company could make 
more money would be a nasty new precedent. It would appear however, that this is a developing 
policy within the Ohio EPA. According to Colleen Crook, in the Division of Surface Water, Ohio 
EPA has approved two other projects. In 1995, the OH EPA approved the relocation of 2,600 
feet of Buckeye Fork in Muskingum County to allow a company to mine limestone. And in 1992, a 
coal company was permitted to relocate 650 feet of Crabapple Creek in Belmont County. Now 
that we know it is a policy instead of a precedent, we feel much better!</p>

<h2 align="center"><font size="2">Environment Wins Half a Loaf in
the Legislature</font></h2>

<p><font size="2">On the last day of this year&#146;s legislative
session, Ohio&#146;s environment won one and lost one. The
legislature failed to pass the ill-conceived &quot;takings&quot;
legislation but passed the environmental audit bill. Rivers
Unlimited worked closely with several groups including Citizen
Action, Great Lakes Audubon, the Ohio Environmental Council and
the Sierra Club to defeat both of these proposals.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">In the end the takings bill could not get voted
off the floor of the Ohio Senate. The bill will have to be
officially reintroduced next session. The takings legislation
nearly passed despite the fact that the proponents of the
legislation were unable to produce one single example of a
regulatory taking in Ohio. This prompted the environmental
community to label this bill a, &quot;solution desperately
seeking a problem.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Unfortunately the environmental audit bill,
better known as the Polluter&#146;s Protection Act, did not meet
the same fate. This secrecy measure will now allow companies to
conduct voluntary audits of their facilities and shield what they
find behind a cloak of immunity from civil prosecution. In
addition all violations, including criminal violations, can be
labeled privileged information an kept from regulators and the
public. This bill is sure to be a green light for unscrupulous
companies that want to hide their environmental misdeeds behind a
wall of immunity provisions, courtesy of the Ohio General
Assembly. The bill passed 62-29 in the House and passed on party
lines in the Senate with all Democrats opposing the bill.</font></p>
