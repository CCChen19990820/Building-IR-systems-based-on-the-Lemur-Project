PREFACE
</H2>
<P>
This plan, developed in conjunction with strategic planning efforts of  the Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),  identifies priorities and charts directions for the National Sea Grant College Program for the decade 1995-2005.  It describes what Sea Grant is, where it fits among the nation's coastal and Great Lakes programs, and how it contributes to NOAA's mission.  Most important, it identifies the issues and opportunities that will require Sea Grant attention into the 21st century.
<P>
Sea Grant's legislative charge is to ³increase the understanding, assessment, development, utilization, and conservation of the nation's ocean and coastal resources by providing assistance to promote a strong education base, responsive research and training activities, and broad and prompt dissemination of knowledge and techniques.² [PL94-461, Sec. 202(b)].  Decisions must be made about what realistically can be done to promote and advance these objectives.
<P>
This document provides a framework for making these decisions.  It is the culmination of some 20 months of drafting, deliberation and revision that began in March 1994.  Throughout these months, drafts were written, reviewed by Sea Grant directors, members of the National Review Panel, National Sea Grant office staff, and executives from NOAA line organizations, including specialists from the Office of  Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (in which Sea Grant resides), and revised accordingly. 
<P>
 In August 1994, a team comprised of Sea Grant directors and National Sea Grant office staff produced a draft that was widely circulated to individual Sea Grant programs, National Review Panel members, and NOAA senior management.  Comments on this version were incorporated in a draft circulated to Sea Grant programs and provided the basis for additional deliberations during Sea Grant Week 95, held in Humacao, Puerto Rico, in May 1995.
<P>
This document incorporates recommendations made at that meeting and concludes the first stage in Sea Grant's strategic planning efforts.  Based on the framework described here, the Sea Grant community will sharpen its focus by developing more detailed implementation plans, link these to measures that assess progress, and seek the resources required to pursue these.

<A NAME="1">The National Sea Grant College Program</A>
</H3>
Congress established the National Sea Grant College Program in 1966 to hasten the development, use and conservation of the nation's marine and Great Lakes resources.  In the Findings section of the National Sea Grant College and Program Act of 1966, Congress declared that:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>"marine resources...constitute a far-reaching and largely untapped asset of immense potential significance to the United States;"
<P>
<LI>"it is in the national interest of the United States to develop the skilled manpower, including scientists, engineers and technicians, and the facilities and equipment necessary for the exploitation of these resources;"
<P>
<LI>"aquaculture...and the gainful use of marine resources can substantially benefit the United States, and ultimately the people of the world, by providing greater economic opportunities, including expanded employment and commerce, the enjoyment and use of our marine resources, new sources of food and new means for the development of marine resources," and
<P>
<LI>"federal support toward establishment, development, and operation of programs by sea grant colleges and federal support of other sea grant programs designed to achieve the gainful use of marine resources, offer the best means of promoting programs toward the goals set forth [above]."
</UL>
<P>
The legislation called for a network of sea grant colleges which would conduct education, training, and research in all fields of marine study, and directed that grants and contracts would go to "suitable public and private institutions of higher education, institutes, laboratories, and public or private agencies which are engaged in, or concerned with, activities in the various fields related to the development of marine resources." [PL 89-688 Sec.  204(c)] 
<P>
The founders' vision has been amply realized.  After nearly 30 years of federal support, (never more than $53.3 million in any one year) the Secretary of Commerce has designated 29 Sea Grant College programs in coastal and Great Lakes states and in Puerto Rico.  These programs are the heart of a nationwide network of some 300 participating institutions that each year draw on the talents of over 3,000 scientists, engineers, educators, students, and outreach specialists.  This network has provided a powerful national capability in marine resource research and outreach which did not exist prior to 1971 when the Secretary of Commerce designated the first Sea Grant Colleges. 
<P>
Notable examples of Sea Grant achievement: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Led the development of hybrid striped bass aquaculture, which has grown from a university demonstration project to a $6 million fish farming industry in just six years.  U.S.  hybrid striped bass production is expected to exceed $50 million in five years.
<P>
<LI>Using selective breeding techniques, developed new strains of salmon that grow three times faster than wild stocks.  The eggs of these fast-growing salmon are being exported to aquaculturists in Japan, Europe and Chile, creating a U.S. industry now worth more than $5 million a year.
<P>
<LI>Discovered that synthetic mimics of oyster molecules can be used to manufacture products such as detergent additives and biodegradable chemicals that reduce crystal growth in pipes, heat exchangers, and boilers.  This work has already resulted in several patents and the formation of two multi-million dollar corporations in Bedford Park, Illinois, and Pendleton, South Carolina.
<P>
<LI>Organized the first systematic effort in the U.S. to discover and develop new drugs from marine organisms.  This biotechnology effort has resulted in the discovery of more than 1,000 compounds--including at least 50 with significant potential for treating inflammatory diseases like arthritis and asthma--and the awarding of 14 patents through mid-1995.

Sea Grant plays a unique and important role in advancing the nation's interest in marine resources.  Together with the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and the National Science Foundation (NSF), Sea Grant provides the only sustained federal contact and source of funds for universities with marine research capabilities.  Moreover, Sea Grant provides the major source of research support for marine-related subjects outside biological, physical, and chemical oceanography, and marine geology and geophysics.  These include, for example, coastal and ocean engineering, fisheries science, and marine-related social sciences and law.  Where NSF and ONR have remained steadfast in their support of basic oceanographic research, Sea Grant has supported scientific research to address marine and coastal resource issues of more immediate public concern.  To ensure that programs respond to local as well as national concerns, the law requires that one-third of the program funds come from state or local governments, industry or other sources.  This has provided outstanding leverage to limited federal funds.
<P>
Sea Grant is also the only NOAA marine program with sustained, legislatively mandated responsibility for linking NOAA with university researchers and educators.  The Marine Advisory Service (MAS) provides a key link between NOAA programs and residents in coastal and Great Lakes states and in Puerto Rico.  Many Sea Grant-supported research projects, pursued in collaboration with NOAA specialists  associated with the Office of Coastal Resources Management, the Coastal Ocean Program, the National Marine Fisheries Service and the National Weather Service, contribute to a wide range of NOAA responsibilities.  These include fisheries and coastal management, aquaculture development, coastal water quality, habitat protection and restoration, marine sanctuaries and estuarine reserves management, and protection of life and property from natural hazards.  Sea Grant is strengthened to the extent that it draws on the extensive technological and scientific resources available in NOAA.  These include its forecasting and remote sensing capabilities; sophisticated environmental and resource information data bases; and access to NOAA ships, laboratories, and computing capabilities.
<P>
<HR>
<H3>
<A NAME="3">The Planning Environment</A>
</H3>
The strategic planning framework for Sea Grant assumes the persistence of the following trends over the next decade: demographic shifts; increased pressures on the coastal and marine environment; public values and expectations about the environment; globalization of the economy; technological innovation; and severe constraints on public expenditures.  
<P>
<B>Demographic Change:</B> Population growth along the nation's coastal margin will continue throughout the next decade.  Some 110 million people--nearly one-half of the total population--live in coastal areas.  Projections indicate that between 1960 and 2010, coastal population will increase from 80 to more than 127 million people, or by nearly 60 percent nationwide.  The demands these increased numbers place on the coastal environment and its resources are formidable and conflicts over its use and access inevitable.
<P>
<B>Environmental Disruptions:</B> Increased population, intensified development, and competing uses will continue to challenge the coastal environment.  The cumulative effect is to disrupt the natural processes of coastal ecosystems and to threaten the ecological, aesthetic, and economic values that attract people to the coast.  Contaminated waters, saltwater intrusions, erosion, habitat and wetlands losses, fishery declines, and shellfish bed closures are indicative of these pressures and are not likely to diminish over the next decade.
<P>
<B>Public Values and Expectations:</B> There continues to be widespread public support for environmental protection, moderated by a belief that it is possible to use natural resources and, at the same time, minimize environmental destruction and preserve resources for future generations. These attitudes become translated into support for environmental education, expectations for a balanced approach toward resource use and conservation, and expanded public access to coastal resources.
<P>
<B>Globalization of the Economy:</B> United States' support for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT) in 1994 affirmed the move to global free trade and the increasingly global nature of the economy.  The ability to compete in this expanded arena will depend significantly on the development of intellectual capital, a climate that promotes entrepreneurial innovation, and institutional flexibility to meet emerging challenges and opportunities.  	
<P>
<B>Technological Innovation:</B> Technological innovations will continue to shape emerging economic and social relationships.  The most obvious are innovations in information, biotechnology, and remote sensing technologies.  Others will emerge.  These technologies provide new tools for inquiry, product development, and management information.  Development and use of these technologies, and understanding their social, economic, and political implications will continue to challenge society.
<P>
<B>Continued Pressures on the Federal Budget:</B> Political support for ocean and coastal programs will be severely limited by fiscal and political conditions.  These include the national debt, the limited portion of the budget available for discretionary spending, a powerful political incentive to reduce public spending, and a political climate that calls for reduced government activity.  Over the next decade, significant increases in funding for coastal and ocean programs are not likely. Despite widespread public support for environmental concerns, ocean and coastal issues will remain low on the public agenda.  The limited prospects for major capital investments (laboratories, vessels, remote sensing systems), and for increased funding for ocean programs will require collaborative approaches to ensure that resources are directed toward the most pressing problems.

These broad trends provide the context for development of this plan.  They are not inclusive. Issues perceived only dimly in 1995 may well emerge to become major concerns.  The variety of issues that invite Sea Grant attention far exceed available resources.  The intent, however, has been to respond to those conditions likely to persist and to identify those areas where Sea Grant can have its greatest impact.  These are: Economic Leadership; Coastal Ecosystem Health and Public Safety; and Education and Human Resources.  Emphasis between and among these topics will necessarily change throughout the decade, depending on budgets, scientific and technological breakthroughs, new problems and opportunities, and the capabilities of the Sea Grant network.  Nonetheless, we expect that by maintaining the course charted here that:	
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The United States will be preeminent in knowledge of the marine sciences, with Sea Grant continuing to be the catalyst for understanding coastal, marine, and Great Lakes systems;
<P>
<LI>United States economic leadership will be enhanced in marine industries and products with marine species aquaculture, marine biotechnology, and environmental technology most prominent among these; 
<P>
<LI>Scientifically-sound, cost-effective, sustainable use and conservation of coastal, marine and Great Lakes resources and environments will be in place, due in part to Sea Grant; 
<P>
<LI>The United States will be preeminent in marine affairs with Sea Grant having established the cadre of technicians and professionals skilled in marine sciences, law, policy, and trades, as well as informing citizens of all ages about the marine environment and its resources;<P>	
<P>
<LI>Loss of life and coastal property will be measurably reduced through Sea Grant research, education, and outreach partnerships with other NOAA programs and government agencies.

<A NAME="1">INTRODUCTION</A>
</H2>
The nation's marine, coastal, and Great Lakes environment and natural resources are undergoing significant change resulting from influx of population, environmental degradation, diminishing resources, and increased international competition in marine products.  These factors have negative economic impacts on both coastal communities and the nation.  Leadership is required to balance economic expansion and development with the environmental health of coastal areas.
<H3>
SEA GRANT'S VISION FOR 2005 
</H3>
The National Sea Grant College Program's investment in the nation's future will stimulate a stream of scientific knowledge and new technology that will strengthen U.S. leadership in ocean and marine-related industries and enhance the social and economic well-being of coastal communities.
<H3>
SEA GRANT'S STRATEGY
</H3>
A major goal is to foster sustainable development and to improve economic competitiveness in global technologies.  The National Sea Grant College Program, through integrated research, technology transfer, and educational programs, will contribute to sustainable development of marine resources, strengthen coastal communities, assist coastal businesses, and work with high-technology industries to implement research-based  technologies.
<H3>
THE PROGRAM
</H3>
Sea Grant's efforts include three topics that will address critical needs for knowledge and improved human resource capabilities to further develop the marine sector of the national economy and to strengthen coastal community infrastructures.  These are:
<P>
<B> Advanced Technology for Commercial Products and Processes -</B> This topic involves application of advanced technologies, including biotechnology, to develop marine products and processes for medical, industrial, and environmental applications.  These will contribute directly to economic growth, improved public health, and a cleaner environment.
<P>
<B> Seafood Production -</B>  This topic provides for a research and educational enterprise that works in collaboration with industry and government to solve technological and policy problems associated with a growing demand for seafood.
<P>
<B> Coastal Economic Development -</B>  This topic is concerned with university-based programs that address needs of coastal economies and marine-related businesses, as they respond to the challenges of maintaining sustainable growth, protecting unique marine resources, and preserving the cultural assets and infrastructures of coastal communities.  A special focus will be development of technological capabilities to maintain the nation's vital but aging marine infrastructure, such as the docks, piers, bridges, and harbors that link the land to the sea.
<H3>
EXPECTED BENEFITS  
</H3>
Scientific knowledge achieves its fullest measure of value when it is applied by entrepreneurs in commercial enterprise and when it results in securing for the people the benefits from marine resource wealth. The National Sea Grant College Program's  strategies for Economic Leadership will help contribute to a robust and growing economy, sustainable coastal communities, a viable and modern marine infrastructure, healthy wholesome seafood products, and a stream of goods and services based on the development and application of advanced technologies.

OVERVIEW
<P>
What is Sea Grant's Vision for 2005?
</H3>
Sea Grant envisions that the application of advanced technologies, including biotechnology, to the development of products and processes for medical, industrial, and environmental applications will result in an expanded economy, improved public health, and a cleaner
environment.
<H3>
Relationship to Department of Commerce Goals
</H3>
In the 1992 report "Technology, the Engine for Economic Growth," specialists in economic development note that: "Leadership in developing and commercializing new technologies is critical to regaining industrial leadership, creating high-wage jobs, and ensuring our long-term prosperity. Investments in research, development, and technology are important not only to high-tech industries such as aerospace and electronics but also to basic manufacturing industries and to small businesses, which must be innovative to survive."  The Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering, and Technology puts special emphasis on marine biotechnology in two recent reports on biotechnology for the 21st century. The National Science and Technology Council, in its report "Technology for a Sustainable Future," has among its fundamental principles the forging of federal-state partnerships directed to advancing the development, commercialization, and diffusion of environmental technologies and the shortening of the time from research and development to commercialization and export of this technology.   
<P>
The Department of Commerce, in its mission statement, focuses on enhancing and ensuring economic opportunity for the American people by facilitating technological development that creates jobs; creating a base for economic growth in distressed communities; and achieving sound assessment, prediction, and stewardship of the environment and its resources. The advanced technologies proposed in this program directly address these goals.
<H3>
What are the Problems?
</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Environmental technologies and bioindustries have the potential to provide a major portion of economic development over the next 20 years. Advancements in biotechnology will be an important component of this development.  The last few years have seen enormous contributions of molecular biology and genetic engineering to modern biotechnology, to economic development, and to human well-being.  Traditional biotechnologies continue to comprise major sectors of the economy.  A very large portion of the growth potential lies in the great biodiversity of the marine environment.  The potential economic and public health benefits of pharmaceuticals, pesticides, hormones, enzymes and polymers derived from marine organisms are great, yet largely unexploited.
<P>
<LI> New environmental technologies are needed to solve major problems in effective monitoring and in pollution control and remediation.  New instrumentation technology, developments in robotics, and development of combined satellite sensing/geographic information systems (GIS) have the potential to provide cost-effective assessment and monitoring capability.
<P>
<LI>The nation faces an enormous challenge in remediating its many contaminated areas. Landfills, groundwaters, and river, lake, and coastal waters all are badly contaminated in many places. There is a strong need for the development of effective remediation technology focused on coastal and Great Lakes waters and sediments.
<P>
<LI>The nation's seafood industry, a complex enterprise composed of capture fisheries, aquaculture, seafood processing, and marketing firms, faces great constraints because of declining fisheries, expanding regulations, and increased international competition.
<P>
<LI>Consumer demand for seafood is at a record high and increasing.  The seafood industry needs innovative methods to assure safety and quality of its products and to compete in global markets.  It needs better technology to face escalating costs from waste disposal and requirements to meet increasingly stringent standards.
<P>
<LI>The United States must look to aquaculture to enhance supplies of high-quality seafood. To prosper, these businesses will need new and advanced technology.
<P>
<LI>Seafood and aquaculture industries are having difficulty complying with regulations that threaten the viability and hinder the expansion of existing seafood processing and aquaculture firms and that inhibit establishment of new businesses. 
<P>
<LI>Traditional coastal industries of manufacturing, commercial fishing, and seafood processing are declining.  Therefore, many coastal communities are looking to diversify their economies and to improve their civilian marine infrastructure systems.  The fundamental challenge is to meet employment and economic development needs of coastal communities while maintaining or enhancing the environmental health and cultural heritage of coastal regions.
<P>
<LI>The U.S. transportation infrastructure, a very important basis for economic development, is falling behind that of other countries.
</UL>
<H3>
<A NAME="2B">WHAT KEY ACTIONS ARE PROPOSED?</A>
</H3>
The development and implementation of advanced technologies will be critical to economic growth, enhanced international competitiveness, and sustainable development. In support of Administration and DOC programs to achieve these goals, Sea Grant proposes the following strategic actions:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Commercial Biotechnology - </B>Develop marine biotechnology to benefit such industries as the pharmaceutical, chemical, and seafood industries. Research and technology transfer programs will develop fundamental knowledge of natural products and processes of marine organisms to provide models for new commercial products and new approaches to industrial processing and bioprocessing.
<P>
<UL>
<P><LI>Molecular Genetics: Develop genetically-engineered species for use in producing chemical products or industrial processing.
<P>
<LI>Natural Products: Develop biologically-active compounds.
<P>
<LI>Bioprocessing, Bioreaction, Cell and Tissue Culture:  Develop useful substances from marine microorganisms and cells of higher organisms. 
</UL> 
<P>
<LI><B>Environmental Technology -</B> Develop environmental technologies that enhance environmental monitoring and assessment, prevent and control pollution, and remediate polluted areas. Key program areas are the development of (1) instrumentation and autonomous platforms for remote sensing and sampling of environmental variables, (2) technology that reduces or eliminates pollutant discharge in waste streams for seafood processing and aquaculture facilities, and (3) processes that remediate contaminated Great Lakes and coastal waters and sediments. 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Enhancement of Environmental Monitoring and Assessment: Develop high-resolution, cost-effective measurement technology; systems for combining satellite imagery with environmental data; and technology for monitoring environmental impacts.
<P>
<LI>Pollution Control and Prevention: Develop new technology for minimizing waste streams from aquaculture and seafood processing operations.
<P>
<LI>Remediation: Develop biological and chemical remediation technology. 
</UL></UL>
<H3>
<A NAME="2C">WHY SEA GRANT AND WHY NOW?</A>
<P>
What is the challenge to Sea Grant?
</H3>
The goal of the National Sea Grant College Program is to focus the talents and resources of America's university-based marine and coastal research, education, and outreach capabilities on the problem of applying advanced technologies to enhance economic growth and development while maintaining and improving the health of the coastal environment. The challenge is to integrate these university-based Sea Grant programs with those of NOAA, other federal agencies, state and local governments and the private sector so that results of the Sea Grant effort are transferred rapidly to the appropriate users.
<H3>
What is the Relationship to the Sea Grant and NOAA Mission?
</H3>
Sea Grant's mission, as expressed in its authorizing legislation, is to increase the understanding, assessment, development, utilization, and conservation of the nation's  coastal, ocean, and Great Lakes resources. Sea Grant accomplishes its mission by utilizing the nation's  university-based research, education, and outreach capabilities. This program in developing advanced technologies for economic growth and environmental stewardship is  central to the Sea Grant mission.
<P>
NOAA, in its strategic plan, has defined as a mission the promotion of global environmental stewardship. Because NOAA recognizes that major problems are associated with the economic development of the nation's coastal and Great Lakes ecosystems, it has an element entitled "Sustain Healthy Coasts" in the agency's strategic plan. Sea Grant, as a part of NOAA, has developed its environmental technology program in support of this NOAA element. 
<H3>
What is Being Done Now?
</H3>
The National Sea Grant College Program is currently conducting a research effort in support of marine biotechnology and environmental technology.  Marine biotechnology research has shown the rich potential for exploiting the biochemical capabilities of marine organisms to provide models for new classes of pharmaceutical, polymers, other chemical products, and new industrial processes.  Therefore, Sea Grant is applying DNA technology and other molecular methods to produce aquaculture vaccines, diagnostic and analytical reagents for control of pathogens in seafood, and aquacultural species. The research encompasses both traditional approaches and modern molecular methods.  However, this unique program of research cannot now address the vast opportunities and needs that currently exist.
<P>
The Sea Grant program in environmental technology is currently developing new chemical and biological sensors for in situ deployment and an autonomous (robotic) underwater vehicle (AUV) to execute missions that are not feasible with tethered vehicles or are too expensive to be conducted by conventional methods. Pollution prevention and control efforts concentrate on developing process control systems for aquaculture that maximize water reuse and on developing low-cost waste treatment technology for small seafood processors. Bioremediation studies are applying biotechnology to the development of specialized microorganisms that will degrade toxic pollutants and are investigating novel approaches to chemical degradation of toxic organics.
<H3>
Why is Further Effort Needed?
</H3>
The nation has embarked upon the ambitious course of promoting economic growth and international competitiveness while maintaining and improving environmental quality. If the U.S. is to maintain and enhance its global competitiveness in biotechnology, it must fully utilize the vast untapped potential of marine organisms as sources of novel compounds and processes.  If small coastal businesses and industries are to grow and prosper they must be provided the technology that permits their growth yet protects the environment.
<P>
The cost-effective cleanup of contaminated areas will require the development of remediation technologies far superior to those available today. In short, the development and implementation of advanced technology is key to ensuring the nation's future economic and environmental well-being.
<H3>
<A NAME="2D">COMMERCIAL BIOTECHNOLOGY - KEY ACTION ITEM</A>
</H3>
Sea Grant proposes to develop marine biotechnology that will benefit such industries as the pharmaceutical, chemical, and seafood industries. Research and technology transfer programs will develop fundamental knowledge of natural products and processes of marine organisms  to provide models for new commercial products and new approaches to industrial processing and bioprocessing. 
<H3>
Molecular Genetics  
</H3>
The development of new industrial products and processes based on exploiting the products and biochemical processes of marine organisms--marine biotechnology for the 21st century-- depends on fundamental advances that will provide the basis for genetic engineering of plants, animals, and microorganisms. Thus, Sea Grant will: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Direct research to develop genetically-engineered species such as lower invertebrates, macroalgae, bacteria, and cyanobacteria with potential for use in either producing chemical products or in industrial processing.  These advances will provide strains that synthesize useful compounds at greater rates, or degrade waste materials or toxic effluents more efficiently. 
</UL>
<H3>
Natural Products: Chemistry and Biological Activity
</H3>
Marine organisms, such as bacteria from unique environments like thermal vents, have the potential for significant industrial and commercial applications. The National Sea Grant College Program will conduct a  spectrum of biochemical and biological research to:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Isolate, identify, and determine the function of enzymes controlling processes of potential commercial benefit. 
<P>
<LI>Isolate and identify compounds that are biologically active and have commercial or medical potential. 
<P>
<LI>Determine the processes and sites of action of novel substances that act in ways different from standard drugs and industrial chemicals. 
<P>
<LI>Define the chemical, physical, and biological properties of marine materials, particularly biopolymers, as a basis for industrial use.

</UL>
<H3>
Bioprocessing, Bioreaction, Cell and Tissue Culture.  
</H3>
This research includes basic physiology and nutrition of marine microorganisms and cells of higher organisms that will provide the scientific basis for their use in controlled systems for producing useful substances.  Sea Grant will: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Develop technology to use culture cells of macroalgae in bioreactors to produce useful biochemicals such as enzymes, pharmaceutical, and agrichemicals.
<P>
<LI>Develop techniques for using halophytic plants in agriculture and in restoring degraded coastal environments. 
<P>
<LI>Determine the factors that promote production of useful biomaterials.

<P>
<LI>Develop biochemical engineering technology for use of saline organisms in bioreactors and photo-bioreactors.
<P>
<LI>Exploit unique biological processes to develop new types of molecular biosensors including indicator systems for detecting low-level toxicity.  
</UL>
<H3>
<A NAME="2E">ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY - KEY ACTION ITEM</A>
</H3>
The National Sea Grant College Program proposes a program to develop technologies for application to environmental assessment and monitoring, seafood industry pollution reduction, and contaminant remediation in the coastal environment. The objective will be to develop technology with the potential for commercialization by the private sector. In conducting this program, Sea Grant will work in partnership with aquaculture, seafood processing, pollution control, and process engineering companies.
<H3>
Enhancement of Environmental Monitoring and Assessment
</H3>
If the necessary monitoring of coastal environmental conditions is to occur so as to track ecosystem health, there will have to be greater reliance on unattended, in situ  measurement platforms and remote sensing observing systems. Cooperative actions in establishing baselines and monitoring areas such as large marine ecosystems, high risk areas, and sanctuaries and reserves will become increasingly important.  Sea Grant, in collaboration with NOAA's National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service, Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management, and the National Aeronautics and Space Agency, will:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Improve the spatial and temporal resolution and cost-effectiveness of coastal and Great Lakes environmental observations through the development of new in situ measurement technologies and of autonomous underwater vehicles.
<P>
<LI>Develop new systems for combining satellite imagery with other environmental data to supply, in near real-time, critical information for environmental assessment, fisheries management, and commercial and sports fishing activities.
<P>
<LI>Develop new technologies to monitor the impacts on the marine environment of mineral and hydrocarbon extraction activities. 
</UL>
<H3>
Pollution Control and Prevention
</H3>
The aquaculture and seafood industries will have to significantly reduce their impacts on environmental quality if they are to expand in the coastal zone. Sea Grant will:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>In cooperation with the pollution and process control industries, develop new technologies for minimizing waste streams from aquaculture farms and seafood processing plants.
 </UL>
<H3>
Remediation
</H3>
Current choices for remediation are often extremely expensive or simply transfer the problem from one medium to another. An example of the latter is the land disposal of contaminated dredge spoils. There is an urgent need for cost-effective remediation technology, especially that which can be applied in situ. Sea Grant will:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Develop biological and chemical remediation technology with emphasis on in situ applications for use in the coastal and Great Lakes environments.
</UL>
<H3>
<A NAME="2F">WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS TO THE NATION?</A>
</H3>
<UL>

<A NAME="3">SEAFOOD PRODUCTION</A>
</H2>
</CENTER>
<H3>
OVERVIEW
</H3>
In the decade ahead, many challenges and opportunities face the U.S. seafood industry.  In many regions, fish production has already reached the limits of the supporting ecosystem. Shoreside, competing coastal development activities challenge the historical fishing infrastructure and the supporting estuarine ecosystems. Both at home and abroad, aquaculture and wild caught fisheries are competing in the marketplace. Recreational fisheries and commercial fisheries now vie for allocation of stocks.  Limited knowledge of regional coastal ecosystems provides a special challenge for those with management responsibility for fishery resources and coastal environments. 
<H3>
What is Sea Grant's Vision for 2005?
</H3>
By 2005, with the aid of Sea Grant programs of research, extension, education, and public information, there will be an expanded economic contribution of the seafood production industries through revitalization of the commercial fishing industry, development of sustainable aquaculture, and enhanced competitiveness through advances in seafood technology.
<H3>
What is the Relationship to Administration and DOC Goals?  
</H3>
Major goals of the Administration are to foster sustainable development and to improve economic competitiveness in global technologies.  Through its mandate, the National Sea Grant College Program has a role to help develop living marine resources, promote healthy coastal ecosystems, and strengthen coastal economies.  Fisheries science, ecosystem research, seafood technology, and aquacultural research, along with programs of technology transfer and information dissemination are essential elements of this mission.  Sea Grant has a notable history of success in these fields. In conjunction with NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service and Coastal Ocean Program, and with state resource agencies and commercial and recreational sectors, the research and outreach will advance science and technology for developing the seafood industry and improving stewardship of living marine resources.  New processes and technology built on Sea Grant research and outreach will enable aquaculture and seafood processing facilities to meet stricter environmental regulations and remain viable in an international economy.
<H3>
What are the Problems?
</H3>
Demand for quality seafood is rising.  The domestic seafood industry, including its commercial fisheries, aquacultural husbandry, and processing firms, is hampered in responding to this opportunity. The harvesting sector is faced with declining fish stocks, deteriorating ecosystems, and competing uses.  Aquacultural development is handicapped by weak governmental commitment, inadequate technology, lack of capital, high operating costs, environmental regulation, and competition for coastal space and resources.  Seafood processors face growing foreign competition, supply shortages, and product safety and quality issues.  All industry segments are affected by the changing and complex regulations governing water quality, safety, and conservation.
<H3>
<A NAME="3B">WHAT KEY ACTIONS ARE PROPOSED?</A>
<P>
Sea Grant's investment strategy will focus on the following elements:
</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Revitalize the Nation's Commercial Fisheries - Develop the knowledge necessary to advance ecosystem approaches to resource management, manage the social and economic impacts of change, develop approaches to minimizing bycatch, and provide the knowledge for appropriate enhancement of wild stocks.
<P>
<LI>Develop Sustainable Aquaculture - Work with government and industry to improve the framework for developing approaches to policy, regulation, and financing of aquaculture.
<P>
<LI>Enhance Competitiveness of the Seafood Industry Through Advances in Seafood Technology -  Provide the knowledge for improved product quality and safety, improve the efficiency and enhance processing technologies, improve waste management, and assist in the development of new products and byproducts. 
</UL>
<H3>
<A NAME="3C">WHY SEA GRANT AND WHY NOW?</A>
</H3>
The nation's seafood industry is a complex enterprise composed of capture fisheries, aquaculture, seafood processing, and marketing firms.  This functional structure belies the very great number of edible species--finfish, crustacea, and molluscs--that are marketed and consumed in many forms.  Problems and opportunities abound with every species and every sector of the industry.  The National Sea Grant College Program has a close working relationship with all sectors of the industry.  The seafood industry faces great burdens because of declining stocks, expanding regulation, environmental and public health issues, and increased international competition. Successful seafood firms must operate cleanly and efficiently, increase productivity with new technologies and processes, and employ a stable work force that will produce high-quality goods and services in return for good wages.
<P>
Consumer demand for seafood is near a record high and increasing. Because domestic products cannot meet this demand, the United States runs a large trade deficit in fishery products. However, this demand may prove precarious if a variety of real and perceived seafood quality problems are not resolved.  The seafood industry needs innovative methods to assure safety and quality of its products and to compete in global markets.  It needs better technology to face escalating costs from waste disposal and from requirements to meet increasingly stringent standards for effluent quality.
<P>
While low or declining fish stocks constrain capture fisheries, other approaches can increase the U.S. share of domestic and foreign markets.  In particular, the U.S. must look to aquaculture to enhance supplies.  It must also seek innovative approaches to better manage and use wild stocks through ecosystem modelling, bycatch reduction, fuller use of raw materials, and enhancement of natural stocks.
<P>
This network plan documents the challenges facing the seafood producing industry today.  The National Sea Grant College Program has, for the past 30 years, been an effective partner in bringing to bear the talents and expertise of the academic institutions in fisheries research.   It has been an especially effective force in helping to reduce conflicts and controversies among the diverse users of coastal resources and in fostering acceptance by fishermen of new harvesting equipment and new regulations.  Those Sea Grant roles are badly needed in today's contentious environment.
<P>
Sea Grant has been NOAA's premier program with responsibility for the research and development of marine aquaculture. The problems of the capture fishing industry dictate that the Sea Grant aquaculture program maintain its momentum to help meet the increasing domestic demands for seafood products.
<P>
Sea Grant's seafood technology program is especially important in assisting the seafood processing industry to deal with the complex regulations governing waste and effluent disposal, product quality and safety, and the new FDA program of hazard analysis critical control point procedures (HACCP).
<H3>
<A NAME="3D">REVITALIZE THE NATION'S COMMERCIAL FISHERIES - KEY ACTION ITEM</A>
</H3>
The National Sea Grant College Program has extensive experience in fisheries science, education, and information transfer.   Sea Grant will build on this long and successful history through integrated program efforts in the following areas:  
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Management: Develop models and improved fishery forecasts.
<P>
<LI>Anticipating Social and Economic Impacts: Assist fisheries managers, industry and coastal communities to understand the social, economic and legal impacts resulting from new management strategies.
<P>
<LI>Minimizing Bycatch: Develop and evaluate fishing gear and techniques to reduce bycatch, assess the impact of bycatch on stock recruitment, analyze effects of bycatch reduction on food chains, and educate the industry on alternative practices and gear.
<P>
<LI>Enhancing Wild Stocks Through Aquaculture:  Develop the technology for enhancing stocks.
</UL>
<H3>
Management 
</H3>
Assessing the status of fishery resources and predicting  the maximum catch for sustained profitability must incorporate knowledge of ecosystems since the traditional species approaches are lacking in their ability to account for ecosystem changes.  Trophic relationships and energetics are now recognized for their importance in affecting the integrity of exploited systems.  If these balances are upset, benefits may be greatly reduced.  In the long term, prediction of future fishery yields will depend upon the development of better ecological models that incorporate mechanisms of population control, natural- and human-induced environmental fluctuations, and multi-species interactions. To build these ecologically-based management models, the dominant natural processes that control variation in the growth and productivity of fish stocks must be identified. 
<P>
Important information must be obtained on the physical environment, predator-prey relationships and basic recruitment processes.
<P>
The following activities are necessary steps towards development of ecosystem models and improved fishery forecasts to which Sea Grant will contribute:  
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Identify critical processes controlling replenishment of fishery resources.
<P>
<LI>Understand multi-species interactions and how these interactions can be modeled and considered in management strategies.
<P>
<LI>Guide the development of management strategies for exploited and manipulated systems, in the context of bioenergetics models, to maintain appropriate levels of forage, predators, and prey.
<P>
<LI>Develop an understanding of how some populations are able to withstand (compensate for) intense fishing pressure and other forms of anthropogenic stress, and how this ability may vary with environmental conditions.
</UL>
<H3>
Anticipating Social and Economic Impacts
</H3>
Most marine fisheries management has been directed to setting catch quotas, seasons, size limits and gear restrictions in attempts to protect the fish stocks.  So long as fish stocks were large, relative to the number and technological prowess of fishermen, these approaches were adequate. However, greater numbers of fishermen have been lured into increasingly capital-intensive fishing ventures.  The result has been over competition for the number of fish.  In the case of halibut in the Pacific Northwest, the result has been a race for fish, with yearly quotas of some fish being taken in a few days, and in some cases in only hours. In this economic climate there are strong incentives to circumvent the rules, and enforcement of the regulations becomes increasingly problematic.  Other factors, including immigration and major public works programs, have contributed to increased fishing effort or decline in fisheries habitat.  The net result in both cases is heightened competition for the available stocks.
<P>
Allocating fish with the traditional management tools is difficult and of dubious conservation value as competition for fish has increased as stocks have declined.  Seeking new techniques and solutions to allocate fish equitably and to minimize unanticipated consequences is a high priority. Sea Grant, through research and information transfer will help fisheries managers, industry, and coastal communities understand the social, economic, and legal impacts resulting from adopting new management strategies, including market-like mechanisms and other non-traditional regulatory regimes, for managing fisheries. Sea Grant will: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Analyze the effects of alternative regimes in terms of efficiency, distributional equity, and community stability; 
<P>
<LI>Analyze the effects of new management strategies on fishing behavior (high-grading, bycatch);
<P>
<LI>Analyze how imposition of new management regimes on fisheries may affect efficiency, distributional equity, community stability; labor mobility, and markets;
<P>
<LI>Improve empirical techniques for measuring the value of fish stocks allocated to alternative uses, including recreational and subsistence fisheries, meeting endangered species and marine mammal goals, and for rebuilding fish stocks; and 
<P>
<LI>Initiate longer-term research to understand how the U.S. commercial and recreational fisheries will perform over the next decade, given issues of environmental quality, technological change, and regulatory policy.  
</UL>
<H3>
Minimizing Bycatch
</H3>
Heavy bycatches of non-target resources and other important components of the ecosystem are a major impediment to increased fishery yields and economic gains.  Many methods of fishing are nonselective, and this results in bycatch of some species including marine mammals, endangered species, and juveniles of the target species. Bycatch sometimes results in at-sea discarding of a large portion of the catch, although the extent of this practice is poorly known in many fisheries. Most discards do not survive. Bycatch also causes significant loss of potential economic benefits when directed fisheries are closed because of heavy "prohibited species" bycatch.  In 1991, there was an estimated $100 million loss of fish and fishing opportunity in the Pacific groundfish fishery alone when the halibut bycatch quota was exceeded.  In some cases, the bycatch problem contributes to overfishing itself, and may jeopardize recovery of a depleted stock.  In other cases, notably the Gulf of Mexico shrimp fishery, there is concern that fishing practices designed to conserve non-target species may increase predation of target species causing economic loss to the fishing industry and consumers.
<P>
Development of conservation gear and practices by the private sector will be actively encouraged. It is expected that Sea Grant will continue to have a primary role in evaluating the efficacy of gear and practices designed to conserve protected species and minimize bycatch, and for the transfer of this information throughout the industry.  Within this context, Sea Grant will:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Accelerate effort to develop and evaluate gear designed to reduce bycatch.
<P>
<LI>Identify and evaluate fishing techniques for reducing bycatch.
<P>
<LI>Assess the impact of bycatch on stock recruitment in selected fisheries.
<P>
<LI>Analyze effects of bycatch reduction in terms of trophic relationships.
<P>
<LI>As knowledge increases, expand education programs to the fishing industry on the impacts of alternative fishing practices and gear and, similarly, the impact of bycatch on fish stocks and endangered species associated with fish.
</UL>
<H3>
Enhancing Wild Stocks Through Aquaculture
</H3>
There is a role for aquaculture technology in enhancing wild stocks.  Sea Grant, in cooperation with NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service, will develop technology for using aquaculture to enhance natural populations of key aquatic species and evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of this practice.  Specifically it will:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Develop hatchery rearing systems for heavily exploited species.  
<P>
<LI>Use biotechnology and other scientific approaches to improve the quality of seed stocks. Work will be done to enhance growth, improve disease resistance and treatment, control reproduction, develop techniques for identifying cultured stocks in the oceans, and understand the genetic consequences of enhancement.
<P>
<LI>Evaluate survival of released cohorts.
<P>
<LI>For certain stocks, provide the ecological evaluation necessary to maximize successful releases into the wild (i.e. to make sure such releases are of a size and timed appropriately with biological processes).
<P>
<LI>Provide the technology transfer necessary to bring new species on line as the science is developed.
</UL>
<H3>
<A NAME="3E">DEVELOP SUSTAINABLE U.S. AQUACULTURE - KEY ACTION ITEM</A>
</H3>
The National Sea Grant College Program has been a major proponent of the U.S. marine aquaculture industry.  Sea Grant will continue to build on this experience in its renewed efforts to develop sustainable aquaculture by focusing on four areas:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Institutional Framework: Assist government and industry in developing approaches to policy, regulation, and financing of aquaculture.
<P>
<LI>Grow-Out Systems: Develop technology for water management and pond culture, intensive production systems, offshore culture, and polyculture.
<P>
<LI>Improving Husbandry: Increase fundamental knowledge of reproduction, hatchery, growth, nutrition, disease diagnosis and control, systems management, selection, and development of vaccines and delivery systems.
<P>
<LI>Enhancing Aquaculture Through Biotechnology: Develop understanding, at the molecular and organismal levels, of the processes of reproduction, development, growth, pathology and immunology.
</UL>
<H3>
Administration and Coordination
</H3>>
Inconsistent policies and commitment at several governmental levels hinder development of U.S. aquaculture.  Sea Grant will develop partnerships with federal and state agencies, academia and industry to address investment, regulatory, and marketing issues barring the economic development of the industry, thus clearing the way for systems of known production and economic performance characteristics that can be used throughout the United States.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Assist in the development of common and coordinated approaches by state and federal agencies regarding policy, regulation, and financing of aquaculture activity, especially in the coastal zone.
<P>
<LI>Work with other agencies to promote aquaculture as an alternative occupation for workers displaced from traditional coastal industries. Since most aquaculture development will occur in the coastal zone, this program will be well-coordinated and leveraged by programs in the "Coastal Ecosystem Health and Public Safety" element of Sea Grant's network plan.
<P>
<LI>Work with local jurisdictions, planning authorities, and regulatory agencies to advance the best available technologies and regulatory mechanisms for scrubbing effluents, recovering wastes, and removing pollution entering productive bays and estuaries.
<P>
<LI>Work with others in government and industry to develop aquaculture products for domestic and international markets.
</UL>
<H3>
Developing and Improving Grow-out Systems 
</H3>
Aquaculture industries in United States coastal regions are facing limitations of water supply, competition with other resource users, and environmental obstacles.  Environmentally compatible systems and practices are needed to minimize impacts on coastal systems and on some fragile estuarine areas.  Limited supplies of high quality water dictate increased use of recirculation systems, especially for broodstock holding, breeding, and nursery facilities.  To reduce nearshore conflicts and environmental obstacles, new technologies for developing aquaculture offshore should be examined.  Sea Grant will:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Expand research responding to immediate industry needs in management of water quality and pond ecosystems, shellfish beds, polyculture systems, and predators.
<P>
<LI>Conduct research on constructed wetlands, pond water rotation and reuse, and other low water consumption techniques as alternatives to pond discharge.
<P>
<LI>Evaluate intensive production systems used in the U.S. and other countries for expanded application to new areas and species. 
<P>
<LI>Evaluate offshore aquaculture technology.  Candidate species include redfish, cod, haddock, halibut, mahi-mahi, grouper, red snapper, cobia, and tuna.
<P>
<LI>Enhance the use of information networks to provide the newest procedures and techniques.
</UL>
<H3>
Improving Husbandry
</H3>
Improvements in brood stock, particularly with respect to gamete production, survival, growth rate, and disease resistance is needed to meet the demand for reliable seed stocks.  The need for rapidly growing, disease resistant stocks, and production technology to rehabilitate the U.S. oyster industry is especially urgent.  A core program of research in genetics, physiology, disease diagnosis and control, nutrition, biotechnology and systems management is needed for candidate aquacultural species.  Numerous successful commercial operations will form the basis for development of standardized brood stocks of high health and performance characteristics for several systems under development. Sea Grant will:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Increase fundamental knowledge of reproduction and growth physiology, nutrition, disease diagnosis and control, and systems management.
<P>
<LI>Select and domesticate key marine species suited for new marine grow-out systems. Develop methods for producing high health, high performance stocks for use in intensive and extensive aquaculture systems.
<P>
<LI>Develop new vaccines and delivery systems for primary disease problems in marine species.
<P>
<LI>Improve hormonal control of reproduction and growth.
</UL>
<H3>
Enhancing Aquaculture Through Biotechnology   
</H3>
Use of the new tools developed through biotechnology offers special opportunities for aquaculture.  The economic production of food and biochemical products through aquaculture can be greatly enhanced by understanding, at the molecular level, the processes of reproduction, development, growth, pathology, and immunology protection in aquacultural species--those used now and new candidates.  Thus, research using the tools of biotechnology will be especially useful in developing:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Genetic and hormonal methods for promoting reproduction, development, and growth.
<P>
<LI>Treatment therapies for diseases in finfish and shellfish, involving characterization of pathogens, activation of immune systems, and pathogenic responses.
<P>
<LI>Genetic, physiological and biochemical bases for immune responses.
</UL>
<H3>
<A NAME="3F">ENHANCE COMPETITIVENESS THROUGH ADVANCES IN SEAFOOD TECHNOLOGY - KEY ACTION ITEM</A>
</H3>
Most of the companies comprising the seafood processing industry in the United States have gross sales of less than $2 million and cannot make large investments in research and development.  Processing companies large and small face increasing international competition, changing and complex regulations governing worker safety, waste disposal and effluent quality issues, and real and perceived problems with product quality and safety.  The seafood industry must process a wider variety of raw material than any other sector of the food industry but, because of its disaggregated nature, it faces many hurdles. The industry requires assistance through research, education, and technology transfer in the areas of:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Product Quality and Safety: Develop technology to implement good manufacturing practices, pathogen detection and control, toxin removal, and rapid response to harmful algal blooms.
<P>
<LI>Processing Technology and Practices: Develop means to improve energy and processing efficiencies, upgrade storage and transportation technology, implement automation, improve processing safety, and increase product quality.
<P>
<LI>	Waste Management and Byproduct Recovery: Develop technology for water conservation and effluent control, improve waste management, interpret regulations, and recover byproducts such as enzymes, hormones, and aquaculture feeds.
<P>
<LI>Product Development: Develop technology for producing high-quality products and value-added products.
</UL>
<H3>
Product Quality and Safety
</H3>
Leaders in the industry have recognized the ties between perceptions of seafood quality and expansion of markets, both home and abroad, for U.S. seafood products.  New regulations recently adopted to increase product safety will challenge some processors and reward those who are more progressive.  New techniques are needed to increase the effectiveness and decrease the cost of ensuring high quality product.  Sea Grant, already at the forefront of education and technology transfer for the industry, has an opportunity to further enhance the competitiveness of the U.S. industry in the world market through several focused activities: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Communicate and help implement good manufacturing practices in the seafood industry, especially HACCP procedures.
<P>
<LI>Apply molecular biology methods to develop highly specific assays that can easily, rapidly, and reliably detect and quantify pathogenic viruses, bacteria, and toxins in seafood and in fishing waters.
<P>
<LI>Improve understanding  and prediction of reaction products and the kinetics of metabolic transformations, including uptake and release, of toxins in commercially important marine species.
<P>
<LI>Develop a rapid response capability for unexpected harmful algal bloom events that will include protocols for mobilization of regional networks and response teams, reporting centers and logistical units.
<P>
<LI>Educate consumers, news media, public health officials and physicians on issues of seafood safety.
<P>
<LI>Develop improved manufacturing methods for control of pathogens in seafood.
</UL>
<H3>
Processing Technology and Practices   
</H3>
To compete in the world seafood market, U.S. processors must continue to increase efficiency through improvements in technology for processing, storage and transportation, and control costs through improved worker efficiency and reduction of accidents and lost time.  Special attention will be give to the following tasks:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Improve energy and processing efficiency in production of fresh, frozen, and canned products
<P>
<LI>Upgrade technology for storing and transporting seafood in top quality condition.
<P>
<LI>Implement automation and other methods that bring rigor and predictability into seafood processing technology. 
<P>
<LI>Promote safety practices that reduce worker injury and lost time.
<P>
<LI>Analyze relationships between product quality, processing parameters, and local environmental, seasonal, and culturing variables.
</UL>
<H3>
Waste Management and Byproduct Recovery  
</H3>
Seafood producing businesses have a special stake in the quality of coastal and marine waters. Environmental concerns, often expressed in new regulation, must be addressed by the seafood processing industry, especially those located in plants built years ago.  New techniques are needed to reduce the potential waste stream through increases in byproduct recovery and for the treatment of residual wastes. With assistance from the National Sea Grant College Program, the U.S. seafood industry can address opportunities to develop byproducts from the 50 to 80 percent of currently wasted raw materials.  Sea Grant will:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Analyze, interpret, and communicate federal, state, and local regulatory requirements and associated penalties, relating to environmental quality, that affect seafood processors.
<P>
<LI>Develop technology for water conservation, waste management, and effluent control.
<P>
<LI>Conduct pilot-scale experiments in waste management and effluent control and demonstrate new or improved technology to the processing industry. 
<P>
<LI>Develop technology for recovery of byproducts such as enzymes, hormones and aquacultural feeds.
</UL>
<H3>
Product Development 
</H3>
For both cultured and wild harvested resources, there are opportunities to expand the market for seafood through the development of new products and new product forms.  New value-added products can stimulate overall consumption, increase the profitability of the seafood industry, and expand U.S. exports of seafood products.  Products developed with new processing techniques can increase shelf life and use a greater proportion of the edible product, thus reducing the waste stream.  Sea Grant will:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Develop technology to produce quality products from latent resources and composite by-catch species, especially those with potential as replacements for depleted, traditional species.
<P>
<LI>Develop and improve recovery technology and associated fabrication technologies, such as extrusion techniques, for producing reconstituted products from U.S. raw materials.
<P>
<LI>Provide better quality and more consistency in supply of seafoods to consumers. 
<P>
<LI>Provide jobs to the employees in traditional coastal industries displaced by other competing industries and programs.
</UL>
<H3>
<A NAME="3G">WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS TO THE NATION?</A>
</H3>
As a result of Sea Grant's efforts, the potential increase in net value from the U.S. seafood industry could be $2.9 billion per year.  These benefits will be available for investment in the economy to promote additional growth.  The annual impact on the national economy (direct, indirect and induced) associated with rebuilding the seafood industry is about $25 billion, including an $8 billion impact on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and about 300,000 jobs.  Among the benefits to the nation from a revitalized commercial fishery, development of sustained aquaculture, and enhanced competitiveness through advances in seafood technology are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Increased U.S. tax base and tax revenues from the harvesting sector by $1 billion.
<P>
<LI>Reduced  U.S. trade deficit and stabilized seafood processing employment, thus reducing costs of unemployment benefits.
<P>
<LI>Reduced bycatch mortality, including protected species such as dolphins and sea turtles.
<P>
<LI>Restored credibility and public trust in government with respect to fisheries management and enforcement; and minimization of legal challenges.

<A NAME="4">COASTAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</A>
</H2>
</CENTER>
<H3>
OVERVIEW
</H3>
Coastal areas--the band of coastal counties bordering the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Great Lakes--are the most densely populated areas in the U.S.  Here, over 50 percent of the nation's population lives on about 11 percent of the nation's total land.
<P>
Coastal industry accounts for a significant portion of the national economy, and much of this activity is marine-dependent:  businesses engaged in fishing, seafood processing, recreation and tourism, vessel construction, marine fabrication and repair, shipping, energy production, and offshore services, as well as facilities like ports and naval bases.  Altogether, marine-dependent and other businesses in the coastal zone produce nearly one-third of the nation's total output of goods and services.  In nine coastal states, the coastal zone accounts for one-half or more of the state's economy, and in 17 others, for one-third or more.
<P>
But even the enormous size of this economy does not capture the full economic value our coasts provide.  Coastal residents also prize the intangible benefits and amenities associated with the distinctive qualities and resources of coastal areas.  Most Americans agree that such qualities are a priceless legacy that must be maintained and preserved for future generations, even as economic imperatives dictate additional development of coastal areas.  Clearly, reconciling the growth of coastal populations and industry with maintenance of high-quality coastal environments is a major challenge that can only be met through additional national investments in environmental protection and education, alternative technologies, and infrastructure development.
<P>
For decades, the goals of business and the environment often seemed to diverge--what helped one invariably was thought to harm the other.  The idea of sustainable development offers a new paradigm--an explicit recognition that economic growth and environmental protection are inextricably linked and that national investments must serve both goals.  
<H3>
What Is Sea Grant's Vision for 2005?
</H3>
Sea Grant will undertake collaborative efforts with business firms, industries, and community leaders:  
<P>
<UL>
<LI>To advance the coastal and marine-related economies by strengthening knowledge, skills, and business opportunities that undergird community stability.
<P>
<LI>To protect the marine resources and environmental assets of coastal communities for the benefit of present and future generations.
<P>
<LI>To help maintain U.S. coastal and offshore industries in positions of global leadership, and to provide the scientific and engineering professionals needed to assure maintenance of our vital infrastructure through the next century.
</UL>
<H3>
What Is the Relationship to National Needs? 
</H3>
Sea Grant's investments in research, technology development, and educational outreach address the economic and environmental goals of the Administration, Congress, and the Department of Commerce by assisting grassroots efforts:  
<P>
<UL>
<LI>To create new industries and businesses that add jobs.
<P>
<LI>To develop advanced technologies that afford U.S. industries an edge in global competition.
<P>
<LI>To retain traditional coastal economic activities.  
<P>
<LI>To provide a more skilled workforce.  
<P>
<LI>To improve resource management practices and environmental quality.
</UL>
This thrust also responds directly to Administration goals of world leadership in science, mathematics, and engineering.  
<H3>
What Are the Problems? 
</H3>
Dynamic changes are taking place in most of the nation's coastal communities, in response to declining natural resources and habitat, growing concerns with biodiversity as a national priority, and increasingly mobile populations.  Many small to medium-sized coastal communities lack the resources and expertise to develop alternative economic opportunities, provide adequate community services, and manage population growth or decline.  Also, most coastal businesses such as marinas and seafood processors are both small and decentralized.  "Existence values," which are at the core of sustainable economies and development strategies, need better definition in operational terms.  
<P>
The essential infrastructure that supports human habitation, recreation, and commerce on the nation's coasts, and industrial activities offshore, includes shipyards, harbor structures, bridges, water control structures, outfalls, pipelines, and offshore platforms.  Many of these structures are more than 40 years old--and some, much older.  Extending the service lives of these structures and bringing them up to modern standards of safety and performance is a major technological imperative because of their vital role in supporting commerce and industry, as well as the quality of human life, the environment, and national security.
<P>
The United States is losing its position of world leadership in construction engineering and technology acquired after World War II.  To regain competitiveness in a world marketplace dominated by low-cost labor, the U.S. must produce scientists and engineers who excel in the creation of innovative technological solutions to problems of strategic importance, such as that of revitalizing the nation's marine infrastructure.  Sea Grant's experience in forging linkages among universities, industrial firms, and government agencies at all levels and its emphasis on problem-solving can make a positive contribution to such restoration programs and in nurturing technologies needed to pursue international business opportunities.
<H3>
<A NAME="4B">WHAT KEY ACTIONS ARE PROPOSED?</A>
</H3>
<UL>
<LI><B>Coastal Business Development -</B> Businesses located in or serving coastal regions are experiencing rapid changes.  Enterprises engaged in commercial and recreational fishing, coastal tourism and recreation, port operations, or marine trades, for example, face greater burdens than in the past, because of scarcer natural resources, environmental and public safety regulations, waterfront displacement, and increased competition.  Building sustainable coastal economies will require research and outreach efforts in support of business development and retention in key marine industries.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Fishing Industries: Develop mechanisms to reduce conflict among users, reduce risk by better business practices, evaluate needs for future facilities, and provide for improved public health and safety.
<P>
<LI>Coastal Recreation Businesses: Develop information to assist small businesses to increase their efficiency, increase public and private access, and implement education programs to reduce liability risks and to develop stewardship.
<P>
<LI>Marine Trades Industry: Develop technology to improve business management, retain waterfront sites, insure compliance with environmental regulations, and improve safety and vessel design.
</UL>
<P>
<LI><B>Coastal Community Development -</B> A coastal community economic development program will focus on communities experiencing coastal urban revitalization, defense restructuring, retirement booms, and waterfront redevelopment.  Another aspect will emphasize preservation of the coastal cultural heritage and understanding of the social and economic values derived from the use of marine and coastal resources.

<LI><B>Revitalizing Marine Infrastructure -</B> There are few established techniques or guidelines for assessing the integrity of marine structures.  Effective repair and rehabilitation measures have only begun to evolve.  Similarly, there are few accepted or well-defined methods for managing the loadings and operations of structures to assure acceptable performance and reliability.  In the United States, it is rare to find either an academic program or a long-term research effort addressing these issues.  Only through a comprehensive and long-term research effort will the technological challenges posed by the aging and obsolescence of marine structures be met.

<A NAME="4C">WHY SEA GRANT AND WHY NOW?</A>
<P>
What Is the Challenge To Sea Grant?  
</H3>>
Over the next two decades, the size of the United States' coastal population is expected to increase dramatically.  Approximately 60 percent of all population growth since 1980 has taken place in coastal counties. 
<P>
The mix of coastal industries and businesses has been changing.  In many coastal regions, for example, manufacturing, commercial fishing, and seafood processing have declined.  And with population shifts, many coastal communities are looking to diversify their economies and to improve their civilian marine infrastructure.  The fundamental challenge is to meet the economic needs of coastal communities while maintaining or enhancing the environmental health and cultural heritage of coastal regions.
<P>
The need to modernize the civilian marine infrastructure is not unique to the United States.  Many other countries are encountering similar problems, but nowhere do we find well-focused, coordinated, or continuing research programs attacking this problem.  This is an opportunity for the United States to develop ocean and coastal engineering technologies that can rehabilitate its aging marine infrastructure and also help address similar international concerns.
<H3>
What Is the Relationship To the Sea Grant and NOAA Missions?
</H3>
By the key actions proposed, the following elements of the NOAA and Sea Grant missions will be advanced:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Development of technologies for new and improved marine products, services, and operations.
<P>
<LI>	Assistance to private enterprises in obtaining useful technologies and information that enhance business productivity and job growth.
<P>
<LI>Assistance to coastal communities in responding to the challenges of coastal population growth and economic restructuring.
<P>
<LI>Facilitation of constructive dialogue between the regulators and users of the coastal and marine commons, to resolve user conflicts and advance the public interest in health, safety, and economic prosperity.
</UL>
<P>
Sea Grant has an outstanding record of success in helping coastal communities as they work to achieve sustainable development.  Sea Grant's public education programs have made an increasingly diverse citizenry better informed about marine science and environmental policy, and have illustrated how the use of marine resources will be affected in the future.  Sea Grant has assisted local businesses and industries in adopting effective management practices for reducing the flow of polluting substances to coastal waters and, at the same time, has worked with regulators to assure that environmental regulations do not add unnecessarily to business costs.
<H3>
What is Being Done Now? 
</H3>
The Marine Advisory Service (MAS)  has been Sea Grant's primary link to coastal businesses and coastal communities for 25 years and is uniquely situated to transfer scientific knowledge and technology to these groups.  Furthermore, representatives of these businesses and community leaders serve on Sea Grant advisory committees and help to shape university research by identifying needs, issues, opportunities, and problems.  The MAS consists of over 250 professionals located in communities throughout the nation's coastal and Great Lakes regions. These professionals are Sea Grant's direct contact with the multitude of small businesses in this country's 451 coastal counties.  Their work is complemented by a network of 90 communicators who create and market information products of value to coastal audiences. 
<P>
During the past decade, a modest program of Sea Grant-funded research has begun to generate technology for rejuvenating the nation's infrastructure.  This modest investment has provided substantial benefits to industry and government alike.  The recent work on analytical methods for assessment and requalification of offshore platforms has provided the foundation for this initiative. In addition, Sea Grant has sponsored efforts to develop engineering procedures that can be used to assess and manage human and organizational errors in the operations of offshore platforms and other marine systems.  Heretofore, there have been no structured, quantitative approaches to guide the design of systems that would be tolerant of human error, or to include consideration of such errors in the design, construction, and operation of marine systems.
<H3>
Why Is Further Effort Needed?
</H3>
Changing demographics and the migration to coastal areas, a declining resource base, loss of jobs in traditional occupations, and growing societal concerns for aesthetic and environmental values have combined to create economic change for many coastal residents.  New occupations and opportunities must be created to supplement and replace traditional jobs to achieve the national goal of environmentally sustainable economic development.  The actions proposed address major issues that constrain environmentally sound economic development in the nation's coastal areas.
<P>
There is a pressing need to significantly accelerate development of the technologies required to rejuvenate the U.S. marine infrastructure.  In many cases, this infrastructure has been allowed to deteriorate to the point where there are serious implications for public safety, environmental quality, and economics.  Continued deterioration must be stemmed, but much of the technology needed for this purpose is either obsolete or nonexistent.  Moreover, rising sea levels worldwide presage several decades of major public investment devoted to upgrading coastal infrastructure, protecting coastal populations, and maintaining the functional viability of marine public works. Several European countries have already begun to raise levees, wharves, locks, bridges, and other structures in low coastal areas.  Without a significant additional effort, the technological developments in this country will be inadequate for the needs of international competition.  To neglect our aging coastal and marine infrastructure is to expect further erosion in our industrial and job base in this sector of the economy.
<H3>
<A NAME="4D">COASTAL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT - KEY ACTION ITEM</A>
</H3>
Coastal enterprises engaged in tourism, recreational boating, fishing, marine trades, and other endeavors face the burdens of scarcer natural resources, a more complex regulatory climate, and increased competition for waterfront space.  With limited resources to cope with these changes, smaller businesses are especially at risk.  To survive, they must be able to operate efficiently, increase productivity, and train a workforce that will produce high quality goods and services in return for good wages.  
<P>
With its outreach programs, Sea Grant plays a vital role in helping coastal businesses adapt to changes in the regulatory environment, implement new technologies, and manage efficiently within their business environment. 
<H3>
Fishing Industries
</H3>
Marine fisheries--commercial and recreational--are important in the economies of many coastal communities.  Sea Grant research and outreach professionals will work to:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Reduce conflict and promote cooperation among competing marine resource users.
<P>
<LI>Better understand the biological and ecological factors that limit natural fishery resources, and use this information to rehabilitate stocks in an environmentally safe manner.
<P>
<LI>Assist fishing operators and investors to employ business practices that are consistent with resource conservation goals, and to adopt new technologies needed to succeed in today's highly competitive business climate.
<P>
<LI>Assist communities in estimating the need for additional facilities to serve commercial and recreational fishing interests, and in planning for future fishing ports, charter boat harbors, waterfront businesses and attractions, and fishing piers and artificial reefs.
<P>
<LI>Provide for public health and safety through timely and authoritative communications about water-related risks (water hazards, contaminant spills, toxic algal blooms, marine pathogens, nuisance aquatic species, marine debris, and other conditions that may impair the use of fishery resources).
</UL>
<H3>
Coastal Recreation Businesses
</H3>
Recreation is valued both for its importance to the economy and for the social well-being of the nation.  Sea Grant will work to:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Help small, independent marine recreation businesses improve their operations and form groups to identify and work for mutual goals.
<P>
<LI>Create sufficient public and private recreation access to meet the growing demand for boating, fishing, and beach use; and investigate pricing strategies to prevent overuse of marine resources by recreationists.
<P>
<LI>Provide safety education programs that reduce the liability risk faced by small businesses and coastal communities. 
<P>
<LI>Educate the next generation of recreational users of marine resources about stewardship.   
</UL>
<H3>
Marine Trades Industry 
</H3>
The marine trades industry includes small enterprises such as boat building, vessel repair, marina operations, dry-stack boat storage facilities, and other commercial services.  Sea Grant will work to:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Improve the business management practices of the marine trades industry.
<P>
<LI>Help design programs for the retention of working waterfront sites.
<P>
<LI>Provide marina operators with the science-based information needed to comply with environmental regulations and to improve marina water quality.
<P>
<LI>Improve safety performance through recreational and charter vessel redesign. 
</UL>
<H3>
<A NAME="4E">COASTAL COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT - KEY ACTION ITEM</A>
</H3>
Managing coastal growth is a critical challenge in coastal areas.  The problems besetting coastal regions--strong population growth, dwindling marine resources and declining natural environments--create a compelling need for economic diversification and growth that are consistent with preservation of the culture, heritage, and landscape of the coastal regions. Innovative ways are needed for small businesses, coastal communities, and local governments to participate in environmentally sound economic growth. 
<P>
Conflicts frequently erupt over allocation of coastal resources as groups with different viewpoints compete.  Sea Grant marine advisors can serve as neutral "honest brokers" of information by opening communications between opposing groups promoting the mutual understanding of issues and viewpoints, providing science-based information relevant to the controversy, and creating a forum for compromise, negotiation, and mediation by other professionals. 
<P>
Sea Grant has played an active educational role in coastal community tourism development, development of port and harbor infrastructure, and waterfront redevelopment.  New economic challenges are illustrated by communities experiencing a heavy immigration of retirees or where the local economy is shrinking with the downsizing of a military facility.  Coastal urban economic development represents another area where Sea Grant could play a more prominent role but, currently, has only a modest outreach effort.  Sea Grant can approach issues of urban industry development or minority business enterprise from the fresh perspective of marine-related business development.  
<H3>
Coastal Tourism Development
</H3>
Tourism is the fastest growing economic sector in America and, for many coastal states, coastal tourism offers what economists call a "comparative advantage" for economic development.  Sea Grant will work with coastal communities to:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Evaluate the tourism potential of recreational, historical, aesthetic, ecological, and cultural assets.  
<P>
<LI>Assess the social, environmental, and economic benefits and costs of tourism development.
<P>
<LI>Help design the planning process for tourism development so as to minimize the attendant adverse impacts.
<P>
<LI>Resolve conflicts involving the tourism industry, community planners, and environmental groups. 
</UL>
<H3>
Communities in Transition
</H3>
As the nation undergoes fundamental economic restructuring, many coastal communities are experiencing troublesome changes in their economies.  Coastal communities undergoing special impacts--such as those related to military downsizing, urban development, and retirement booms--are struggling to plan for their economic future, facing questions of how to create, retain, and attract jobs for their citizens.  Sea Grant will work with these communities to:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Understand and manage the cumulative and secondary impacts of coastal growth or economic restructuring.
<P>
<LI>Develop the community leadership and provide the training needed to sustain the long-term economic and cultural heritage of the coast.
<P>
<LI>Conduct research to determine the economic and social value of coastal environments and marine resources. 
<P>
<LI>Provide for adequate amenities, such as recreation opportunities and safety, in coastal urban areas.
<P>
<LI>Mitigate growth-related environmental stress through the use of innovative land zoning, reserves, limited-use critical areas, minimized development in hazardous areas, and habitat restoration programs.
<P>
<LI>Provide for proper facilities siting for coastal dependent and non-dependent economic activities (e.g. aquaculture, waste disposal, marinas).
<P>
<LI>Understand and manage the cumulative and secondary impacts of coastal growth or economic restructuring.
<P>
<LI>Foster collaboration with state and local economic development agencies.
</UL>
<H3>
Coastal and Waterfront Redevelopment
</H3>
Waterfront cities are revitalizing their urban waterfronts, turning abandoned wharves, docks, and piers into attractive destinations for tourists and local residents.  In addition, reuse of "brownfield" sites--that cannot be used until they are decontaminated--is a critical economic development concern today.
<P>
Sea Grant will work with communities and businesses to: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Understand the social and economic benefits of coastal and waterfront redevelopment.
<P>
<LI>Design zoning and land use plans that will reserve multiple-use options for coastal and waterfront areas in the future. 
<P>
<LI>Restore unused coastal and waterfront facilities to productive use.  
</UL>
<H3>
Ports and Harbors
</H3>
There are nearly 500 commercial ports in the U.S., with perhaps 150 of these being deepwater commercial seaports. Sea Grant will work with the U.S. Coast Guard, Army Corps of Engineers, and coastal communities, port authorities, and businesses to:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Develop technology and information to reduce navigational risks.
<P>
<LI>Improve port productivity through adaption of new technologies related to cargo handling, waste management, and water quality.
<P>
<LI>Plan port development strategies, including links to inland cargo transportation and other infrastructure functions.
<P>
<LI>	Develop multipurpose uses for ports to support the fishing and boating industries, cruise ship services, waterfront redevelopment, parks and recreation, scenic viewing, and foreign trade zones.  
</UL>
<H3>
Planning and Decision-Making Information 
</H3>
Community leaders and governing bodies need methods for integrating environmental information with local planning procedures.  Sea Grant investigators respond to these needs through interdisciplinary projects that combine elements of fundamental science with systems analysis and operations research.  Goals of such work include the development of models and methods to:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Elucidate the economic and community values associated with the use and preservation of marine resources and coastal environmental assets.
<P>
<LI>Assess the value of "nonmarket" resources and processes identified with wetlands, habitat preservation, endangered species, biodiversity, and environmental quality. 
<P>
<LI>Evaluate sustainable economic development goals and track the use and conservation of marine and coastal environmental resources in the production of the nation's economic output.
</UL>
<H3>
<A NAME="4F">REVITALIZING MARINE INFRASTRUCTURE - KEY ACTION ITEM</A>
<P>
Inspection and Condition Surveys 
</H3>
Determining the condition of aged marine structures in service involves at least three closely integrated steps.  The first is to characterize the structure, including its foundation, in terms of geometry, damage effects, corrosion, and the original performance criteria used in its design and construction.  The second involves the inspection and nondestructive testing of the structure in situ; such methods are not well developed.  Third, the gathered information must be analyzed to assess the structure's existing performance capabilities before remedial design measures can be undertaken.  Sea Grant will:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Identify and develop reliable noninvasive inspection techniques that can characterize the condition of marine structures above, near, and below the surface of the water, as well as near and below the seafloor.
<P>
<LI>Develop methods for underwater surveys that are safe, cost-effective, and reliable, especially using remote sensing techniques.
<P>
<LI>Develop improved data archiving and analysis capabilities to make the results of surveys relatively easy to interpret.
</UL>
<H3>
Environmental and Operational Loadings
</H3>
Environmental loadings are the forces on structures from such natural phenomena as waves, currents, ice, wind, and earthquakes.  Operational loadings include forces resulting from the weight of deck equipment, lifting and hoisting, vibration induced by machinery, vehicle momentum, and vessel impacts.  Aging structures become more vulnerable to environmental loadings as a result of corrosion, biofouling, fatigue, and differential settling.  Service loadings may change as technology advances and the service requirements of the structure evolve.  Sea Grant will:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Develop improved analytical procedures and identify the kinds of field data needed to improve the prediction of future environmental and operational loading conditions and forces on marine structures.  
<P>
<LI>Develop load control and load management technologies that will limit stresses on marine structures.
<P>
<LI>Develop methods of quantifying and integrating the various sources of uncertainty associated with the definition and characterization of environmental and operational loadings.
</UL>
<H3>
Structure Performance Assessments
</H3>
Marine engineers understand how to evaluate the performance characteristics of intact and ideal structures subject to the usual range of environmental and operational loadings.  What is not so well known is how to assess damaged, decayed, and repaired or rehabilitated structures subject to the full range of extreme environmental and operational loadings.  Sea Grant will:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Develop the analytical capabilities necessary for the evaluation and prediction of performance characteristics of deteriorated and rehabilitated marine structure systems.
<P>
<LI>Determine the thresholds at which property, productivity, life, and/or environmental safety are placed at risk.
</UL>
<H3>
Rehabilitation, Repair, and Recycling Procedures
</H3>
U.S. technology associated with maintenance, repair, recycling, and rehabilitation of marine structures is in many cases obsolete or non-existent.  Many engineers are capable of designing new marine structures.  Construction techniques are similarly highly developed.  However, capabilities associated with maintenance, repair, rehabilitation, recycling, and decommissioning of marine structures have not been well developed.  Sea Grant will:  
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Establish, through experimental and analytical research, the basic load-deformation behavior and residual strength of damaged and deteriorated components that comprise marine structures, including their foundations.
<P>
<LI>Develop methods that enable projections to be made of damage to marine steel, concrete, and timber, associated with impact, corrosion, decay, and fatigue.
<P>
<LI>Develop rehabilitation methods to restore the strength of components in damaged structures.
<P>
<LI>Develop engineering and construction technology, consistent with economic and environmental constraints, for removal of structures that must be salvaged.
<P>
<LI>Develop procedures to evaluate alternative use and reuse of offshore facilities.
</UL>
<H3>
<A NAME="4G">WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS TO THE NATION?</A>
</H3>
Scientific knowledge achieves its fullest measure of value when it is applied by entrepreneurs in commercial enterprise and, when it results in securing for the people, the benefits from marine resource wealth.  The National Sea Grant College Program's strategies for economic leadership will help contribute to a robust and growing economy, sustainable coastal communities, a viable and modern marine infrastructure, healthy wholesome seafood products, and a stream of goods and services based on the development and application of advanced technologies.
<P>
The $2.9 billion annual sales from U.S. seafood production induces an economic benefit of about $25 billion, including an $8 billion impact on GNP and about 300,000 jobs.  Thus, rebuilding a sustainable fisheries promises tremendous economic and social returns on investment.
<P>
Sea Grant efforts with coastal communities will advance the economic and social well-being of coastal residents in every state bordered by the nation's seacoasts and Great Lakes.  Sea Grant will help to stabilize, strengthen and revitalize several hundred coastal communities undergoing rapid change and save millions of dollars in construction and maintenance costs for essential marine facilities.

<A NAME="1">INTRODUCTION</A>
</H2>
Demographers estimate that well over half of the U.S. population will reside within 50 miles of the marine and Great Lakes coasts by the year 2000.  The fragility of natural coastal ecosystems and their susceptibility to natural and man-made hazards provide major challenges to policy makers and public safety officials concerned with providing strategies for providing sustained development opportunities and maintaining public safety.  Sea Grant, with its multi-disciplinary approach to research and outreach, provides a major mechanism of developing the leadership necessary for accomplishing this difficult task.
<H3>
Relationship to Department of Commerce Goals
</H3>
Job creation and economic growth and improved environmental quality are two major goals developed through the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) process.  The Department of Commerce, in its mission statement, focuses on enhancing and ensuring economic opportunity for the American people by: facilitating technological development that creates jobs; creating a base for economic growth in distressed communities; and achieving sound assessment, prediction, and stewardship of the environment and its resources.

Sea Grant's program in coastal ecosystem health supports the Administration goals of economic growth and improved environmental quality.  Specifically, the program addresses NSTC priorities in environmental quality by developing a scientific basis for integrated ecosystem management, new science policy tools, and new systems for observations, information synthesis and transfer, and data management.  The application of environmental technologies to support sustainable development will promote job creation and economic growth.
<H3>
SEA GRANT'S VISION FOR 2005
</H3>
Sea Grant envisions the implementation of policies and programs to protect and enhance both the health of coastal ecosystems and the safety of its inhabitants and users while, at the same time, providing for sustained growth of the coastal economies.  Policies and programs will be adopted which ensure the continued safe and sustained development of these complex communities through the generation of relevant research information and its effective transfer to coastal communities.  More specifically, this vision includes: (1) healthier coastal and Great Lakes ecosystems through greatly improved water quality; (2) increased high-quality habitats for living marine resources; (3) a prosperous and growing seafood production and processing sector operating in harmony with the coastal environment; and (4) the complete integration of the physical and biological sciences with economics and the social sciences in the development of resource management policies.
<H3>
SEA GRANT'S STRATEGY
</H3>
Threats to continued development of the nation's coastal areas include degradation of the environment due to increases in human activities and increased exposure of the populace to marine and coastal hazards.  Degradation of coastal habitats and water quality combined with natural processes such as environmental change and severe storms threaten the sustainability of coastal communities.  Through the implementation of research related to toxics, nutrient overenrichment, habitat function and restoration, and prediction and preparedness for severe storms and other coastal hazards, Sea Grant can translate and transfer information to decision-makers and policy makers through its outreach capabilities.  These steps will help ensure that proper policies and programs are in place to undergird the sustained economic vitality and safety of coastal communities.
<H3>
THE PROGRAM
</H3>
Two major topics will be addressed to provide the knowledge and capability needed to develop programs that promote sustainable development and safeguard the coastal community population and infrastructure:
<P>
<B>Coastal Ecosystem Health - </B>This topic will focus on developing information necessary to protect and enhance water quality and habitats supporting natural ecosystem function and to promote sustainable development.  Policy makers and resource managers will be provided the information, technology and techniques needed for formulating appropriate environmental policy.
<P>
<B>Public Safety -</B> Activities in this area will provide the necessary information to enable public safety officials to implement programs that ensure the preparedness and response of communities to coastal hazards such as hurricanes, coastal storms, tsunamis and toxic spills such as oil or chemical.  It will also promote safety at sea through development of new equipment and training programs for the fishing and diving communities.
<H3>
EXPECTED BENEFITS
</H3>
An informed public will make better decisions about the use of and their involvement in coastal and Great Lakes areas.  The nation will realize enhanced economic growth of the coastal economy and greater public support for public policy which ensures both environmental and economic vitality.  It will also result in saving lives and property as well as realizing major cost savings in disaster response.

<H3>
OVERVIEW
</H3>
The vast, complex ecosystems of the nation's coast and Great Lakes serve as the basis for producing the natural resources necessary to support coastal economies.  Declining water quality, because of increasing populations and resource use, threatens the structure and function of those systems.  This loss and alteration of habitat affects fisheries production and ecological integrity. New policies and procedures for evaluation are required for more effective management to sustain ecosystem health and productivity.
<H3>
The Problems
</H3>
The U.S. has undergone a doubling of its population in the last five decades.  Accompanying this growth has been a dramatic shift in population from inland rural areas to coastal urban areas.  As a result of this combined growth and migration, over 50 percent of the U.S.  population now lives within 50 miles of a coast or Great Lake.  A result of this population shift has been the extensive development of our coastal areas.  Industrial, commercial, and residential development has fueled the coastal economy, which now accounts for from one-third to one-half of American jobs and one-third of the U.S. Gross National Product.  However, this often unplanned development activity has resulted in major declines in the health of the nation's coastal ecosystems.
<P>
Evidence for decline abounds.  Bathing beaches are frequently closed due to sewage pollution. Over one-third of the shell-growing waters in the U.  S.  are closed for all or part of the year due to pollution by sewage or toxic chemicals.  Habitat loss, flow alteration, pollution, and overfishing threaten the viability of the coastal and commercial recreational fisheries that annually contribute over $40 billion in economic activity.  Red tides and other harmful algal blooms appear to be occurring with increasing frequency, with resultant threats to public health and costs to the fishing and recreation industries.  It is estimated that the cost to the country to cope with the nonindigenous zebra mussel will be at least $10 billion.
<P>
There is an opportunity to stem and reverse this environmental degradation of the coastal zone and its ecosystems.  However, to accomplish this goal, the "either/or" choice between environmental protection and economic development must be eliminated.  This will require a significant investment in creating new approaches to managing development, in obtaining new scientific understanding of the ecosystems of our coastal and Great Lakes waters, and in the development of new environmental technologies which permit growth while maintaining the quality of the environment.
<P>
Thus, coastal ecosystems are stressed by a multitude of factors including habitat loss or modification, loss of biodiversity, nutrient and toxic inputs, and fresh water diversion.  However, currently, the inability to establish cause and effect relationships among coastal ecosystem impacts and the individual stressors prevents managers from reliably predicting the outcome of their actions.  Understanding of ecosystem structure and function must be developed to the point that the interactive and cumulative effects of multiple stressors can be accounted for and mitigation strategies developed.
<H3>
Contaminants
</H3>
Toxic substances are a critical problem in the nation, especially in the Great Lakes area.  A large number of chemicals have been identified as "critical pollutants" in the Great Lakes based on their use, loadings, toxicity, and/or bioaccumulation in aquatic foodwebs.  The accumulation of organic chemicals in fish poses a threat to higher organisms, both humans and wildlife.  Nationwide, impacts on aquatic organisms have been identified, especially on early development of sensitive species.  The resulting economic impact on commercial and sport fishing and the associated regional recreational industry has been enormous.  Clean-up of inplace pollutants, particularly contaminated sediments, represents a potentially enormous economic liability for the nation. Trade-offs between environmental, social and economic concerns are inevitable, and decision makers will look to scientists to provide answers to cost/benefit questions.  Many major management decisions will be driven by toxic substance issues and underscore the urgent need for quantitative information on contaminant sources, trends, transport fate and effects.  
<H3>
Over-enrichment
</H3>
Eutrophication of coastal waters because of excessive nutrient input has affected coastal ecosystem productivity, caused loss of dissolved oxygen in waters as diverse as Chesapeake Bay and the Louisiana shelf, and may accelerate the frequency of noxious and harmful algal blooms. The nation is faced with spending billions of dollars to eliminate nutrient infiltration from sewage treatment facilities and from nonpoint sources.  While the relationship between nutrient inputs and eutrophication is well understood for lakes, the same is not true for coastal waters.  Managers cannot, at present, predict with confidence the results on water quality of potentially very costly programs of nutrient reduction.  
<H3>
Biotoxins/Harmful Algal Blooms
</H3>
Biotoxins produced by algae present in the marine environment cause severe illness in many persons annually and can be fatal.  Severe economic loss occurs in coastal communities when fisheries, especially for shellfish, must be closed because of contamination by biotoxins.  Biotoxins and large-scale blooms of single species of algae can also affect the health of a fishery.  For example, the scallop fishery in New York's Peconic Bay was devastated by a brown tide bloom in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  Currently, public health officials lack rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective methods to detect many of these substances.  There is insufficient understanding of the ecology of the organisms to make reliable predictions of outbreaks.  Any improvements in public protection will require the development of new methods for detecting these toxic compounds and ecological research to support the development of a predictive capability.  
<H3>
Habitat Loss and Modification
</H3>
Generally, estuarine habitat is disappearing in coastal areas.  Commensurate with coastal development has been a steady decline in estuarine-dependent fishery resources.  It is estimated that three-quarters of the nation's commercial and recreational marine fisheries are, at some point in their life cycle, dependent on estuarine habitats for food and shelter or as migratory routes and spawning grounds.  Populations of many harvested fish species of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf of Mexico coasts have been reduced to historic low levels.  These declines are likely due, in part, to the combined effects of fishery harvests and habitat degradation and loss.
<P>
Actual losses or changes in the biological structure of existing habitats affects their ability to function as integral parts of existing coastal ecosystems.  A substantial number of nonindigenous aquatic species including the zebra mussel, the ruffe and the Asian clam have recently been introduced into U.  S.  waters.  Such species introductions can completely alter existing ecosystems and result in economic impacts that reach billions of dollars and affect coastal residents, local governments, and industries.  The problem is two-fold: the nation must deal with the effects of the substantial number of species that have already invaded U.S.  waters successfully, and it must prevent new introductions from the large pool of potential invaders.
<H3>
Cumulative Impacts
</H3>
Coastal zone managers are faced with intransigent problems: the effects of cumulative impacts in coastal areas, and potential ways for dealing with this problem; the need to develop options for controlling erosion and nonpoint source (NPS) runoff, and the testing of setbacks or other non-intrusive ways of controlling NPS runoff; and the evaluation of the set of management approaches termed loosely "integrated coastal management" or "integrated watershed management." With increasing numbers of people moving to coastal areas, and with changing use patterns--from commercial extractive/industrial to recreational extractive and non-extractive uses--there are increasing conflicts over the use of coastal resources.  Many of these conflicts end up in courts, costing both public and private sectors millions of dollars in expenditures.
<H3>
<A NAME="2B">WHAT KEY ACTIONS ARE PROPOSED?</A>
</H3>
Maintaining and enhancing the health of the nation's coastal ecosystems requires the development of a sound understanding of the behavior of coastal and Great Lakes ecosystems and the effects of human activities on these systems, the policy tools that enable the sustainable development of the coastal region, and the technology to permit that development.  
<P>
In support of NOAA, DOC, and Administration programs to restore coastal ecosystem health and encourage sustainable development, Sea Grant proposes the following strategic actions:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Coastal Ecosystems -</B> Protect and enhance the health of coastal ecosystems by improving the quality of coastal and Great Lakes waters.  Sea Grant will provide information to resource managers and regulators on ecosystem structure and function and the effects of declines in water quality on these systems.  The development and implementation of nonpoint source pollution control programs in cooperation with federal, state, and local governments will be a major Sea Grant focus.  Sea Grant will develop and transfer new environmental technologies to reduce or eliminate water pollution from the seafood producing and processing sector.
<P>
<LI><B>Coastal and Great Lakes Habitats -</B> Protect, enhance, and create coastal and Great Lakes habitats that are essential to the sustainability of coastal and Great Lakes ecosystems and the productivity of their commercial and recreational fisheries.  Sea Grant will provide information to resource managers and regulators on the impacts of habitat alteration and loss on ecosystem and fishery productivity.  In cooperation with federal, state, and local governments, Sea Grant will develop programs to prevent the introduction of and to control aquatic nuisance species in coastal and Great Lakes waters.  Through biotechnology, Sea Grant will develop and transfer to users new technology for the creation and restoration of coastal and Great Lakes habitats.
<P>
<LI><B>Sustainable Development -</B> Promote sustainable development by providing policy makers, regulators, and resource managers with new capability to assess the links between the physical, biological, economic, and social sciences and environmental policy.  Sea Grant will provide accurate, unbiased information on the potential economic and social impacts of current and proposed plans, policies, and regulations.  Sea Grant will develop new approaches for evaluating the effectiveness of policies in preventing, managing, and ameliorating environmental problems in the coastal zone.     
</UL>
<H3>
<A NAME="2C">WHY SEA GRANT AND WHY NOW?</A>
<P>
What is the Challenge to Sea Grant?
</H3>
The goal of Sea Grant is to focus the talents and resources of America's university-based marine and coastal research, education, and outreach capabilities on the problem of maintaining, restoring, and improving the health of coastal ecosystems in the context of economic growth and development.  The challenge is to integrate these university-based Sea Grant programs with those of NOAA, other federal agencies, state and local governments and the private sector so that results of the Sea Grant effort are rapidly transferred to the appropriate users.
<H3>
What is the Relationship to the Sea Grant and NOAA mission?
</H3>
Sea Grant's mission is to increase the understanding, assessment, development, utilization, and conservation of the nation's coastal, ocean, and Great Lakes resources.  Sea Grant accomplishes its mission by utilizing the nation's university-based research, education, and outreach capabilities. This program in coastal ecosystem health clearly fits within the Sea Grant mission.
<P>
NOAA, in its strategic plan, has defined as a mission the promotion of global environmental stewardship.  NOAA recognizes that major problems are associated with development of the nation's coastal and Great Lakes ecosystems and has an element entitled "Sustain Healthy Coasts" in the agency's strategic plan.  Sea Grant, as a part of NOAA, has developed its program in support of the NOAA element.  
<H3>
What is Being Done Now?
</H3>
In the area of water quality, Sea Grant pursues research or outreach efforts in toxics, nutrient cycling and eutrophication, pathogens and biotoxins, non-point source pollution and environmental technology.  Toxics research covers all aspects of toxic chemical behavior in the environment, with emphasis on the transport of toxics through food chains and the effect of toxics at the cellular, organism, and population levels.  Eutrophication efforts focus on understanding and predicting the effects of changes in nutrient inputs on ecosystem productivity and response. Additional ecological research is focused on understanding the causes of harmful algal blooms and developing the ability to predict these blooms.
<P>
Many, but not all, Sea Grant outreach programs are now devoting some staff time to issues of nonpoint source pollution control.  Sea Grant outreach personnel are working with federal, state and local governments, the private sector, and other groups to develop required nonpoint source pollution control strategies.  In the area of point source pollution, Sea Grant has a very small research effort to develop new technology for the reduction or elimination of pollutants from aquaculture and seafood processing waste streams.  More effort is being expended by the Sea Grant Marine Advisory Service (MAS) who are working with aquaculture and seafood processing firms to evaluate and implement commercial pollution control technologies.  
<P>
Sea Grant research on coastal habitat focuses on assessing the importance of wetlands and other habitats in supporting living marine resources and in affecting estuarine nutrient cycling and water quality.  The issue of wetlands loss and restoration is critical to sustaining coastal development, and Sea Grant researchers are involved in developing techniques for creating and restoring wetlands and evaluating the success of those efforts.
<P>
Sea Grant supports an extensive aquatic nuisance species program.  Sea Grant research efforts to prevent new introductions of nonindigenous species focus on the role of ballast water, the ecological effects of invading species, and physiologically- and mechanically-based methods to control them.  The Sea Grant MAS carries out an extensive outreach/education effort targeted toward zebra mussels that has included establishing a monitoring network and information clearinghouse, publication of advisory and educational literature for the public, and technical assistance and coordination for various public groups.
<P>
Sea Grant is unique in its support for significant effort directed towards socioeconomic research and outreach in the marine sector.  Sea Grant research addresses marine and coastal economic and social science issues including the policy and governance of the coastal region, fisheries management, fisheries and aquaculture economics, water policy, and valuation of non-market resources.  Sea Grant's MAS has programs addressing socioeconomic issues and conflict resolution.
<H3>
Why is Further Effort Needed?
</H3>
The nation has embarked upon the difficult course of promoting economic growth while maintaining and improving environmental quality.  Achieving sustainable development along the coasts and the Great Lakes will require much greater understanding of the effects of human activities on critical coastal ecosystems along with new approaches to merging this understanding into effective developmental policies.  If small coastal business and industry are to grow and prosper, they must be provided the technology that permits their growth yet protects the environment.  
<P>
The challenges to implementing sustainable development are major.  NOAA has committed itself to establishing a program structure and integrated framework for management of coastal resources.  If the nation and NOAA are to be successful, a greatly expanded and integrated effort in developing scientific understanding, new approaches to management and policy making, and new environmental technologies will be required.  
<H3>
<A NAME="2D">COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS - KEY ACTION ITEM</A>
<P>
Toxics
</H3>
A major focus of environmental contaminants over the last two decades been on the impacts of xenobiotics in natural systems and at natural levels.  Research on linkages between environmental contaminant chemistry, ecology, and biogeochemistry is beginning to bear fruit.  Sea Grant research will:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Determine the linkages between contaminant properties and the transport/removal processes governing contaminant fate and effects.
<P>
<LI>Determine the effects of point and nonpoint sources on contaminants loadings and levels and the linkages between contaminant loading and contaminant distribution and accumulation in the ecosystem.
<P>
<LI>Determine the effects of contaminants and complex mixtures of contaminants on aquatic organisms, wildlife, and human health.
<P>
<LI>Determine the effects of food web structure and dynamics on contaminant cycling and bioaccumulation.
<P>
<LI>Determine the role of benthic processes in controlling contaminant levels in food webs, including the impacts of both nearshore, highly contaminated zones and pelagic zones of sediment and chemical contaminant accumulation.

<P>
<LI>Assess contaminant trends in the ecosystem as related to contaminant loadings and inlake transport and removal processes.
<P>
<LI>Develop appropriate models to predict the effects of contaminant reduction on ecosystem function and living marine resource health.
</UL>
<H3>
Biological Contaminants
</H3>
Biological contaminants -- bacteria, pathogens, nonindigenous organisms -- can cause the deterioration of coastal water quality, and with it, closed beaches, contaminated seafood, and water unfit for human consumption.  Wild and cultured fin and shellfish are lost to harvest, sale and use.  Sea Grant will focus on:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Development of biosensors for improved detection, identification, and control of specific virus and bacteria in seafood and seawater.
<P>
<LI>Characterization and prevention of pathogenic organisms in aquacultured species to decrease economic losses and the spread of diseases to wild populations.
<LI>	Detection and identification of sources, characteristics and survivability of pathogens in the marine environment.
<P>
<LI>Increase public awareness through outreach and education programs about the risks associated with biological contaminants.
</UL>
<H3>
Nutrients
</H3>
Nutrient reduction programs to control eutrophication can cost billions of dollars.  To make informed choices on nutrient control strategies, it is essential that managers have a clear understanding of what the likely results of a particular approach will be relative to the cost. However, the current understanding of nutrient cycling and trophic dynamics in coastal waters is often insufficient to enable such predictions to be made with any accuracy.  To address this problem, Sea Grant will continue to undertake research on the linkages between nutrients inputs, ecosystem productivity, and water quality.  Sea Grant will:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Determine the relative importance of riverine, terrestrial, atmospheric, and oceanic sources of nutrients in shaping and controlling estuarine and coastal production.
<P>
<LI>Identify patterns of land use and regulation that affect the flow of excess nutrients into coastal waters, and evaluate alternative approaches to the amelioration and removal of excess amounts of these nutrients.
<P>
<LI>Separate changes in productivity and biodiversity of estuarine and coastal ecosystems in response to natural variability from changes due to nutrient sources from human activities.
<P>
<LI>Determine the linkages between primary production and living marine resources and the way these linkages are affected by anthropogenic nutrient inputs and natural variability.
</UL>
<H3>
Sedimentation
</H3>
Sedimentation can play a significant, but not yet clearly defined, role in coastal water quality. Agricultural run-off, deforestation, land use practices, shoreside and marina construction, erosion -- even earthquakes and volcanic eruptions -- can affect the flow of sediments into the coastal ecosystem.  Sea Grant will examine:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The role played by land use practices and natural conditions in increasing sediment movement to and within coastal waters and the impact of these changes on water quality and coastal ecosystems.
<P>
<LI>The availability and effectiveness of economic incentives, engineering practices, and regulatory regimes designed to control sedimentation and its impact on coastal water quality.
<P>
<LI>The nature, extent, and impacts of dredging and the disposal of dredged materials on coastal water quality.
<P>
<LI>The importance of sediment resuspension due to storms.
</UL>
<H3>
Biotoxins/Harmful Algal Blooms
</H3>
Sea Grant will conduct research and outreach efforts to increase understanding of the causes of harmful algal blooms, to improve the ability to predict and monitor their occurrence, and to develop ways to mitigate their effects, either through prevention, control, or treatment of living organisms or seafood prior to human consumption.  The focus will be on:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Understanding the competitive outcomes among phytoplankton species through experimental studies on factors regulating selection and succession, including grazing, allelopathic effects of toxins, nutrients, and related anthropogenic variables.
<P>
<LI>Assessing the physiology of growth and toxin production for harmful species through experimental studies emphasizing environmental tolerances and factors which influence growth and toxin production.
<P>
To develop successful mitigation efforts, it is first necessary to understand the acute, chronic, and sublethal effects of harmful algal blooms in food webs.  Sea Grant will conduct research to: 
<P>
<LI>Evaluate toxin transfer through the food web by determining kinetics of toxin uptake and depuration, bioconversions, and anatomical distribution; identifying important pathways of toxin transmission; the biological or genetic basis for variability in toxin production; and determining toxin accumulation potential for marine species that are commercially important, endangered, or major food web links.
<P>
<LI>Assess risks to marine life by identifying the effects of harmful algal blooms on various trophic levels and life cycle stages (physiology, behavior, and relative sensitivity), especially for commercially important, endangered or threatened species.  
<P>
<LI>Improve mitigation and management by developing practical protocols for protecting aquaculture and other commercially important fisheries, including the identification of potential indicator and vector species.  
<P>
One of the major impediments to developing cost-effective monitoring and research programs is the lack of suitable techniques for identifying and counting phytoplankton.  Sea Grant will support the development of: 
<P>
<LI>Rapid, taxon-specific methods, including techniques, e.g., molecular probes (nucleic acid and antibody), that can be used to identify, enumerate and separate harmful algal taxa, or to indicate physiological conditions at temporal and spatial scales appropriate to harmful algal blooms.
</UL>
<P>
Protecting the public and living marine resources from the effects of harmful algal blooms will require a major outreach effort to accompany the research program.  Sea Grant will support efforts to:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Develop a low-cost, rapid response capability for unexpected harmful algal bloom events that will include development of protocols for establishing regional networks and organizing regional response teams, reporting centers and logistical support.
<P>
<LI>Educate consumers, public health officials and physicians in issues of seafood safety.  
</UL>
<H3>
Nonpoint Source Pollution
</H3>
Because of the number and variety of sources, the control of nonpoint source (NPS) pollution is a significant challenge to the nation.  While policy and regulations will be developed at the federal and state levels, development and implementation of NPS reduction plans will occur mostly at the local level.  Most local governments lack the expertise to develop such plans.  Sea Grant will:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Provide expertise to local governments and communities in support of developing NPS pollution reduction plans.
<P>
<LI>Apply its skills in conflict resolution to develop consensus support for the implementation of NPS reduction plans.
<P>
<LI>Educate the public as to the causes of NPS pollution and the need for control.
</UL>
<H3>
Chemical and Oil Spills
</H3>
Periodic, dangerous spills of toxic and exotic chemicals and oil along the coastal edge cause socio-economic hardships to coastal communities by destroying property and public trust resources.   In many situations, the toxic characteristics of various chemicals will require evacuation and/or restocking.  In others, remediation requires extensive cleanup activities at tremendous costs to society and the private sector.  Sea Grant will focus on the following areas:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Bioremediation research.  Recent breakthroughs in marine biotechnology tools make it possible to apply engineered bacteria to spills that have the potential of decomposing certain chemicals and oil without leaving unsafe residue.  Results from fundamental research need to be applied in field tests to verify effectiveness, safety and aftereffects.  
<P>
<LI>Physical Models.  When a spill occurs, it is often difficult to predict its extent in various oceanic conditions, landwater interfaces, and wetlands.  Physical models are needed to apply local and forcing conditions rapidly, obtain predictions for assessing the potential extent of impacts, and develop effective evacuation of people and property.
<P>
<LI>SocioEconomic Research.  Socioeconomic methodologies need to be developed to enable evaluation of damages and to assign liability.  Often, the damages go far beyond immediate economic losses and cleanup costs.  Thus, social research is needed to assess and evaluate impacts on communities, businesses, livelihood, and quality of life.  New economic tools are needed to quickly and completely evaluate total economic impacts.
<P>

<LI>Prevention Mechanisms.  Many spills can be prevented with safer and better managed vessels and pipelines.  Research is needed to enable the construction of failsafe mechanisms and training is needed for managers to more effectively and safely operate.
<P>
<LI>Mitigation.  In the aftermath of spills, communities, businesses and environmental managers need to develop mitigation measures.  Applied research and outreach programs are needed to provide the tools for effective mitigation and transfer of relevant technology and information to the affected communities and for managers to carry out mitigation programs.  Information and tools for evaluating economic tradeoffs and mitigation of social conflict are needed on a realtime basis.
<P>
<LI>Response Mechanisms.  Communities, businesses and people in spillaffected areas need education and information to deal with response to real and perceived impacts.  Evacuation is expensive and disruptive.  It requires careful planning, precise knowledge of extent and potential damages, and information on safety.  Social upheaval is a real problem that requires outreach programs to assist communities in their response.

<A NAME="2E">COASTAL AND GREAT LAKES HABITATS - KEY ACTION ITEM</A>
<P>
Habitat Structure and Function 
</H3>
Sea Grant is concerned with understanding both the processes that shape marine communities over time and space and with the importance of specific habitats to the well-being of living marine resources.  Special emphasis is placed on estuarine and wetland habitats because of their proximity to centers of human population, their use by society for multiple, often conflicting purposes, and their roles as spawning grounds and nursery areas for economically valuable species of finfish and shellfish.  Priority research areas are to:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Increase understanding of the ecological relationship between populations of living marine resources and estuarine habitat.
<P>

</UL>
<H3>
Habitat Restoration
</H3>
Loss of productive estuarine and coastal habitat is a critical problem in maintaining the water quality, productivity, and biodiversity of out nation's coastal ecosystems.  Sea Grant supports efforts to restore habitat that has been lost or degraded so that its original functional value can be recovered.  Critical research needs are to:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Develop and refine cost-effective and reliable techniques for restoring and creating critical wetland and estuarine habitats, emphasizing the use of innovative technologies where appropriate.
<P>
<LI>Develop population and community level indices of habitat quality that reflect the ability of habitats to support living marine resources.

Aquatic Nuisance Species
</H3>
Sea Grant will support a series of research and outreach activities including: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Prevention - Sea Grant researchers will identify potential pathways for species introductions, carry out risk analysis, and develop strategies to interdict those pathways showing the greatest risk.  
<P>

<P>
<LI>Outreach/Education - Sea Grant will carry out an outreach/education effort to reach state and local agencies and commercial and private users.  
</UL>
<H3>
Cumulative Impacts
</H3>
Although scientists and managers generally have focused on the impacts of individual stressors to marine and Great Lakes ecosystems, it is the interactions of natural and anthropogenic stressors that determine the overall impacts on living resources and habitat quality.  Management practices must begin to recognize and address these interactions by managing on an ecosystem basis, but before that can happen, there needs to be a scientific basis for integrating the effects of multiple stressors on ecosystems and watersheds.  Sea Grant will develop the tools necessary for ecosystem management by supporting efforts to:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Understand the effects of multiple stressors on coastal ecosystems and watersheds.
<P>
<LI>Develop methods, including modeling, to predict the ecosystem impacts of proposed management actions and mitigation strategies targeted toward multiple stressors.

</UL>
<H3>
<A NAME="2F">SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT - KEY ACTION ITEM</A>
</H3>
If sustainable development is to succeed, policy makers, regulators, and resource managers must be provided with new capabilities to assess the links between the physical, biological, economic, and social sciences and environmental policy.  In addition, they will need accurate, unbiased information on the potential economic and social impacts of current and proposed plans, policies, and regulations.  Sea Grant will develop new approaches for assessing the effectiveness of policies in preventing, managing, and ameliorating environmental problems in the coastal zone.
<H3>
Socioeconomic Dimensions of Environmental Change
</H3>
To manage natural resources is to manage people.  Sea Grant will promote sustainable development by providing support to understand the relationship between humans and their environment, particularly on those environmental ecosystems that are under stress.  Sea Grant will:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Identify social and economic analyses of the effects of environmental changes.
<P>
<LI>Provide accurate, unbiased information on the potential social, economic and distributional effects of current and proposed plans, policies and regulations.

<LI>Work with coastal constituencies to produce timely information on the extent and nature of social and economic effects of these changes in management.
</UL>
<H3>
Coastal Management Policy Tools
</H3>
There are many unanswered questions about how best to manage coastal resources, and as the scientific knowledge base on the problems and issues advances, the ability to provide management options to deal with such issues must be enhanced.  Sea Grant will:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Develop new approaches for evaluating the effectiveness of current policies and management approaches to coastal resources.  
<P>
<LI>Assess capabilities of potential new tools or approaches to manage resources.  
<P>
<LI>Assess the capacity of current legal and management regimes to deal with the complex problems of today.
</UL>
<H3>
Multiple Use Management and Conflict Resolution
</H3>
With increasing numbers of people moving to coastal areas, and with changing use patterns--from commercial extractive/ industrial to recreational extractive and non-extractive uses-- there are increasing conflicts over the use of coastal resources.  Many of these conflicts end up in courts, costing both public and private sectors millions of dollars in expenditures.  Sea Grant will:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Investigate the nature and sources of coastal conflict, using the analytical perspectives of the social sciences.  By understanding the underlying dimensions of conflicts from multiple perspectives, it will be easier to design solutions to help groups deal with them.  
<P>
<LI>Build on the MAS capability to deal with conflict management and resolution.  MAS specialists maintain neutral positions in their communities, providing scientific and management information to the public and to resource managers.  As a result of their neutral positions, they are in an excellent position to act as mediators of environmental conflicts. They are often mediators in practice, but the Sea Grant program will provide training to develop their abilities in a professional capacity.  The combination of research based on multiple use and the MAS capabilities in mediation will alleviate some of the intransigent coastal conflicts.
</UL>
<H3>
Water Availability
</H3>
The availability of large volumes of potable fresh water is becoming a major growth issue in coastal communities much as it has been an issue in arid regions.  Reliable sources of potable water will more often become the critical issue for sustainable coastal development.  Water management will also increasingly affect estuarine water quality and fisheries management due to impacts on ground water supplies, saltwater intrusion and alteration of estuarine salinity distributions.  Sea Grant actions will include developing:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Costeffective, largevolume desalinization technology to allow developing communities to obtain local supplies of potable water.
<P>
<LI>Technology to effectively dispose of or reuse waste water so that it will not contaminate precious supplies of potable water.
<P>
<LI>Socioeconomic evaluation tools to enable communities and developers to assess costs of obtaining and maintaining adequate water supply.
<P>
<LI>Effective outreach programs to advise managers on the best technology and evaluation of various sources and management of water supplies.
<P>
<LI>Tools for estimating carrying capacity (including density, costs and use of recharge areas) for better planning.
</UL>
<H3>
Cumulative Impacts
</H3>
Individual growth and development decisions can seem relatively simple.  Basic understanding of the consequences of individual cases are being identified.  The longterm planning and design problems evolve from thousands of these simple, individual decisions.  Tools to understand the cumulative impacts of these decisions are not well developed.  In the long term, the importance of individual decisions becomes secondary to the cumulative impacts.  Issues to be addressed by Sea Grant include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Identifying activities that can result in cumulative impacts in specific ecosystems or in geographically defined areas.
<P>
<LI>Developing accurate technical tools or measures to ascertain cumulative impacts.
<P>
<LI>Developing strategies to manage cumulative impacts at acceptable levels.  These strategies should include long-range, holistic land and water use planning.  Geographic information systems need to be used to identify valuable resources and important uses, and competent legal research must be conducted to understand the maze of local, state and federal laws and regulations applicable to the planning and management processes.
<P>
<LI>Reassessing existing regulatory "escape measures" such as state and federal mitigation policies in light of the development of technical tools to measure cumulative impacts and in light of more comprehensive management techniques to manage these impacts to acceptable levels.

Our nation's coastal zone is a major resource to the country.  As stated in NOAA's strategic plan, the seafood industry has a $50 billion value while the shipping industry is valued at $20 billion. Over 100 million participants engage in recreational swimming, fishing, or beach attendance annually.  Thus, developmental and management decisions that affect these resources must be based on the best available information and technology.  
<P>
This program will both directly support the economic development of the U.S., especially its coastal regions, while increasing the country's ability to manage and protect its coastal ecosystems.  The program will also support the efforts of other NOAA elements in achieving these goals.  Managers and regulators at NOAA and other agencies will benefit from the development of new policy tools for the management of coastal resources and from solid ecological and socioeconomic data on which to base their decisions.  The nation will benefit from an expanded supply of seafood through the sustainable development of the aquaculture and seafood processing industries.  Improvements in water quality and habitat quantity and quality will provide broad benefits to the American public in terms of recreation, public health, and rebuilding populations of living marine resources.

</CENTER>
</H2>
<H3>
 OVERVIEW
</H3>
As population along the nation's coasts continues to increase, so do the cost and complexity of dealing with coastal disasters.  Recent events such as Hurricane Andrew in 1992, the Los Angeles earthquake, and the March 1993 Nor'easter underscore the costs incurred, both nationally and locally, to prepare for and respond to these events and restore coastal communities.  
<P>
The costs and hazards associated with natural disasters, spills, safety problems and restrictions on development can be reduced by transferring needed information on how to better plan for and deal with impacts to the private and public sectors.  The nation needs to have a coordinated means whereby its coastal residents can obtain information designed to reduce loss of life while simultaneously enhancing the quality of life and return on investments.  For example, the impact of one tsunami on a West Coast city could result in tremendous loss of life, high costs of recovery and large federal expenditures for restorationmost of which could be ameliorated with timely, relevant information in the hands of those affected.
<H3>
What is Sea Grant's Vision for 2005?
</H3>
Sea Grant envisions that the generation of relevant research information and the transfer of it to coastal communities will improve the ability of coastal residents to protect better their lives and property.  In addition, the coastal zone of the United States will be safer, less hazardous, and more amenable to wise development.
<H3>
What is the Relationship to Administration and Department of Commerce Goals?
</H3>
One of the goals of the Department of Commerce (DOC) is to enable both American businesses and the economy to be more competitive.  Environmental stewardship and sustainable development require wise and effective response to coastal hazards and appropriate community reparation.  Savings and benefits from an effective program would serve to help DOC achieve those goals in the coastal sector.
<P>
Strengthening existing relationships with other NOAA units, including the National Weather Service and the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management as well as other agencies that deal with hazard protection and recovery such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, state emergency management agencies, and the U.S. Coast Guard will enable NOAA to more effectively fulfill its mission.  Similar relationships with private agencies such as the Red Cross would yield similar dividends.
<H3>
What are the Problems?
</H3>
Protecting life and property from the impacts of coastal hazards, increased development and more complex activities at sea has become more difficult due to such trends as sea level rise, higher coastal population density, and the inexperience of coastal populations to deal with coastal hazards and their aftermath.  
<P>
Approximately 50 to 60 percent of the population of the U.S. lives within 50 miles of the saltwater shoreline or those of the Great Lakes.  Many of these people are recent coastal residents and are unfamiliar with low frequency coastal hazard events.  
<P>
There is clear evidence that the U.S. is in a period of relatively high rates of sea level rise.  The rate varies greatly, but increasing water levels are the norm for most of the U.S. coast.  The reasons for sea level rise are not clear, but they may be partly due to global warming.  Rates for much of the U.S. coast are 1 to 3 mm/year, which may not seem like much of a threat, but sea level rise is a highly leveraged process.  Shoreline recession due to erosion is typically 100 times greater than the vertical rise in water level.  The movement of the salt water wedge into tidal estuaries or salt water intrusion into coastal aquifers is roughly amplified 1,000 to 10,000 times the vertical rise in sea level.  These factors are contributing to a serious shortage of water in many coastal locations and the problem will almost certainly get worse.
<P>
It is essential that public policy makers, researchers and outreach specialists better understand the impacts of coastal hazards such as storms, tsunamis, chemical and oil spills and shortages of water, and devise the best available mechanisms for mitigation, response, and recovery. Currently, more research is needed to make accurate and timely predictions so that the public can deal with coastal hazards.  Research needs to be conducted to develop technology that can be used to help communities recover from disasters and that illuminates the economic and social aspects of mitigation and recovery.  At the same time, the impacts of coastal development need to be more thoroughly examined so that measures can be taken to protect life and property and maintain quality of life.  
<P>
Work and recreation at sea is inherently dangerous.  Commercial fishermen suffer the highest mortality rate of any profession.  Commercial and recreational divers continue to stretch the limits of human capacity under water.  Enhancing their safety is essential to saving lives and improving the economic vitality of these industries.
<H3>
<A NAME="3B">WHAT KEY ACTIONS ARE PROPOSED?</A>
</H3>
An integrated and focused program of Sea Grant research, education and outreach, in conjunction with NOAA's Coastal Zone Management Program, is needed to develop better capabilities to deal with:
<H3>
Coastal Hazards-
</H3>
<UL>
<LI>More rational public policy related to coastal zone development,
<P>
<LI>Expanded evaluation of mitigation techniques to ameliorate the impact of natural and man-made disaster on the coastal margin,
<P>
<LI>More timely and accurate tsunamis warnings and prediction of flooding potential,
<P>
<LI>Assessment of the physical, biological, and social impacts of chemical, radioactive materials, and other exotic substance spills,
<P>
<LI>Economic evaluation of impact and recovery from storms, tsunamis, earthquakes, spills and evacuation,
<P>
<LI>Assessment of the relationship of shoreline changes/responses to new combinations of sea level rise and physical changes,
<P>
<LI>Development of new technology for remediation and prevention of disasters, 
<P>
<LI>Transfer of information on the prediction, impacts and recovery from severe storms and tsunamis,
<P>
<LI>Work with public agencies to enable more efficient and effective evacuation and recovery plans, 
<P>
<LI>Assist local governments in dealing with the impact of chemical/oil spills by providing economic evaluation techniques, information on impacts, and more effective ways for recovery,
<P>
<LI>Assessment and prediction of fluctuating water levels on the Great Lakes, and
<P>
<LI>Provide better building codes to protect development investments.
<P>
<LI>Assist local governments and developers in incorporating water availability limitations, erosion rates and setbacks, and coastal building codes into development activities so as to increase returns on investments.
<P>
<LI>Assess and predict water levels on the Great Lakes.
</UL>
<H3>
Safety at Sea -
</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Design and test new equipment to increase safety in coastal operations and disasters,
<P>
<LI>Develop and deliver training programs for fishing vessels to increase the crew's ability to survive and work productively in a hazardous environment, and
<P>
<LI>Understand better the physiological and psychological barriers to safer diving procedures.
</UL>
<H3>
<A NAME="3C">WHY SEA GRANT AND WHY NOW?</A>
<P>
What is the Challenge to Sea Grant?
</H3>
The challenge facing the nation is to recognize that the risk from natural hazards and accidents is relatively high and costly and that current trends strongly indicate that this risk is going to increase and cause the quality of life in coastal areas to deteriorate unless specific measures are taken to lower the risks.  In tackling the impacts of coastal development, it is imperative that there be tools and infrastructure that do not destroy the assets that make the coast attractive.  In promoting safety at sea, the challenge is train fishermen to recognize the importance of planning and preparing for emergencies, develop behaviors and equipment which minimize hazardous situations, occur, and provide the best available technology/information to support safe diving practices.  
<P>
Sea Grant provides an excellent mechanism for pursuing coordinated efforts, where local and other support can be joined with state and federal monies to fund needed research and technology transfer and to scaleup activities.  For example, Sea Grant MAS program leaders and extension agents can be valuable resources in helping bring the facts and benefits of NOAA's National Weather Service's modernization program, with its improved predictive and warning capabilities, to the maritime public and coastal communities.
<H3>
Why is Further Effort Needed?
</H3>
As the outreach arm of NOAA, Sea Grant provides the link to academia, business, other federal agencies, state and local agencies, and the general public to maximize use of the results of marine science research and education.  It is urgent that the trend toward more and more costly impacts from coastal disasters arising from more and more intensive coastal development be reversed. Each year, natural hazards, chemical/oil spills, accidents and the effects of coastal development create economic damages of increasingly huge dimensions.  Generating and transferring relevant information will save the nation countless costs, and reduce the loss of life because of the lack of preparation and prediction.
<H3>
<A NAME="3D">COASTAL AND NATURAL HAZARDS - KEY ACTION ITEM</A>
</H3>
Current projections for the environmental, economic and social risk from coastal natural hazards show an increasing trend because of a growing coastal population and a lack of fundamental understanding of the physical processes.  The basic Sea Grant framework of fundamental, problem-oriented and applied research, together with outreach through coastal hazard specialist/agents, and education by establishing information clearinghouses represents the basic strategy for reducing the risk of coastal hazards.  Sea Grant's efforts in coastal hazards will focus on the following areas:
<H3>
Severe Storms
</H3>
Severe storms fall into two categories--tropical and extratropical.  Tropical storms are usually called hurricanes and extratropical storms are usually referred to as Nor'easters on the East Coast. Both types are centered around low pressure areas.
<P>
Tropical storms are smaller in size but usually have higher wind speeds than extratropical storms. Extratropical storms can sometimes persist for days adding to the cumulative impact of destruction.  The hazard associated with the storms relates to winds, waves, and flooding. Because of low pressures, the storms can cause unusually high tides, called storm tides, which account for much of the hazard to life and property.  El Nino events in the Pacific are also responsible for increased water levels which contribute an additional difficulty in predicting coastal hazards on the West Coast.  Coastal storm damage on the East Coast is in the hundreds of millions to billion dollar range per year.
<P>
Most of the sediment transport along the shoreline and transport into navigation channels occurs during storms.  This sediment transport accounts for much of the erosion on the open coast, and the key locales in this processes are tidal inlets.  In recent years, there have also been several breaches in barrier islands due to storm-induced wave action and water levels.  These breaches cause unexpected new inlets to form which create a whole range of new problems where they occur.  The breaches have caused enormous losses of property, are a serious threat to human life, and interfere with navigation at adjacent previously existing inlets.  Sea Grant will focus on:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Understanding the relationship between storm intensity and hazards.
<P>
<LI>Evaluating the potential for hazard reduction and mitigation.
<P>
<LI>Investigating tidal inlet hydrodynamics and sediment transport to improve predictive numerical models, and improve technology for cross inlet sediment movements.
<P>
<LI>Expanding outreach and training efforts to include a cadre of coastal hazard specialist/agents, construction and insurance industries, information clearinghouses, and closer collaboration and coordination with emergency organizations and with researchers on making their research relevant to tackling coastal hazards.
</UL>
<H3>
Earthquakes and Tsunamis
</H3>
Tsunamis, often called tidal waves, are trains of very long period waves.  These waves are usually generated by the impulsive motion of the part of the ocean floor, which accompanies an earthquake.  Tsunamis are also generated by volcanic eruptions, landslides into the ocean and submarine slides.  These waves, which are quite small in deep water, can shoal to great heights in shallow water and can inundate coastal communities.  The worst relatively recent tsunami disaster in the U.S. killed about 120 people in Anchorage, Alaska, in 1964.  Several severe tsunamis have occurred in the Pacific recently; one killed over 100 people in Japan.  In the U.S., more people have been killed by tsunamis than by the direct affects of earthquakes.  The hazard potential is greatest along Pacific shorelines, but there is also risk in the Caribbean (Puerto Rico & Virgin Islands).  Prediction of tsunamis is difficult since they are usually caused by earthquakes.  To reduce the hazard, Sea Grant, in collaboration with the National Weather Service, will focus on: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Development of effective warning systems based on prediction research and the identification of coastal areas with high potential for flooding.
<P>
<LI>Development and application of improved methodologies and numerical models for estimating inundation associated with seabed earthquakes and other hazards associated with tsunamis.
<P>
<LI>Application of tsunami inundation modelling and related techniques to assist communities in developing inundation maps for evacuation and planning particularly for the U.S.  Pacific and Caribbean shorelines. 
</UL>
<H3>
Coastal Planning and Building Construction Techniques
</H3>
Today, the longterm success of planning depends on the availability and application of effective management tools, which must remain functional for the lifetime of the development.  The most critical management decisions are often determined in initial planning and design.  Private and government planning and the permitting of individual projects are often a one chance opportunity to separate appropriate use from an overload of the resources.  These initial decisions establish the coastal impacts for the functional lifetime of the development, typically the next 50 to 100 years or longer.  Sea Grant proposes to address the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Develop and refine land- and wateruse tools for private and government applications specific to coastal areas that can be used to guide longterm appropriate development.
<P>
<LI>Refine coastal construction techniques, materials and building codes to incorporate new technology and to insure consistent and proper application in building science.
<P>
<LI>Develop plans for post-disaster damage assessment, including evaluation of current and recommended building practices, mitigation planning, and other strategies.
<P>
<LI>Improve understanding of public perceptions of risk and of the social and economic impacts of coastal hazards and mitigation strategies.
</UL>
<H3>
Shoreline Process and Erosion
</H3>
Each year, tens of thousands of acres of land are lost to shoreline erosion due to natural and maninduced causes.  Shoreline accretion and openwater sedimentation is likewise affecting many coastal areas.  Understanding these processes and the being able to predict future changes are critical to successfully managing future development.  Existing and future development will be forced to deal with shoreline changes.
<P>
Commercial and recreational water use will depend on continued use of natural and manmaintained waterways for navigation.  Natural and maninduced sedimentation is already degrading the water quality in estuaries by restricting circulation.  Without a better understanding of land runoff and estuarine sedimentation interactions, this trend will continue.  Sea Grant efforts will focus on:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Development, refinement and application of existing wave, tide, current, sediment transport, and shoreline erosion models to hazard mitigation.
<P>
<LI>Explore costeffective techniques for sedimentation control, navigation maintenance, circulation enhancement, and beach nourishment.
<P>
<LI>Design and evaluate non-structural engineering alternatives to manage shoreline erosion. 
<P>
<LI>Transfer research findings to designers, planners, managers, regulators, and decision makers in forms usable for immediate application.
<P>
<LI>Develop a better understanding in the Great Lakes of the effects of nearshore seabed erosion during low water levels and its effects on shoreline change during high water levels.
<P>
<LI>Development of a better understanding of coastal sediment budgets and processes and their implications for shoreline development and hazard mitigation.
<P>
<LI>Develop an improved understanding of public perceptions of risk and of the social and economic impacts of shoreline processes and erosion strategies.
</UL>
<H3>
<A NAME="3E">SAFETY AT SEA - KEY ACTION ITEM</A>
</H3>
Sea Grant is experienced in dealing with safety issues relating to people and property in coastal environments.  Past research, educational programs, and technology transfer have resulted in the saving of life and property.  Foremost among these endeavors has been work with the diving and commercial fishing communities to promote safety and emergency preparedness.   Sea Grant will focus on the following areas:
<H3>
Vessel Stability Research
</H3>
Vessel stability is a function of hull design and weight distribution.  Improvements in hull design have tended to be made on a trial-and-error basis and can be severely affected by changes in fishing practices as fishermen respond to changes in fish availability and regulations.  Equipment aboard fishing vessels is frequently added with little thought to its cumulative effect on weight distribution, adding to the potential for capsizing.  Research is needed to provide the scientific basis for design and testing fishing vessels which maximize their inherent stability under extreme conditions.  Sea Grant will focus on:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Model development for computer design of stable, yet efficient fishing vessel hulls.
<P>
<LI>Effects of various environmental and loading stresses.
<P>
<LI>Field testing.
</UL>
<H3>
Equipment Design and Testing
</H3>
Fishing equipment is continually evolving and changing.  An example is the development of the Turtle Excluder Device.  Early designs were heavy and bulky and posed a safety hazard on deck. New designs eliminated that liability and increased efficiency.  Such issues will continue to arise and Sea Grant engineers will continue to provide research in developing gear that provides the safest alternatives.  New communications equipment, satellite technology, and materials will be surveyed and evaluated for use in fishing operations to enhance crew safety.
<H3>
Survival and Safety Training
</H3>
Current economics and management approaches to fishing exacerbates the safety problem in an already unsatisfactory situation.  Fishermen feel forced to fish even under unsafe environmental conditions.  Crew turnover is excessive and frequently results in an inexperienced crew unaware of safety issues and ill-prepared for emergencies.  Because of this situation, the Commercial Fishing Vessel Safety Act of 1988 mandated the need to have at least one crew member, certifiably trained in safety, aboard commercial vessels at all times.  The act also required certain equipment aboard vessels such as  survival suits, life rafts and emergency position indicating radio beacons.  It required the U.S.  Coast Guard to implement the act, a task it is ill-prepared to handle, but for which Sea Grant is well-equipped because of its existing cadre of commercial fishing specialists who already teach safety training to some extent.  The Coast Guard quickly recognized this and depends on Sea Grant's capability for implementing the training aspects of the act.  This work will continue and consist of:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Developing training materials, manuals, modules for use regionally and nationally.
<P>
<LI>Providing formal training workshops concerning subjects such as firefighting, use of survival equipment, proper radio communication in emergency situations, and emerging regulations.
<P>
<LI>Transferring new state-of-the-art equipment into the industry.
</UL>
<H3>
Recreational and Commercial Diving
</H3>
The recreational, scientific and small commercial diving communities are increasing their use of mixed gases to extend their working time underwater.  They are now performing nitrox diving operations for which either the current decompression tables have never been proven or no tables/procedures exist.  Sea Grant has an opportunity to provide the necessary guidance to develop safe nitrox diving procedures.  Sea Grant research and extension activities will include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Practical operations--procedures including decompression table development.
<P>
<LI>Safety--certification/training requirements, epidemiological information on divingrelated accidents and fatalities, and diving accident management.
<P>
<LI>Medical aspects--treatment of divingrelated accidents, hyperbaric equipment, emergency equipment, procedures and protocol, and diving in remote locations.
<P>
<LI>Environmental impacts on divers--hazardous materials and pathogens, ambient temperatures, and psychological concerns.
<P>
<LI>Fundamental hyperbaric physiological research--all levels from cellular to systemic that address decompression table development.
<P>
<LI>Data dissemination--workshops/symposiums, papers, abstracts, bibliographies, and data repositories.
</UL>
<H3>
<A NAME="3F">WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS TO THE NATION?</A>
</H3>
An informed public will make better decisions about its use of and involvement in coastal areas. The nation will realize savings from the costs of responding to disasters that are currently exacerbated by lack of knowledge for the public to prevent, mitigate or respond.  Restoration costs will be reduced by more responsible building and use of the coastal environment.
<P>
The cost of private and public insurance would be reduced.  This would occur because disasters raise premium costs everywhere but, if insurance companies are assured of better building standards, they will tend to reinsure and thereby reduce longerterm costs.  Damages from coastal storms often extend considerable distances inland.  Therefore, these efforts will help inland communities by saving money and lives.
<P>
A wellinformed population will deal more competently with the effects of spills.  Costs, that are sometimes very large, will be reduced by: introducing new technology to prevent spills; introducing bioremediation techniques for cheaper cleanup; devising better plans for evacuation and response to spills; developing innovative economic and social tools to evaluate economic losses and to assess social conflicts/upheaval, leading to more effective mitigation and response; and ensuring more efficient and wider community response through education and information transfer.  
<P>
Improved vessel stability, better equipment and increased safety of fishermen will reduce the cost of fishing and increase economic returns for the industry.  Reduction of fishing hazards through training and improved equipment will decrease the cost of insurance and personnel costs.
<P>
A major benefit to the nation will be the reduction in loss of human lives and the economic-social costs associated with such losses through improved diving and treatment procedures.  Numerous technological efforts by Sea Grant also will help stimulate the nation's economy.  Additional benefits include: increased productivity for science and commercial divers; less risk and improved performance for search and rescue divers; increased enjoyment for recreational divers with less risk and longer, deeper, safer dives; and a resumption of the world leadership role for the U.S.  in diving safety and physiology.

<A NAME="1">INTRODUCTION</A>
</H2>
Investment in the health of the nation's marine, coastal and Great Lakes resources returns in the form of sustainable development and protection of life and property.  Sea Grant, an issue-based marine science program, will draw upon its partnership of people, universities, government and businesses to ensure a technically trained work force and a scientifically and environmentally informed citizenry in the 21st century.   Sea Grant is uniquely placed as NOAA's contact and conduit to educational resources.  Through education and training, Sea Grant will help position the U.S. to be competitive in the global economy.
<P>
In an increasingly complex and crowded world, the need for awareness, expertise and information is rapidly growing.  Traditional jobs along the coasts and elsewhere are declining and being replaced by service and communications businesses.  Changing demographics, particularly the increases in minority populations, are not reflected in professions in marine science, education, and resource management programs.  Innovative media mechanisms are not being fully utilized to bring the latest and most useful information to an anxious public and community decision makers. Skilled technicians and practitioners are needed to keep the nation competitive in the 21st century. Economic development may be limited by scientists and engineers who lack appropriate cutting edge expertise, and  by a lack of representation of culturally diverse elements of American society. 
<H3>
SEA GRANT'S VISION FOR 2005
</H3>
Sea Grant visualizes a higher quality of life by developing an informed citizenry and producing highly qualified professionals. Cultivation of marine environmental awareness and expertise in the nation's work force will facilitate integration of environmental criteria into engineering and business decisions and support diffusion of environmental technologies.  Directed flow of research-based information is central to innovation and sustainable development.
<H3>
SEA GRANT'S STRATEGY
</H3>
Through partnerships with universities, government, citizens groups and businesses, Sea Grant will direct its multidisciplinary expertise to address the following issues:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Demographic changes in the work force and in the increasing coastal population.
<P>
<LI>Use of emerging science and technologies to provide new knowledge to target audiences via electronic highways, remote sensing and information retrieval.
<P>
<LI>Improve the formal education  system (K-12 plus higher education) by infusing marine science information in precollege education through teacher training. 
<P>
<LI>Increase the diversity of marine scientists and engineers in undergraduate and graduate programs.
<P>
<LI>Develop opportunities to train and retrain resource managers, planners and policy makers to deal with problems created by multiple and conflicting uses of coastal and marine resources.
<P>
<LI>Increase public understanding of science and technology by using innovative media mechanisms, informal education, public facilities, and electronic formats. 
</UL>
<H3>
THE PROGRAM 
</H3>
<B>A Highly Trained Work Force -</B> Through support of undergraduate and graduate education, and through skill-based training, Sea Grant institutions will produce a cadre of highly trained scientists and engineers that will be in a position to lead the nation into the 21st century.  Global competition depends upon production of highly skilled technicians and world-class researchers entering the work force.
<P>
<B>A Scientifically and Environmentally Informed Citizenry -</B> Sea Grant will design and implement education programs that utilize marine and coastal information within local contexts to complement national systemic education movements.  Teaching the teacher will promote change in the formal education system by multiplying the marine experience to new generations of youth. Sea Grant's public outreach program, through its Marine Advisory Service and communications networks, will effect changes in the informal education system as it interprets and synthesizes information for ever larger audiences.
<H3>
EXPECTED BENEFITS
</H3>
<UL>
<LI>A better trained and more diverse cadre of scientists and engineers will increase the nation's competitive position in the world marketplace. 
<P>

OVERVIEW
<P>
What is Sea Grant's Vision for 2005?
</H3>
Sea Grant will provide national leadership to develop well-prepared professionals who understand the changing nature of science and research in marine and coastal problems and make wise decisions concerning resource management.
<H3>
Relationship to Department of Commerce Goals
</H3>
To address national needs, Sea Grant will  help increase the pool of well-trained, capable technicians and scientists qualified to provide coastal environmental assessment, prediction, and stewardship for the nation.  Through education and training, Sea Grant will help position the U.S. to be competitive in the global economy.
<H3>
What are the Problems?
</H3>
Although, studies show that continuing career opportunities exist for graduates in science, mathematics and engineering, published research on science education concludes that science teaching and learning need to be improved nationally.  Sea Grant will assist in developing a workforce capable of world class research and applying the results of scientific research to develop new products which will compete successfully on the world market.  In addition, the growth in coastal population and the need to address increasing coastal conflicts requires more scientifically literate policy makers.  Finally, training opportunities need to be provided to fishermen, seafood processors, and small businesses which are the pillar of the U.S. coastal economy.
<P>
Women, minorities and those with disabilities are underrepresented in the field of marine science and policy.  Much of this underrepresentation in science and policy starts very early in the educational process--a point at which Sea Grant can make a difference through its K-12 focus.
<H3>
<A NAME="2B">WHAT KEY ACTIONS ARE PROPOSED?</A>
</H3>
<UL>
<LI><B>Scientists and Engineers -</B> Assure the supply, quality and diversity of marine and coastal scientists and engineers within the work force.
<P>
<LI><B>Resource Managers -</B> Assure the supply, quality and diversity of coastal and marine resource managers within the work force.
<P>
<LI><B>Technical Training -</B> Increase opportunities for marine technical training and access to applied research related to coastal commerce.
</UL>
<H3>
<A NAME="2C">WHY SEA GRANT AND WHY NOW?</A>
<P>
What is the Challenge to Sea Grant?
</H3>
The education challenge is to meet the changing nature of the needs for a highly trained and diverse work force focusing on the coastal and marine arena.
<H3>
What is the Relationship to the Sea Grant and the NOAA Mission?
</H3>
Sea Grant will assist in the education of professionals who become the best talent in a highly competitive market.  These professionals will provide a work force available not only to NOAA but also to the nation and the world as a whole.
 <H3>
What is Being Done Now?
</H3>
Each year, Sea Grant researchers collectively train about 500 graduate and undergraduate students to solve coastal and marine problems in science, engineering and coastal policy.  The availability of research assistantships, scholarships, and fellowships insures that the best and the brightest students are brought into marine fields.  These include the national-level John Knauss Marine Policy Fellowship, the Industrial Fellowships, state fellowships and internships, and professional opportunities for students in many disciplines, many of which bring them into relevant problem-solving settings.  Research assistantships are the bread and butter of graduate and university training, and insure that highly motivated and trained graduates enter the workforce.
<H3>
Why is Further Effort Needed?
</H3>
Continuing demand for well-trained professionals in marine science engineering and policy is the rationale for continued effort to provide the best education opportunities.  The underrepresentation of gender and cultural diversity in the marine and coastal arenas requires inclusion in training and employment considerations.
<P>
A larger and more knowledgeable set of policy makers, well acquainted with solving coastal problems, is needed to meet the demands caused by the growing number of conflicts due to increasing pressures on coastal resources.  Furthermore, individuals who work in marine trades along the coast need access to evolving regulations and research results to make their work more productive and sustainable, 
<H3>
<A NAME="2D">SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS - KEY ACTION ITEM</A>
</H3>
The nation requires a reliable supply of qualified scientists and engineers in marine and coastal fields.  To meet this need, Sea Grant will continue to provide fellowships and research assistantships to highly qualified students.  To complement this program, Sea Grant will:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Evaluate and expand a fellowship program with industry in which qualified graduate students will conduct research within a corporate setting under both academic and industrial supervision.  The results of this endeavor will enhance the transfer of technology between university and industry scientists and engineers, infuse a coastal problem solving component into graduate education, and focus fiscal and intellectual resources on mutual problems. Potential opportunities lie in the engineering, seafood and fisheries, aquaculture and travel/tourism sectors.
<P>
<LI>Increase entry and advancement of minorities and women in the research and engineering fields.
<P>
<LI>Continue undergraduate and graduate assistantships for the best students in marine sciences.
</UL>
<H3>
<A NAME="2E">RESOURCE MANAGERS - KEY ACTION ITEM</A>
</H3>
Increasing coastal population accompanied by demographic changes brings new problems requiring expertise in resource management and conflict resolution. To meet the growing need for policy and resource managers at all levels of government, Sea Grant will:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Increase the number of decision makers with post-graduate education in natural resource management.
<P>
<LI>Develop outreach programs that provide integrated ecosystem management tools to local decision makers who often act in isolation without understanding the complexities of ecosystem relationships.  New tools and state of the art application such as remote sensing, geographic information systems, and interactive data bases will be utilized.
<P>
<LI>Develop outreach programs to address emerging resource issues such as habitat restoration and water quality, providing information to local state and federal decision makers.
</UL>
<H3>
<A NAME="2F">TECHNICAL TRAINING - KEY ACTION ITEM</A>
</H3>
With realignment of the U.S. economy away from primary manufacturing and natural resource extraction, a need exists to focus human resource development on the emerging communications and service sectors related to marine resources.  The workers of tomorrow need post secondary training to obtain skills to work in a changing  environment.  Training, retraining and job-to-work programs for marine industries such as boat building, marine electronics, aquaculture, recreation and tourism are important components for the future.  The greatest increase is predicted to take place in the leisure business.  To foster relevant technical and marine trades career training, efforts will be undertaken to:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Develop a partnership between the recreation industry and Sea Grant to train or retrain people to enter this growing job market.
<P>
<LI>Establish an economic guide to predict marine skills needed for the next decade and beyond. The results will assist in establishing priorities for community/technical college and pre-college curricula.

<H3>
OVERVIEW
<P>
What is Sea Grant's Vision for 2005?
</H3>
Sea Grant will be a leader in providing environmental information, science and technology to the general public as well as in the precollege education system in marine-aquatic arenas.  Sea Grant will be recognized as a primary marine and aquatic education and communication program through its work to enhance public knowledge about and stewardship of marine, coastal, and Great Lakes resources.
<H3>
Relationship to Department of Commerce Goals
</H3>
The U. S. Department of Commerce includes achievement of environmental stewardship as a prime goal in its mission statement.  Achieving stewardship clearly cannot be accomplished without public involvement, knowledge and awareness.  Furthermore, the White House Office of Science and Technology report,  ³Science in the National Interest,² (1994), stated:  ³This country must sustain world leadership in science, mathematics, and engineering if we are to meet the challenges of today...and of tomorrow.²
<P>
The report also stated as a major goal improvement in scientific and technological literacy of all Americans so that citizens can make informed choices while fulfilling their lifelong responsibilities. This goal is relevant both to formal and informal education systems.  Sea Grant has the capability and experience to provide educational avenues, materials and leadership for meeting this national goal.
<H3>
What are the Problems?
</H3>
As the 21st century approaches social pluralism and cultural diversity will become increasingly important considerations for resource managers and information providers.  The problem is that demographic changes and economic development are outstripping the ability to cope with the changes they bring to coastal areas.  Education, involvement and, ultimately, stewardship need to be accelerated in all coastal environments, or the U.S. will lose its economic base of natural resources. 
<P>
Cultivating contacts with and educating media professionals about coastal and marine issues via Sea Grant's communications network can bring even more up-to-date coastal and marine information to a larger and broader public through use of the mass media, including  television, cable, and radio. Through its education, outreach, and communications capabilities, Sea Grant will bring the latest scientific and technical advances from the academic sector to the public realm in a timely fashion.
<H3>
<A NAME="3B">WHAT KEY ACTIONS ARE PROPOSED?</A>
</H3>
<UL>
<LI><B>Precollege Education -</B> Design and implement education programs to complement the National State Systemic initiatives (NSF) to reform education by providing information, curricula and training both to precollege teachers and their students.
<P>
<LI><B>Informal Education -</B> Increase public understanding of science through nonformal education avenues, including facilities such as museums and aquaria; electronic and print media; and life-long learning programs.  Respond to increasing demands for marine information by the growing and aging population.
</UL>
<H3>
<A NAME="3C">WHY SEA GRANT AND WHY NOW?</A>
<P>
What is the Challenge to Sea Grant?
</H3>
The key challenge is to develop a scientifically and environmentally informed citizenry from the young child to the older citizen.  Coastal issues such as declining water quality, degraded estuarine habitats, and multiple use conflicts require an informed public aware of the issues and of potential solutions.  Common information, built on a solid scientific base, will bring diverse groups together and provide a basis for collaborative working relations.  
<P>
Sea Grant will be an information broker of unbiased scientific, outreach and education results to provide the nation a steady flow of coastal, marine, and Great Lakes information.  Sea Grant has an important role to play in enhancing public stewardship by training education leaders who then influence generations of students and the expanding adult audience for science information. Training of informal educators who work at  public aquaria, science museums, and nature centers--either as docents, education program coordinators, or volunteer environmental monitors--enables them to reach increasingly diverse and larger audiences.
<H3>
What is the Relationship to the Sea Grant and the NOAA Mission?
</H3>
The relationship of Sea Grant to NOAA rests on the university partnership and dissemination network within Sea Grant.  This supports NOAA's mission to become the premier source for atmospheric and oceanic science education.  That goal, which Sea Grant enhances, will enable the U.S. population to make sound economic, environmental and public safety decisions, now and in the future, in regard to the coastal environment.
<H3>
What is Being Done Now?
</H3>
At present, Sea Grant programs have both state and regional education activities, including formal and in informal ventures.   In the formal sphere, Sea Grant educators develop and disseminate new curricular materials, conduct teacher-training workshops, and provide field training for precollege students.  Two recent examples of how the Sea Grant mechanism works are the Sea Grant global change education workshops and the interagency cooperation with the U.S. Navy, 
<P>
Department of Interior, and NOAA¹s National Environmental, Satellite, Data, and Information Service to conduct regional Operation Pathfinder summer training courses for teachers. 
<P>
In the informal sphere, Sea Grant advisory personnel and their programs via the 4-H, Scouts, museums, environmental camps, interpretive centers, sanctuaries, aquaria and parks have reached more than three million people.  For the past 12 years, Sea Grant programs have provided leadership and organization for the nationwide marine debris volunteer beach clean-ups.  Another major project that is operating on a regional scale is global change education--train the trainers--that uses teleconferencing to create a national live-time educational broadcast. In any given year, Sea Grant's communication network creates and markets hundreds of publications, videos, radio programs, and other products designed to increase public knowledge about coastal and marine resources and issues.
<H3>
Why is Further Effort Needed? 
</H3>
The environmental and demographic conditions in the coastal margin require an informed citizenry for understanding and action.  The continuing need for  future scientists and engineers in the marine fields, particularly women and minorities, requires early intervention in the education pipeline.  Although Sea Grant is not the only program to recognize these needs, it is well placed to establish a strong connection between scientific findings and public awareness, between research and public policy.
<H3>
<A NAME="3D">PRECOLLEGE EDUCATION - KEY ACTION ITEM</A>
</H3>
The precollege (K-12) educational system, which involves teachers and pupils in formal educational settings, has not met the U.S.'s need for informed graduates in science and mathematics.  During the coming decade, Sea Grant educators will design implement and assess education programs to complement the national systemic initiatives to improve K-12 education. The goal is to provide marine and coastal information and curricula that reflect a multidisciplinary knowledge base as well as a focus on issues important to local communities and ecosystems.
<P>
Sea Grant marine education has always stressed science but included other disciplines such as the social sciences, humanities, and the arts.  The main strategy for transferring this knowledge concentrates on teaching the teacher through inservice and preschool programs.  Sea Grant workshops and courses will not only take teachers into the marine environment where they will acquire hands-on experience but also bring researchers out of the laboratory and into dialogue for a direct transfer of knowledge to teachers.  The teachers multiply these experiences through their students over many years.  Updating and training new and veteran teachers is a long-term process requiring a sustained effort and repetitive programs to assure impact on the greatest number of teachers.  Other strategies include direct contact with youth through recurring school programs, summer camps and field trips.  During the next decade, Sea Grant will:  
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Increase the rate of information transfer of marine research conducted by NOAA and other agencies with marine and aquatic interests.
<P>
<LI>Promote career-long professional development where scientists work in partnership with practicing teachers to bring the excitement of marine research into the classroom.
<P>
<LI>Increase the use of the ³Electronic Highway² to acquire and analyze marine and coastal data and connect teachers with projects and people around the nation and globe.  This ties directly with distance learning strategies.
<P>
<LI>Develop curricula utilizing emerging technologies for data acquisitions such as remote sensors, interactive video,  hypertext, and data exchange.
<P>
<LI>Develop appropriate assessment techniques to evaluate and improve education programs and efforts.
<P>
<LI>Increase linkages with other education efforts within NOAA and other federal and state agencies and national education projects to enhance collaboration.  
<P>
<LI>Increase partnerships with business and industry to validate career skills relevance.
<P>
<LI>Make special efforts to include minority teachers, teachers of minority students, and particularly students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds.
</UL>
<H3>
<A NAME="3E">INFORMAL EDUCATION - KEY ACTION ITEM</A>
</H3>
Informal education, that which occurs outside of the formal school classroom setting, has a broad audience.  It extends from organized programs such as docents and public lecture series to public walkthroughs in museums and aquaria to lifelong learning programs that focus on the needs of senior citizens.  
<P>
Informal education addresses the public desire for understanding science and is a critical component of Sea Grant's effort to disseminate information about coastal and marine issues. Their goal is to assist citizens to be informed decision makers.
<P>
During the next decade, Sea Grant researchers and educators have the potential to advise public groups that have marine educational programs and exhibits.  Within this role, research findings are transferred to the general public.  These are partnerships to be nurtured and encouraged because of the inherent interest of the large public audience.
<P>
The next century will see a powerful need for communicators to interpret and synthesize research into ideas and terms understandable by the lay public. Simply providing data is not enough--many of Sea Grant's audiences will want clarification, explanation and simplification.  More emphasis on using the mass media--cable and network television, radio, and newspapers--will enable Sea Grant to reach even wider audiences with timely information about coastal and marine topics.  Emerging technologies in communications such as CD ROM and interactive video will enable Sea Grant to produce materials of greater depth to the active learner.  These techniques will engage the viewer by requiring problem solving rather than passive watching.
<P>
During the next decade, Sea Grant will:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Identify research for incorporation into outreach programs that increase the public understanding of marine and aquatic systems.
<P>
<LI>Increase the flow of socioeconomic information between Sea Grant and resource managers.
<P>
<LI>Develop new, in-depth marine and coastal communication products on marine issues using existing media as well as emerging technologies.
<P>
<LI>Provide support for citizen-based education programs such as the marine debris projects, volunteer water-quality monitoring programs, and shoreline restoration which enable the public to become involved with environmental issues.
<P>
<LI>Provide assistance (funding and advice) to establish more interpretive and interactive exhibits in museums, aquaria, and other public facilities.
<P>
<LI>Extend to both national and international audiences relevant communications products and outreach programs originally emanating from local programs.
<P>
<LI>Target noncoastal and inland audiences, who rely on coastal resources for seafood and recreation, with information that shows the consequences their actions have on coastal ecosystem health. 
<P>
<LI>Maintain Sea Grant as a credible information source to the national media via concerted media relations efforts on ocean and coastal issues.
<P>
<LI>Explore new communication and education pathways for reaching culturally and economically diverse audiences.
</UL>

The decline of our environment is one of the major social problems facing the nation and the world. That decline is challenging science and technology, philosophy, economics, law and politics to develop policies that can effectively guide management and restoration of the environment. If we are to have any success in developing such policies, we must examine new ways of thinking about solutions that integrate all of our intellectual resources.
<P>
The Coastal and Environmental Policy Program (CEPP) is a pioneering approach to environmental problem-solving that pursues real-world solutions through policy research, education and public service across traditional disciplines of science, economics, law and philosophy.  Along with the <A HREF="../EFC/index.html">Environmental Finance Center</A>, CEPP is located at <A HREF="../index.html">Maryland Sea Grant</A>.
<BR>
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
The Coastal and Environmental Policy Program was part of a very successful <! A HREF="Teleconf.html">interactive teleconference on environmental finance</A> on September 13-14, 1995, which was broadcast from the University of Maryland to several locations nationwide using state-of-the-art interactive software.  This conference is a cooperative effort between CEPP, the Environmental Finance Center and the School of Public Affiars at the University of Maryland with the Environmental Finance Center at the University of New Mexico and the Municipal Technical Advisory Service at the University of Tennessee.
<P>
What distinguishes CEPP from traditional environmental studies is the capacity to view the ecosystem in the broadest possible sense. CEPP recognizes the vitally important interconnections among the natural and social sciences and the need to effectively integrate science, policy and management perspectives in a practical, conceptual framework. By fostering collaboration of institutions and human endeavors, CEPP seeks to build a strong foundation for effective environmental management and resource protection.<P>
<H3>CEPP Administration</H3>
The Coastal and Environmental Policy Program, formed in 1987, is a joint venture among the University of Maryland School of Law, School of Public Affairs, the Center for Environmental and Estuarine Studies (<A HREF="http://co.cees..edu">CEES</A>), Agriculture and Natural Resources and the Maryland Sea Grant. The Center for Global Change is an affiliate member. CEPP's programs serve and draw upon graduate students and faculty throughout the University System.

<H1>Mathias Medal</H1>
</CENTER>
One of Sea Grant's primary roles is to encourage outstanding scientific research in the service of sound environmental policy. To recognize the contributions of exemplary researchers who have contributed to informed policy in the Chesapeake Bay region, the Sea Grant programs of Maryland and Virginia and the Chesapeake Research Consortium have joined together to sponsor the Mathias Medal, awarded on a biennial basis to outstanding environmental researchers.
<P>
The Mathias Medal is named in honor of Charles "Mac" Mathias, retired U.S. Senator from Maryland, who was instrumental in helping to launch the current region-wide Chesapeake Bay restoration effort (see <A HREF="#BACKGROUND">History & Procedures</A> below for more details). 
<P>
Recipients of the Mathias Medal are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>1990 - <A HREF="Pritchard.html">Donald W. Pritchard</A> for his work in describing estuarine dynamics.

<A NAME="BACKGROUND"></A>
<H3>History & Procedures</H3>
In 1989, Maryland Sea Grant approached the Virginia Sea Grant Consortium and the Chesapeake Research Consortium expressing the concern that there are many opportunities for politicians and environmentalists to get recognition for there work in the public interest, but that scientists who try to delve into practical policy issues or seek to apply their expertise for the public good often go without recognition or are, in some case, are actually criticized by their colleagues for doing it.  It was proposed that the three programs ought to combine forces to offer recognition in the form of a publicly presented award to scientists who serve the public in this way.  Sea Grant recommended that Senator Charles "Mac" McC. Mathias, former Senator from Maryland, who is considered to be the "father" the contemporary Chesapeake Bay Restoration Program be honored in naming the medal.  Senator Mathias is regarded as a politician who recognized the value of science for the public good, and who reached out frequently to seek the input of the scientific community for that purpose.  Accordingly, Drs. Chris D'Elia, Joseph Mihursky, and William Rickards, Directors of Maryland Sea Grant, the Chesapeake Research Consortium, and Virginia Sea Grant, respectively, collaborated to establish a science medal award.
<P>
Drs. Mihursky and D'Elia met with Senator Mathias on June 6, 1989 to ask him to lend his name to the medal.  Being a modest and self-effacing person, he felt that he did not deserve such special recognition.  However, he did agree to do it.  Accordingly, a photographer was sent to the (retired) Senator's office to take photographs to use in designing the medal. Dr. Jack Greer of Maryland Sea Grant assumed the responsibility of the medal production process.  It was collectively decided to develop a bronze medal with a face profile on the front and the three founding institutions listed on the back.  A laser engraving was made and fifty medals were cast by the firm <I>The Protocol Groups Inc.</I>   of Danbury, Connecticut.  Fifty medals were produced.
<P>
A Mathias Medal archival file has been established and initially includes this historical account of the establishment of the medal and our protocols.  It is to include also a copy of the curriculum vitae of each medal recipient and any appropriate photographs or video productions.  This material is presently housed at Maryland Sea Grant at College Park.

<H1>Donald W. Pritchard<BR>
1990</H1>
</CENTER>
Researcher Donald W. Pritchard won the first Mathias Medal, in recognition of scientific excellence and outstanding contributions to our understanding of the Chesapeake Bay.
<P>
Because of his seminal work dealing with the fundamental characteristics of the Chesapeake Bay during the early years of Bay research, Pritchard was seen as a highly deserving recipient by the selection committee, which was itself made up of well-known scientists and other leaders in the Bay community.
<P>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
Pritchard, an internationally acclaimed physical oceanographer, developed a classification scheme (now a textbook standard) for the water circulation processes of the Chesapeake as well as other estuarine systems. He served as director of The Johns Hopkins University's Chesapeake Bay Institute from 1949 to 1973 and as the senior research scientist there from 1973 until 1979. In those capacities, and as chairman of The Johns Hopkins Department of Oceanography from 1950 to 1968, he helped establish the scientific agenda and management policy for the Chesapeake.
<P>
He most recently served as a professor and dean at the Marine Science Research Center at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.
<P>
Originally trained as a meteorologist at U.C.L.A., Pritchard forecasted sea and swell conditions for amphibious landing operations in Normandy and the Pacific during World War II.  He received his Ph.D. in oceanography at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography at the University of California, La Jolla in 1952.

Pritchard has served on numerous regional, national and international boards, com-missions and committees and has provided expert testimony on coastal matters. Among the many honors he has received are the Honorary Doctor of Science Degree from the College of William and Mary in 1985 and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region II Annual Environmental Award in 1987.
<P>
Highlights of the awards ceremony, held at the National Aquarium in Baltimore on the evening of December 5th,  1990, were the introductory remarks made by Pritchard's long-time friend and fellow Bay researcher, <A HREF="Cronin.html">Dr. Eugene Cronin</A>, and the remarks Pritchard made himself as he accepted the award.
<P>
The Mathias Medal was sponsored by the Sea Grant programs of Maryland and Virginia and by the Chesapeake Research Consortium, whose members include the major research institutions in the Bay region. Senator Mathias' son, Charlie Mathias, Jr., who had joined his father on a series of voyages during the 1970s to investigate the Bay's health, presented the award to Professor Pritchard.

</CENTER>
L. Eugene Cronin has been a student of the Chesapeake Bay and other estuaries since 1940.  He is a zoologist by education, but has spent most of his career in administration.  His home was in Aberdeen, MD, his undergraduate education at Western Maryland College, and graduate research at the University of Maryland.
<P>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
His research and publications have been related to the biology of blue crabs, fish, oysters, and zooplankton and to the problems of pollution, resource management and the deterioration of' the Chesapeake Bay.
<P>
He directed the Chesapeake Biological Laboratory of the University of Maryland for 20 years, established the Marine Laboratory of the University of Delaware, and directed the Chesapeake Research Consortium for 7 years.  The Consortium comprised the Johns Hopkins University, the University of, Maryland, the Smithsonian Institution and the Institute of Marine Science of the College of William and Mary.  He served as Liaison Scientist for the U. S Office of Naval Research, visiting marine laboratories throughout Western Europe.
<P>
Dr. Cronin has served on the Marine Board of the National Research Council, chaired the Environmental Advisory Board of the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, and has been on a large  number of local, national and international commissions and boards. He has been a consultant for 15 agencies and institutions. He works now as a coastal consultant and lecturer.
<P>
In professional affairs, he has been President of the National Shellfisheries Associations, Atlantic Estuarine Research Society, and the internationa1 Estuarine Research Federation.  He has had a long association with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, the Alliance for the Chesapeake Bay and other organizations.  He received an honorary doctorate from Western Maryland College and awards from a variety of sources, including the Isaac Walton League of America, the Oyster Institute of North America, Office of Naval Research, the Army Corps of Engineers, the American Motors Conservation Award, Chesapeake Appreciation Days, and as an honorary "Admiral of the Chesapeake Bay".
<P>
Present interests have reverted to the problems of effective management of the blue crab, the Chesapeake¹s greatest living resource, and the preservation of important natural areas.  His principal hobby is the collection of working duck decoys from the Chesapeake area and other coastal sites.
<P>
Dr. and Mrs. Cronin reside at Bay Ridge, near Annapolis, MD.

</TD></TR></TABLE>

Other governmental appointments have included the USEPA Chesapeake Bay Nonpoint Pollution Committee, 1977-78; the Advisory Committee and the Technical Liasion Committee of the Virginia-North Carolina Chowan River Basin Commission, 1979-83; the Virginia State Board of Certification for Water and Wastewater Treatment Plant Operators, 1979-86; the Lower James River Water Quality Management Advisory and Technical Advisory Committees, 1983-88; Virginia appointee to the Chesapeake Bay Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee, 1985-95, where he is currently serving a second two-year term as Chair; the Virginia State Water Control Board  (SWCB) Nutrient Standards Technical Advisory Committee, 1986-88; the Science Advisory Committee of the Virginia SWCB, 1991-94; the Virginia-Israel Water Resources Management Cooperative Effort, 1988; and the Virginia Chesapeake Bay Project Partnership Council since 1995.
<P>
Dr. Randall introduced biological nutrient removal (BNR) wastewater treatment to the Chesapeake Bay area in 1984, and worked with the Hampton Roads Sanitation District from 1986-90 to develop the public domain patented VIP process, now in operation at the 40 MGD Norfolk Plant for over 4 years. A similar plant will begin operating at Suffolk, Virginia in 1997. He has worked closely with the Maryland Department of the Environmental since 1987 to develop and implement BNR processes at municipal plants throughout Maryland. These efforts have resulted in the modification and operation of more than 15 BNR plants in Maryland, including development of the VT2 Process now operating at Bowie, and the IFAS Process in operation at both the Annapolis and Anne Arundel County Cox Creek plants.  Other efforts in Virginia, Delaware and Pennsylvania have resulted in modification of another 15 Bay watershed plants for BNR, and 21 waste-water treatment plants are currently being evaluated for BNR implementation.
<P>
Active in professional organizations, Dr. Randall is currently President of the Association of Environmental Engineering Professors, the USA Representative on the Scientific and Technical Committee of the Removal Specialty Group of the IAWQ, and Vice-Chair of the Wastewater Management Committee of the Environmental Engineering Division of the American Society of Civil Engineers.

Efforts to restore Chesapeake Bay fisheries and to develop the expertise for successful aquaculture enterprises have increasingly turned to the findings of scientific research.  Conceptually, this research has demonstrated that if we are to restore and protect the Bay's major commercial and recreational species, we must understand how they function in the aquatic ecosystem. Studies that will in the long run deliver the knowledge resource managers need for restoring Bay fisheries must rely on ecosystem-based science. Such research aims to explain the network of interactions that affect the health of species such as oysters, striped bass and blue crabs.
<P>
Towards these ends, our major objectives are to:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Develop an understanding of the basic processes regulating population recruitment and health
<P>
<LI>Determine how these processes are affected by human activities and environmental events
<P>
<LI>Provide decision-makers with interpretive information they will need for developing sound fishery management policy
<P>
<LI>Provide advanced knowledge for improving aquaculture production
</UL><P>
The sophisticated understanding that follows the achievement of these objectives will serve the development of valuable methods for improving resource habitat, for protecting wild fisheries and for advancing the state-of-the-art in aquaculture.

Maryland Sea Grant has long had an active interest in coastal and estuarine policy, particularly in such areas as nutrient control, the role of aquaculture and the leasing of private oyster grounds -- issues hotly debated in Maryland. For example:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>An early Sea Grant book, <CITE>Maryland's Oysters: Research and Management</CITE>, detailed the complex relationships between the historical management of the public and private oyster fisheries in Maryland, and their relation to scientific findings and recommendations.
<P>
<LI>More recently, Sea Grant organized a workshop to help address a reevaluation by the Chesapeake Bay Program of its plan to reduce nutrients by 40 percent.  The result is a report, <CITE>Dissolved Oxygen in the Chesapeake Bay: A Scientific Consensus</CITE>.
</UL>
<P>
Maryland Sea Grant has strengthened its ties with other units of the University of Maryland System concerned with coastal policy.  The most significant is its affiliation with the System's Coastal and Environmental Policy Program (CEPP).  Established by the Maryland General Assembly, CEPP serves as a System-wide means to respond to state needs in coastal policy issues.

Maryland Sea Grant has long been committed to the development of new technologies for advanced research in marine science, particularly molecular biology and biotechnology approaches for producing faster growing fish and shellfish. Over the last several years, we have expanded that research support to include the potential of valuable compounds from marine organisms for pharmaceuticals and as natural inhibitors to biofouling. We are employing university-wide expertise in advanced computer remote sensing and engineering technologies to complement our support of environmental research for improving water quality in the Chesapeake Bay watershed.

<A NAME="WRIGHT"></A><H2>Temperature/Salinity Tolerance and Salt Regulation in the larvae of Dreissena polymorpha (R/ZM-02)</H2>
The zebra mussel invasion, first evident in Lake St. Clair in 1988, has spread rapidly through the Great Lakes and into rivers in North America. The effects have already been overwhelming for some aquatic ecosystems as well as industries which depend on water use.
<P>
Zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) colonies have flourished in water intake pipes to thicknesses that have been measured in feet-the costs to remove these mussels have been extraordinarily high. The mussels have also had a profound impact on food webs, outcompeting other filter-feeding organisms, and physically swamping bottom-dwelling animals by their shell production and their copious deposits of feces and mucus. 
<P>
Just how much of an impact zebra mussels can have on the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem will likely depend on temperature and salinity conditions. Though considered a freshwater organism, zebra mussels have also grown well in brackish waters. To date, no detailed information on the tolerance of zebra mussels to temperature-salinity combinations found in the Bay is available.
<P>
In this project, David Wright and Victor Kennedy are investigating the environmental tolerance of larvae in order to produce a predictive set of relationships that relate combinations of temperature salinity to mussel growth and survival. Such information will provide resource management agencies-with a solid basis for developing protective measures to limit the spread of these organisms.<P>

<A NAME="KENNEDY"></A><H2>Swimming and Settlement Behavior in the Quagga Mussel (R/ZM-03)</H2>
In 1992, a second invasive mussel was discovered in the Great Lakes. Though it appears to resemble the zebra mussel, molecular evidence indicates that this "quagga mussel" is indeed a different species. If it disperses as rapidly and effectively as the zebra mussel, it too could spread widely in North America with damaging effects on the ecology of lake and river systems as well as on industries such as electrical generation plants.
<P>
Of particular concern is the initial observation that the quagga mussel can tolerate salinities higher than the zebra. Some of the methods such plants use to control zebra mussels and, potentially, quagga mussels, can be costly, inefficient or environmentally undesirable. As a consequence, environmentally benign methods of control are of great interest.
<P>
The most effective stage of control would be the free-swimming larval stage, before settlement when the mussel would already be well established. Development of such deterrence depends on understanding the behavior of mussel larvae with regards to:<P>
<DL>
<DD><UL><LI>their reaction to gravity</UL>
<DD><UL><LI>temperature and salinity changes</UL>
<DD><UL><LI>light levels</UL>
<DD><UL><LI>low dissolved oxygen</UL>
</DL><P>
By studying their repertoire of behaviors, Victor Kennedy will be able to detail the similarities between both zebra and quagga mussels and may be able to develop recommendations for preventive actions industries such as power plants could take to inhibit their settlement in water intake systems.<P>

<A NAME="STEVENSON"></A><H2>Multiscale Modeling of Coastal Landscape Dynamics (R/PT-03)</H2>
While the Chesapeake Bay cleanup has had some success in reversing environmental damage caused by increasing population, the threat posed by rising sea level and land subsidence has yet to be fully addressed. 
<P>The Blackwater River watershed on Maryland's Eastern Shore is among the most threatened of the state's coastal marshes and shorelines. It is an ecologically rich wetland habitat that historically has been an important spawning area for many species of anadromous fish and a major wintering habitat for water fowl. However, recent erosion rates have been extremely high, and there is a concern that the area's ecological values are being rapidly lost.
<P>
To slow erosion and subsidence, new restoration strategies are needed, from artificially nourishing habitat marshes to placing tide gates in strategic locations to lessen the impacts of high salinity intrusions. Alternative strategies depend on understanding the natural and manmade changes that have occurred historically in the watershed. This information will be used to develop simulation models to project future changes under various management and climate scenarios.
<P>
To develop such models, Court Stevenson and Robert Costanza will employ aerial photographs, surface level surveys and other sources from 1850 to 1989 to prepare land cover maps. From these they will develop computer models that can address questions such as how wetland habitat in the Blackwater River watershed has changed over time, what the major causes of these changes are, and what will be the most effective restoration strategies to halt habitat decline.<P>

The Toxics Research Program, a joint initiative with the <A HREF="../../VASG/index.html">Virginia Sea Grant Program</A> and the <A HREF="http://155.206.19.100/NCBOhome.html">NOAA Chesapeake Bay Program Office</A>, forms part of the Chesapeake Bay Environmental Effects Research Program.  Its goals are to understand how Chesapeake Bay ecosystem processes influence the transport, fate and effects of toxicants and how toxicants can affect ecological processes, including trophic dynamics.  These goals are being accomplished through a multi-year, coordinated, interdisciplinary and inter-institutional research program, supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency.
<P>
To date, studies supported by this program have documented the accumulation, transport and concentration of representative toxics in the Bay.  The key research challenge is to determine what impact these  contaminants have on the Chesapeake ecosystem.  Current studies described here focus on how toxics enter the Bay's food chain and how they may affect the survival and productivity of living resources.

Sea Grant-sponsored research stimulates new ways of looking at our marine resources.  A major Sea Grant objective is to serve as a catalyst for the sharing of information about resources from our oceans, rivers and estuaries.  The focus is on marine science and affairs - special concerns are the Chesapeake Bay, its ecology and valuable fisheries, and the relationships between science and policy.
<P>
These materials are intended for a diverse audience that includes researchers, educators, students, resource managers, fishermen, seafood processors, marina owners, shippers, recreational boaters and legislators.

Sea Grant extension agents provide the first point of contact for citizens within different regions of the state.  They are supported by a staff of specialists  in these areas:  finfish, shellfish, water quality, economics and seafood production.  The entire staff are also involved in providing information and advice to policy makers at the local, state and national levels on issues related to their areas of expertise.<P>

As  part of the <A HREF="http://www.agnr.umd.edu/CES/">Maryland Cooperative Extension Service</A>, the Maryland Sea Grant Extension Program can directly access other Extension staff to assist in addressing special problems.  Cooperative Extension personnel, for example, have assisted seafood processors in such areas as disposal of crab waste through composting, and developing a water quality assurance program.<P>

40 minutes. $20.00<P>
This award-winning film documents how scientists unlocked the key to the Chesapeake's tragic decline. It provides an excellent example of how scientific research can not only identify a specific problem (in this case the decline of underwater grasses in the Chesapeake Bay) but can also point toward the need for wide-ranging policies needed to solve it.

Beside the <A HREF="index.html">Maryland Sea Grant College</A>, the University of Maryland System (<A HREF="http://www.ums.edu">UMS</A>) has wide-ranging programs in marine science and policy which form a network of institutions located throughout the Chesapeake Bay and its watershed.  The network includes teaching campuses, a major marine biotechnology research center and regional offices for marine extension services.  It also includes the Coastal and Environmental Policy Program which brings together expertise throughout UMS to focus on critical policy-related issues.
<P>
The University of Maryland Center for Environmental and Estuarine Studies (<A HREF="http://co.cees..edu">CEES</A>) guides the scientific programs at University's three major laboratories for marine, estuarine and freshwater research:<P>

The Center of Marine Biotechnology  (<A HREF="http://www.umbi.umd.edu/">COMB</A>), a constituent of the University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute, applies genetic engineering to improve methods of seafood production, develop novel pharmaceuticals and develop techniques to clean up environmental pollutants.<P>
Some UMS campuses offer special marine-related undergraduate majors:<P>
<DL>
<DD><UL><LI>Environmental Science Program at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES)<P></UL>
<DD><UL><LI>General Biological Sciences Programs' marine emphasis at the University of Maryland College Park<P></UL>
<DD><UL><LI>Joint BS/MS five-year program offered through a cooperative arrangement between the UMES  and CEES<P></UL>
</DL>
At the graduate level, students have a number of opportunities to pursue marine-related studies.  The University's Marine-Estuarine-Environmental-Studies Program (MEES) draws on the expertise of the faculty across the entire UMS.  An alternative is to follow a course of study in a academic department - Biology, Natural Sciences, Zoology, Botany, Microbiology, and Agricultural Resource Economics (environmental economics) - and the School of Public Affairs (environmental policy).<P>

HAACP -- Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points -- is a federal food safety program that seafood processors must institute by December 18, 1997. First proposed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1994, HAACP is a mandatory program that focuses on preventing human hazards from contaminating food. 
<P>
As part of the HAACP procedures, seafood processors will have to:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>analyze potential hazards, 
<LI>identify critical control points, 
<LI>establish preventative measures, 
<LI>establish monitoring procedures, 
<LI>establish corrective actions, 
<LI>maintain effective recordkeeping, and 
<LI>establish procedures to verify the system is working.
</OL>
<P>
To help seafood processors meet the goals of HACCP, the National Sea Grant Program is supporting a <A HREF="http://www-seafood.ucdavis.edu/haccp/HA.htm">Seafood HACCP Alliance</A> for training and educating processors across the nation. Sea Grant Seafood Specialists are working with the FDA, the U. S. Department of Agriculture, the National Marine Fisheries Service, state agencies organizations, and other organizations to put on HACCP training workshops and to produce educational materials that can be directly applied to plant operations.

</CENTER>
<B><FONT SIZE=+3>Z</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>ebra mussels - which have already caused millions of dollars of environmental and economic damage in the Great Lakes region - have entered the headwaters of the Susquehanna River. Expectations are that these molluscs w ill spread into the Chesapeake Bay within the year.</FONT>
<P>
</TD></TR></TABLE>

First observed in the Great Lakes in 1988, the mussels may have been introduced when one or more transoceanic ships discharged ballast water into Lake St. Clair near Detroit, Michigan. The mussels have spread throughout the Great Lakes, causing major problems in power plants and water treatment facilities, where they clog intake and outflow pipes. One estimate puts the cost of scraping mussels from pipes in the Great Lakes region at $50 to $100 million a year.
<P>
The rapid spread of the zebra mussel is primarily a result of its reproductive capacity: females can produce more than 30,000 eggs per season. The fertilized eggs develop into free-swimming larvae, called veligers, that stay afloat for several weeks before settling onto stable surfaces. Once settled, the mussel will likely live from three to five years.
Adult zebra mussels look like small clams with yellowish or brown Dshaped shells, usually with alternating dark and light bands. Most are under an inch long, though they can grow as large as two inches. In the larval stage, they are so small they are essentially invisible to the naked eye.

</CENTER>
Because the zebra mussel threatens every industry that depends on water, it has the potential to cause problems for many industries and municipal services, and may indirectly affect virtually every citizen in Maryland and the Chesapeake region if it becomes established. Power generating facilities on the Susquehanna, like the Conowingo Dam, and municipal water supplies that depend on the Susquehanna may be threatened soon. It is not clear at present how much of the Chesapeake and its tributaries are at risk, but it could well be that many of Maryland's surface waters may be threatened - including reservoirs supplying water to the metropolitan areas of Baltimore and Washington D.C., waters supporting diverse agricultural activities, and waters used for recreation.

Zebra mussels in the free-swimming larval stage often attach to boat hulls and find their way into hoses, bilges and almost anywhere water will go. Your boat could easily become a ferry for moving mussels from one body of water to another. The Great Lakes Sea Grant Network has recommended the following precautions to boat owners to help prevent further spread of the zebra mussel:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>When transporting a boat, drain all bilge water, live wells, and bait buckets before leaving infested areas. Do not transport leftover bait from infested waterways to other waters.
<P>
<LI>Thoroughly inspect your boat's hull, outdrive, trim plates, trolling plates, prop guards, transducers, trailers, and other parts exposed to infested waters. If surfaces feel grainy, tiny zebra mussels may be attached. These "hitchhiking" mussels should be scraped off.
<P>
<LI>Thoroughly flush hulls, outdrive units, live wells (and pumping systems), bilge, trailer frames, anchors and anchor ropes, bait buckets, raw water engine cooling systems, and other boat parts and accessories that typically get wet - use hot water - 140 degree F (160 degree C) or hotter water. A pressurized steam cleaner or high pressure power washer is also effective and requires less time.
<P>
<LI>Thoroughly dry boats and trailers in the sun before transporting them to other waterways.
<P>
<LI>On boats that remain in the water, avoid leaving outdrive in the down position. Hulls and drive units should be inspected. Mussels can attach to outdrives and cover or enter water intakes; this leads to clogging, engine overheating, and damage to cooling system parts.
<P>
<LI>Antifouling paints may be effective in preventing attachment of zebra mussels to boat hulls, outdrive units, propellers, and other underwater boat components and accessories. Consult your local marine dealer or manufacturer for applicability and local use or environmental restrictions. Hull waxes do not appear to be effective.

Even in ecosystems as well studied as the Chesapeake Bay,  the shifting links between the myriad parts of the estuary - both living and nonliving - remain poorly understood. Yet a clear understanding of how ecosystems like the Chesapeake transfer energy and material through the environment and how these processes affect organisms and communities is necessary for the success of any effort to restore the Bay. Managers need the ability to focus actions to achieve desired results, to predict the likely response of the system and to evaluate the effectiveness of their methods.
<P>
It is in such a context that we have developed an environmental studies research program to help improve the basic understanding of estuarine processes and to provide information for effective protection of the Bay's marine resources.

<I>How do high nutient loads interact with trace metals and varying concentrations of dissolved oxygen to affect the Chesapeake Bay and other coastal systems? Denise Breitburg (right, front) explains to Sea Grant's Gail Mackiernan (left, back) how experiments in an array of twenty controlled ecosystems (called mesocosms) will provide the first findings to    answer this question.
</I>
<P>
<A NAME="START"></A>
Along the banks of St. Leonard's Creek on the Patuxent River, scientists at the Benedict Estuarine Research Center have begun a long-term study that should greatly improve our ability to manage complex coastal systems like the Chesapeake Bay.
<P>
Today's resource managers rely heavily on the use of computer models, such as the Chesapeake Bay Program's Water Quality model, to test various control strategies, for example, the effects of reducing nutrient inputs on dissolved oxygen in bottom water. Over the last decade, continuing research and monitoring in coastal systems - as well as improved computer power -  have greatly increased the sophistication of these models. They now mimic, to a degree, basic food web and other ecological relationships, and can be used to predict ecological responses to various management actions.
<P>
Nevertheless, existing models are still limited in their predictive accuracy, says Benedict researcher Denise Breitburg, because modelers are unable to include key ecological relationships. That is because the basic research to clarify these often complex relationships has not yet been done - it requires a large coordinated effort of scientists with diverse expertise, it is time-consuming, and it is, therefore, costly.
<P>
The major issue is that organisms do not respond to a single factor at a time, but to a suite of stresses acting together. And simultaneously, they are being influenced by the activities of other species, which in turn are being affected by multiple environmental factors.
<P>
In the Patuxent River and the Chespeake Bay, those key factors include the interactive effects of high nutrient loading, toxic contaminants and dissolved oxygen levels which can vary from total absence to super-saturation. How do such complex interactions reverberate though the ecosystem? How does the system respond, from clouds of algae to schools of large fish? And most importantly, how can we achieve a basic understanding of these responses so that we can better predict environmental change and improve management of our coastal ecosystems?

<A NAME="1"></A>
<H3>A Question of Complexity</H3>
Scientific research has clarified a good number of cause-and-effect relationships when it comes to individual environmental stresses such as high nutrient loading and low dissolved oxygen. We also know how heavy nutrient loading and changing temperature affect phytoplankton production, or how phytoplankton may respond to contaminants under a range of oxygen conditions.
<P>
But the open environment is considerably more complex: organisms from phytoplankton to sediment-dwelling worms to oysters to anchovies and striped bass are all responding to multiple stresses that continually occur in unknown combinations.
<P>
Until now, controlled experiments designed to measure the effects of such interactive stresses, under different conditions, have been limited - and predictive models are the poorer.
<P>
"Clearly," says Donald Scavia of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Coastal Ocean Program, which is funding the project, "the interactions are what we know least about. If you base management decisions on isolated cause-and-effect relationships, you're missing the important interactions."   
<P>
It is those interactions, says Denise Breitburg, that scientists at the Benedict lab, along with other researchers, are after. And in a big way.
<P>
A wide-ranging multi-disciplinary team has begun intensive experiments on the ecological effects of multiple stresses that will run over five years, experiments that make use of mesocosms and large field enclosures set in the Patuxent River. 

<CENTER>
<H3>
<HR SIZE=4>
"These experiments will not only help us compare the effects of single and multiple stressors, they will enable us to test the importance of complexity itself."
<HR SIZE=4>
</H3>
</CENTER>

Researchers will model experimental results and then begin linking those results to a network of other models designed to predict the effects of management actions on the Patuxent River. 
<P>
"If all goes well," says Jim Sanders, director of the Benedict lab, "then for the Patuxent and other coastal systems, we'll have a mechanism for being able to better predict what might happen within a system. "And," Sanders adds, "we'll also be able to pragmatically step back from those predictions and ask if a management response is worth the cost."
<P>
The goal is ambitious and chancy. "But research is all about gambling," says Donald Scavia, "and there has been no such program to deal with interactions on this scale." After all, he says, "this project is looking at multiple impacts on a full spectrum from mesocosms to field enclosures to field studies to modeling for watershed dynamics to looking at the economic impacts of multiple stressors."
<P>
It is a challenging undertaking, which begins with adept experimental design.

Large field enclosures in the Patuxent River like the one shown at left, one of two set up this summer at the Benedict Estuarine Research Center, will enable scientists to simulate the river's complex biodiversity.  By 1997, ten to twelve of these field enclosures will hold experiments which will assess the cumulative impacts of nutrient and trace metal loading (see diagram above, adapted from the original schematic by Jeff Smallwood).

<A NAME="2"></A>
<H3>Designing Experiments</H3>
"The centerpiece of our study," says Denise Breitburg, "is a series of mesocosm and large-enclosure field experiments." Mesocosms have been designed to run controlled studies of single and multiple stressors at different levels of ecological diversity, from very simple to more complex environments. The larger field enclosures will actually be located in the Patuxent River, so that researchers can examine the impacts  of multiple stressors on environments of greater complexity than the mesocosms. 
<P>
"These experiments" says Breitburg, "will not only help us compare the effects of single and multiple stressors, they will enable us to test the importance of complexity itself."
<P>
For Breitburg, there are at least several issues that involve ecosystem complexity. The first involves the effects of multiple stressors such as high levels of toxic chemicals and nutrients, and low dissolved oxygen: their interactions could prove more devastating than one might predict when looking at those same stresses individually. 
<P>
A second issue involves the effect different levels of ecological complexity may have in modifying multiple stresses, for example, does a more complex, or diverse, ecosystem differ in its capacity to handle multiple stresses?
<P>
A third issue has to do with how much useful information the different mesocosm environments can give, compared, for example, with the large field enclosures.  
<P>
The starting place for these questions are 20 one-cubic meter mesocosms - they have been designed to run replicate experiments that span five levels of complexity, from environments containing single-celled phytoplankton to environments with fish and bottom dwelling organisms.

<P>
To sort through the effects of cumulative stress, researchers need to distinguish how each of these environments responds to single stresses, for example, to different nutrient concentrations, then to different trace metal concentrations. The metal concentrations are based on the findings of Benedict scientist Gerhardt Riedel who has taken intensive measurements seasonally throughout the Patuxent River. 
<P>
Researchers have already begun blending mixtures of nutrients and trace metals in the mesocosm experiments.
<P>
Each year, experiments will be run several times over five-week periods - the reason, says Breitburg, is to account for variations that occur naturally and seasonally.
<P>
What is the relation of mesocosms to the Patuxent environment? How well will the findings - and the computer models that are developed to make ecological predictions from those findings - reflect what managers can expect in the Patuxent?
<P>
One way the Benedict researchers propose to answer such questions is with experiments in larger tanks, tanks more diverse in ecological complexity and therefore more representative of the Patuxent River.
<P>
To do this, says Breitburg, they conducted trial runs this summer with two 10-cubic-meter tanks that they placed near shore in the Patuxent. These tanks, which filter water from the river, make it possible to increase species diversity: sandy areas, oyster reefs, a wider variety of fish, benthic invertebrates, clams and oysters.
<P>
By next summer, ten more tanks will be operational. Together with the mesocosm studies, says Jim Sanders, the experimental project is "immense." It involves a "careful dance of many institutions and senior investigators with different expertise who are trying to get information on time scales that are interpretable."
<P>
As a scientist with expertise in the effects of trace contaminants on phytoplankton, he has had to "step back," he says. "I had to open up my biases and think of what a fish ecologist wanted out of this study, what a modeler wanted out of it. My personal interest became more subservient to the whole."
<P>
The experiments, as he says, are only the first stage - other researchers waiting for the numbers so that they can then link the results in St. Leonard's Creek with the entire Patuxent River. Their findings will shed new light not only on the workings of Chesapeake creeks and rivers but on coastal systems throughout the world.

<H1>From Ecology to Economics</H1>

If the goals of the Benedict project were only to improve scientific understanding of systems like the Patuxent River, they might be ambitious enough. And certainly, those are some of the major goals. "Five years from now," says Denise Breitburg, "we should have a much better understanding of how the cumulative impacts of nutrients, trace metals and low dissolved oxygen levels affect the [Patuxent] ecosystem." And we should also have a better understanding, she says, "of how much useful information you can get from simple versus complex experiments."
<P>
But NOAA's Coastal Ocean Program, which is supporting this project, is after much more, says Donald Scavia - in the long run, quantitative tools that resource managers can use to assess the potential effects of different management actions. More than that, he says, policy makers need to be able to assess the economic impacts of those actions - and this study, says Scavia, aims to do that as well.
<P>
From experiments on the response of phytoplankton to multiple stressors in one cubic meter mesocosms to predicting economic impacts of management actions for the Patuxent River - such is the breadth of the Benedict project. It is that ambitious uniqueness that excites Doug Lipton, a resource economist at the University of Maryland College Park and coordinator of the Sea Grant Extension Program.  
<P>
</TD><TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP>
<IMG ALIGN=middle SRC="GIFs/side1.gif" ALT="[sorting fish photo]"><P>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
One of those economic impacts is the effect of changing water quality conditions on the abundance of recreational fish and what those changes could mean for sports fishing. 
<P>
Lipton is part of the research team that includes experts in field measurements and monitoring, ecological modeling, watershed studies, fisheries ecology and economics. These wide-ranging experts come from the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, the State University of New York-Buffalo, the University of Virginia, the University of Connecticut, the Maryland Department of the Environment, and SENES (Specialists in Energy, Nuclear and Environmental Sciences) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.
<P>
If the project is successful, says Lipton, "for the first time we'll be able to say that reduction of nutrients has some predictable implications in economic terms." In this case, Lipton's aim will be to relate how different nutrient and toxic loads - under current, improved and worsened conditions - impact the availability of recreational fish. He will then be able to estimate the economic consequences of the changes in sport fishing that will result under those different conditions.
<P>
It is a long route to get from phytoplankton to striped bass. Can it be done? Scavia is not sure whether it will be possible to quantify and deal with cumulative stress over such scales. "But given the needs of better managing our coastal systems," he says, "we have to try some new scientific and economic approaches."

<A NAME="START"></A>
Jackie Takacs had spent the whole day standing in the Choptank River, and now the tide was cresting at about a foot and a half above normal. 
<P>
The waves moving across the surface of the river were hitting her at neck level, and she literally had to dive down to find the remaining bags of oyster shell she had been helping to move all day long. Sea nettles, which had drifted in with the tide, were waiting for her when she surfaced, draping their stinging tentacles over her hair, her face, her arms.
<P>
Anyone else might have considered this a rather dismal situation. But for Takacs it was a great day. 
<P>
For more than a month, Takacs, an oyster hatchery assistant, had worked with Sea Grant Extension specialist Don Meritt and others at the Center for Environmental and Estuarine Studies (CEES) Horn Point Oyster Hatchery to set oyster larvae - despite the fact that low salinities had made this effort extremely difficult. According to Don Meritt, salinities in their section of the Choptank River reached only 7 parts per thousand (ppt) by mid-summer, and barely reached 7.5 to 8 ppt as summer drew to a close. "About 8 to 10 ppt seems to be the magic number for setting oysters," says Meritt.
<P>
Last year, mid-summer salinities reached 9 to 10 ppt up river, at the newly reclaimed oyster bar where the oyster spat are taken to mature. In a "normal" year (and Meritt cautions that there is no such thing as a normal year, since climatic patterns swing from wet to dry years) the salinity may hover at 12 to 14 ppt in their region of the Choptank. Last year, which was at least a bit more "normal," hatchery operators began setting oysters at the beginning of the summer. This year, they had to wait.
<P>
Although production setting of oysters did not start until the beginning of August this year, by the time a month had passed the Horn Point Hatchery had set 5 million oysters - twice the amount they set last year.  This is a remarkable achievement, especially in a low-salinity year.
<P>
"We are really proud of what we were able to do this year," Meritt says, and he gives a great deal of credit to Takacs.
<P>
Their success was due to a number of factors, but according to Takacs, the most important ingredient was "tender loving care."

<A NAME="1"></A>
<H3>Far More Than Oysters</H3>
Although spawning and setting oysters have occupied both Takacs and Meritt for much of the year, they have also helped to educate a wide range of people about oysters and their importance in the Chesapeake Bay. "We spent 20 days working with teachers and students this past year," says Takacs, who estimates that well over 500 people passed through the hatchery, from kindergarten students to the University of Maryland System Board of Regents.
<P>
In September, Takacs called Doug Romano, a teacher at Dorchester High School, to ask for high school student help with moving oysters from grounds off Horn Point to well up the Choptank River - the project is part of a larger effort to rebuild oyster bars in the Chesapeake Bay. So far the bar looks promising, according to Kennedy Paynter, University of Maryland College Park researcher who is working with Meritt on the project. Last year's spat on the upriver oyster bar are showing a sixty percent survival rate.
<P>
One group in particular, the Living Classrooms Foundation, has worked closely with the Horn Point Hatchery, bringing students both from "at-risk" groups and from "gifted and talented" classes. All of them work hard learning about oysters and ecology in an intense hands-on program.
<P>
"A mother called me after the oyster planting this year," Takacs says, "because her son had left his shoes."  The parent said that her son had arrived home exhausted but excited after a long day of moving oyster shells.
<P>
Working together and building team spirit is one of the goals of the Living Classrooms Foundation. To help foster this sense of teamwork, Takacs divided the students into teams this past summer and had them examine a four-year-old oyster reef off the beach at Horn Point. The students studied oysters and their habitat and the organisms growing on and around them. "I asked the students to think about what might be eating the oysters," she says, "and what might be eating what is eating the oysters."
<P>
The students studied the spat being raised in the hatchery's large tanks, called upwellers. "I asked them whether we could just plant them [the tiny spat] in the Bay," she says. After looking at the four-year oyster bar, the students could see that without being set on other shell (cultch), the spat would simply sink in the mud or become easy food for predators.
<P>
As well as teaching students about the biology of oysters, she has put their energies to good use, moving shell bags, counting spat and calculating survival rates. She has recruited graduate students at Horn Point to help bag shell - something they can do throughout the year. 
<P>
Says Meritt of Takacs's contribution to this year's successful oyster hatchery production: "She did it. She basically did it."

The year of '96 will go down as a cool, wet one, and a bad time for anyone trying to set oysters in the Chesapeake region. Oyster hatchery operators up and down the Chesapeake Bay, especially in Maryland where the water is fresher, found it extremely difficult -- if not impossible -- to set oysters in the low salinity water. Don Meritt (shown above in the field and in the hatchery), of the University of Maryland's CEES Horn Point Lab and a Sea Grant shellfish specialist, was one person who succeeded. He and Jackie Takacs, after overcoming numerous stumbling blocks, finally set even more oysters than they did last year. In 1995, from June through August, they set some 2.5 million oyster spat. In 1996, and not starting until the beginning of August, Meritt and Takacs set more than 5 million oysters before the summer ended.

<H1>High School Aquaculture</H1>
By J. Adam Frederick<BR>
Maryland Sea Grant Extension
<P>
Students at South Carroll High School in Carroll County, Maryland, have been designing innovative aquaculture systems in a unique research course that challenges them to solve practical problems while working as part of a team.
<P>
The aquaculture projects provide a means for integrating such subjects as engineering, math, computer-aided drafting and composition with concepts of water quality and biology. 
<P>
Under the direction of award-winning teacher Bob Foor-Hogue, the students have built seven recirculating aquaculture systems, ranging in size from 150 to 550 gallons. In addition to designing the systems, the South Carroll students produce multimedia programs and write grants to support the funding for these projects - they have been successful for each school year.
<P>
The Hall of Exploration at the Columbus Center in Baltimore will incorporate an aquaculture exhibit that is being designed by the South Carroll students as part of an exhibit highlighting aquaculture research at the University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute's Center of Marine Biotechnology - it will also illustrate how aquaculture provides an exciting way to study many aspects of science.
<P>
Visitors to the Hall will be able to see a work in progress as students and teachers collaborate in constructing and stocking the systems with such fish as yellow perch, trout and shad.
<P>
<B>Editor's Note:</B> <I>The Columbus Center's National Center for Marine Biotechnology Research and Education will open a public Hall of Exploration in spring/summer of 1997. Maryland Sea Grant Extension Education Specialist J. Adam Frederick is based at the Columbus Center, developing and implementing education programs.</I>

Nearly fifty years ago, scientists successfully used low temperature freezing techniques (cryopreservation) to preserve animal and fish sperm -- that ability has made it possible to produce offspring from most domesticated animals, birds, a few endangered wildlife species and numbers of fish species such as Atlantic herring, catfish, pike, salmonids and zebrafish.  Cryopreservation of fish eggs and fertilized eggs (embryos) is another matter, since a number of complications arise in transferring water and cryoprotectants across the cell membrane into the embryo or yolk so that the embryo can be successfully reconstituted.  Recent advances in molecular techniques hold promise that such preservation can be done successfully. The long-range goal of this project is to develop an uncomplicated, low-cost cryopreservation system for fish embryos and eggs, so that normal fish can be routinely produced. Towards this end, a team of scientists led by Mary Hagedorn will use the zebrafish as a model for determining how cryoprotectants function in the embryo yolk at various developmental stages. Cryopreservation of embryos can be of enormous value to the aquaculture industry and resource management and conservation, especially given that many fish species and distinct genetic strains are endangered because of environmental degradation and other human impacts. The ability to freeze embryos could help in ensuring genetic diversity, preventing species or strain extinction by producing a reservoir of "insurance" populations, and allowing time to rehabilitate natural environments to support introductions of native species.

<A NAME="R/F-85"></A><H2>The Novel Gonadotropin-releasing Hormone (GnRH) of Fish: Its Functions, Regulation of Synthesis and Release, and Potential Use for Spawning Manipulations in Striped Bass (R/F-85)</H2>
The farming of striped bass and other fish species in Maryland and the mid-Atlantic has been expanding in the last decade -- nevertheless, the economic growth will remain limited unless growers can have access to inexpensive "seed," i.e., embryos  or newly hatched fish. Though large striped bass have been maintained and spawned in hatcheries, their captivity more often than not disrupts hormonal systems. Consequently, growers have had to depend on the capture of gravid striped bass for eggs and sperm -- they then inject the fish with a hormone to induce spawning. These are costly processes. If the industry is to significantly step up production, growers will need to obtain eggs on demand so that they can reliably plan and predict their production and harvest cycles. With continuing Sea Grant-support, Yonathan Zohar has significantly enhanced our understanding of the molecular processes controlling the pituitary gland and its release of growth hormones. Recent studies led to the important discovery of a maturational gonadotropin that regulates the final ovarian development and may be the major hormone responsible for egg and sperm development. In captivity, it is this gonadotropin that is blocked so that it is not released to the blood stream and does not reach the ovaries. In this project, Zohar will synthesize chemical analogs of the newly discovered gonadotropin to improve spawning induction in striped bass. In addition, he will detail the regulation and release of this growth hormone to try to explain reproductive failures in fish kept in captivity.

<A NAME="R/F-81"></A><H2>Hormonal Regulation of the Onset of Puberty in Striped Bass (R/F-81)</H2>
A major limit to finfish aquaculture is the expense of maintaining adults to reproductive maturity, a period of six to eight years. One way to reduce this expense is to lower the age of sexual maturity, which could reduce long-term handling costs and allow earlier reproduction. Yonathan Zohar's hypothesis is that the onset of sexual maturity is triggered by the development of a functional gonadotropin-regulating hormone. Focusing his studies at the molecular level, his aim in this project is to follow the course of the hormone's development and to determine how its activity is regulated.

<A NAME="R/F-80"></A><H2>Utility of b-glucan as an Immuomodulator for Infectious Disease Prophylaxis in Fish Aquaculture (R/F-80)</H2>
The intensive rearing of fish in recirculating systems or in ponds gives growers the potential to produce large numbers of fish that are uniform in size and quality. However, the physiological stress on fish from common aquacultural practices (e.g., crowding, handling, grading, transporting) can suppress the immune system effectiveness in fighting microbial infections. Recent developments indicate that immunostimulator agents can help control or prevent such infections. For example, b-glucans are a group of chemical compounds that offers potential usefulness to farm-reared striped bass and hybrids. A polymer of glucose that serves as a stimulant to the immune system, b-glucans have shown few side effects in laboratory experiments. How effective are they in enhancing disease resistance in real-world aquaculture? Robert Anderson will try to answer this question. His overall goal is to quantify the immunostimulation in striped bass that have been given b-glucans when presented with aquaculture-related stressors.

<A NAME="R/F-83"></A><H2>Evaluation of the Aquaculture Potential of Differing Strains of Striped Bass (R/F-83)</H2>
While the striped bass aquaculture industry has expanded by more than 600 percent since the 1980s, one limit to continued expansion is relatively high consumer prices -- a consequence of high production costs. One way to lower these costs is to maximize growing efficiency from egg to harvest size. While genetic manipulation and other molecular techniques offer one means for achieving these aims, the most expedient strategy is to employ strains of striped bass that have traits for fast growth and efficient food assimilation. 
<P>
It is well documented that strains of species from different geographical areas often exhibit major differences in performance measures as growth rate, disease resistance and feed conversion efficiency. One preliminary study found a 30 percent variance in growth rate between different geographic strains. The striped bass industry currently relies on very few strains of the species for commercial production of pure and hybrid fish. In this project, Reginal Harrell will evaluate growth performance characteristics of five strains of striped bass representing a wide geographic range and unique genetic diversity. His aim is to determine the fastest growing and best surviving strains under different rearing systems. Industry support for this project is strong -- identifying superior strains of striped bass represents the most rapid and cost effective means of improving the production of striped bass; these strains are likely to be useful immediately as broodstock for the industry and to form the basis for projected improvements in selective breeding efforts.

Educating aquaculturists, investors, legislators and government agency officials on issues related to fish farming and innovative technologies is critical if research is to lead to economic returns. Scientific advances in engineering, nutrition, molecular biology and genetics provide the basis of industry growth -- however, aquaculturists are often limited in their ability to keep up with the applications of sophisticated new technologies. In this regard, the network of Sea Grant specialists and agents in marine advisory programs have played a major role as information brokers. But even for the most technologically literate, staying abreast of advances in molecular biology, genetics and recirculating systems can be difficult. This project is aimed at assisting advisory specialists throughout the nation to become knowledgeable about innovative technologies and their implications for aquaculture, for instance, growth hormones, the limitations and risks associated with transgenic species, the potential of bioengineered feed additives, genetically modified species, and the ethics of releasing such species. The resource guide that will result from this project will cover such issues, including current or potential applications, public and ethical concerns, and regulatory status and policy issues.

<A NAME="R/F-82"></A><H2>The Role of Iron and Host-Derived Growth-Factors in Regulating Gene Expression in the Oyster Parasite Perkinsus marinus: Strategies for Inhibiting Proliferation (R/F-82)</H2>
Two parasitic diseases of oysters, MSX and Dermo, have had a constant and unrelenting impact on adult oyster populations throughout the Bay. In the last six years, Chesapeake oyster populations have reached an all-time low, primarily due to Dermo disease. With a major breakthrough in the laboratory culture of the causative organism, researchers are now able to investigate the disease at the cellular level. Gerardo Vasta is focusing on the role of iron, critical to growth of both the parasite and its host. Because iron is generally much less available than other metabolic needs, competition for iron between oyster cells and parasites is intense. 
<P>
Environmental factors in the Chesapeake may increase the availability of iron -- for example, low oxygen conditions in the Chesapeake during summer months trigger chemical reactions in the sediments that release more soluble forms of iron into the water column. Increased iron in the waters may explain why Dermo is more prevalent during the summer in oysters located in poorly oxygenated regions. In this project, Vasta will detail the role of iron in regulating the proliferation of Dermo and will ascertain the importance of enzymes in the oyster's immune system to the growth and survival of the parasite. In the long run, this research should lead to genetically designed strategies for blocking infection and proliferation of the parasite. It could also provide a further rationale for nutrient reduction strategies adopted for the Bay and other estuaries.

<A NAME="BRANT"></A><H2>Linking Water Quality to Fish Production in the Chesapeake Bay:  Spatially-explicit Models of Fish Growth and Predation (R/F-79)</H2>
Two factors critical to natural fish production are water quality, for instance, temperature and dissolved oxygen, and predation levels, the feeding on one species by another.  For some years, Maryland Sea Grant has supported extensive research on the population dynamics and effects of dissolved oxygen concentrations on the anchovy and menhaden, among the most abundant fish in the Chesapeake Bay.  These fish play a key role as consumers of plankton and as the prey of larger species like the striped bass and the bluefish.
<P>
Recent work by Stephen Brandt has employed underwater acoustics to measure the seasonal abundance, distribution and biomass (the mass of fish per unit area), as well as their selectivity of prey and feeding relationships.  Now, using advance computer techniques that can account for environmental differences from the upper to lower regions of the Bay, Brandt and Denise Breitburg are developing models that relate water quality parameters in specific areas of the Bay to the ability of fish to feed and grow.  If successful, these models will relate fish biomass to water quality.  
<P>
Preliminary data, for example, indicate that during the summer months, high temperatures and low oxygen in the Bay have greatly reduced the areas where striped bass can feed and grow.  Information such as this will give water quality and fisheries managers new predictive tools that will allow them to assess the effects of specific management actions on fish stocks.

<A NAME="ZOHAR"></A><H2>Basic and Applied Studies on Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Induction of Sperm Production, Ovulation and Spawning in Morone Species (R/F-78)</H2>
Producing fish for farm rearing or closed recirculating systems depends on the regular and predictable supply of their eggs.  Unfortunately, the spawning (production of eggs and sperm) of stripers in captivity is difficult to control.  In captivity, there is an apparent failure to synthesis or release to the bloodstream, the hormones necessary to final maturation of the eggs.
<P>
Aquaculturists now depend on injecting ripe fish with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which assists in ovulation and spermatogenesis (the formulation of sperm).  Yonathan Zohar, Thomas Chen and Curry Woods began work in 1992 on studies of the molecular basis of GnRH synthesis and its regulation.  One goal has been the development of an insert for the striper which provides timed-release of the GnRH hormone.  
<P>
They have also been studying the structure and regulation of expression of the GnRH gene, which includes the molecular and cellular processes involved in the synthesis and secretion of GnRH hormone in striped bass.  In the long term, this work will lead to new approaches for regulating the reproductive cycle of striped bass and other farmed fish.

The Chesapeake Bay Program's restoration goals are, to a large extent, measurable ones, in which such indicators as water quality, fish and shellfish abundance and underwater grass distribution can be quantified to account for the degree of restoration success. Mark Sagoff and David Wasserman contend, however, that restoration cannot be understood simply in terms of ecosystem health, such as increased dissolved oxygen levels or more fish and shellfish, or by economic returns. They maintain that restoration goals must include a "sense of place," a sense of being at home in a particular locality. And characterizing what that sense of place means to people who live and work in the Bay region is a major objective of this project. By organizing focus groups of residents, they have begun to analyze the similarities and differences in attitudes and values that dominate contemporary views of Chesapeake restoration. Concentrating their research in southern Maryland, they will compare current attitudes and values with those from diverse literary and historical accounts of the Bay. The reports and videotapes resulting from this work should benefit many in the Bay watershed who have been engaged in trying to maintain a Chesapeake Bay regional identity while accommodating to inevitable ecological, social and cultural changes.

<P><A NAME="R/PO-3"></A><H2>Nonpoint-Source Pollution and Land Use in the Patuxent Watershed (R/PO-3)</H2>
A key to successful restoration of the Chesapeake Bay -- from improved fisheries to more widespread underwater grasses to oxygenated bottom waters -- is the Bay Program's goal of a 40 percent reduction of nutrient inputs to Bay waters. As sewage treatment plants continue to improve, the single most important source of nutrient overloading becomes diffuse (nonpoint) sources -- eroding soils, groundwater seepage, atmospheric deposition. Changes in the land resulting from population growth and development (e.g.,  from forests to cropland or cropland to suburban housing or commercial enterprises) influence much of this diffuse nutrient loading. In the 1,000-square-mile Patuxent watershed, researchers have made important advances in mathematical modeling that allow them to simulate the effect of such land use changes on nutrient inputs. Land use changes are driven by a host of factors, among them economics, personal choices, zoning and transportation. 
<P>
In this project, environmental economist Nancy Bockstael is building on innovative mathematical modeling that will enable an assessment of changes in land use patterns under a number of alternative policy scenarios. These policies will focus on state and local land use management plans that are likely to have significant effects on water quality. This model can then be linked with ecological models for the Patuxent that will enable researchers to look at the consequences of land use changes on nutrient loading. In the long run, this work should improve forecasts of the ecological effects of development and, perhaps, help make for better tradeoffs among politics, economics and the environment.

<P>The Chesapeake Bay Program's restoration goals are, to a large extent, measurable ones.  Indicators as water quality, fish and shellfish abundance and underwater grass distribution can be quantified to account for the degree of restoration success.
<P>
Mark Sagoff and David Wasserman contend that restoration cannot be understood simply in terms of ecosystem use, whether by measuring dissovled oxygen levels or increases in the number of fish and shellfish or by economic return.  They maintain that the goal of restoration is to create a "sense of place", a send of being at home in a particular locality.
<P>
Characterizing what that sense of place means to people who live and work in the Bay region is a major objective of this project.  In organizing focus groups with residents, scientists, businessmen, regulators and policymakers, they plan to analyze the similarities and differences in attitudes and values with those from diverse literary and historical accounts of the Bay.  The reports and videotapes resulting from this work should benefit many in the Bay watershed who have been engaged in trying to maintain a Chesapeake Bay regional identity while accommodating the inevitable ecological, social and cultural changes.

<A NAME="R/BT-03"></A><H2>The Preparation of Chitin Oligosaccharides (R/BT-03)</H2>
Chitin is the second most abundant organic substance in nature, after cellulose, and is one of the principal components of shells of crustaceans such as the blue crab. While Sea Grant has supported research leading to commercially marketed fertilizers and soil amendments from composted shell, the economic return is relatively low. Chitin and its derivatives, on the other hand, have significant potential for applications in medicine, agriculture and bioprocessing. Oligosaccharides (small chain sugars) are known to be important in many physiological processes, including the induction of defense mechanisms in plants, the formation of symbiotic root-nodules in legumes, and as anti-metastatic agents in mammalian tumors. However a major impediment to even exploring such uses is that these compounds are difficult to prepare and consequently very expensive. A pure oligosaccharide can cost from $5-15 per milligram; thus, even simple experiments to explore potential uses can themselves cost thousands of dollars. This project will employ recombinant DNA technologies, using genes from chitin-digesting marine bacteria, to degrade chitin and produce a variety of oligosaccharides quickly and in large quantities. The resulting compounds will be tested for biological activity in a variety of agricultural and medical applications.

<A NAME="R/BT-04"></A><H2>Enzymatic Modification of Chitosan (R/BT-04)</H2>
Chitosan, a derivative of chitin, can be obtained from waste crab shells and has unique physical and chemical properties which can be employed in a variety of applications. Despite its potential, chitosan is not being effectively exploited because unfavorable market forces are not encouraging -- chitosan's high cost limits development of new products while the low profit margins of existing products do not justify improved (and cheaper) production methods. This project will explore a new technology which will allow production of chitosan precisely tailored to meet emerging needs for medical, industrial or manufacturing uses. To position chitosan for exploiting new applications, it will be necessary to demonstrate that its chemical, biological and mechanical properties can be adapted to such applications. Toward these ends, Gregory Payne will use specific enzymatic reactions in the laboratory to produce modified chitosans, and test their utility in various applications. In the long run, successful applications of chitosan will benefit seafood processors who are now faced with disposal costs and potential new businesses that can make innovative use of this valuable material.

<A NAME="McAVOY"></A><H2>Modeling and Advanced Control of an Activated Sludge Waste Water Treatment Facility (R/EG-1)</H2>
With sewage treatment plants accounting for some 60 percent of the phosphorus and nearly 35 percent of nitrogen entering the Chesapeake Bay, reducing these compounds is a primary task of the Bay's 40 percent nutrient reduction goal.  Achieving large reductions, however, is expensive - cost estimates in Maryland alone range upwards of $300 million for the needed plant upgrades.
<P>
To help minimize capital costs, Thomas McAvoy and Peter Minderman are extending an initial Sea Grant-supported project to develop techniques of neural network and process modeling that will help operators of waste treatment plants optimize activated sludge processes, the biochemical reactions to remove carbon, phosphorus and nitrogen fro incoming waste.
<P>
Neural network models employ techniques of artificial intelligence, in which feedback loops take changing data into account to signal adjustments in mechanical processes, such as controlling oxygen-demand activated sludge processes (please select <A HREF="#McAVOY1">schematic</A> to see a neural net of a waste water plant).  By using neural network approaches for the design of models that are specific to each waste treatment plant, this project should demonstrate techniques that can:<P>
<DL>
<DD>Help increase plant efficiency;
<DD>Reduce energy costs;  and
<DD>Improve the quality of effluents discharged into receiving waters.</DL><P>

<A NAME="BURCHARD"></A><H2>Bacterial Inhibitors of Adhesion of Marine Biofilm Bacteria (R/MP-1)</H2>
On virtually every submerged surface in natural waters, colonies of microorganisms produce biofilms composed of the microbes themselves and their extracellular products. In many cases, these biofilms serve as a precursor to the settlement of barnacles and other organisms which can foul marine surfaces, such as the hulls of ships and water intake pipes.
<P>
Remedies for this biofouling are often costly and environmentally damaging. Observations have shown, however, that some bacteria actually inhibit the attachment of other microbes.
<P>
In this project, Robert Burchard has been examining interactions of marine biofilm bacteria, where an extracellular polymer produced by one strain inhibits the adhesion and spread of other biofilm species. He has been working to purify the polymer and to characterize its molecular features. These studies are advancing our understanding of the dynamics of biofilm formation and could lead to the development of biologically based, environmentally safe, inhibitors to biofilm formation and biofouling.<P>

<A NAME="CARDELLINA"></A><H2>Marine Organisms as Sources of Novel Agrochemicals and Pharmaceuticals (R/MP-2)</H2>
Marine organisms produce a tremendous variety of unique chemical structures, many with no counterparts in terrestrial plants, or animals. An unusually high percentage of these compounds exhibit substantial pharmacological activity-significant in antimicrobial and antitumor properties. Because marine species have developed many of these compounds to protect against predation, microbial infection and overgrowth by competitors, they may also prove useful in analogous situations in agriculture.
<P>
John Cardellina and Fred Singleton have been collecting marine organisms and extracting and screening extracts for inhibition of plant pathogens, phytotoxicity, plant growth regulation, seed germination inhibition and insecticidal activity. They are working to isolate and identify the active constituents from these extracts and to evaluate their activity. This project has already identified a number of plant growth regulators, phytotoxins, antimicrobials, insecticides and cytotoxins, while preliminary screening results indicate bioactivity in extracts from marine bacterial cultures.
<P>
As this work advances, collaboration with a pharmaceutical corporation will provide an avenue for further testing and eventual use of these compounds in medicine or agriculture.<P>

<A NAME="R/CBT-27"></A><H2>Factors Controlling the Food Chain Accumulation and Transfer of Inorganic and Methylmercury in Chesapeake Bay Organisms (R/CBT-27)</H2>
How do toxic contaminants like mercury pass through the Bay's food web? To help provide answers, this project will focus on the base of the food chain, describing how mercury and methylmercury move through both bottom-dwelling (benthic) organisms and free-swimming (pelagic) ones. The researchers will examine how algae and zooplankton assimilate different forms of mercury, and explore how the chemistry of both water and bottom sediments affect the uptake of these compounds.  They will then determine how mercury might move from these primary consumers to the fish that feed higher up the food chain.

<A NAME="R/CBT-26"></A><H2>Quantitative Evaluation of Contaminants in a Chesapeake Bay Region of Concern:  Assimilation Model of Exposure and Bioaccumulation in Baltimore Harbor (R/CBT-26)</H2>
In Chesapeake Bay, three areas are of special concern with regard to toxic contaminants: the Elizabeth River, the Anacostia River and Baltimore Harbor.  This study will focus on Baltimore Harbor where sediments contain high concentrations of many organic contaminants, including DDT, PCBs, chlordanes and PAHs (polyaromatic hydrocarbons). Researchers will develop a simulation model specific to the harbor that will simulate both the carbon and the contaminant flows in the water column and in the sediments.  They will use information gathered from all relevant state and national agencies on known organic contaminants in Baltimore Harbor, then screen this information before incorporating it into a database.  By developing this contaminant-ecosystem model, the research team will be able to use this single Region of Concern to understand and predict how toxic organic compounds may threaten estuarine systems like the Chesapeake.

<A NAME="R/CBT-31"></A><H2>Impact of Sediment-associated Contaminants on Benthic Species in Chesapeake Bay:  Implications for Carbon and Contaminant Transfer in Food Webs (R/CBT-31)</H2>
The sediments of the Chesapeake Bay form a large reservoir of toxic compounds. Whether or not these sediment-bound toxicants affect the ecosystem -- and to what extent -- depends on if and how they enter the food chain.  This study will test the hypothesis that toxic compounds first affect bottom-dwelling species, and are then transferred higher up the food chain, possibly to fish or even humans. Researchers will use microcosm studies to measure the availability of toxic compounds, the rate of uptake, the transfer between organisms, and the toxicity of trace elements released from contaminated sediments. Using representative benthic species, they will test the effect of these trace elements on living organisms and assess the subsequent movement of toxic compounds into the food chain.

<A NAME="WEINER"></A><H2>Interaction of Copper and Cadmium with Microbial Benthos Biofilm and Effects on Oyster Larvae Set (R/CBT-19)</H2>
Microbial biofilms can form anywhere in marine environments.  These bacterially produced polysaccharide films cover nearly all underwater surfaces. They are a significant part of surface sediments, and have the capacity to sequester various substances in concentrations will above their levels in the surrounding environment.
<P>
Among these substances are trace metals, which in laboratory experiments have had deleterious impacts on newly set oysters. This project is examining:<P>
<DL>
<DD>how two toxic trace metals (copper and cadmium) are concentrated by microbial films;  and<P>
<DD>how these films affect free-swimming oyster larvae that reach setting 
  stage for final attachment and metamorphosis.<P>
</DL>
Preliminary lab results indicate that copper disrupts some behavioral functioning by larval oysters and inhibits their setting on biofilms.<P>
Ronald Weiner and Marianne Walch are trying to determine whether there is a link between the concentration of toxics in biofilms and the early mortality of newly set oysters that has been observed in many areas of Chesapeake Bay.<P>

<A NAME="RIEDEL"></A><H2>Contaminant Flux from Sediments: Impacts on Chesapeake Bay Food Webs (R/CBT-20)</H2>
Sediments in certain regions of the Chesapeake Bay contain elevated amounts of toxic substances: these represent a potential reservoir for continuous flux of toxics into the ecosystem, long after control measures have seemingly reduced their direct inputs. Processes which control the release of sediment-bound contaminants to overlying waters or which make them available to organisms are thus of primary concern for the Chesapeake Bay restoration program.
<P>
This research is using a mesocosm system (tanks that mimic the natural environment) to study the effects on estuarine food webs of toxic contaminants in sediments. Among the factors to be tested: how the absence of oxygen (anoxia)-a seasonal phenomenon in much of the Bay-affects the chemical behavior of compounds such as arsenic, cadmium and copper. The researchers have found, for example, that under anoxic conditions, copper and arsenic behave differently with potentially significant effects on the composition of phytoplankton species. Over the long term, changes in the phytoplankton community within the mesocosms will be related to the extent of release and exposure of these sediment-bound toxicants.

<A NAME="ANDERSON"></A><H2>The Effects of Environmental Contaminants on the Progression of Perkinsus marinus Infection in the Eastern Oyster. (R/CBT-22)</H2>
A major factor in the near decimation of oysters over the last decade in Chesapeake Bay has been parasitic disease, in particular, two protozoan parasites commonly referred to as MSX (Haplosporidium nelsoni) and Dermo (Perkinsus marinus). Against both these diseases, the oyster has largely been defenseless - the puzzling question is why?
<P>
One explanation may be the deleterious effects of pollutants, e.g., cadmium and aluminum, on the functioning of the oyster immune system. Laboratory testing of the immune system's disease-fighting cells indicates that their activity is suppressed at high concentrations of some toxic compounds. Robert Anderson, Eugene Burreson and Michael Unger hypothesize that heavy metals and other contaminants reduce the oyster's resistance to dermo. Tthey have designed studies that should enable them to detail the effects pollutants might have on progression of the disease in individual oysters.<P>

<A NAME="KRAMER"></A><H2>Metallothionein in Marine Coccoid Cyanobacteria: Cloning, Transcriptional Analyses and Application to the Assessment of Metal Stress in Natural Communities of Picoplankton in Chesapeake Bay (R/CBT-23)</H2>
Determining whether or not chronic, sub-lethal concentrations of pollutants have subtle though significant effects on trophic level interactions in the Chesapeake Bay is extremely difficult. Traditional laboratory approaches to studying the sub-lethal stress on organisms do not seek to uncover the cellular mechanisms that such stresses exert.
<P>
In this project, Jonathan Kramer is employing the techniques of molecular toxicology to determine how toxics impact sub-cellular mechanisms in an important species of blue-green algae, cyanobacteria (commonly referred to as picoplankton), in the Bay. The microalgae being studied are common in the Bay, and at some seasons represent an important fraction of the phytoplankton.
<P>
An organism under chronic exposure to certain toxic trace metals will have a distinct genetic signature in the release of a protein called metallothionein. Moreover, they are unique in that-unlike most other organisms-they produce metallothionein only in response to metal exposure. The ability to recognize such signatures enables researchers to make sensitive measurements of cellular characteristics that indicate ongoing metal stress, an ability that could provide scientists and managers with a means for realistically assessing the effects of metal toxicity in the natural environment.

<A NAME="WRIGHT"></A><H2>A Risk Assessment for Dimilin Use in the Northern Chesapeake Bay:  A Model Study for Non point Source Runoff (R/CBT-24)</H2>
Chemicals have played a major role in the development of modern agriculture and in protecting crops and trees against pest infestation. The downside of their use, however, has been the runoff into natural waters of compounds that are potential toxicants. While several chemicals have been banned from use because of their impact on non-target species (for example, DDT on birds), what has been lacking is a realistic assessment of the fate and effects of many others, particularly in how they affect aquatic organisms.
<P>
In this project, David Wright and Rodger Dawson will characterize the role of one such pesticide, Dimilin, which has been used widely in the Chesapeake basin for gypsy moth control. While Dimilin has no demonstrable effect on birds and mammals, low concentrations can affect crustaceans, particularly zooplankton which are key prey species for fish. Using two test species of zooplankton, the researchers will assess the toxic effects on mortality, reproduction and other abnormalities in conducting a hazard assessment for this compound's mode of action. They will combine chemical application information, run-off data and toxicity data to generate a model risk assessment for non point source pesticide run-off that will be important for understanding Dimilin and that can also serve as a model for other pesticides.

Maryland recreational boating expenditures total $1.01 billion annually, providing a net economic boost of over $980 million annually  to the State of Maryland according to the results of a Maryland Sea Grant study  scheduled for release this morning in Annapolis at the 17th Annual Maryland  Marine Trades Conference.  
<P>
Coordinated by Douglas W. Lipton, Director of the University of <A HREF="index.html">Maryland Sea  Grant College Extension Program</A>, the report finds that, on average, boaters of  all classes each contribute $5,136 annually to the state economic output.  Those expenditures generate over 18,000 full-time equivalent jobs in the Maryland  economy, and 34 percent of the expenditures result in actual wage payments and  compensation to Maryland residents. 
<P>
Maryland state and county governments benefit as well with sizable tax revenues  from the recreational boating expenditures.  The state and local income tax  generated is $4.3 million, an amount that is in addition to an estimated $3  million in taxes paid directly by the boaters themselves.  This tax revenue does not count state excise taxes on boat sales and local slip taxes, and sizeable  business income tax.
<P>
Funded through the cooperative efforts of the Maryland Boating Administration,  Maryland Department of Natural Resources, and the Marine Trades Association of  Maryland, the study's aim was to evaluate the spending by boaters, and how that  spending affects both the state economy and Maryland businesses, from  marine-related firms such as marinas and boat dealers to restaurants and service establishments. Support for the analysis was also provided by the Maryland Sea  Grant College Program and the University of Maryland Cooperative Extension  Service.
<P>
Overall boaters spend over $1 billion annually in boating activities.  The study breaks those activities into three main areas: $438 million spent on boating  trips for items such as boat fuel, food and lodging, fishing supplies, clothing  and equipment; $428 million spent on boating-related expenditures such as slip  fees and maintenance; and $144.5 million spent in the purchase of either new or  brokered used boats.
<P>
The study focuses strictly on the activities of registered and documented  private recreational boats in Maryland during the summers of 1993 and 1994, and  does not take into account the additional impact that transient boaters and  others who spend money with Maryland marine trade industries likely have. Thus a boater registered in Delaware who spends most of the time boating on the  Chesapeake Bay is not included in the report's results.  With Maryland being a  major destination for boaters registered in other states, there is a significant amount of "out-of-state" expenditures not captured in the study. Additionally it does not include the economic impact of charter boat activity in Maryland such  as fishing charters or tourist boat excursions.
<P>
Lipton says "The study demonstrates that the restoration and protection of the  Chesapeake Bay has important economic implications.  A degraded Bay means less  boating, less income and less employment generated in the region.  The study  also shows that boater spending has a wide impact both geographically, and  across industries.  When boating is impacted, negatively or positively, there  are concurrent impacts across the economy."
<P>
Lipton says that similar studies conducted in Florida, Texas and Seattle areas  have like results. He also notes that the boating industry is showing signs of  rebounding from a deep recession in the early 1990's which means good news for  Maryland's economy.  Lipton plans on updating the Maryland study annually based  on new figures on boating registrations and price inflation.
<P>
Based on 190,436 registered and documented boats in Maryland in 1993, the  analysis by the Maryland Sea Grant Extension Program employed detailed survey  questionnaires of boaters. The Department of Natural Resources Boating  Administration and the Marine Trades Association of Maryland assisted in the  design and sample selection of the survey. The University of Maryland Survey  Research Center conducted the survey. 
<P>
Survey responses provided measures of expenditures and spending patterns (i.e.,  food and lodging, fishing supplies, boat fuel, transportation) by owners of  trailered powerboats, in-water powerboats and sailboats. The average  expenditures for each class of boat was then multiplied by the number of   registered boats of that class.  In 1993, the registered and documented boats  were as follows:  trailered powerboats: 100,087;  in-water powerboats   60,021;  and sailboats 30,328. 
<P>
To determine the economic activity generated by the recreational boating  industry, an impact analysis planning (IMPLAN) model - a national input/output  model - was used to assess how expenditures generated by the recreational  boating industry affected various aspects of the state economy, for instance,  their affect on income and jobs.

 Solutions to today's global environmental problems require close and "real time" interactions between academic organizations for disseminating information, teaching, holding meetings/conferences, and coordinating projects.  This capability would substantially reduce money spent on travel and the related time lost while providing direct contact with groups not having access to university and research centers nor ability to travel.
<P>
In response to this need, Maryland Sea Grant is developing a lecture series focused on the declining fisheries in the world oceans and the role of marine biotechnology.  This a joint effort with the Center of Marine Biotechnology, another part of the University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute (UMBI), the University of North Carolina at Research Park, the University of Bergen (Norway), Goteborg University (Sweden), and the Office of Global Programs (NOAA).  
<P>
By taking advantage of the latest interactive video technology, participants will take part in each of the monthly seminars in real time.  The teleconference lectures are an extension of  the Cooperative Program in Europe for Research on Nature and Industry Through Coordinated University Studies (i.e., Copernicus), which brings together European universities to work on ecological and environmental issues facing the world today.

The purpose of <FONT COLOR="FF0000">HAACP Countdown</FONT> is to alert the seafood processing industry on strategies to successfully implement the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's mandatory seafood inspection guidelines -- the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point program, which goes into effect on <B>December 18, 1997.</B>
<P>
In addition to the six newsletters, the Sea Grant and Cooperation Extension Service programs of North Carolina, Virginia and Maryland are offering HAACP courses. FDA recognizes these courses as the standard for compliance with the training requirement of the HAACP regulation. The bimonthly issues of this newsletter during 1997 will keep you informed of developments in training and sources of information.  The newsletters highlight steps processors can take to prepare for HACCP inspection.

<A NAME="INTRO"></A>
The <A HREF="../../index.html">National Sea Grant College Program</A> and the <A HREF="http://www.nfwf.org/">National Fish and Wildlife Foundation</A> are seeking innovative, creative research and outreach projects that address aspects of the problem of nonindigenous species in U.S. coastal and Great Lakes ecosystems.  About $1.9M is available from the National Sea Grant College Program to support these projects in FY97; up to an additional $2.8M may be available in FY98 depending on the overall funding appropriation for the National Sea Grant College Program.  Of this amount, 70% of the funds will be made available to support research projects and 30% for outreach activities. The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) is making available an additional $110,000 for new projects through this Announcement.
<P>
Proposals should be submitted to the respective State Sea Grant Programs  by <B>March 17, 1997</B> (please see <A HREF="../../SGDirectors.html">Sea Grant Directors</A> for names and addresses).

<H3>Research and Outreach Framework</H3>
</CENTER>
An interagency Ad Hoc Committee on Exotic Species in the Great Lakes has prepared a report entitled, "Coordinated Program of Research for Exotic Species in the Great Lakes."  This report, although targeted for the Great Lakes, provides a useful framework for research and outreach on any nonindigenous species problems and is therefore being used to structure this more general Announcement for both marine and Great Lakes nonindigenous species problems.  
<P>
The <A HREF="../../index.html">National Sea Grant College Program</A> encourages research and outreach proposals that address one or more of the following program areas:
<P>
<OL>
<B><LI>Biology and Life History</B><BR>
Basic biological research into population dynamics, genetics, physiology, behavior, and parasites and diseases of nonindigenous species with the potential to lead to the development of ecologically safe, effective, and inexpensive control.  Research on the ecological and environmental tolerances of nonindigenous species with the potential for prediction of eventual geographic and ecological impacts.
<P>
<B><LI>Effects on ecosystems</B><BR>
Research on the impacts of nonindigenous species at each stage of their life history with the potential for helping natural resource managers determine how to minimize the impacts on established biota and their habitats.
<P>
<B><LI>Socio-Economic Analysis: Costs and Benefits</B><BR>
Research on the potential impacts of nonindigenous species on human health in terms of spread of disease, concentration of pollutants, and contamination or purification of drinking water sources.  Economic impact on sport, commercial and tribal fisheries, the recreation and tourism industry, the shipping and navigation industry, and municipal and industrial water users.  Use of research results to provide a scientific basis for developing sound policy and environmental law, and for public education and technology transfer.
<P>
<B><LI>Control and Mitigation</B><BR>
Research into various types of control -- engineering (redesigning water intakes, etc,), physical (scraping, filtering, etc.), chemical (biocides, antifoulants, etc.), biological (parasites, predators, etc.), and physicochemical (heat, salinity, pH, etc.) -- to develop selective, effective controls that minimize adverse ecological/environmental impacts. Outreach activities that will transfer these technologies to the appropriate users.
<P>
<B><LI>Preventing New Introductions</B><BR>
Research and outreach into identifying vectors of introduction, developing cost-effective, realistic methods of prevention, and transferring the information to appropriate users.  In particular, research to develop workable and effective methods to eliminate ballast water discharge as a source of nonindigenous species introductions without imposing undue hardships on the shipping industry.
<P>
<B><LI>Reducing the Spread of Established Populations</B><BR>
Research and outreach to identify mechanisms for further dispersal of individual established species that will lead to the development of safeguards and protocols to prevent and/or slow the spread of nonindigenous species to uninfested areas, and transfer of that information to appropriate users.
</OL>
<P>
The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (<A HREF="http://www.nfwf.org/">NFWF</A>) encourages proposals for individual student fellowships that will build the student's capacity to use marine systematics as an effective tool in protecting the indigenous components of marine ecosystems from nonindigenous introductions.  These projects may support any of the six program areas listed above.
<P>
Return to <A HREF="#TOP">top</A>.<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="GUIDELINES"></A>
<CENTER>
<H3>Proposal Guidelines</H3>
</CENTER>
The ideal research or outreach project attacks a well-defined problem that will be or is a societal issue.  The organization or people whose task it will be to make related decisions, or who will be able to make specific use of the projects results, will have been identified and contacted by the Principal Investigator(s).  The project will show an understanding of what constitutes necessary and sufficient information for responsible decision-making or for applied use, and will promise to generate such information by itself or in concert with other planned activities.  Projects that result in new knowledge and understanding which is generalizable to the solution of similar problems or other geographic areas have a higher priority.   
Research projects are expected to have:  a rigorous, hypothesis-based scientific work plan; a strong rationale for the proposed research; and well-established user relationships.  Research undertaken jointly with industry, business, or other agencies with interest in the problem will be seen as being meritorious.  Their contribution to the research may be in the form of collaboration, in-kind services, or dollar support. Projects that are solely monitoring efforts are not appropriate for Sea Grant funding.
<P>
One- or two-year proposals will be entertained for funding by the National Sea Grant College Program; proposals submitted for National Fish and Wildlife Foundation funding should be for one year only. Annual requests for Sea Grant Federal funds generally are between $50,000 and $100,000 and may include administrative overhead. Proposals for NFWF should be in the range of $10,000 to $15,000 in Federal funds and may not include administrative overhead.  
<P>
Both the National Sea Grant College Program and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation require matching funding for grants.  Sea Grant awards must include a non-Federal matching contribution of at least $1 for every $2 of Federal support requested.   For NFWF awards, the matching requirement is greater: a non-Federal contribution of at least $1 is required for every $1 of Federal support requested; however, NFWF may be able to help locate matching funds if necessary, and potential investigators for the student fellowships are encouraged to apply even if the matching requirement has not been met entirely.

<H2>Can Increasing Stocks of Oysters in Chesapeake Bay Serve to Improve Water Quality? (R/P-40)</H2>
Once the site of the nation's richest oyster grounds, the Chesapeake Bay has seen its oyster populations decline sharply in the first quarter of this century, largely the result of overharvesting. In more recent years, those populations have been further decimated as parasitic disease has swept throughout most regions of the Bay. While the oyster industry has been a major casualty of this near elimination of oysters, the health of the Bay ecosystem may be suffering as well. Since adult oysters can filter as much as 50 gallons of water a day during the summer, they remove large amounts of phytoplankton -- curbing the overabundance of these algae through nutrient reduction and other strategies is a major goal of the Chesapeake Bay Program. 
<P>
While there has been considerable speculation about whether restored oyster populations in the Bay could play a major role in reducing algal density, the evidence has been more circumstantial than demonstrable. Using a sophisticated experimental design, this project will test the hypothesis that eutrophied waters can be substantially improved as a consequence of the feeding activity of oysters. The researchers hope to demonstrate that by removing large quantities of phytoplankton, oysters also reduce the amount of biodegradable organic material that settles to bottom waters, where it contributes to oxygen depletion. If successful, this project should provide valuable insight into the significance of restoring a key species based on its ecological importance.

<A NAME="R/P-41"></A><H2>The Role of Dissolved Organic Nitrogen in the Eutrophication of Chesapeake Bay (R/P-41)</H2>
For more than a decade, scientists have been detailing the impacts of heavy nutrient inputs to the Chesapeake Bay -- among those impacts are massive algal growth, poor water quality, loss of underwater vegetation and an altered food web that may promote extensive bacterial production. A key element of the Bay cleanup aims at reducing nutrient loadings by 40 percent, to levels comparable to the 1950s. The major targets for nutrient reduction are river inflow, sewage and land runoff -- all sources of dissolved inorganic nitrogen. But inorganic nitrogen accounts for only about 50 percent of the Bay's total dissolved nitrogen; 20 to 50 percent takes the form of dissolved organic nitrogen, such as urea, amino acids, and nitrogen released from plankton and other sources. 
<P>
Organic nitrogen was once thought to be relatively unavailable biologically, but previous work by Patricia Glibert has shown that this is not the case. Just how organic nitrogen impacts the food web is an important issue, since at this time the Bay cleanup focuses on inorganic nitrogen alone. For example, the Chesapeake Bay model, which predicts the amount of nutrient reduction necessary to restore water quality, is based only on sources of inorganic nitrogen. In this project, Glibert and Carolyn Miller will characterize seasonal changes in the composition of dissolved organic nitrogen along the length of the Bay and in two rivers, the Patuxent and Choptank. In laboratory experiments, they will determine the extent to which dissolved organic nitrogen is biologically available to bacteria and phytoplankton. The results will provide information on whether organic nitrogen is a more important nitrogen source to control in specific parts of the Bay.

<A NAME="R/P-38"></A><H2>Bacterioplankton Dynamics in the Patuxent River: Response to Nitrogen Abatement (R/P-38)</H2>
Major upgrading of sewage treatment plants on the Patuxent River -- first begun during the late 1980s -- will reduce discharges of nitrogen to the river by nearly 50 percent. Resulting benefits to water quality are expected to be significant, since heavy loading of nitrogen and phosphorus has been linked to oxygen depletion and habitat loss, as well as shifts in the food web that favor the production of microbes over the production of fish. The cutback of nutrients to the Patuxent in effect makes the river a natural laboratory and offers a singular opportunity to examine whether nutrient reductions are reflected in changes to the structure of the food web. 
<P>
Because of year-to-year variabilities in river flow, nutrient runoff and other climatic effects, such a project needs to be conducted over a number of years to detect whether nutrient reductions show any positive trends in water quality, for example, in lowered bacterial production. With Sea Grant support since 1994, Cynthia Gilmour and Douglas Capone have been focusing on the effect that nutrient reduction has on the microbial community in different salinity regions of the Patuxent -- their aim is to determine whether, as loadings from sewage treatment plants decline, bacteria compete with phytoplankton for limited inorganic nutrients.  Specifically, they are evaluating whether the Baywide 40 percent nutrient reduction goal is sufficient to achieve desired reductions in algal production. They will also evaluate what conditions direct the flow of organic material through microbial paths as opposed to pathways leading to higher organisms, such as fish and shellfish.

<A NAME="R/P-37"></A><H2>Satellite Remote Sensing with SeaWiFS to Detect Seasonal and Interannual Variability in Phytoplankton Abundance in the Chesapeake Bay and Adjacent Coastal Waters (R/P-37)</H2>
Shipboard studies have been critical to developing our understanding of processes in Chesapeake Bay such as the relationship between nutrient loading and phytoplankton biomass.  But traditional oceanographic methods can be ineffective for sampling dynamic features that typify estuaries, including dense and often patchy blooms of diatoms and dinoflagellates.  Remote sensing using satellite and aircraft instruments enables improved spatial and temporal coverage for several important properties, including chlorophyll concentrations, turbidity and temperature.  Since 1989, Larry Harding and his colleagues have used aircraft remote sensing with the Ocean Data Acquisition System (ODAS) to provide synoptic, baywide information on algal abundance, production and dynamics in the Bay.  This effort has generated a set of unmatched ocean color data and provided much insight into the variability of phytoplankton seasonally and from year to year.
<P>
In this project, Harding and Wayne Esaias will use ocean color data from two aircraft instruments, ODAS and the SeaWiFS Aircraft Simulator (SAS II), to measure the distribution and abundance of phytoplankton chlorophyll in the Chesapeake Bay and adjacent coastal waters.  The data from these aircraft instruments will be combined with satellite data from the new ocean color satellite instrument, the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), following its scheduled launch in late 1996 to provide synoptic, frequent data on phytoplankton dynamics in these nutrient-rich waters.  The satellite data have the advantage of high synopticity and regularity of coverage and will augment the fine-scale information obtained using ODAS and SAS II.  This project will provide data on phytoplankton biomass to scientists and managers who are working to accurately assess improvements of Bay water quality.

<A NAME="R/OC-01"></A><H2>Measurement and Modeling of Surface Waves in Northern Chesapeake Bay (R/OC-01)</H2>
Waves riding the surface waters of the Chesapeake Bay are a driving force in a host of processes -- from erosion of shorelines to the scouring and suspension of bottom sediments (sediments that may contain toxic compounds and other chemicals) to the dispersion of dredged material and the deep mixing of the Bay's water masses. Most of our understanding about the behavior and effects of surface waves, however, is anecdotal or based on limited computer modeling. While wind is the chief driving force for wave formation in the Chesapeake, there are few data and even less capability for predicting the effects of different wind conditions. 
<P>
Focusing on the northern Bay, Lawrence Sanford will implement a wind-wave computer model; first, he will gather wind and wave data during different seasons and at several locations. He will then use these data as inputs to mathematical models and later for comparisons with results from running those models. The most successfully calibrated model will be used to produce a set of predicted wave responses to different wind conditions. Sanford can then compare these values to nearby weather information that will then be available for a wide variety of applications by scientists and resource managers tracking the physical dynamics of the Bay, and by other users of the Bay's waterways.

<A NAME="R/ES-04"></A><H2>Susceptibility of Chesapeake Bay to Invasions of Non-indigenous Species Associated with Ballast Water (R/ES-04)</H2>
he release and proliferation of exotic, or nonindigenous, species to coastal waters in the United States has been linked to their international transport by way of ship ballast tanks. According to the recent "National Biological Invasions Shipping Study" -- commissioned jointly by the National Sea Grant Program and the U.S. Coast Guard -- big ships dump more than 2.4 million gallons of ballast water into U.S. waters every hour. Exotic species that arrive in U.S. waters can alter ecosystems and potentially change food webs, spread diseases, introduce biological toxins, and replace commercially important species with unharvestable varieties. For example, zebra mussels ferried into the Great Lakes from Europe have caused considerable economic damage, and have profoundly changed the ecosystem of lakes and rivers as they have spread through the nation's waterways.  
<P>
To determine the susceptibility of the Bay to new exotic organisms transported in ship ballast water, researchers are studying factors which promote or thwart biological invasions. Of the nearly 90 ships they have tested in the ports of Baltimore and Norfolk, 90 percent of the samples carried live organisms, among them, fish, crustaceans, barnacles, bivalve molluscs, copepods, diatoms, dinoflagellates, flatworms and polychaete worms. This project will determine whether these organisms are capable of surviving local conditions and invading Bay waters -- the findings will provide a basis for developing management procedures to regulate ballast water discharge and to minimize the introduction of such species into the nation's waters.

<DL><DD>Sum of photosynthesis - daily respiration for all organisms<P>
</DL>could serve as such an indicator.<P>
In 1992, Michael Kemp began a project to develop an index that would serve as a measure of trophic condition and oxygen depletion potential.  Measuring integrated metabolic process as changes in oxygen concentrations along the Bay's axis, his results to date show significant differences between the upper, mid and lower portions of the Bay.<P>
In the next two years, Kemp, Christopher Madden and Water Boynton are extending this study to cover the Bay's shallow regions, which represent over 50 percent of the Chesapeake's total area.  Preliminary results indicate that these regions have metabolic characteristics quite different from the deep areas.  For example, the shallow waters can Support considerable algal production;  and recycle of nutrients and organic material in bottom waters, thus contributing significantly to net community metabolism.  They can also be a source of organic matter to deeper waters which can lead to oxygen depeletion.<P>

<A NAME="HARDING"></A><H2>Satellite Remote Sensing with SeaWiFS to Detect Seasonal and Interannual Variability in Phytoplankton Abundance in the Chesapeake Bay and Adjacent Coastal Waters (R/P-37)</H2>
Conventional shipboard studies are critical to understanding processes such as nutrient loading and phytoplankton productivity in the Chesapeake Bay and other estuaries.  But sampling at discrete locations can miss dynamic features such as the formation of dense but patchy phytoplankton blooms.<P> 
Remote sensing from airborne instruments can provide broad surveys of a water body and can greatly improve sampling and data quality.  Since 1989, Lawrence Harding has used aircraft remote sensing with the Ocean Data Acquisition System (<A HREF="http://155.206.19.100/ODAS.html">ODAS</A>) to provide synoptic, baywide information on algal abundance, production and dynamics in the Bay.<P>
In this project, Harding and Wayne Esaias will use ocean color data from the new Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) satellite to measure the distribution and abundance of chlorophyll in the Chesapeake and adjacent coastal waters.  The satellite will provide more synoptic data and will complement the fine spatial scale that is obtained with ODAS.  This project will also mark a transition in technology, setting the stage for the routine use of remotely sensed information, by satellites and other means, for environmental management.<P>

<A NAME="GILMORE"></A><H2>Bacterioplankton Dynamics in the Patuxent River:  Response to Nitrogen Abatement (R/P-38)</H2>
Over the next several years, upgrading of sewage treatment plants on the Patuxent River should reduce discharges of nitrogen by nearly 50 percent. Expectations are high that the environmental health of the river will improve significantly since heavy nutrient loading has been linked to oxygen depletion and habitat loss.<P>
Nutrient overenrichment is also thought to be responsible for food web shifts that favor the production of bacteria and other microbes over the production of fish and shellfish.  In some cases microbial productivity exceed that of the phytoplankton.  Ongoing reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus to the Patuxent, in effect, makes the river a natural laboratory, thus offering scientists a unique opportunity to examine the response of the food web.<P>
In this project, Cynthia Gilmour and Douglas Capone will study the changing impact of nutrient reductions on microbial production and phytoplankton populations.  Specifically, they will evaluate whether the Baywide 40 percent reduction goal is sufficient to achieve desired reductions in algal production.  In addition, they will help determine what conditions direct the flow of organic material through microbial paths instead of to higher organisms.<P>

<A NAME="RUIZ"></A><H2>Susceptibility of Chesapeake Bay to Invasions of Non-Indigenous Species Associated with Ballast Waters (R/ES-4)</H2>
The release and proliferation of exotic, or non-indigenous, species to coastal waters in the United States has recently been tied to their transport in ship ballast tanks.  Some organisms such as zebra mussels have caused considerable economic damage and, in a number of instances, have profoundly changed the ecosystem of impacted lakes and rivers.  San Francisco Bay, for example, invaded by at least 14 non-indigenous species since 1973, and the Great Lakes by 43 exotics since 1960.
<P>
Once established, non-indigenous species can alter feeding networks and community composition.  They can also significantly impact fisheries by spreading diseases, introducing biological toxins, and replacing commercially important species with unharvestable varieties.
<P>
To determine the susceptibility of the Chesapeake Bay to exotic organisms discharged in ship ballast water, a team of researchers will be working in conjunction with a Coast Guard-funded study to sample and identify organisms from the ballast.  They will also examine the viability of invertebrate larvae, zooplankton and dinoflagellates carried in this ballast and will sample potential invasion sites for the presence of introduced species.  The results will provide a scientific basis for designing management procedures to regulate ballast water discharge and to minimize the introduction of such species into the nation's waters.<P>

<A NAME="SANFORD"></A><H2>Measurement and Modeling of Surface Waves in Northern Chesapeake Bay (R/GE-3)</H2>
Any attempt to predict human and natural impacts on the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem - from dredged spoil disposal to exchange of chemical compounds between air and surface waters - must take into account the effects of surface waves.  They are an important, but often neglected forcing mechanism for shoreline erosion, sediment transport and the resuspension of bottom sediments.<P>
While wind is the chief driving force for wave formation in the Chesapeake, there is little data and even less capability in predicting the effects of different wind conditions.  Beginning in 1995, Lawrence Sanford will implement a wind-wave computer model (he is now testing several) for the entire Bay.  Focusing on the northern portion of the estuary, he will gather wind and wave data over a range of seasons and locations.  He will use this data as inputs to mathematical models and later for comparisons with the results from running those models.  The most successfully calibrated model will then be used to produce a set of predicted wave responses to different wind conditions.  Sanford can then compare these values to nearby weather information to estimate the "wave climatology" for that location, information that will then be available for a wide variety of applications by scientists and resource management agencies as the track the physical dynamics of the Bay.<P>

<A NAME="R3"></A>
<H4>Where Should Processors Begin?</H4>
Most processors have some concept of HACCP principles but may not understand how to implement them in a useful, business-friendly way.  In the HACCP Countdown series we will cover each of the principles, using examples to demonstrate actual practice.  We start with a discussion of the prerequisites to HACCP.

<A NAME="R4"></A>
<H4>HACCP Prerequisites</H4>
You will learn in the HACCP course that existing regulations related to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) are essential for HACCP to be successful.  Regulatory officials often reference Title 21 part 110 of the Code of Federal Regulations when speaking of GMPs.  The GMPs outline agency expectations for producing safe and wholesome products with regard to  physical facilities, sanitation, pest control, product handling and other areas.  HACCP does not replace the GMPs -- both are required. 
<P> 
To make GMPs plant specific, address each of the requirements in a set of written procedures.  First, describe each step of the operation, from receipt of raw materials through shipping or warehousing.  Expand these steps to include company policies related to purchase specifications, product lot coding, the basis for chosen processing schedules, preventive maintenance, employee training and references to regulations or industry guidelines where applicable.  Also describe methods you use to prevent contamination, especially cross-contamination of cooked products with raw materials.
<P>
Next, develop written procedures for cleaning and sanitizing the plant and equipment.  These procedures should specify cleaning and sanitation methods, cleaning sequence and time schedules, the equipment and chemicals used and chemical concentrations. Include the location and use of sanitizer dips and footbaths and procedures for monitoring sanitizer concentrations.  Also address policies related to employee hygiene, such as hand washing, clothing, illness or skin sores.  Written plans for pest management, product recalls and customer complaints are also recommended.  
<P>
A company-specific description of product flow and processing procedures is commonly referred to as Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).  Those which pertain specifically to GMPs are called Sanitation Standard Operating Procedures (SSOPs).  They can be combined into one concise document. 
Request a sample SSOP, FDA GMPs and supporting record keeping forms from the seafood specialist in your state. 
<P>
GMPs and SSOPs establish the foundation for HACCP.  When properly implemented, SSOPs greatly facilitate Hazard Analysis: the first step in HACCP.  They help to justify the selection of Critical Control Points under HACCP and may reduce the daily record keeping requirements of your plan.
<P>
Prior to HACCP development, have on file any documentation which supports processing procedures used in the plant.  For example, a heating step which kills disease-causing bacteria should have a process schedule established by in-plant study if the step is implemented as a point of control or if heating could otherwise affect the safety of the product.  Published industry guidelines or standards are often valuable supporting documents, as are microbiological or chemical analyses of products and water.  Also, conduct your own audit for GMP compliance and review inspection reports for deficiencies.

<A NAME="R5"></A>
<H4>Bottom Line</H4>
All of this information may seem a bit overwhelming considering that we have yet to discuss the mysteries of HACCP.  As you will soon learn, however, the HACCP plan itself is usually very brief and limited in scope.  Written SOPs/SSOPs are not required by the FDA regulation but will allow you to substantiate your HACCP plan when questioned during inspection.  In addition to HACCP, the regulation requires processors to keep sanitation records.  These will be discussed in the next issue of HACCP Countdown but are important here because maintenance of sanitation records is greatly facilitated by SSOPs and by a general state of GMP compliance.

<H3>A Note on Implementing HACCP</H3>
</CENTER>

The logical steps for HACCP implementation begin with prerequisite programs (compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices) progressing to Hazard Analysis, Identification of Critical Control Points, Establishing Critical Limits Monitoring, Corrective Actions, Record-Keeping and Verification.   Experience shows, however, companies may need 6-12 months of practice with monitoring and record keeping systems to identify methods which work best for them.  While we will cover these topics in detail in later issues, we recommend that you begin to gain experience now.  Consider starting with the following steps:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Identify places in your operation where you expect to keep HACCP records, i.e. places or procedures which could affect food safety.  These include cooking and pasteurization steps, time-temperature control for ready-to-eat products, brining (salt content) of fish to be smoked and shellfish harvest sites (tags). 
<BR>
<LI>If routine monitoring is not in place in these areas, start keeping records of the parameters you believe are necessary for a safe product.  This may be a good time to purchase that temperature chart recorder you have been considering.
<BR>
<LI>Attend a recognized seafood HACCP training course as soon as possible.
<BR>
<LI>Review or, if needed, write Standard Operating Procedures for how and why each operation is performed.  (See <A HREF="#R3">HACCP Prerequisites</A>)<BR>

For more than two decades, oyster populations in Chesapeake Bay and mid-Atlantic 
water have been increasingly battered by Dermo and MSX, two parasitic diseases for 
which there is no known remedy. In the northeast, a new and as yet unidentified 
pathogen, called Juvenile Oyster Disease (JOD), has been taking a toll in hatcheries.  
On the west coast, the Pacific Oyster has been subjected to puzzling summer 
mortalities. 
<P>
The continuing decline of oyster stocks has been a catalyst for federal support of the 
Oyster Disease Research Program, a far-reaching effort by the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration to support innovative research that will lead to 
improved techniques for combating oyster disease.  The Program began in 1990 with 
oversight by the NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service and its Chesapeake Bay 
Office, and is now administrated by the National Sea Grant College Program. 
<P>
Through competitive proposals each year, the Oyster Disease Research Program is 
supporting effort to develop:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>optimal strategies for managing around disease<BR>
<LI>molecular tools to better monitor the onset and presence of disease<BR>
<LI>better understanding of the processes of parasitic infection<BR>
<LI>improved understanding of the oyster's immune system<BR>
<LI>hatchery techniques for producing disease-resistant strains<BR>
</UL>
This extensive program of ongoing research coupled with outreach and 
management efforts aims to better serve the restoration of healthy populations of 
oysters in the nation's coastal waters.

<H3>OVERVIEW</H3>
</CENTER>
Biotechnology can be defined as the application of scientific and engineering principles to provide goods and services through mediation of biological agents (adapted from a definition in <FONT><I>Biotechnology: International Trends and Perspectives</I></FONT> by Alan T. Bull, Geofrey Hold, and Malcome D. Lilly, organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, Paris, 1982, p.21).  It encompasses more than technology based on DNA and other related molecular methods that are recent, powerful tools. Traditional applications of biotechnology such as antibiotic production through fermentation and microbial sewage treatment and water purification comprise huge sectors of the economy.  Modern molecular biotechnology, such as cloning of insulin for commercial production in bacterial cultures, is growing rapidly.  In just a few years such technology has become a $10 billion sector of industry in the United States. 
<P>
Biotechnology depends on exploiting information stored in genes and their component DNA. Genes of terrestrial organisms have been the primary source of information for the biochemical products and bioprocessing schemes that form the foundations of biotechnology.  While terrestrial organisms exhibit great species diversity, marine organisms represent greater phylogenetic diversity.  That is -- most of the major classes of the Earth's plants, animals, and microorganisms are primarily or exclusively marine.  Thus, marine organisms represent sources of unique genetic information and important natural resources for development.  However, few have been used in biotechnology by either traditional methods or modern molecular means because the research base for doing so is meager.  
<P>
The large majority of marine organisms, including microorganisms, are not known well enough for their gene pool and biological processes to be accessible to those who develop and practice biotechnology.  However, exploratory research shows the potential for exploiting the biochemical capabilities of marine organisms to provide models for new classes of pharmaceuticals, polymers, enzymes, other chemical products, and industrial processes as well as vaccines, diagnostic and analytical reagents, and genetically altered organisms for aquaculture and the seafood industry. Biotechnology also is providing new tools and approaches for defining fisheries stocks and ecological relationships of marine organisms and for improving the base of knowledge for resource management. 
<P>
The National Sea Grant College Program's research and outreach in support of marine biotechnology was expanded significantly in Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995 as a result of increased Congressional funding for this purpose - $3.2 million in FY 1994, an additional $2 million in FY 1995.  The additional funding in these two years brought total federal and matching funding to $8.5 million and $4.2 million respectively in Fiscal Year 1995.  It brought the number of Sea Grant projects in this field to 125 and allowed their average annual funding to increase to about $100,000 including matching funds.   The level of investment remained essentially the same in Fiscal Year 1996 at over $12,000,000 in federal and matching funding.  An estimated 20-25 percent of the projects  at 50 major universities and research institutions around the country have industrial matching funds and/or collaborators. Others have collaborators in resource management agencies.  The research is advancing science (see <A HREF="apndxa.html">Appendix A</A>), training students for careers in high technology, and providing foundations for commercial development.  The research projects (see <A HREF="apndxb.html">Appendix B</A>) can be grouped in the interrelated categories described below.

<H3>Gene Technology for Shellfish and Finfish</H3>
</CENTER>
Medical researchers at the University of California, San Diego, collaborating with marine biologists at the University of Connecticut, have developed techniques for using modified viral particles (retroviral vectors) to alter the genes of a marine invertebrate.  This is the first application of molecular biology to alter DNA in a marine invertebrate.   The researchers demonstrated their methods by genetically altering the dwarf surfclam.  They disarm the viruses by removing their genetic material so that they are incapable of replicating and then add foreign genes as a payload to the virus.  Although retroviral particles are used widely as a gene delivery vehicle in human gene-therapy experiments, getting the vectors to enter non-mammalian cells proved difficult.  The researchers substituted a new viral envelope which allows the vectors to enter virtually any type of cell.  For the surfclam experiments they engineered "reporter" genes into the vectors.  This caused the fertilized surfclam eggs to display a blue color and indicate that the implanted genes were present and functioning. The work is expected to provide a new tool to fight diseases that attack commercial stocks of oysters, clams, and abalone.  Once the genes responsible for protecting cultured shellfish from disease have been identified, retroviral vectors can be used to deliver these protective genes directly to brood stock.   Pangenix, Inc. has secured a license to tailor the technique for commercial use.
<P>
In related work at Stanford University researchers have demonstrated that electroporation can be used as an effective means of introducing foreign DNA into abalone embryos. Seventy to 100 percent of three- to seven-month-old juveniles retained the inserted DNA. And at the University of Minnesota, researchers working with finfish, have developed technology that will allow the controlled expression of foreign genes introduced into fishes.  In any animal cell, the natural state of most genes is "off"; thus, to be able to make foreign genes useful, one must be able to turn them on or cause them to be expressed. The genes must also be insulated from normal gene regulators already in the cell.  The Minnesota researchers have demonstrated that genetic insulator sequences obtained from chicken and fruit fly DNA can function in fishes and they have discovered gene controllers that work best for turning on, to proper levels, genes foreign to the fish.

<H3>Producing Soft-Shell Crabs</H3>
</CENTER>
Researchers at the University of Alabama at Birmingham have successfully cloned the gene for the blue crab's molt-inhibiting hormone (MIH). Decreased MIH levels trigger the molting process of the crab which sheds its shell to grow.  For a few hours after the shedding, the crustaceans are soft and can be eaten whole.  To successfully clone large quantities of MIH cheaply and efficiently, the researchers have inserted MIH-gene into insect cells to take advantage of their DNA replicating machinery.  By replicating the material, the scientists can produce sufficient quantities for research to develop a way to block its release or effectiveness and thus be able to produce soft crabs on demand.  Forcing crabs to molt on command would provide an abundant, year-round, and controllable supply of soft-shell crabs for the seafood industry.

Extending earlier research that identified methylfarnesoate (MF) as a  juvenile hormone in crustaceans and determined its role in reproduction, researchers at the University of Connecticut have developed technology to synchronize shrimp egg production and to increase the number and quality of eggs produced.  Females injected with MF are stimulated to produce eggs ready for fertilization.  The procedure produces 180 percent more eggs than the traditional crude method of removing the eyestalk gland.  It will increase aquacultural efficiency.

<H3>Improving Strains for Aquaculture</H3>
</CENTER>
In efforts to improve the efficiency of producing triploid Pacific oysters that are an important component of the aquaculture industry, researchers at Rutgers University and Louisiana State University have been working on technology that would not require the use of cytochalasin B, a FDA controlled substance that induces triploidy.  (Triploid oysters don't spawn and so remain fat all summer, unlike diploids, which use up their stored glycogen in the spawning process and become lean and unmarketable in the summer.)  The Rutgers researchers have produced tetraploids and crossed them with diploids to produce triploids from both male/female and female/male crosses.  All surviving oysters from the crosses were triploids whereas only 46 percent of oysters were triploid by cytochalasin-B induction.  Triploids from the crosses at eight and ten months of age were 13 and 51 percent, respectively, larger than normal diploids.  The results indicate that mating tetraploids and diploids is a better method for triploid production, that such triploids are better suited to aquaculture, and that they are ideal for population control.

<H3>Controlling Fish Disease</H3>
</CENTER>
Working collaboratively, researchers at the University of Maine and  the Department of Interior's National Fish Health Research Laboratory have developed a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) assay for detecting and identifying aquatic birnaviruses.  These birnaviruses are the largest and most diverse group of viruses within the family Birnaviridae and include viruses from numerous species of fish and invertebrates.  Many are agents of diseases in cultured and wild freshwater and marine species.  Most are closely related antigenically.   The RTPCR assay is a rapid and reliable substitute for cell culture methods for the detection of fish disease agents such as infectious pancreatic necrosis virus.   It will enhance prevention and control of fish diseases.

Working in collaboration with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and partial support from the National Marine Fisheries Service, researchers at the University of Alabama at Birmingham have developed rapid and highly specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques for detecting pathogenic bacteria in food products.   The PCR techniques amplify unique DNA segments of the pathogens and can be used to distinguish pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains of the same species.  The researchers have applied their techniques to simultaneous detection of pathogenic and total Escherichia coli in a single reaction in meat products and to detection of Salmonella, Vibrio vulnificus, and Vibrio parahemolyticus in shellfish, and Listeria monocytogenes in cooked sausage and milk.

<H3>Ensuring Safety of Shellfish and Recreational Waters</H3>
</CENTER>
Vibrio vulnificus is a bacterium common to many coastal waters.  It can cause severe disease in some humans - death in those with damaged immune systems.  Filtering-feeding animals, including oysters, can accumulate the bacterium and become unsafe for raw consumption; thus, being able to rapidly assay for the organisms is important.  Researchers at Louisiana State University have developed antibody-based reagents for the rapid detection and identification of V. vulnificus in food and environmental samples.  They are using the reagents to classify the relative virulence of more than 70 isolates collected from the Gulf Coast states.  Their work suggests that among a large and unknown number of V. vulnificus strains associated with seafood-producing environments, only a relatively small number of them account for the illnesses associated with the bacterium.  Because these strains can be easily detected and monitored, it may be possible now to manage growing waters and monitor seafood supplies so that consumers can buy and consume safe, wholesome shellfish.
<P>
In related research, researchers at the University of Hawaii have developed immunological methods to detect the human pathogens Salmonella typhimurium and Shigella dysenteriae and plan to test their effectiveness in identifying marine recreational waters contaminated with pathogens from land-based discharges.  Also addressing the issue of harmful bacteria in coastal waters, researchers at the Universities of California, Los Angeles and Santa Barbara, turned to DNA technology as a substitute for current monitoring methods that are unacceptably slow.  The technology can quickly identify all the microorganisms in a sample.  By extracting bacterial genetic material from seawater samples and replicating it millions of times by means of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), they can then sort the resulting genetic soup by the types and amounts of bacteria present.  Because bacteria also are present in healthy coastal waters, normal bacterial profiles must be known in order to detect changes resulting from contamination.  The researchers have found that each sample has a few dominant bacterial groups; usually one or two predominant taxa represent 30 to 50 percent of species present.  Their approach will allow them to generate accurate maps of naturally occurring bacteria in coastal waters.  They expect it to provide a means of  monitoring coastal water for bacterial contamination.

Addressing the misrepresentation of other fish species as the higher priced red snapper in some retail outlets, researchers at the University of Florida developed monoclonal antibody techniques to differentiate snappers from other groups of fishes and to differentiate red snappers from other types of snappers.  Using hybridoma techniques, they produced two monoclonal antibodies against red snapper protein a.  One, which showed strong reactivity with several snappers, could be used in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and immunodot blotting to distinguish the snappers from other commonly consumed seafoods and meats.  The second can be used to distinguish red snapper from the other snappers.

<H3>Models for Pharmaceutical Development</H3>

Malaria is a major cause of mortality worldwide.  It causes one to two million deaths annually, mostly of children under age five.  Malarial parasites are becoming increasing resistant to commonly used drugs. Mosquitos that carry the parasite are becoming resistant to insecticides.  Working with partial support from G. D. Searle, Inc. and Monsanto, Inc. researchers at the University of Mississippi have identified several novel marine metabolites that are active against the malarial parasite, Plasmodium falciparum.  Because the metabolites represent new chemical structural classes active against malaria, they will  provide new mechanisms of action against the parasite and may yield better treatments for resistant strains.   Another novel metabolite identified by this research group primarily through detailed analysis of NMR spectra and high resolution mass spectral data was inactive against the malarial parasite, but showed significant activity against four mammalian tumor-cell lines.

Researchers at the University of Hawaii have isolated from a the mollusk, Elysia rufescens, a new compound that is active against solid tumors of the lung and colon.  The complex compound, a depsipeptide, is present in only low concentrations in both the mollusk and an alga on which it feeds, Bryopsis sp. An industrial collaborator has applied for an investigative new drug license in order to commence clinical trials.   Genetic manipulation and culturing of the algal source of the material may be required to supply sufficient quantities of the drug for testing.

The University of California's first major effort in the United States to identify new drugs from marine plants and invertebrate animals is responsible for numerous patents held by the University; several are licensed by pharmaceutical and other industries.  One antiinflammatory natural product, pseudopterosin, has brought over $1.2 million in royalties to the University of California and in 1995 was on the University's "Top 10" royalty-producing inventions.  The novel diterpene glycoside, which inhibits inflammation by a unusual mechanism, is being used in the cosmetic industry and is expected to be used also in the pharmaceutical industry upon the completion of clinical trials that are in progress.

Other researchers at the University of Hawaii are developing industrial microbiology for the cyanobacteria which are rich sources of natural compounds that also are serving as models for drug development.  They have discovered an inducible mechanism for increasing synthesis of the chemical defense compounds in cyanobacteria and optimized culture media for production of the secondary metabolites.  They have determined metabolic control mechanisms and restrictions in cyanobacteria and developed methods for the isolation and identification of genes controlling secondary metabolism.  They are demonstrating that secondary metabolites can be produced in large-scale laboratory cultures of cyanobacteria.

Because some organisms from which potentially valuable new drugs have been isolated are slow growing, rare, or occur in remote areas, synthesis is another approach researchers in Hawaii are taking to providing adequate supplies of bioactive compounds for testing and clinical studies.  They have demonstrated new, highly efficient synthetic methods for producing a family of prostaglandins, originally isolated from marine organisms, that are undergoing clinical trials against chemotherapeutically resistant ovarian cancer.   Their methods provide a reliable means of securing material for clinical trials, and for producing pharmaceutical drugs for market.

<H3>Mammalian Hormones from Algae</H3>
</CENTER>
Algal culture is the approach researchers at Oregon State University (OSU) are taking to production of the novel red algal compounds they have isolated and identified.  These compounds mimic the anti-inflammatory actions of specific human hormones; others are specifically toxic to plant and animal pests that plague agriculture and aquaculture.  Some appear to be as promising as taxol, the anti-tumor agent in yew trees.  Because it takes large quantities of slow-growing plant material to produce enough bioactive agents for testing, the interdisciplinary OSU team, a natural products chemist and a chemical engineer, have developed systems for culturing and harvesting cells, rather than entire plants, in a quick-growing, high-volume "soup."  The system shows promise not only for research, but for eventual commercial production of algal metabolites. They recently have extended their findings on red algae to microalgae (members of the Phaeophyceae and Chlorophyta) and found that they possess similar biosynthetic pathways.  From several they have identified novel prostaglandinlike substances.   Studies of the molecular mechanisms by which some of these marine oxylipins are formed have revealed that novel oxidative reactions are responsible. Understanding these biosynthetic pathways in detail has allowed production of  research biochemicals of high value, such as 12Shydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12SHPETE), and set the stage for development of new classes of pharmaceuticals.

<H3>Producing Anti-Leukemia Drug</H3>
</CENTER>
A slow-growing marine invertebrate, the bryozoan Bugula neritina, is the source of a potentially important drug which is active against leukemia.  The drug occurs in minute amounts in or on the animal.  Because the invertebrate animal lives in a symbiotic relationship with a bacterium, it is theorized that the bacterium,  in exchange for a surface on which to grow, synthesizes the toxic drug in order to protect the bryozoan against predators.  Because large amounts of the drug are needed for clinical trials, researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara are trying to (1) prove the drug is elaborated by the bacterium, and (2) develop methods for large-scale culture of the bacterium.  So far, they have identified the newly described bacterial species and have started producing bacteria-free colonies of the animal which they expect to be free of the drug.

<H3>Novel Composite Materials</H3>

Some organisms produce composite materials whose properties make them superior to synthetic materials used in industry.  Trying to capitalize on nature's secrets, scientists at the Universities of California, Santa Barbara and Berkeley are attempting to produce biomimetic materials, ceramic-like composites, that will have properties useful in new industrial applications.  They are using biomineralized shells and skeletons of marine organisms as models and have developed a new mineral-organic composite material that is highly processible, biodegradable, and exhibits a remarkably high strength-to-weight ratio.  It consists of diatom-produced biosilicate and chitin fibers. 
<P>
One obstacle to research aimed at developing these new materials has been the difficulty in purifying the genes and proteins that control the process of biomineralization in corals. The researchers have overcome this difficulty by developing a method to turn on the coral genes that control mineral formation thereby activating synthesis of the proteins that direct the formation of the skeleton.  They also discovered that swimming coral larvae require a chemical signal from the environment to trigger their metamorphosis to adult form and first turn on the genes that form skeletal materials.  By placing the signal molecule on an artificial surface like plastic, they have created a kind of coral flypaper that collects larvae. They are working in cooperation with the DuPont Corporation and Amgen, Inc. to identify the genes that they expect to use to shape crystal fibers of skeletal material into micro-thin bundles resembling the high-performance fiber optic cables needed for advanced communications and computing devices.

<H3>Thermostable and Psychrophylic Enzymes</H3>
</CENTER>
Researchers at Rutgers University in New Jersey are studying enzymes of thermophylic bacteria from oceanic black smokers in order to find novel catalysts that will be useful in industrial processing.  They recently isolated from the bacterium, Thermotoga neapolitana, and cloned an a-galactosidase which hydrolyzes melibiose oligomers.  These oligomers are major components of soy and other bean products and limit the amount of soy that can be incorporated into animal feeds for monogastric animals such as pigs and chickens that cannot digest the oligomers. Thus, a-galactosidase is of broad potential application and of keen interest to the food industry. However, a further requirement for the use of soy products is the requirement for removal of a protease inhibitor.  This is accomplished through heat treatment.  A thermostable a-galactosidase is of special interest because its use would allow removal of melibiose and protease inhibitor in a single processing step.

Researchers at the University of Washington are extracting enzymes from one of the three major life forms, the Archaea.  They collect the single-celled microorganisms from areas near undersea volcanoes on the Juan de Fuca Ridge.  Among other heat-stable enzymes, they hope to find DNA polymerases that will increase efficiency in biotechnological processes requiring replication of DNA.    The researchers are having good success identifying new species of the Thermococcales (the most common group of hyperthermophiles isolated at vents) using a combination of phenotypic and molecular biological analyses.  Their studies with approximately 20 isolates from several geographical locations, and biotopes within these locations, indicate a very high diversity at the species level.  They have completed preliminary experiments on the effects of hydrostatic pressure on enzymes from several hyperthermophiles which showed a factor of five increase in the half-life of a DNA polymerase at 44 Mpa.  They have also found that one polymerase retained enhanced thermal stability at low pressure if first exposed to high hydrostatic pressure for 30 minutes.  In addition to applications, they expect this research to lead to fundamental information about the weak links in protein thermostability.  The researchers also are studying cold-tolerant enzymes from very cold oceanic environments. They have established protocols for obtaining crude preparations of a given protein released into the surrounding medium by their bacterial isolates and observed, for chitinase production, maximal yield per volume of culture in stationary phase at which time most of the enzymes had been released from the cells.  Psychrophilic enzymes already are used in industry; discovery of new ones one with novel properties would expand industrial applications.

<H3>Heavy Metal Decontamination</H3>
</CENTER>
Environmental contamination by heavy metals is sometimes a consequence of industrial processing.  Because removal and storage of huge volumes of water or soil usually makes remediation prohibitively expensive, researchers, at Ohio State University (OSU) and the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), have looked for ways to selectively remove heavy metals. One approach is to imbue plants with enhanced ability to sequester metals.   Plants and animals naturally produce methallothioneins, metal-binding proteins.  Because plants require primarily water and sunlight to grow and reproduce, they offer potential for application in water decontamination.  The researchers are working with single-celled algae and cyanobacteria. The UAB researchers have genetically transformed a species of a common genus of the cyanobacterium, Synechococcus, by inserting the gene for mammalian metallothionein to increase its heavy metal resistance and accumulation.  The OSU researchers inserted the chicken metallothionein gene in the single-celled green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and found that this allows the alga to grow to higher densities in cadmium-contaminated waters.

Researchers at the University of California, San Diego are taking another approach to metal decontamination.  They are focusing on bacteria that can precipitate metal -- convert soluble metal to an insoluble state. In general, the biochemical mechanisms by which biota affect geochemical cycling are very poorly understood.  However, it is becoming clear that a variety of these mechanisms may be exploited for biotechnological purposes.

Recent LSU work focuses on biotreatment and recycling of used marine timbers and pilings salvaged from marine installations such as ports and petroleum production structures.  This research has provided methods for the removal of creosote, copper, chromium, arsenic and other toxic compounds from treated wood so that the wood can be recycled.

In related work at the University of Washington, scientists have found that bacteria digest oil five times more quickly if single-celled organisms called protozoa are nearby.  Because protozoa eat pollution-consuming bacteria, some scientists thought that eliminating them would increase rates of  breakdown.  But research has shown that protozoa are important to biodegradation.  One of the goals now is to learn exactly what protozoa do to make bacteria eat hydrocarbons faster.  Preliminary findings show that protozoa may act as a form of population control by grazing bacteria down to their most efficient levels. They also may fertilize the bacteria by providing them with nitrogen, a nutrient required to digest hydrocarbons, aerate the sediments in ways that promote biodegradation, or digest the oil themselves.

Researchers at the University of Delaware are exploiting the salt tolerance of marine and estuarine plants to develop crops that can be grown in coastal environments or on farm land that has become salty from many years of fertilizer application.  Through a decade of research using tissue-culture techniques to genetically select halophyte varieties that have high nutritional value and taste, the scientists have developed halophyte hay, grain, and vegetable crops which are being tested in China, Egypt, Israel, Pakistan, Thailand and the United Sates.  They also are using genetic engineering to improve halophytes for crop use.  Specifically, they are incorporating a gene for cold tolerance into one species so that it can be grown in cold climates as grain. Approaching the development of salt-tolerance from another direction, the researchers also are working to understand the complex mechanisms of salt tolerance so that this ability can be infused into traditional crops like corn and wheat.  Much of their focus is on salt-meadow hay, a relative of maize and other crops, and seashore mallow, a relative of cotton and okra.   They are laying the groundwork for isolating salt-tolerance genes, an important goal for regaining growing areas lost to salt.

Many of the sea oats planted to restore damaged beach environments from Delaware to Texas share a common birthplace -- a test tube in Florida. Researchers at the University of Florida have developed micropropagation techniques to produce sea oats and other coastal vegetation .  Creating offspring from a superior plant in a laboratory allows growers to custom design plants that have a greater chance of survival in the harsh beach environment.  The researchers also developed another technique for increasing the success of beach restoration efforts -- inoculation with vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (VAM).   VAM fungi are normally found in the roots of plants growing in undisturbed ecosystems.  The fungi enable the plants to tolerate water stress and to better use inorganic nutrients.  Plants grown in nurseries without soil or in pasteurized, sterilized or fumigated soils lack VAM fungi.  Nursery seedlings inoculated with VAM fungus have a much higher chance of surviving after planting than do non-inoculated plants.

<H3>Resolving Fisheries Problems</H3>

Scientists are developing new techniques to determine the causes of greatly reduced populations of cod, haddock, flounder, and other traditional commercial stocks in the Gulf of Maine.   They need to know the number of distinct stocks of these species and the degree to which they intermix.  To provide precise information of this kind they are using DNA "fingerprinting" methods.   They use the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify DNA taken from small tissue samples of marine specimens.  Amplification is required to obtain enough material for analysis.  The sequence of nucleotides, the basic structural units of DNA, is obtained from each sample and can be compared with strands from other specimens of the same species in order to detect even the most subtle genetic differences among them.  Using a DNA sequencer, the scientists can amplify a DNA sample one millionfold in a single test tube and can handle 48 samples in three hours.  Previous techniques, depending on bacterial manipulation, took about a month for a single sample.  Working with scientists at the National Marine Fisheries Service in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, the scientists at the Universities of Maine and New Hampshire, are using samples archived since the 1930s to try to understand population fluctuations and how they correlate with the species' genetic structure.   The information on stock structures has important implications for resource managers.  It will allow the management of individual stocks rather than entire fisheries. The results so far indicate that the Georges Bank haddock population is not genetically discrete and that Georges Bank cannot be viewed as a closed system.

Biologists at the University of Delaware are using PCR to try to identify strains of the American oyster, Crassostrea virginica, that are resistant to two parasites, MSX and Dermo, that have almost destroyed the oyster industry in the Delaware and Chesapeake Bays.  They hope to find resistant strains that can be produced through aquaculture and used to repopulate areas where the parasitic diseases are rampant. <P>

<H3>Identifying Larvae</H3>
</CENTER>
Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to randomly amplify polymorphic DNA (RAPD), researchers at the State University of New York at Buffalo have identified species-specific genetic markers for five species of gorgonian corals. Using PCR-RAPDs, they can identify adult gorgonians as well as larvae collected in the field.  This generic technique can be applied to any organism in which identification based on morphologic traits is difficult.  Identification of larvae allows more detailed studies of early life histories of marine organisms and studies of the subsequent effects on the dynamics and genetic structure of adult populations.

<H3>Genetic Diversity of Fisheries</H3>
</CENTER>
Researchers at Case Western University in Ohio have shown that there are measurable genetic differences among walleye fishes from different geographic locations in Lake Erie.  This means that mature fish return to their birthplace to spawn and that protection of spawning habitats may be essential to preserving genetic diversity.  Why is genetic diversity important to healthy populations of organisms?  It ensures that some individuals can, for example, endure hot or cold spells, or endure starvation, be willing and able to change their diet, withstand bouts of parasites or disease, or accommodate to changes in their habitat.  Without genetic diversity, a population or entire species could be destroyed by a sudden change in habitat.  Fortunately, the studies show that despite fluctuations in walleye populations over the years from heavy fishing and toxic pollutants, the populations have maintained high genetic diversity.
<P>
Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a DNA "fingerprinting" method for fishes that does not require sacrificing the live specimen.  It can be used to determine from what specific "nest" a fish has originated and thus provide highly refined information for management of fisheries within specific ecosystems.

<H3>PROSPECTS FOR THE FUTURE</H3>
</CENTER>
Sea Grant research and other federally sponsored research is showing that investment in marine biotechnology advances science and provides information useful in developing technology.  It is evident that marine organisms are sources of unique genetic information that has been inadequately explored as a basis for developing new biotechnological products and processes. Marine microorganisms, which often live in symbiosis with both vertebrates and invertebrates, represent a resource of special opportunity.  For example, hydrothermal vents associated with tectonic spreading zones in the ocean are sites particularly rich in novel organisms. 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"There are still &#12650,000 km of unexplored submarine tectonic spreading zones girdling the globe with several thousands of projected hydrothermal vent sites.  Only &#126100 of them have been visited by research submersibles, and even fewer of them have been sampled.  All of them appear to be different, chemically as well as biologically.  It is well justified to conclude that, as a newly explored marine environment, hydrothermal vent sites promise a wealth of biotechnologically useful microorganisms."(Jannasch, H.W. (1995) Deep-sea vents as sources of biotechnologically relevant microorganisms.  <I>J. Mar. Biotechnol.</I>  3: 5-8.)
<P>
"Marine microorganisms have developed unique metabolic and physiological capabilities that not only ensure survival in a great variety of extreme habitats, but also offer the potential for the production of metabolites which would not be observed from terrestrial microorganisms. .&nbsp.&nbsp.&nbsp On the basis of the few chemical studies reported, and in recognition of the unique compounds which have been isolated, it can be concluded that marine microorganisms could, if effectively explored, represent a major biomedical resource.  Given the lack of in-depth knowledge of the nutritional requirements of marine microorganisms, however, the question of how to develop this resource effectively must first be answered." (Fenical, W. And Jensen, P.R. (1993) Marine microorganisms: a new biomedical resource. In Attaway, D.H. and Zaborsky, O.R. (Eds.) <I>Marine Biotechnology I: Pharmaceutical and Bioactive Natural Products</I>, Plenum Pub. Co., New York, pp. 420, 449.)

The development of marine biotechnology by both traditional and modern methods is just beginning.  It has provided solid advancements and offers enormous potential. 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Marine biotechnology is just beginning to revolutionize our ability to better use marine resources.  We can expect in the future to see advances in such areas as biomaterials, pharmaceuticals and diagnostics, aquaculture and seafood safety, bioremediation, and biofilms and corrosion." (Burris, J.E. (1996) Introduction: hope for the evolving marine biotechnology revolution. <I>BioSci.</I>  46(4): 235.)

In 1992, the first National Aquaculture Extension Conference brought specialists and agents together in a meeting that fostered interregional exchanges and catalyzed cooperative efforts.  The need for such exchanges remains, with the aquaculture industry facing challenges to growth and profitability.  The second National Aquaculture Conference should serve as a means for developing innovative ideas that will make a difference for the aquaculture industry in the Unites States.

</TD></TR><TR>
<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>
Extension agents and specialists throughout the nation have played an instrumental role in the growth of aquaculture over the last two decades. 
<P>
With support from the <A HREF="http://www.usda.gov/">U.S. Department of Agriculture CSREES</A> through the Regional Aquaculture Centers and from the <A HREF="http://www.noaa.gov/">U.S. Department of Commerce/NOAA</A>  <A HREF="../NSGO/index.html">National Sea Grant College</A>, Land Grant and Sea Grant Extension professionals have conducted wide-ranging programs of research, development and education outreach to private sector interests, from small-scale businesses to vertically integrated companies.
<P>
In 1992, the first National Aquaculture Extension Conference brought specialists and agents together in a meeting that fostered interregional exchanges and catalyzed cooperative efforts. The need for such exchanges remains. The industry faces challenges to growth and profitability, in particular from foreign imports and from domestic regulation. The good news is that remarkable scientific progress has been made in the last five years, while communications technology continues to accelerate, making available unprecedented opportunities for extension professionals to share their expertise with potential beneficiaries.
<P>
While research and development continue to be key in the development of aquaculture, so too will rapid and cost-effective outreach. Land Grant and Sea Grant Extension offer the best expertise for such outreach-improved leveraging of this expertise through networking, through collaborative efforts and through innovative educational programs offers a powerful means for serving the industry.
<P>
This second National Aquaculture Extension Conference aims at bringing us closer to such aims. The Conference should serve as a catalyst for developing innovative ideas that will make a difference for the aquaculture industry in the United States-it is designed for you, the Extension agent and specialist.

Annapolis has a strong maritime tradition, which is apparent from the sail and power vessels that use it as home port. The US Naval Academy is located here and is available for walking tours and includes a museum. The city has fine restaurants, attractions and entertainment, as well as a great many interesting sights and shops.
<P>
Baltimore is nearby with such attractions as the National Aquarium, the Maryland Science Center, Harborplace, and the Columbus Center (exhibition hall, also housing the <A HREF="http://www.umbi.umd.edu/">University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute's Center of Marine Biotechnology</A>). The  Eastern Shore, with its traditional commercial fishing and growing aquaculture industry is just across the Bay Bridge, while Washington, D.C. is a short trip away.

Ronald C. Baird Named<P>
National Sea Grant Director
</H2></TD>

</CENTER>
<P>
Ocean scientist, educator and businessman Ronald C. Baird has been named director of the NOAA National Sea Grant College Program, the Commerce Department's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced today (3/19/96).
<P>
Baird will assume his new position with NOAA in Silver Spring, Md., <B>June 3</B>, after completing his tenure as vice president of university relations at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
<P>
NOAA administrator D. James Baker called Baird's selection, the result of a national search, "an exceptional choice."  "Dr. Baird's experience in business and education, as a scientist and college administrator, makes him uniquely qualified to lead Sea Grant, whose continued success in helping to protect and preserve our marine environment hinges on a solid working partnership between business, government and the university research community," Baker said. 
<P>
Baird will direct the <A HREF="NationalSeaGrant.html">National Sea Grant College Program</A>, a network of over 300 colleges, universities, research institutions and marine organizations that work in partnership with industry, the federal government, and state governments to support marine and Great Lakes research, education and extension services.
<P>
On his appointment, Baird said, "In an era of limited resources and global environmental challenges to coastal resources, the products of an active industrial, academic and government research partnership will be absolutely critical to our ability to manage coastal resources on a sustainable basis.  Sea Grant is just such a partnership, with a track record of achievements.  Being part of an enterprise whose goal is the health and well being of our invaluable coastal resources is a challenge I welcome."
<P>
At Worcester Polytechnic, the nation's third oldest college of engineering and science, Baird is responsible for the university's external relations, including its news service, development office, corporate relations, alumni programs and university publications. He helped develop the school's first comprehensive corporate relations program and as an adjunct professor in the Department of Biology and Biotechnology has maintained an active research program.
<P>
Before joining Worcester Polytechnic, he was director of research at Geo-Marine, Inc., an engineering consulting firm in Dallas, Texas.  He was also the president of Schuster Corporation, an investment concern in the greater Worcester area.
<P>
From 1990-95, he was a member of the National Sea Grant Review Panel, a 15-member, independent citizens advisory committee.
<P>
Baird received a B.S. in zoology from Yale University in 1958. Following service as a naval officer, he received an M.A. in zoology in 1965 from the University of Texas, Austin.  He received his Ph.D. in biological oceanography from Harvard University in 1969.  His principal research interests involve the organization of oceanic ecosystems and natural resource management.

Habitat Restoration Projects<BR>
Call for Proposals</H1>
</CENTER>

<H3>Deadline: May 15, 1997</H3>

For the fifth year, the Chesapeake Bay Program (<A HREF="http://www.epa.gov/r3chespk/">CBP</A>) announces the availability of <I>challenge</I>  grants for habitat restoration projects that will support CBP living resource and habitat commitments.  Typically, grants range from $10,000 to $75,000.  
<P>
The <I>Chesapeake Bay Habitat Restoration: A Framework for Action</I> identifies four major habitat types of concern:
<UL>
<LI>Open water (oyster reef)<BR>
<LI>Shallow water (tidal wetlands, beach, SAV bed)<BR>
<LI>Freshwater tributaries and streams (streams, riparian forest, emergent wetlands)<BR>
<LI>Inlands and islands (forest, forested wetlands, islands).
</UL>
<P>
Highest consideration will be given to projects involving riparian zones, in-stream habitat, emergent freshwater wetlands, forested wetlands, and similar freshwater habitat.  Proposals must identify the specific location of projects, nearest stream/river basin, and longitude and latitude.  Grants cannot be awarded without 1:1 nonfederal match at the minimum (may include in-kind).

<P>
For more information, visit the <A HREF="http://www.epa.gov/r3chespk/cbp_home/bayprog/budget/budget.htm">CBP Request for Proposals</A> (budget forms are available for you to download).  You should also contact:

One of Sea Grant's major roles in the joint state and federal program to restore the <A HREF="CB.html">Chesapeake Bay</A> is to support advanced research that will lead to sound policymaking and more effective management of the Bay's threatened resources.  Such research is highlighed in  <A HREF="Communications/MarineNotes/index.html"><I>Maryland Marine Notes</I></A>.
<P>
Maryland Sea Grant collaborates with other Sea Grant programs in the <A HREF="../index.html">Mid-Atlantic region</A>.  This program also works with <A HREF="../VASG/index.html">Virginia Sea Grant</A> in its efforts to understand and restore the Chesapeake Bay.  Maryland Sea Grant also helped create and continues to support the Coastal and Environmental Policy Program (<A HREF="CEPP/index.html">CEPP</A>), which brings together expertise throughout UMS to focus on critical policy-related issues, and the <A HREF="EFC/index.html">Environmental Finance Center</A>.

</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1><IMG ALIGN=middle SRC="GIFs/MRPSEAL.gif" ALT=[MARMP logo]">  Regional Priorities</H1>

The Mid-Atlantic RMRP plan acknowledges the importance of methods and application of research to management and planning.  Regional research is most important in terms of regional management.  There is a need for more and better access, to existing data and information on the marine and estuarine ecosystems, that can be applied to management decisions, modeling of ecosystems, and coordinated multidisciplinary research on basic processes.  The inventory of existing programs and projects within the region is extensive.  The Mid-Atlantic RMRP plan hopes to foster coordination of existing programs and efficient use of resources within the region.<P> 

<H2>Priority Methods</H2>
The following methods of research are considered high priority under this plan:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Data management, synthesis and interpretation<P>
<LI>Ecosystem modeling and comparative studies<P>
<LI>Presentation and application of regional research to regionalmanagement<P>
<LI>Economic and social considerations<P>
</OL> 
 
<H2>Priority Applications</H2>
The following specific scientific research areas are considered high priority for application of the above methods:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Historical and contemporary effects of land-use on living resources in the context of ecosystem structure and function<P>
<LI>Eutrophication, algal blooms and anoxia<P>
<LI>Fishery yields, recruitment and trophodynamics of the Mid-Atlantic Bight<P>
<LI>Parameters of materials (including nutrients, sediments and contaminants) and biotic exchanges between estuaries and the coastal ocean<P>
<LI>Coastal erosion and climatic effects<P>
</OL>  

<H2>Benefits</H2>
As a result of projects emphasizing the above methods and research priorities, the Mid-Atlantic RMRP will provide the following benefits:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Promote a regional perspective on problems that can only be addressed in coordinated and integrated ways<P>
<LI>Improve information transfer from scientists to managers, and coordination of marine research throughout the region<P>
<LI>Treat ecosystems as functional and complete units and thusenable understanding at the system level<P>
<LI>Address the human role in the coastal environment on a regional basis<P>
<LI>Supply the results of regional research to regional management needs<P>
<LI>Determine research priorities based on all multidisciplinary, multi-state and multi-institutional results available<BR>
</OL>

<H2>3rd International Conference on the<BR>
Environmental Management of Enclosed Coastal Seas<BR>
</H2>
</CENTER>
<H3>
August 3-8, 1997<BR>
Stockholm, Sweden
</H3>
EMECS stands for the Environmental Management of Enclosed Coastal Seas, a network of activities that brings together scientists, policy analysts, philosophers, decision makers, teachers and citizens to develop holistic approaches to the management of valuable coastal seas, such as the Chesapeake Bay, the Seto Inland Sea of Japan, the Baltic Sea, and many more.  
<P>
Just as these coastal seas serve as special resources - for food, for shipping, for recreation, and for important cultural roots and heritage - they also present special challenges for those who would protect and restore them, and use them wisely.
<P>
EMECS conferences have been held in Kobe, Japan (1990) and Baltimore, Maryland (1993) and the next EMECS conference will be held in Stockholm, Sweden in August 1997.
<P>
For information about the next EMECS conference, please:<BR>

<H1><IMG ALIGN=middle SRC="GIFs/MRPSEAL.gif" ALT=[MARMP logo]">  Research Plans & Reports</H1>

The Mid-Atlantic Research Plan was approved by both the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (<A HREF="http://www.noaa.gov">NOAA</A>) and Environmental Protection Agency (<A HREF="http://www.epa.gov">EPA</A>) in June of 1994, after review by the Executive Committee for the Regional Marine Research Program.  While the future of the program is uncertain (Congress approved funds only for the regional research program for the Gulf of Maine in 1995) the plan should serve as a useful model for guiding future research in the Mid-Atlantic region.  The Implementation Schedule contained in this plan has not been followed since the fall of 1994.<P>
The Mid-Atlantic Regional Marine Research Program has subsequently held a workshop on the first priority identified in this Research Plan.  The workshop, "Land-use effects on coastal ecosystems in the Mid-Atlantic", was held on December 1&2, 1994 at the Belmont Conference Center in Elkridge, MD.   The products of this workshop will be available from the Maryland Sea Grant Office, 0112 Skinner Hall, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742.

<center><h2>STUDY REPORTS HUMAN IMPACT ON GLOBAL NITROGEN CYCLING GREATER THAN
ORIGINALLY BELIEVED; RATE OF IMPACT ACCELERATING </h2></center>

<font size=+1>N</font>ARRAGANSETT, R.I.- Human-induced changes to the global 
nitrogen cycling patterns are much more significant than 
previously believed is the finding of three United 
States-based scientists in a report published in the 
Netherlands this week (10/22/96), in the peer-reviewed 
science journal, Biogeochemistry. They attribute the 
changes to the rapid post-World War II increase in the use 
of inorganic nitrogen fertilizers, and to atmospheric 
pollution from fossil fuel combustion. <p>
 
"We will need more large-scale discussion and assessment of 
how to deal with this nitrogen problem. We are clearly not 
just dealing with sewage, but with agricultural practices 
and atmospheric sources. These are too large-scale and 
difficult for individual cities and states to deal with. It 
will require larger geographical governmental units," says 
Rhode Island Sea Grant Director Scott Nixon, one of the 
report's principal authors. Joining Nixon in authoring the 
study are Robert Howarth, Cornell University ecology and 
systematics professor, and James Galloway, University of 
Virginia environmental sciences professor. <p>
 
The report is the result of a two-year study of the 
nitrogen cycle of the North Atlantic Basin, including the 
ocean, coastal systems and contributing watersheds from 
northeastern Canada to the Amazon and from Northwestern 
Africa to the Baltic Sea.  The North Atlantic was chosen 
because it is the best-studied and most-altered region of 
its kind, and the scientists say that what was learned can 
be extrapolated globally, particularly to the developing 
third world areas of the globe.<p>

Increasing scientific evidence shows that large amounts of 
reactive nitrogen from the atmosphere can change species 
composition, kill trees, and impact coastal marine 
waters-including causing nuisance algal blooms, hypoxia and 
anoxia, changes in species composition of plankton, 
elimination of entire food chains, and death of fish and 
shellfish. Nitrogen is an important bio-stimulant both on 
land and in the marine environment. Human activities have 
accelerated the cycling of that element, increasing the 
amount moving through the atmosphere, the oceans and across 
the landscape.<p>
 
The findings represent a significant step forward in 
understanding of the controls over, and effects of, 
human-induced changes to nitrogen cycling throughout the globe.  <p>
 <p>
Among the important findings are: <br>
<ul>
<li>  Humans have had a much larger impact on the global 
nitrogen cycle than previously thought. 

<li> Changes are large and recent.  Enormous changes in 
large-scale nitrogen cycling have occurred in a very short 
period of time ( much of it in the last 50 years. 
 
<li>  The major source of nitrogen to waterways is from 
agricultural and atmospheric sources. Anthropogenic 
deposition of nitrogen from the atmosphere is the major 
source of nitrogen in the northeastern and southeastern 
U.S. These changes are directly related to two huge 
increases: the use of inorganic nitrogen fertilizers that 
accelerated dramatically following WW II, and atmospheric 
pollution from fossil fuel combustion. 
 
<li>  Nonpoint sources of nitrogen, largely from fertilizer 
and atmospheric deposition, dominate the sources of 
nitrogen to rivers and estuaries, while sewage accounts for 
only some 11 percent. 
 
<li>  Nitrogen deposition for the entire North Atlantic basin 
is five times great than in pre-industrial times. 

<li>  The continental shelf is a "sink" for nitrogen from both 
land and the open ocean, a previously unknown role.  (Being 
a  "sink" for nitrogen means that reactive nitrogen is 
removed from the system and converted by bacteria back to 
unreactive nitrogen gas that is returned to the 
atmosphere.)  
</ul>

There is both "good" and "bad" news in the study's 
conclusions.  <p>

The good news is that as estuaries load up with nitrogen 
--- there has been a three-to-five-fold increase in the 
last 100 years --- the reactive nitrogen is being 
transported to the coastal shelf where it is being
denitrified.  For large urban areas like Boston, or New 
York the implication is if the continental shelf is a net 
"sink" for nitrogen, then it is better to put wastewater 
and sewage outfalls out of bays and estuaries, and onto the 
coastal shelf, which is better able to absorb it. <p>
 
The bad news is that the problem is not just watersheds, it 
is airsheds. <p>

The findings show that nitrogen pollution will be harder to 
solve as a result. New pollution remediation and controls 
will be needed to monitor and reduce atmospheric nitrogen  
sources, such as acid rain, smog, and ozone. For large 
multi-state estuaries, such as Chesapeake Bay, that means 
regulations governing control of atmospheric sources, not 
just waterborne sources, of nitrogen. <p>
 
Impetus to conduct the study originated at a Rhode Island 
Sea Grant-arranged conference in May, 1994 that featured 50 
scientists from 12 countries in a gathering to look at the 
buildup of reactive nitrogen on Earth. <p>
 
The study was sponsored by the following international 
organizations: the Scientific Committee on Problems of the 
Environment (SCOPE) of the International Council of 
Scientific Unions; the United Nations Environmental 
Program; the World Meteorological Organization;  and the 
Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.  <p>

<!-- SLUG: 10-22-96: 
Weevil Shows Potential to Control 
Eurasian Watermilfoil 
-->
<center><h2>Weevil Shows Potential to Control Eurasian Watermilfoil </h2></center>

<font size=+1>D</font>ULUTH, MN.<br>
University of Minnesota Sea Grant researchers think a tiny freshwater weevil 
(Euhrychiopsis lecontei) shows promise as a possible control for Eurasian 
watermilfoil.  Watermilfoil continues to slowly spread in Minnesota, usually due
to accidental transport by boaters.  <p>

Susan Solarz and Ray Newman conducted experiments at the University of Minnesota
with a native weevil that normally eats northern watermilfoil--a usually benign 
native relative of the Eurasian type.  Solarz and Newman found that weevils 
introduced  to Eurasian watermilfoil in a lab setting prefer to lay eggs on the 
Eurasian variety over native varieties.  The weevil lays its eggs on the tips of
the milfoil plant.  Once they hatch, the young burrow down the stem, eating 
their way through the plant, which slows down the growth of milfoil.  Under the 
right environmental conditions, this could provide a chemical-free control 
method.<p>

"Their results show that the weevils are definitely worth looking into as a 
control method and that additional research is necessary," said Chip Welling, 
coordinator of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' Eurasian 
watermilfoil program.<p>

"Finding a natural way to inhibit Eurasian watermilfoil is important," said 
Newman.  "Although it is unlikely the weevils will eradicate Eurasian 
watermilfoil infestations, under certain conditions which we are still 
investigating, they can reduce the amount of the plant that spreads across the 
water's surface, which can provide major benefits, especially for boaters.<p>

"While chemical control may still play a role in specific settings -- such as 
near crowded lake accesses, and to clear navigational channels -- natural 
controls have advantages," said Newman.  "First, these weevils are already here;
there isn't the danger of adding a new exotic pest. The weevil specifically 
targets Eurasian watermilfoil, reducing the risk that native plants will be 
harmed in the process.  Second, effective biological controls may result in 
long-term declines at a relatively low cost.  This reduces the need for repeated
treatments usually required with chemical and mechanical controls."<p>

Solarz and Newman also discovered that once weevils are reared on the exotic 
plant in the lab, they will spend more time looking for it if the Eurasian 
variety is removed, instead of simply switching to the native species.  They can
eventually switch, but the weevils have long coexisted with the native variety.<p>

Eurasian watermilfoil is an exotic plant that has infested North American waters
since the late 1940s.  If can form dense mats of vegetation and crowd out native
aquatic plants, clog boat propellers and make water recreation difficult.  
Eurasian watermilfoil has spread to 75 lakes, primarily in the Twin Cities area,
and four rivers or streams.  The most recent finding was in Rice Lake (the 
northwest Metro area) this summer.<p>

Solarz and Newman's results were recently published in Oecologia.  A reprint of 
this journal article, "Oviposition Specificity and Behavior of the Watermilfoil 
Specialist, Euhrychiopsis lecontei," is available from Sea Grant by calling 
(218) 726-6191.<p>

them in all seasons and weathers. Though his initial purpose was to detail commercial fishing 
methods in the he Chesapeake, he ultimately shows us much more: the look of the water at dawn in a 
rising northeast wind. Also  chronicling thirteen ways of fishing for the Bay's species of oysters, crabs, 
finfish, soft and hard  clams. Jacoby gives us a brief, impressionistic glimpses of what may be a

<center><h2>Sea Grant Publishes Guide To Marine Science Careers</h2></center>

<font size=+1>C</font>OLLEGE PARK, MD.<br>
	Does your son or daughter want to be a marine 
biologist? Do you want to know if that's a good 
career choice? A recently produced Sea Grant
publication can help you and your child find the answers. Marine Science
Careers: A Sea Grant Guide to Ocean Opport unities describes the fields of
marine biology, oceanography and ocean engineering as well as other
closely related fields and offers some insight as to what the future holds
as far as career opportunities go in these fields.<p>
	In addition, the guide contains question and answer profiles of 38
marine scientists and other professionals from around the country. These
men and women talk about how they got into their careers, what they do,
what they like and dislike about their wor k, what they see for the future
in their fields, and much more.<p>
	The guide is being distributed by Sea Grant, a national network of
29 research and education programs dedicated to the wise use and
conservation of our marine and Great Lakes resources for the public
benefit. Individual copies cost $5 and can be ordered from Sea Grant
Communications, Kingman Farm, University of New Hampshire, Durham, N.H.
03828-3512 (checks payable to UNH) or from Sea Grant Communications, Woods
Hole Oceanographic Institution, 193 Oyster Pond Rd., CRL 209, Woods Hole,
Mass. 02543-1525 (checks payable to WHOI). <p>


 <center><h3>REVIEW COMMENTS OF NEW SEA GRANT CAREER GUIDE:</h3></center>

A guidance counselor from Milwaukee, Wisc.: "What I like most about Marine
Science Careers is its comprehensiveness. Not only does it give job
information and where to learn more, but it also gives students real life
feedback from workers in the field. I wouldn't change a thing. It is too
rare that we guidance counselors are given concise, relevant information
on specific careers to give our students." <p>

A grandfather from Oakland, N.J.: "I have assumed the role of 'guidance
counselor' for my 14 grandchildren because of the shortcomings of the high
schools in this. That's why I sent for Marine Science Careers. I expected
to find the usual blend of watered down soup, sort of like Career
Selection 101. What an exciting surprise. The format is perfect. The
content powerfully pertinent. The strategy to edify and convince couldn't
be improved. Indeed the title could (and probably should) be changed just
to sim ply Careers. It would make a most valuable contribution if used as
a textbook in all high schools. The underlying technique is sound enough
to use in any career goal setting effort." <p>

A teacher from Worcester, Mass.: "This is a great publication. It
introduces many potential careers and provides detailed information on
specific, real people. Thanks!" <p>

A parent in New York, N.Y.: "Marine Science Careers will be extremely
useful in helping me advise my children. I like the personal touch, the
diversity of careers, and the range of types of people. I wish I had had
this as a pre-college student!" <p>

A guidance counselor in San Diego, Calif.: "This is very well done. It's
clear and well organized. There's a nice diversity of gender, ethnicity,
and region among those profiled. Bravo!" <p>

A biologist from Long Island, N.Y.: "I like Marine Science Careers. It
covers a wide range of career options and opens the marine field to more
prospective scientists. I hope it reaches a wide audience of high school
and college students and teachers." <p>

A student from South Jersey, N.J.: "Marine Science Careers will be of
major assistance to me with my career decisions. It is very informative
and well done. I particularly like reading the individual profiles." <p>

A teacher from Green Bay, Wisc.: "This publication will most definitely
help me in advising my students. I especially like the information about
each field and the human focus and the honesty of each person featured. We
have needed this for a long time! K ids are always interested in marine
biology careers and we've never had much to give them. Now we do! Thank
you!" <p>

A guidance counselor from Westborough, Mass.: "Marine Science Careers has
the real 'scoop' on the jobs in marine science from real people. I think
it's great! Send more copies." <p>

<center><h2>Penobscot Bay Conference Zeros in on Research Needs</h2></center>

<font size=+1>O</font>RONO, Maine...Researchers, armed with curiosity and 
inadequate
funding, are hoping to assemble a composite picture of the complex
ecosystem of Penobscot Bay, according to organizers of a conference
held May 15 in Searsport. In his introductory remarks, Robert Wall,
Director of the University of Maine (UM) Sea Grant Program, stated,
"What we lack is a synthesis of current knowledge, a framework, and
priorities for future investigations." <p>

Jointly sponsored by the Penobscot Bay Network and the Sea Grant
Program, the forum on "Marine Science and Sustaining the Health of
Penobscot Bay" brought together researchers from the Universities of
Maine and New Hampshire , Maine Maritime Academy, Maine Department of
Marine Resources, and Maine Department of Environmental Protection to
meet with representatives of organizations with an interest in the
future of the bay. Representatives of local, state, and federal
government were also on hand.<p>

According to scientists who attended the conference, research on
Penobscot Bay is significant because there is so little of it.
Discussion centered on what scientists know about the bay and how to
frame issues for future research.<p>

The bay's economic importance was underscored by Robert Steneck, UM
professor of oceanography, who pointed out that about half of Maine's
lobster landings and 30% of sea urchin landings come from counties
around the bay. "Penobscot Bay is still very productive," added Dan
Schick of the Maine Department of Marine Resources, "and we should make
use of it." Schick noted that there are underutilized species which
inhabit the bay, with markets elsewhere. These new fisheries resources
could be tapped, but only after information on their sustainablility
and on the appropriate gear, fishing techniques, and management tools
is available.<p>

Several participants described problems in the bay including
contamination of sediments, closed clam flats, and a health advisory on
lobster tomalley. Eelgrass beds, providing nursery habitat to several
commercial species, is well below historical levels, according to Fred
Short of the University of New Hampshire, although some increases have
been noted recently near Belfast.<p>

According to Steve Miller of the Islesboro Island Trust, attempts to
reseed historically productive clam flats on the island have failed for
unknown reasons. Causes may be related to water or sediment
contamination or to other factors, such as those affecting clam
reproduction. These problems may be warning signs of more fundamental
problems, other speakers noted, but current information does not allow
scientists to provide a reliable diagnosis.<p>

Larry Mayer of the UM Darling Marine Center, pointed out that 
the bay's harvestable resources
depend on unseen microorganisms such as bacteria and plankton. "Knowing
the bay by its visible resources is like describing the economy on the
basis of sports stadiums and opera houses," said Mayer. "We need to
take a gardener's approach to the system, maintaining productivity over
the long run and keeping a healthy and functioning ecosystem."<p>

Several speakers emphasized the importance of cooperation among
scientists, government officials, and the fishing community. Ted Ames
of the Island Institute showed maps of groundfish spawning areas he
assembled from observations made by harvesters. He called for
scientists to use such information as a "point of departure" for their
research. His point was driven home by Joe Bigl, state representative
from Bucksport, who told participants to find solutions to the bay's
problems through grassroots collaboration. He also urged scientists to
draw on the knowledge of citizens whose livelihoods depend on the bay's
fishing, tourism, and other industries. <p>

John Barlow and Jacquelyn Boucher of Maine Maritime Academy described
basic data collection by students, but they also pointed out that they
lack funds to thoroughly analyze the data and develop models that help
us understand what is happening over time and why. Barlow called for
the creation of a Penobscot Bay Research Endowment Fund to support such
efforts.<p>

Research on the Gulf of Maine has revealed a clue to an unexpected
circulation pattern in the bay, according to David Townsend of the UM
Department of Oceanography. Twenty percent of the fresh riverine water
entering the Gulf flows out of the Penobscot River watershed, and would
normally be expected to move along the western shore of Penobscot Bay.
What appears to happen instead is a "bulge of fresh water" into the
waters on the eastern side of the bay. The finding emphasizes the need
to determine circulation patterns which control the dispersal of
nutrients, as well as pollutants, in the region.<p>

Research needs identified by the group include an inventory of
species, location of productive habitats, identification of impacts
from toxic chemicals, and determination of sustainable harvests for
urchins, lobsters, shrimp, and groundfish.<p>

The Penobscot Bay Network includes over a dozen educational,
government, and private organizations which have been meeting since
1992 to promote research and the long-term environmental and economic
health of the bay region. Proceedings of the most recent forum and of
two previous conferences in 1993 and 1995, as well as a research
bibliography, are available at a small charge from the UM Sea Grant
Program (207-581-1440) or from the Hancock Office of UM Cooperative
Extension (207-667-2196).<p>

<center><h2>
GENETIC CLONING DISCOVERY MAY LEAD TO
YEAR-ROUND SOFT-SHELLED CRAB SUPPLY
</h2></center>
In a recent project expected to revolutionize an erratic soft-shelled crab 
industry, researchers have successfully cloned genetic material that allows blue
crabs to regulate molting and establish their protective shell.  Understanding 
the chemical mechanisms that control this process is a key discovery in an 
effort to manipulate crab development to produce a dependable supply of 
soft-shelled crabs (which are actually crabs that have recently shed their 
protective cover) for industry and seafood lovers. <p>

The cloning experiment, led by Mississippi-Alabama Sea Grant researcher Doug 
Watson, focused on a gene that codes for a protein known as molt inhibiting 
hormone, or MIH.  At normal concentrations, MIH blocks shell shedding and 
maintains the crabs protective cover.  However, as a crab develops, it 
continually outgrows its shell and must replace it with a new, larger one.  At 
this time, concentrations of MIH fall, and the crab enters molting.<p>

Under natural circumstances, this process occurs irregularly, limiting the 
industry's ability to take full advantage of potential soft-shelled harvests.  
However, now that MIH genetic material has been cloned and the MIH hormone can 
be produced in large quantities, researchers can experiment with substances that
could block the hormones activity and force the crab into molting.  This ability
could produce "an abundant, year-round, and controllable supply of soft-shelled 
crabs for the Gulf of Mexico soft crab industry and consumers of seafood," says 
Watson. <p>

The success of this project was accomplished through the construction of a 
high-tech genetics library of blueprint material.  The research team created the
library by extracting the genetic messages (messenger RNA or mRNA) from crab 
eyestalks and then making cDNA (complimentary DNA) copies of the mRNA.  Each 
clone obtained this way is called a cDNA clone, and the entire collection of 
clones, a cDNA library, which is actually a random mixture of cloned genetic 
material floating freely in a test tube.<p>

"It's the proverbial needle in the haystack. To fish the MIH cDNA from the 
thousands of clones in the `library,' we generated a specific nucleic acid 
probe.  The probe was a segment of the MIH gene we cloned from another crab 
species, " explains Watson.<p>

After isolating the cDNA that codes for MIH, Watson then inserted this genetic 
material into insect cells through manipulation of viruses that attack insects. 
In this manner, the cDNA becomes part of the cell's entire genetic complement 
and MIH is produced by DNA replicating machinery.  From this process, Watson 
"anticipates the availability of large amounts of the hormone that will allow us
to isolate and test natural compounds that may block the hormone's action," and 
rocket the soft-shelled crab industry forward.   <p>

04-19-96 TOOL DEVELOPED FOR MANIPULATING GENES OF MARINE INVERTEBRATES>
<center><h2>Tool Developed for Manipulating Genes of Marine Invertebrates
</h2></center>

LaJolla, CA.  Modified viral particles (called retroviral vectors) have been 
used for the first time to alter the genes of a marine invertebrate.<p>

Using principles developed in a California Sea Grant project, Dr. Jane C. 
Burns, M.D., of the Department of Pediatrics at the School of Medicine, 
University of California, San Diego, genetically modified the dwarf 
surfclam, Mulinia lateralis. Results of the experiment, a collaboration 
between Burns and Thomas Chen, Ph.D., director of the University of 
Connecticut's Biotechnology Center, are published in the April 16 edition 
of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.<p>

"This work may provide a new tool for marine biologists to use against the 
diseases that attack commercial stocks of oysters, clams, mussels, and 
abalone," Burns says. Once the genes responsible for protecting cultured 
shellfish from disease have been identified, retroviral vectors could be 
used to deliver these protective genes directly to brood stock.<p>

Development of the retroviral vectors began in the early 1990s at UCSD's 
Center for Molecular Genetics under the direction of Jiing-Kuan Yee, Ph.D., 
and Theodore Friedmann, M.D. There Burns worked to improve the ability of 
altered viruses to carry foreign genes into non-mammalian cells.<p>

"We disarm the viruses by removing their genetic material so that they are 
incapable of replicating," says Dr. Burns, "and then add foreign genes as a 
'payload' to the virus."<p>

Though retroviral particles are now widely used as a genetic delivery 
vehicle in human gene-therapy experiments, getting the vectors to enter 
non-mammalian cells proved difficult. Burns and Yee substituted a new viral 
envelope, which allows the vectors to enter virtually any type of cell.<p>

For the surfclam experiments, Burns genetically engineered "reporter" genes 
into the vectors, which caused the fertilized surfclam eggs to display a 
blue color, indicating that the implanted genes were present and 
functioning. Then she generated billions of vector particles carrying this 
reporter gene.<p>

To allow the vectors to be implanted into the surfclam, Chen exposed 
embryos to short pulses of electricity, a technique called electroporation. 
The electricity punctures holes through the embryo's tough outer membrane, 
the chorion, allowing the virus to reach the embryo's cells and deliver its 
genetic payload. Analysis showed that the reporter genes were inherited by 
a high percentage of the next generation.<p>

The experiment was funded in part by California Sea Grant, the UCSD Gene 
Therapy Program Grant-in-Aid, and the National Science Foundation. Other 
contributors to the experiments included Standish Allen of Rutgers 
University, graduate student J.K.  Lu of the University of Maryland, and 
post-doctoral fellow T. Matsubara of UCSD.<p>

In her California Sea Grant research, Burns is seeking to assist the 
aquaculture industry by
genetically modifying striped bass to increase its growth rate.<p>

04-19-96  MAGRATH URGES HOUSE PANEL FOR CONTINUED SEA GRANT SUPPORT>

<center><h2>Magrath Urges House Panel for Continued Sea Grant Support</h2>
</center>


In testimony before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, 
State and the Judiciary April 18, NASULGC President C. Peter Magrath gave a 
strong endorsement of the National Sea Grant College Program.<p>

"Sea Grant Program is a truly effective partnership between academia, 
government, and the private sector.  It is the only national science program to 
employ a broad range of physical and social marine sciences to address public as
well as scientific concerns through its unified approach to problem-solving via 
its research, education, technology transfer and advisory service components," 
Magrath told the Committee.<p>

The NASULGC President stressed that "Sea Grant funding is competitively awarded 
and peer-reviewed.  It is a catalyst for economic growth, and produces national 
benefits and cost savings far in excess of the resources it consumes."<p>

"Sea Grant's economic impact has been shown to be more than twenty times the 
amount of the annual federal appropriation.  It has an impressive record of 
achievements in the marine biotechnology, aquaculture, seafood safety, fisheries
management and production, pollution control, education, coastal development and
management, coastal engineering, and in ensuring under-represented sectors of 
our society are beneficiaries of and participants in Sea Grant activities,"  
Magrath explained.<p>

Magrath provided three examples where Sea Grant has had a tremendous impact: In 
marine biotechnology, Sea Grant is producing new antitumor compounds proven 
effective against breast and prostate cancers, as an anti-inflammatory, and new 
antiviral drugs from never-before explored marine compounds; Sea Grant 
researchers discovered that the diving response of marine mammals can be applied
to human systems to treat cold water near-drowning victims, literally saving 
hundreds of lives a year;  Sea Grant sponsored research has developed wheat 
treatment from crab wastes, increasing crop yields by 10%.<p>

Magrath urged the Committee to approve an FY 1997 appropriation of $56 million 
for Sea Grant, as authorized by the House Resources Committee.  Sea Grant is 
receiving $53 million in FY 1996 and the President has recommended a cut to $48 
million.<p>

"Mr. Chairman, we believe that Sea Grant is a vibrant and successful program, 
and is fully prepared to help the U.S. make the most of its coastal, marine, and
Great Lakes resources in coming years.  A thirty-year track record of 
accomplishment more than justifies this Subcommittee's ongoing commitment to Sea
Grant, and I urge your continued support for the National Sea Grant College 
Program, " Magrath concluded.<p>

03-19-96 --- RONALD C. BAIRD NAMED NATIONAL SEA GRANT DIRECTOR>


<center>
<h2>RONALD C. BAIRD NAMED NATIONAL SEA GRANT DIRECTOR</h2></center>

Washington D.C. Ocean scientist, educator and businessman Ronald C. Baird
has been named director of the NOAA National Sea Grant College Program, the 
Commerce Department's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced 
today (3/19/96).<p>

        Baird will assume his new position with NOAA in Silver Spring, Md.,
June 3, after completing his tenure as vice president of university relations at
Worcester Polytechnic Institute.<p>

        NOAA administrator D. James Baker called Baird's selection, the
result of a national search, "an exceptional choice."  "Dr. Baird's experience 
in business and education, as a scientist and college administrator, makes him 
uniquely qualified to lead Sea Grant, whose continued success in helping to 
protect and preserve our marine environment hinges on a solid working 
partnership between business, government and the university research community,"
Baker said.<p>

        Baird will direct the National Sea Grant College Program, a network
of over 300 colleges, universities, research institutions and marine 
organizations that work in partnership with industry, the federal government, 
and state governments to support marine and Great Lakes research, education and 
extension services.<p>

        On his appointment, Baird said, "In an era of limited resources and
global environmental challenges to coastal resources, the products of an active 
industrial, academic and government research partnership will be absolutely 
critical to our ability to manage coastal resources on a sustainable basis.  Sea
Grant is just such a partnership, with a track record of achievements.  Being 
part of an enterprise whose goal is the health and well being of our invaluable 
coastal resources is a challenge I welcome."<p>

        At Worcester Polytechnic, the nation's third oldest college of
engineering and science, Baird is responsible for the university's external 
relations, including its news service, development office, corporate relations, 
alumni programs and university publications.  He helped develop the school's 
first comprehensive corporate relations program and as an adjunct professor in 
the Department of Biology and Biotechnology has maintained an active research 
program.<p>

        Before joining Worcester Polytechnic, he was director of research at
Geo-Marine, Inc., an engineering consulting firm in Dallas, Texas.  He was also 
the president of Schuster Corporation, an investment concern in the greater 
Worcester area.<p>

        From 1990-95, he was a member of the National Sea Grant Review Panel,
a 15-member, independent citizens advisory committee.<p>

        Baird received a B.S. in zoology from Yale University in 1958.
Following service as a naval officer, he received an M.A. in zoology in 1965 
from the University of Texas, Austin.  He received his Ph.D. in biological 
oceanography from Harvard University in 1969.  His principal research interests 
involve the organization of oceanic ecosystems and natural resource management.

<h3>Panic Underwater:</h3>
<h1>Sea Grant Study Says Over Half of Scuba Divers Experience "Potentially
	Life-Threatening" Panic Attacks"</h1></center>

<font size=+1>MADISON, Wis.</font> -- More than half of 
the scuba divers in a national survey 
reported that they had experienced panic or near-panic behavior on one or more 
occasions, according to Dr. William Morgan, director of the University of 
Wisconsin-Madison Sport Psychology Laboratory.  <P>

There is general agreement among diving authorities that panic behavior is 
responsible for many of the diving accidents and fatalities that occur in 
recreational scuba divers. Dr. Morgan says he hopes his diver panic studies can 
help prevent diving fatalities by informing diving instructors and divers about 
the panic phenomenon in order to screen out divers who might be susceptible to 
potentially life-threatening panic attacks.<P>

"Of  those divers who have not reported panic episodes up to this point, it's 
probable that a number of these individuals will experience a panic attack in 
the future," Morgan said. <P>

Other findings in the Sea Grant study included:<P>
<UL>
      <li> Incidence of panic was higher in women (64%) than men (50%), though 
more men  (48%) than women (35%) perceived the events as life-threatening. 

      <li> Panic attacks are not restricted to novice divers.  Divers with many 
years of experience can experience attacks for no apparent reason. 

      <LI> It was possible to predict panic behavior in beginning scuba divers 
with 88% accuracy using a measure of trait anxiety.

      <LI> Divers who score significantly higher on a measure of trait anxiety 
than divers in general are potentially at greater risk of experiencing a panic 
attack while diving. 

      <LI> Using psychological treatments to reduce anxiety responses in scuba 
divers exposed to various stressors has not been successful in the limited 
research conducted up to this time. 

      <LI> Anxiety responses during and following suba diving exercise were 
associated with the interaction between water temperature and protective apparel
worn by divers.  

      <LI> That is, wearing a suit in cold water and not wearing a suit in warm 
water DID NOT result in anxiety responses; wearing a suit in warm water, and not
wearing a suit in cold water DID result in anxiety responses. 

      <LI>  The risks and dangers of panic attacks during scuba diving are not 
well known among the recreational scuba diving community.  Such terms as 
anxiety, stress and fatalities do not appear in the index of commonly used scuba
training books, nor are topics such as panic even addressed in most training 
manuals, Morgan said.
</ul>
<P>

Dr. Morgan is the author of three books and over 100 journal articles, and he 
was founding president of the Division of Exercise and Sport Psychology in the 
American Psychological Association and is a former member of the Sport 
Psychology Advisory Committee for the U.S. Olympic Committee. Morgan's diver 
panic studies were conducted over the past 10 years in a project funded by the 
University of Wisconsin Sea Grant Institute and published in the December 1995 
issue of Sports Medicine.<P>

<h3>Rhode Island Oil Spill Threatens Key Ecological Areas
Expert Scientific Sources Available From Sea Grant</h3>


<b>Editor's Note:</b>  The following people can offer expert comments and 
viewpoints 
from a scientific basis for issues surrounding the growing ecological disaster 
resulting from the spill of nearly 1,000,000 gallons of heating oil along Rhode 
Island's southern coast this past weekend from the barge, The North Cape.   Feel
free to call the sources direct.  If Sea Grant can be of further assistance with
additional sources on other angles of coverage please call Ben Sherman at 
(301) 405-6381 or contact him via e-mail at: 
<a href="mailto:sherman@umbi.umd.edu">Sherman@umbi.umd.edu</a> <br>
Also 
Information on the Rhode Island Oil Spill can be accessed over the World Wide 
Web on the <a href="http://brooktrout.gso.uri.edu/riseagrant">Rhode Island

<h4>
OIL SPILL IMPACT - AN OVERVIEW</h4>

Areas of Research / Media Topics:</b> Biotechnology; Oceanography; Ecology; 
Pollutants, toxic contaminants; Education - environment and marine; Seafood

Physiological effects of pollutants on marine animals; Invertebrate nutrition; 
Effects of toxic chemicals on the marine environment; Hazards of dredged 
material disposal in the marine environment. <p>

<b>McDowell Comments:</b> "One good thing about this spill is that the 
concentration of
higher molecular weight hydrocarbons is less in a refined oil such as heating 
oil, than in crude oil such as spilled in Alaska. Therefore many of the 
compounds will not produce decades-long effects. The bad news is that refined 
products such heating oil are much more toxic in the short term. The Rhode 
Island spill is comparable in volume to similar heating oil spill in West 
Falmouth in September, 1969. The concern here, as was the case then, is the 
proximity of the spill to the shoreline and coastal habitats. <p>

"The immediate evidence of the spill comes from tainted shellfish, dead fish 
washing ashore, high bird mortality. In the West Falmouth case the evidence of 
fish kills  and obvious damage declined in several months. Still it wasn't for 
several years that reversals took place.  There are still some hydrocarbons 
present. Once it works into coastal sediments the oil can still have sublethal 
effects on such areas as rate of growth, reproduction, settling and migratory 
behavior, food chain transfer.<p>   

"This spill has certainly seen a lot of lobster die-off, but the most important 
aspect here is the loss, or significant reduction, of the juvenile lobsters - 
possibly a whole year class.  The key for the lobster is whether of not the 
nearshore habitat has become heavily oiled.  If it has you could see long term 
effects on lobsters effecting their feeding, reproduction rates, molting growth 
and so forth for the next few years.  A similar situation occurred with the West
Falmouth spill in the salt marshes where a large population of fiddler crabs 
took eight years to recolonize that habitat. There are a lot of subtle effects 
that can occur at even low concentrations of oil pollution."<p>

<b>Nixon Comments:</b>  "On one hand there good news it is the time of year 
when 
relatively little is going on in terms of biology.  Still there is danger if the
oil gets down to the depths, and in some areas it appears to have happened.  
This is one of the worst places in the state to have this happen. It is right on
the edge of the state's coastal lagoons which are a key nursery ground for our 
fishery."<p>

Controlling Oil Spills, Predicting their Paths

<b>Spaulding Comments:</b> "This spill is potentially very significant 
ecologically and
economically.  It is spreading along the coast, and from Point Judith to the 
Harbor of Refuge to Block Island.  The most recent information is that it is 
headed right straight back to the Rhode Island coast.  In terms of impact I 
can't remember a spill that has come as close to all the areas that we have 
tried to protect through the years.  The spill is located right off our coastal 
ponds.  Two of those ponds - Cards and Trustom - have both been breached: oil is
in them.  I can't imagine a worst scenario than a spill right outside our 
coastal ponds.  I can't image a worst scenario for Rhode Island."<p>

currents; Prevention and cleanup of oil spills, using oil control booms in 
cleanup operations; Modeling of coastal processes; Sediment acoustics, mechanics

<b>Celikkol Comments:</b>  "When it comes to cleaning up a spill, 
the lighter the oil, 
the less one can do.  This is much lighter than crude oil such as spilled in 
Alaska.  This oil is highly toxic, but dissipates much faster - about 60% of it 
evaporates, and therefore normally there is less of it mixed into the water 
column.   What happened in Rhode Island, however, was that the spill occurred in
the surf zone, so with the wave action, large amounts of it were mixed 
immediately into the water column creating a large lobster kill.  If it had 
occurred offshore, it would have floated on the water surface and evaporated 
before creating the kill we've seen this time.  This type of oil  is difficult 
to cleanup. You can't boom it like crude. You can do some minimal skimming, but 
perhaps the best you can do is collect about 10%, primarily through the use of 
absorbents such as dried peat moss and other material that acts like a sponge.  
What will probably happen is that about 60% will eventually evaporate; if they 
get lucky 10% will be recovered; and the rest will settle into the sediments 
where it will take some years before its effects will be reduced."<p>

<b>Steiner Comments:</b>  <br>
"The sad part of this incident is 
that it probably wouldn't 
have occurred if  the U.S. had an inspection and training system for tug boat 
operations in this country as was proposed by Rep. Gerry Studds in 1994 
following the Amtrak barge accident in Mississippi.  The bill, which was killed,
would require inspection, and have improved licensing and training of boat 
crews.  The Coast Guard has conducted a study of tug boat safety and training 
and found they don't even meet international minimums that are required for 
ships governed by international inspection rules.  The people of Rhode Island 
should use this spill to get Congress to go back and take a look at implementing
legislation aimed at improving tow vessel safety - improvements in inspection of
vessels doing towing, and being towed; in licensing and training of crews; in 
routing agreements; in development of weather guidelines; and in the development
of technological devices such as remote anchor deployment systems that could 
control drifting barges in emergencies.<p>

"Each oil spill is unique in their own right so you can't compare Rhode Island 
to the Exxon Valdez.  What you can say is there will be economic, social and 
environmental uncertainty for a good period of time. If they think it will go 
away in a short time period that is highly wishful thinking.  It won't happen.  
The key is prevention.  Not much can be done afterwards."<p>

<h3>Minnesota Sea Grant Research</h3>

<h2>
Genetic Engineering Breakthrough Could Lead to Better Supply of Fish
</h2></center>

<b>MINNEAPOLIS:</b>  A University of Minnesota Sea Grant genetics research 
team, headed
by Perry Hackett,  has discovered how to insert extra genes into fish 
chromosomes in a way that should not have any unwanted side-effects.  This 
represents a break-through to improving fish through genetic engineering. The 
results might eventually impact the U.S. food consumer of fish, providing a more
reliable supply of desirable fish through the growing U.S. aquaculture industry.
 <p>
"Our controllers and insulators give any fish biologist the ability to 
genetically engineer any species of fish using any gene available.  It will make
marine biotechnology more efficient and reliable," says Hackett.<p>

 "You can think of genes like light bulbs that come in all sorts of sizes, 
colors and shapes.  But to get them to provide the right kind of light at the 
right time, you need to have them hooked up to switches.  If you can't get them 
to turn on when you want, then they're useless, " explains Hackett.  "From a 
safety point of view, this is great!  We have control.  We can clearly define 
what will happen to the animal.  It's the difference between doing a surgical 
procedure and taking a random shot," said Hackett.<p>

Although these findings should yield groups of transgenic fish with more uniform
traits (e.g., growth rate, disease resistance, etc.), some safety issues are yet
to be explored.   One is whether or not the altered traits would pose 
adverse ecological effects if large numbers of the transgenic fish ended up in a
natural ecosystem, and whether or not escaped transgenic fish could reproduce in
the wild.  If they did reproduce, an assessment would be needed on whether or 
not this would have adverse effects on wild gene pools, particularly on 
endangered species.<p>

Researchers have been working to genetically-improve fish by transplanting genes
for specific traits or characteristics.  Called transgenics, the genes can come 
from the same species of fish, from other fish, or even from other animals.  
Creating and studying transgenic fish helps researchers learn more about how 
they develop so that bigger, healthier fish can be produced for aquaculture.  It
also helps further understanding about how more complex animals like humans 
develop and grow.
<p>
When a new gene is added, it doesn't always work as desired.  It may not work at
all.  Unwanted side effects sometimes occur.  In any animal cell, most genes are
off most of the time, so the natural state of a gene is "off."<P>

The key to solving this problem is understanding what switches genes on and off;
what allows them to be "expressed."  These switches are called "promoters, " and
like genes themselves, promoters are made of DNA that lies between the different
genes on a chromosome.  Promoters are just as important as the genes themselves.
<p>
"Promoters are like switches that respond to different signals that come from 
cells or the environment, " says Hackett.  Through his research on zebrafish, 
Danio rerio, Hackett and his students have discovered several gene controllers 
that work best for turning on genes to the proper level. (Like having a dimmer 
switch on a light that can be turned to the precise level needed.)<p>

The second problem is that regulators from the normal genes in a chromosome can 
affect the transplanted gene, and controllers from a transplanted gene can 
conflict with regulators that are already there.  Insulators, or border 
elements, are needed to keep their functions separate. <p>
 
His group's findings were published in March in the  journal of Molecular Marine
Biology and Biotechnology and reprints of the article, "Development of 
position-independent expression vectors and their transfer into transgenic 
fish," are available from Minnesota Sea Grant, (218) 726-6191.

<h2>HACCP REGULATIONS, INSPECTION COMING TO SEAFOOD INDUSTRY</h2>
</center>

<b>THE ISSUE:</b> On January 28, 1994 the United States Food 
and Drug Administration 
announced its proposal to establish procedures for safe processing and importing
of fish and fishery products.  The seafood safety measures are to be based on 
the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) system whereby seafood is 
monitored at critical points in its journey from the sea to the consumer to 
insure its quality and safety. The FDA issued its final regulations for seafood 
industry HACCP inspection procedures on December 5 1995.<p>

<b>INTERVIEW SOURCE:</b> Steven Otwell, Sea Grant Seafood 
Specialist, University of 
Florida Sea Grant Program
Office Phone: (904) 392-1991; Home Phone: (904) 372-3997; E-Mail: 
otwell@gnv.ifas.ufl.edu<p>

<b>Areas of Research / Media Topics:</b> Seafood safety and quality.  
Dr. Otwell heads 
the National Sea Grant team responsible for training seafood processors how to 
comply with the new seafood handling regulations; Development of an automated 
quality assessment device for shrimp; Development of a sanitation rating for 
Listeria bacteria in blue crab and shrimp processing.<p>

<b>Otwell Talking Points:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>  Need for seafood processing inspections
<li>  Benefits to consumers
<li>  Impacts on industry, businesses, restaurants, grocery stores.
<li>  Implementation procedures, time frames, cost to consumer.
</ul>


<h4>Otwell Comments: </h4>

<b>Significance of HACCP Regulations:</b> "This is the most dramatic 
change in the 
inspection of our food supply in the last 30 or 40 years in the U.S. It is both 
regulatory and marketplace driven. It is a highly effective way to promote food 
safety and it is a proven method. The U.S. is not alone in this. We're seeing 
the major markets of the world going to this type of system."<p>

The Challenge of Making Federal Rules Apply Regionally: "Federal, state and 
industry cooperation is needed. Much of the responsibility for the HACCP program
will rely on state initiatives, since they will guide inspections along to their
particular regional needs. We don't have cod in Florida and Virginia doesn't 
have natural salmon, so we have to fend for our own respective industry 
interests." ..."Since this alliance is the first type of cooperation and joint 
effort among various agencies, industry, and educators to initiate the HACCP 
concept for any form of food commerce in the country, a lot of eyes will be on 
it."<p>
 
<b>Consumer Benefits From HACCP Rules:</b> "Regulators and industry 
have sought to work
together to increase the safety and quality of seafood process and consumed in 
the U.S. This partnership will focus seafood training and education in the 
industry to insure safety and restore consumer confidence in the nation's 
seafood. HACCP procedures are intended to provide the American consumer with 
more confidence in the nation's seafood products.  When the new regulations go 
into effect, we want to make sure the industry not only understands them, but 
can also comply with them."  <p>

<b>Sea Grant Role:</b> The National Sea Grant Program has been conducting 
a multi-year 
effort (since 1994) aimed at providing the means to provide the training and 
education to successfully implement the FDA / HACCP regulations.  Central to 
that effort has been the creation of the Seafood HACCP Alliance. <p>

<b>The Seafood HACCP Alliance:</b> The Alliance's goal is to 
foster a more uniform and 
current national education, training and technical assistance program for the 
seafood industry and the federal, state and local food inspectors.  The Alliance
approach is to develop basic education manuals and conduct a series of 
'train-the-trainer' courses to help prepare a cadre of instructors across the 
nation.  Likewise, through continuing project funds from the National Sea Grant 
College Program, they plan to provide a  number of actual training sessions for 
the regional industries and inspectors.  To assure regional coverage, the 
Alliance is organized in alignment with the regional affiliates of the 
Association of Food & Drug Officials (AFDO).  They are represented by pertinent 
agencies, academic expertise and industry.  The Alliance does not develop or 
direct policy or commercial response.  The Alliance role is strictly for 
development and delivery of educational programs.<p>

<b>Seafood HACCP Alliance Membership:</b> Representatives from - Association 
of Food & 
Drug Officials and their six regional affiliates; U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration, Office of Seafood; National Marine Fisheries Service; National 
Fisheries Institute; National Food Processors Association; Interstate Shellfish 
Sanitation Conference; USDA Cooperative Research, Education & Extension 
Services; National Sea Grant College Program's National Office and the 
state-based Sea Grant programs in Alaska, California, Florida, Louisiana, North 
Carolina, Oregon and Virginia.<p>

<b>Implementation Procedures Entering Final Stages:</b> The Seafood 
HACCP Alliance has 
arranged a special "trial test" December 4-6 in Alexandria, VA. for their 
materials and mode of instruction to determine any needed adjustments before 
completing the course curriculum and launching the national education program.  
The trial training session is designed to exemplify the intended training 
program.  The instruction includes a manual and selection of practicals to 
provide experience in developing HACCP programs for seafood processing. All 
training materials were developed in cooperation with the US Food & Drug 
Administration to assure consistency with future FDA mandates.<p>

<h3>Sea Grant Seeking Solutions</h3>
<h2>
"Black Beauty" Setting Electrifying Pace for New Cost-effective Underwater
Welding Technology</h2></center>

<b>Editor's Note:</b>  The following is a outline report 
on an Ohio Sea Grant research 
project aimed at improving underwater welding technology. Feel free to contact 
the sources listed at the end for further information, interviews, 
demonstrations.<p>

<b>Issue:</b> Increasing demand for effective, 
efficient and economically feasible 
underwater welding technology.<p>

<b>Background/Overview:</b>  Underwater welding repair of offshore, 
inland waterway and
port facilities is becoming a top priority for both military and industrial 
communities.  Many of these facilities are operating well beyond their intended 
life, increasing associated maintenance and repair costs.  <p>

Worldwide applications of underwater welding include underwater pipelines, 
offshore oil drilling rigs, docking facilities, mining, ships, barges, dams, 
locks, subsea habitats, and nuclear power facilities.  Current underwater 
welding technology can produce "code-quality" welding if a dry chamber system is
used to keep water from the work area.  However, the hyperbaric chambers 
required for this process are very expensive to operate.<p>

The alternative repair is a wet welding technique with no mechanical shielding 
from water.  Despite adverse water environment conditions, there are, compared 
to hyperbaric chamber welding, direct and considerable cost savings in making 
efficient wet welds.<P>

<b>Sea Grant Researcher / Media Source:</b> Dr. Chon Tsai, Ohio Sea 
Grant Researcher; 
Department of Industrial, Welding and Assistance Engineering Professor; Ohio 
State University (OSU), (O) 614-292-0522.

<b>The Solution:</b> Using Sea Grant research funds, 
Tsai has developed a new welding 
electrode nicknamed "Black Beauty" for the black appearance of its waterproof 
coating.  The electrode is in the final months of a two-year National Coastal 
Resources Research & Development Institute (NCRI) testing project.  The project 
goal is to develop a database of engineering results for the commercialization 
and technical support of the electrode.  Welding Consultants, Inc. is the 
project partner in this effort.<P>

The electrode has already shown the potential to overcome many problems 
associated with underwater welding including poor weld profile, micro-cracking, 
undesirable operating characteristics and poor weld appearance.  <p>

<b>Positive Traits Documented by Experimental Tests:</b> The electrode 
exhibits the 
following positive traits from testing completed thus far:<br>
<ol>
  <li> welds have 
excellent visual appearance and profile, making them less likely to crack while 
in service; 
<li> micro-cracking of the weld metal has been eliminated; 
 
<li>operating characteristics are superior to other commercially-available 
electrodes; and 
<li> the electrode produces suitable results when welding 
in any position, while most other electrodes are limited to flat position 
welding.  
</ol>In general, the "Black Beauty" has out-performed all other 
commercially-available electrodes in all the test and analyses categories.<p>

<b>Additional Benefits:</b> The new wet welding electrode will create:
<ol>
<li>a more 
efficient wet welding process which businesses and entrepreneurs may use for 
water structures and their repairs; 
<li> new jobs in electrode manufacturing and 
offshore construction; 
<li> reduced environmental risk due to stronger and more 
effective repairs to submerged structures.
</ol>

<b>Economic Potential:</b>  The estimated electrode cost is 
seven to ten dollars per 
pound, considerably less expensive than the current three commercially-available
electrodes, which range from a low of $13-$15 per pound to a high of $35.<p>

Welding Consultants, Inc. hopes to be manufacturing the electrode by the end of 
1996, with C.H. Symington and Co. marketing it.  An annual sales volume of 
150,000 pieces, approximately 40 percent of the total domestic market, is 
projected in the U.S.  Related welding equipment sales in this country could 
reach an additional annual $1.5 million in sales and services. The international
market is considered to have even greater potential.  <p>

<b>Developments Made to Commercialize:</b> The engineering database for the new 
electrode will provide a breakthrough in commercial wet welding applications.  
Several steps have already been taken:  
<ol>
<li>the Ohio Underwater Welding Center at
OSU has been established to disseminate new underwater welding technology to 
industrial users and to provide industrial/provider/user contact databases, 
training, and R&D services; 
<li> the U.S. Navy, as a potential user of the new 
technology, has provided funds for an OSU welding research team project to 
evaluate and compare the applicability of the "Black Beauty" electrode and 
another electrode to their Naval ship repair practices, aiming to reduce costly 
and time-consuming dry-docking; 
<li> Harbin Research Institute of Welding, in 
Harbin, China, has expressed great interest in the promotion of the electrode in
the Chinese market due to its superb performance in pressure vessel testing 
there.  If successful, the huge China market could translate to volume electrode
sales.

<h3>Desire For Bargains Helps Keep The Environment Clean</h3>
</center>


Congressional cutbacks threaten water monitoring and surveillance programs 
installed as a response to the federal Clean Water Act of 1972. Should the goal 
of these cutbacks be to save money rather than to out-and-out eliminate 
monitoring, then organizations such as the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) can still do their job. Three Ohio State University economic modelers 
illustrate how regulatory agencies can continue and even strengthen their 
monitoring and enforcement (M&E) of pollution control policies at reduced costs.
<p>
     The modelers, Eva Hentschel, Alan Randall, and Mario Miranda, with the 
university's Department of Agricultural Economics, presented their paper -- 
"Enforcing Pollution Control Regulation Using Two Types of Inspection, a 
Reputation Indicator, and Self-Reports" -- last August at the annual meeting of
the American Agricultural Economics Association. Their work was supported by 
Ohio Sea Grant.
<p>
     Although the mere mention of "economics" and "modeling" may have sent some 
readers on to the next page, the truth is that this model and others like it 
have to plumb the depths (or shallowness, as the case may be) of human behavior 
to be useful and relevant. For example, these researchers are well aware that
the whole problem of finding and abating pollution "is a repeated game between 
the agency, who sets the policy parameters, and the firms who react to them." 
Their model realizes that firms won't bother to control pollution unless they 
know that they are likely to get caught, and the expected penalty for polluting 
is severe enough to make it not worth the risk. It also realizes that even
the most severe penalty is worthless unless it is also enforced. Finally, the 
model presents what every human loves -- a bargain.
<p>
     The researchers' model has three special features that, when all three are 
employed, can reduce an agency's water monitoring and enforcement costs by 5/6. 
First, rather than inspect firms at random, the agency adjusts the probability 
of inspecting particular firms based on their past compliance records. This
presumes that pollution control is costly and therefore that most commercial 
firms will avoid compliance if they can get away with it. The companies that 
show time and again that they do comply with controls, however, suggest that 
their continued compliance is more reliable and "trustworthy." As a result, the 
number of inspections paid to these companies with a positive reputation is
reduced, and money is saved. By the same token, firms with reputations for 
consistently violating pollution levels are inspected more and more often. The 
continually increasing threat of inspection should act as a deterrent to 
violation. That is, polluters don't want to get caught.
<p>
     The model's second feature is that the regulatory agency conduct two types 
of inspection: sampling and capacity.  Surveys suggest that testing effluent for
pollution (i.e., sampling) is at least three times as expensive as ensuring that
a firm has the proper equipment to control pollution (i.e., capacity).
Samples can require weeks for proper collection, and as much or more time
for proper chemical analysis. Inspecting machinery, on the other hand -- first 
to assure its presence, second to make sure it's being used -- can take a few 
days. Once a firm has invested in the necessary personnel, machinery, and other 
technology to control pollution, it's a small step for them to actually 
implement control, and so they are likely to do so.  Inspections of firms known 
to have the proper pollution abatement equipment can therefore be reduced. The 
money from fewer inspections can be invested in more sampling of firms suspected
of violation, which should, in turn, decrease the likelihood of violation.
<p>
     For the third and final feature -- and this is where the researchers take 
the best advantage of human behavior -- the model suggests that some inspections
by the agency (which cost the agency money) be substituted with self-reports 
from the firm.
<p>
        At this point, you're probably saying, oh sure, what firm is going to 
tell the truth, anyway? And that's because you assume that humans will lie if 
they know they won't get caught and if the price of telling the truth is high. 
But the modelers also know that humans don't like to be lied to and that if a 
firm is caught in a lie about how much pollution it's putting out,  we, society,
will support very, very big penalties. So the model suggests this: to encourage 
firms to truthfully report their own pollution violations, set a fair, 
reasonable, forgiving penalty.  That is, don't make the price too high for 
telling the truth. But for the firms that would actually falsify their records 
and lie to the public about their violations, wallop them with a big penalty. 
Society will perceive them as deserving it, and the big penalty will deter false
self-reports. Fewer inspections save money, and focusing inspection and  
enforcement on the worst-case firms keeps the environment clean.
<p>
     And you thought economics was dry and boring.

<h3>Thick Slick of Green Ick:<br>
 Bloom of Blue-Green Algae Returns to Lake Erie</h3>
</center>


<h4>COLUMBUS, OHIO:</h4>
 A bloom of a potentially toxic cyanobacterium (or blue-green 
alga) was discovered mid-August in Lake Erie's western basin, according to Dr. 
Jeff Reutter, director of Ohio Sea Grant and Stone Laboratory. John Hageman, 
laboratory manager for the freshwater field station, discovered the bloom of
Microcystis (tentatively identified as sp. aeruginosa) near Rattle Snake
Island, two miles west of Put-in-Bay, while on a research trawl.
By mid-September the bloom had peaked. Lake Erie's entire western basin was then
covered with what looked like, according to Hageman, "a thick slick of  
grass-green paint."<p>
     Such nuisance algal blooms are nothing new to Lake Erie, according to Dr. 
Alfred Beeton, Director of the NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research 
Laboratory (GLERL). They occurred annually in the 1970s and early '80s before 
Canada and the U.S. agreed to lower phosphorus -- a nutrient and limiting factor
in the growth of phytoplankton -- in all of the Great Lakes with the Great
Lakes Water Quality Agreement. What is new, says Dr. Reutter, is that the blooms
of the '70s and '80s were predominated by a different cyanobacterium, 
phanizomenon flos-aquae. Even more surprising to researchers is that the bloom 
has occurred now after the accidental introduction of the zebra mussel in 1986.
<p>
     "Microcystis is part of the lake's natural flora and fauna," says Dr. 
Beeton, "but since the zebra mussel we haven't seen, nor would we expect to see,
any bloom of any kind of algae, considering the mussel's filtering abilities." 
Indeed, Lake Erie is clearer now than it has been for decades. The effect
is attributed to each one of billions of these thumbnail-sized mussels filtering
phytoplankton and zooplankton from a reputed liter of lake water a day.<p>
     Dr. Henry Vanderploeg, also with GLERL, is not surprised by the Microcystis
bloom in Lake Erie, however, having observed the same phenomenon for the last 
two years on Lake Huron's Saginaw Bay, which is also infested with zebra 
mussels. Dr. Vanderploeg suspects that the mussels are promoting the growth of
Microcystis. His laboratory videos of zebra mussels from both Lake Erie and 
Saginaw Bay show the mussels sucking in plankton along with the typically 
BB-sized, gelatinous Microcystis colonies. The videos also show the mussels 
expelling the Microcystis as loosely consolidated pseudofeces -- a typical
behavior of these mussels in dealing with unpalatable food.<P>
     Having observed these unusual blooms for the last two years,  Dr. 
Vanderploeg believes that "the zebra mussels' rejection is the probable 
mechanism for the bloom. This behavior poses the question, is this rejection the
mussels' response to a toxin in the algae? And if so, are the blooms toxic?" 
[that is, harmful to other organisms]. Dr. Vanderploeg is sending water samples
from both lakes to Wright State University's Dr. Wayne Carmichael, an expert in 
toxic algae, for testing.<p>
     "There are about six known species of Microcystis, most of which have been 
analyzed, and every one is producing toxins called 'microcystins,'" says Dr. 
Carmichael. "We presume, then, that this Microcystis in Lake Erie is also 
producing toxins, although we haven't tested it yet." According to Dr.
Carmichael, these tests are sensitive to minute levels of microcystins, so
that finding toxin production does not necessarily mean that there is sufficient
toxin to make the cyanobacterium actually toxic. That, he says, depends on the 
growth conditions, such as levels of available light and nutrients, and 
temperature.  <p>
        Microcystis is known to have been responsible for some bird and fish 
kills, previously attributed to man-made pollution. High levels of microcystins 
are known to poison the liver; at very low prolonged doses they act as liver 
tumor promoters. Exposure to the toxins can also cause gastrointestinal problems
in humans.<p>
     Lisa Babcock-Jackson, a graduate student at The Ohio State University, can 
attest to one effect of microcystins on humans.  At the peak of the bloom, she 
made three, hour-long scuba dives in one day to retrieve test tiles coated with 
candidate anti-zebra mussel additives for her work with Ohio State toxicologist
Dr. Susan Fisher. "Unfortunately," says Babcock-Jackson, "the day was windy, and
Microcystis reduced visibility to near zero in the entire water column at 12, 15
and 18 feet. Later that same day I was seized with abdominal pains that doubled 
me over." <p>
        Babcock-Jackson cannot say absolutely that her pain was due to
swallowing tiny amounts lake water during her dives ("which I'm prone
to,"she adds), but she considers it a remarkable coincidence that she
became ill within hours of her dives, remained ill during her workweek, and 
recovered only when she returned to Columbus. <p>
     Surely, by now you're wondering that if Microcystis is known to produce 
toxins that can make us and other animals sick, and that at one time annual 
blooms were commonplace on Lake Erie, why were the blooms never tested then for 
toxicity? And why should a bloom make news now?<p>
     "Ignoring Microcystis as a source of fish and bird kills was simple 
oversight on the part of researchers," says Dr. Carmichael. "Pollution was so 
rampant in the '70s and '80s, we presumed the wildlife kills that we were seeing
to be the result of xenobiotics" [man-made, polluting chemicals].<p>
     The bloom is news now because, in a nutshell, it shouldn't be here, 
according to Ohio State University's Dr. David Culver. He's examining the level 
to which Microcystis competes with other phytoplankton for light and nutrients 
and may even inhibit its competition with toxin. "With the presence of zebra
mussels," says Dr. Culver, "and particularly with the lake's reduction in
phosphorus, we assumed that nuisance algal blooms such as this were a thing of 
the past. Microcystis shows that we were wrong and sends us back to the drawing 
board. We know, for example, that zebra mussels are digesting 
phosphorus-containing organisms and releasing phosphorus back to the water 
column. Maybe these nutrients are supporting the bloom."<p>

<h3>Local Photographers Spotlighted In Sea Grant's New Bay Calendar,
 Exhibit </h3>
</center>

        NARRAGANSETT-January explodes with the golden fireworks of First
Night over the upper Bay. August vibrates with the bustle of a busy day at
the beach. November smolders in a foggy amber dawn.<p>
        February 25 is noted as the birth date of Ida Lewis, one-time
keeper of the Lime Rock Lighthouse in Newport, and June 27 is red-lettered
as the date in 1994 that 500 quahoggers joined the governor at Greenwich
Bay to celebrate its reopening to shellfishing. <p>
        These are some of the scenes and snippets of local lore that make
the new Narragansett Bay Calendar for 1996 a uniquely Rhode Island
document. Designed around seasonal photographs of the Bay by Rhode Island
photographers, the calendar is being introduced with an exhibition of
photographs chosen from the nearly 400 images contributed to the calendar
project. The exhibit, Through the Lens: Perspectives on Narragansett Bay,
will hang at Arnold Art Gallery, 210 Thames Street, Newport, from November
10 through 27, with a second showing at the Citizens Bank Headquarters, One
Citizens Plaza, Providence, from December 4 through 17. <p>
        Along with scenes of Narragansett Bay in all its seasons and all
its moods, the calendar features brief narratives about different facets of
Bay life, ranging from descriptions of Bay creatures such as quahogs and
jellyfish to accounts of oil spills and underwater archaeology. Intricate
line drawings illustrate the narratives, and date blocks include
information about historical events and daily tides. <p>
        The calendar and the exhibit are sponsored by the Narragansett Bay
National Estuarine Research Reserve, Rhode Island Sea Grant, and the
Narragansett Bay Project to heighten awareness of the beauty of the Bay and
its importance as a resource to the people of Rhode Island and southeastern
Massachusetts. <p>
        The calendar is $10. To order, or for more information, write to
the Rhode Island Sea Grant Communications Office, University of Rhode
Island Bay Campus, Narragansett, Rhode Island, 02882, or call (401)
792-6842. <p>

<h3>Magnuson Act Floor Debate Underway, Fisheries Act Background Information,
Expert Scientific Sources Available</h3>



Contact for Additional Information: Ben Sherman (O) 301-405-6381<p>
<b>Issue:</b>  Reauthorization of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation 
and Management Act,
the principle law governing the management of U.S. fisheries.<p>


<b>Time:</b> U.S. House of Representatives passed reauthorization 388-37
with 7 not voting on 
October 18th.  The
bill is slated for debate in the U.S. Senate this Spring.<br>

<b>Importance:</b>  According to the United Nations' Food 
and Agriculture Organization,
70 percent of all fish stocks are fully exploited, overexploited or rebuilding 
from past overfishing. Nine of the world's 17 major fisheries are in serious 
decline and four others are classified as commercially depleted.
<UL>
<LI> Worldwide, overfishing and poor management reduce 
the optimum revenues from 
fishing by at least $15 billion a year.  At the same time, the FAO says global 
fisheries production will need to increase by 25 percent to 91 million tons over
the next 10 years just to keep up with human  population growth and maintain 
current per-capita fish consumption.
<LI>  The United States has abundant finfish and shellfish resources of 
considerable value within its 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone.  According to 
the National Marine Fisheries Service, domestic commercial fisheries in 1991 had
a total impact on the U.S. Gross National Product of more than $50-billion 
dollars.  And that's not counting the economic impact of the 17 million people 
who engaged in recreational marine fishing that year.
<LI>  However, fish stocks were less abundant in 1991 than before 1976, when 
comprehensive federal fisheries management began with passage of the Magnuson 
Fishery Conservation and Management Act.  By the early 1990s, 67 of 236 fish 
species were being over-utilized, 61 were fully utilized and only 28 
under-utilized and data were inadequate to determine the status of the 80 other 
known species.
<LI>  Many fish populations are at or near historic lows, 
including some species 
that are familiar table fare.
<LI>  There is no question that many species have been overfished 
and others are 
being mismanaged. Overcapitalization in the fishing industry has contributed to 
catches in excess of sustainable levels.  Depleted fish stocks are causing fish 
harvesters and processors to go bankrupt.<p>
</ul>

<h3>EXPERT SOURCE COMMENTS:</h3>
<h4>Alaska Sea Grant</h4> 
<b>(4 hours behind EDT)
Ron Dearborn - Director, Alaska Sea Grant Program
University of Alaska - Fairbanks, School of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences
(O) 907-474-7949<br></b>
Dearborn says that science must play an increased role in 
fisheries management: <br>
"The failure is with the scientist, and not with management. There have been 
very significant changes in the ecosystem that are just now being factored into 
fishery science.  It's hard to manage wisely when you have no idea what's going 
on in the ecosystem."<p>


<h4>North Carolina Sea Grant</h4>
<b>Larry Crowder - North Carolina Sea Grant Research Scientist
Duke University Marine Laboratory, (O) 919/504-7637<br></b>
"What the Magnuson Act did equivocally is deal with foreign fisheries. It 
established the U.S. economic zone and who the fish belonged to. The U.S. effect
was development of a domestic fleet --- one that is now 40 to 50 percent 
overcapitalized." ... "What the Magnuson Act should address now is overfishing 
and ways to control effort. There are a number of suggestions in the Act for 
that. It should also address bycatch and discards...There is all of this 
discussion about resource allocation these days --- Who is a commercial 
fisherman and who's not and what percentage of change is attributable to 
sportfishing. But we don't know how much resource is out there. Everyone seems 
to be ignoring the stock assessment issue --- What is a total allowable catch? 
How and why do stock populations fluctuate from year to year?  How do you 
accurately assess populations? How can you divide a resource until know what the
catch is? This is overlooked in who gets the fish? It's not a trivial problem, 
and it's not going away ... Many people think fish should be managed as part of 
the coastal ecosystem --- ecosystem management. Rather than managing each 
species separately, we should manage the network of interacting species. We 
should consider habitat and interactions among species."<p>

<h4>North Carolina Sea Grant</h4>
<b>Michael Orbach - North Carolina Sea Grant Fisheries Research 
Scientist, (Member 
North Carolina Marine Fisheries Commission), Duke University Marine Laboratory, 
(O) 919-504-7606<br></b>
"The Magnuson Act has done a good job of participatory governance among people 
participating in the fishery. But what it has not done is take into account the 
larger societal values toward the ocean. " ... "The science used to develop 
management plans is largely natural science. Yet management decisions have 
social and economic ramifications as well as biological ones. But social science
and economics are not explicitly included in fisheries management."<P>

<h4>Delaware Sea Grant</h4>
<b>Lee Anderson - (Member Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council), 
Professor of 
Marine Policy, University of Delaware, Graduate College of Marine Studies, (O) 
302-831-2650<br></b>
"Congress should be very careful about any restrictions it places on the use of 
ITQs (Individual Transferable Quotas) and other management tools by fisheries 
councils.  The current version of the Magnuson Act contains enough guidance and 
controls to ensure that proper consideration is given to all spects of proposed 
management techniques.  Further restrictions will not be good for fisheries 
managers, fishermen, or--the bottom line--our fisheries."<p>

<h3>New Approach to Managing Recreational Anchorages
Saves Money and the Environment
</h3>
         <h1>Boaters Regulate Anchoring in Southwest Florida</h1>
</center>

<b>The Issue:</b>  The increasingly serious problem of recreational 
boaters negatively 
affecting coastal communities and their environments.<p>

<b>Background/Overview:</b>  There is one boat for every 20 residents in 
Florida.  With
over 700,000 boats in Florida's waters, there are many opportunities for 
conflicts such as excessive noise, crime and boat traffic.  Often, local 
governments respond to such conflicts by imposing restrictions.  Unfortunately, 
the diversity of boating restrictions often hinders compliance and leads to 
frustration on the part of boaters, thus hurting local economies, 
environmentally fragile areas and the boating business _ a multi-billion dollar 
contributor to Florida's economy.  <p>

A new boating management program has been developed through a partnership by the
University of Florida Sea Grant Program, the Boater's Action and Information 
League (BAIL), the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), the 
West Coast Inland Navigation District (WCIND), and the Southwest Florida 
Regional Planning Council.  This five-year pilot program covers recreational 
anchoring from the southern shores of Tampa Bay to Marco Island, just south of 
Naples _ a 150-mile stretch of coastline that contains some of Florida's best 
boating and fishing areas.  Continued interest in boating is encouraged by the 
program, and it helps protect coastal environments.  If successful, this new 
approach to anchorage management could offer a solution to other boating 
problems in other areas resulting from increased competition for the use of 
scarce water resources.<p>

<b>Sea Grant Expert Source:  Dr. Gustavo Antonini, Florida Sea Grant Extension 
Specialist and University of Florida Department of Geography Professor, (O) 
904-392-6233.</b><p>

<b>A Possible Solution:</b>  The southwest Florida pilot anchorage program 
is based on 
a recently completed feasibility study of such an approach that was conducted by
the University of Florida Sea Grant Program.  The study included large-scale 
mapping of anchorages, demographic and opinion surveys of boaters and shore 
residents, and the testing of "tools of persuasion" _ guide materials to 
influence boater behavior.  A product of this collaborative effort is "A Guide 
to Anchorages in Southwest Florida."  Additional eco-tourism publications are 
planned to improve boater awareness regarding anchorage characteristics as well 
as to introduce users to wise management practices.<p>

The pilot program classifies anchorages into three categories.  Areas where 
environmental damage has not occurred as a result of boating are designated as 
"regulation free."  Sections of coastline where environmental damage can be 
documented would be placed in a "restricted use" category, and areas where 
over-crowding occurs would be subject to "direct" management.  Any regulatory 
actions taken would be developed and enforced by a Harbor Board whose membership
would consist of local shoreside residents, boaters, and representatives of 
public agencies.  BAIL and Sea Grant will be responsible for educating boaters 
about the new program, and Sea Grant will work with the DEP to establish a 
monitoring strategy to evaluate boaters' effects on the waters.  Members of BAIL
will  conduct training sessions throughout southwest Florida.  <p>

<b>Antonini's Comments:</b>  "Basically, this is a 'carrot-stick' approach 
to boating 
management. The carrot is the offer of regulation-free boating and the stick is 
that if boaters fail to act responsibly, their freedom to enjoy the pleasures of
boating along Florida's coastline will be increasingly regulated. Giving boaters
such a strong role in regulating themselves might seem risky to some people, but
in reality, boaters have the biggest stake in seeing that they behave 
responsibly. Of all the many groups that share our coastal resources, boaters 
seem to be among those with the highest regard for protecting the beauty and 
serenity of Florida's waters."<P>

<h2>Insurance Industry May Be Helped by Sea Grant Hurricane Research</h2>

<b>Issue:</b> Insurance industry and coastal weather hazards - have they 
learned from 
Hurricane Andrew?  What changes have they made?  What changes are people and 
businesses along the coastal zone of the Southeastern United States making or 
being forced to make because of the risk of coastal erosion storm damage and 
hurricanes? <p>

<h3>Sea Grant Research Highlight:</h3>
One example of a change came in September when the National Federal Flood 
Insurance Program ended their subsidies for relocating structures away from 
eroding shorelines.  North Carolina Sea Grant researcher Spencer Rogers has 
studied coastal erosion and building codes. He is recommending that communities 
change their setback rules to reduce the likelihood of beachfront property being
washed out to sea by increasing the setback line from a 10-year erosion rate to 
a 100-year erosion rate, similar to the standard used for flood plains.

Specialist, Office: 910-458-5498, 458-5780</b><br>
Coastal engineer who can explain storm surges, winds and waves impact on coastal
barrier islands. Also an expert on hurricane-resistant construction. Has helped 
rewrite North Carolina building codes for storm construction. Very familiar with
hurricane insurance issues having done work with insurance industry on 
hurricanes in North Carolina and Texas.<p>

<h3>Sea Grant Research Highlight:</h3>
South Carolina Sea Grant researcher Peter Sparks is working by using wind 
tunnels at Clemson University and construction design modification to help 
preserve building "envelopes." As a result of his research a Del Webb retirement
community, Sun City-Hilton Head being built in Beauford, South Carolina, has 
modified its design including changes in window systems,  and roof pitches to 
improve its structural integrity in hurricane winds.  Sparks has also been 
working with the insurance industry since Hurricane Andrew to help develop their
new "Building Code Effectiveness Grading Schedule." He is pitching this system, 
which is based on sound scientific knowledge,  to individual architects as a 
means of insuring new structures are built to higher weather-resistance 
standards.<br>

Sparks has done a major study on the "risk of hurricane wind damage to buildings
in South Carolina." Report makes nine major recommendations including 
standardizing state building codes and training certification procedures for all
inspectors, changes in insurance occupancy certification, structure review of 
all public buildings and modifications as necessary to meet wind loads; 
institute architectural plan review before new buildings are constructed. Sparks
can discuss these and related hurricane issues. Is currently working with 
insurance industry to improve their understanding of hurricane-resistant 
construction requirements and with Del Webb development on Carolina coast to 
improve hurricane resistance in new construction.<p>

<h2>National Sea Grant Marina Network:</h2>
<h3>Enhancing the Economic and
Environmental Sustainability of the Marina Industry.</h3>

<b>NARRAGANSETT, RI:</b> The marina industry is 
rapidly becoming a dominant coastal 
business. ManySea Grant programs are interacting with the marina industry, 
addressing critical economic and environmental issues facing marinas, and 
providing important information to the industry. However, information exchange 
among programs is limited. To make Sea Grant's interaction with this important
industry more productive, the National Sea Grant Marina Network (MarinaNet)
creates a system for the efficient transfer of information and experience
about marina operations. The network will create and reinforce connections
among Sea Grant programs, and between Sea Grant and the marina industry,
regulatory agencies, and other marine-related organizations.<p>

The MarinaNet project began on August 1, 1995 and will be completed by July
31, 1997. The principal investigators are Virginia Lee and Mark Amaral,
from Rhode Island Sea Grant. Co-investigators include: Alex Wypyszinski,
New Jersey; Michael Liffman, Louisiana; Dewayne Hollin, Texas; Marion
Clarke, Florida; John Schwartz, Michigan; and Bruce DeYoung, Oregon. Each
member of the MarinaNet team is responsible for networking with regulatory
and nonregulatory agencies, other Sea Grant programs, and with the marina
industry within their regions.<p>

Objectives
<ul>
<LI> Link individual Sea Grant programs with marina-related activities or
projects into a national network to facilitate easy access to all research,
advisory, and outreach activities and make the network available to the
marina industry, Sea Grant programs, and regulatory agencies.

<li> Encourage a proactive and economically sustainable approach to the
aquatic environment by marina personnel and their clients.

<li> Serve as a conduit of research information between academia and the
marine trades to a) facilitate the emergence and application of best
management and marketing practices; and b) respond to the continuing
demographic changes along the nation's coastal margin that are resulting in
a public expectation of a balanced approach toward public access to coastal
resources.
</ul>

Methods
<ul>
<li> Develop a network of Sea Grant personnel, drawn from state programs, who
are active participants in the marina industry. Key elements include: (1)
establishing a communication network linked with the National Sea Grant
Depository for on-line access to documents; (2) hosting a preconference
meeting for Sea Grant at the 1997 International Marina Conference; (3)
creation of a national environmental catalog for marinas that distills
existing Sea Grant marina operations information; and (4) assessment of
research opportunities.

<li> Provide an efficient point of contact through which national marine trade
associations can interface with Sea Grant.
</ul>
Upcoming Activities

<ul>
<li> Official announcement of project initiation through press releases and
courtesy meetings.

<li> Organizational meeting for MarinaNet investigators and other interested
Sea Grant professionals, to be held October 22, 1995, in Ft. Lauderdale,
Florida, prior to the annual International Marina Conference.

<li> First MarinaNet newsletter. February, 1996. Additional newsletters with
follow  semiannually. The newsletter will highlight Sea Grant activities as
they pertain to the marina industry and related regulatory activities. It
will be distributed to the Sea Grant network, and then to the industry via
project collaborators.

<h3>A SEA GRANT SPOTLIGHT ON SOLUTIONS:<br>
 TRAINING MUNICIPAL LEADERS IN WATER RESOURCE
PROTECTION ISSUES</h3>
</center>

<b>The Issue:</b> Insuring that volunteer and/or part-time 
municipal policy board 
members or city management personnel understand watershed management issues.
<p>

<b>Background / Overview:</b> The authority for land use regulation more 
often than not
rests with local officials.  As such they are responsible for controlling 
nonpoint sources of pollution that may degrade town water supplies, fishing 
areas and other important water resources.  Often local boards making these 
decisions are comprised of volunteers with a wide range of backgrounds and 
training, and as a result they are often lacking the knowledge they need to 
carry out their responsibilities. These boards evaluate proposed subdivision, 
industrial and commercial facilities, and recreational projects like golf 
courses and playing fields.  They also guide future land use and zoning plans; 
and they develop and implement pollution abatement plans when problems occur. 
Because most localities provide no formal training for board members, and 
because membership on these boards turns over with some frequency, expertise in 
watershed quality issues can vary widely over time and among cities and towns. 
<p>

<b>Sea Grant Expert Source:</b> Pamela M. Pogue, Marine Research Associate with 
Rhode 
Island Sea Grant.  Pogue holds a master's degree in marine affairs from the 
University of Rhode Island and a B.A. degree in government and economics from 
Georgetown University. She has been associated with the University of Rhode 
Island's Coastal Resources Center since 1988 and has had experience as an 
assistant town planner for the town of East Greenwich, RI. <p>

<b>A Possible Solution:</b> Developing a means of educating municipal 
board members in 
watershed issues is a concern of Rhode Island Sea Grant. It has developed two 
successful training programs in the past year and has received funding for a 
third project.  The programs' broad purposes are to provide board members with a
fundamental understanding of watershed issues and how they may relate to 
development and regulatory processes.  The programs have as main goals to assist
volunteer board and commission members in honing skills needed to: 1) make land 
use decisions which take into account potential impacts on the watershed; 2) to 
develop a working relationship among the memberships of boards and commissions 
within a watershed to enhance coordination and communications for sustainable 
development of the watershed's ecosystems; and 3) to promote decision-making 
which balances economic opportunities and environmental well-being. Each 
training program is customized for the locality, and uses a case study approach 
to illustrate successful examples of planning and policy processes, and the 
application of management tools and techniques. Lectures by regional experts and
field trips are also part of the sessions.  Among the topics that are addressed 
in the sessions are such basics as an introduction to watershed land use and 
water quality; local wastewater and storm water management processes and 
principles; planning for natural disasters; management of natural resources such
as coastal beaches; how to use and interpret impacts of development using modern
technological tools such as geographic information systems; the value and 
functions of wetlands; and how to prepare policy decisions that will hold up in 
court.  The importance of these educational efforts is explained by Rhode Island
Sea Grant's Pamela Pogue who points outs that "the guardians of clean waters and
judicious development are local officials who must make sure their communities 
follow state regulations and formulate local rules. Ineffective regulations 
threaten the coastline, rivers and streams."<p>

<h3>A SEA GRANT SPOTLIGHT ON SOLUTIONS:<br>
 COASTAL EROSION & BUILDING SETBACKS</h3>
</center>


<b>The Issue:</b>  Cost-effective management of chronic, long-term 
coastal erosion.  <p>

<b>Background / Overview:</b>  Engineering solutions, 
such as shoreline hardening 
through use of sea walls or sandtraps such as groins and breakwaters, can 
protect coastal property, but usually at high costs to both property owners and 
taxpayers. Unwanted side effects often result: loss of recreational beaches 
and/or accelerated erosion of adjoining property.  Beach nourishment has fewer 
side effects but requires a commitment to replace sand every few years or after 
major storms. Costs can be even higher, and usually are a public expense.<p>

Another approach is adoption of oceanfront setbacks - requiring building 
construction to be a certain number of feet behind the ocean shoreline based on 
an erosion-rate formula in an effort to minimize erosion threats. Currently 20 
coastal states have adopted shoreline setbacks and 10 of them - including North 
Carolina and Florida - base their setbacks on the long-term erosion rate.  The 
Committee on Coastal Erosion Zone Management of the National Academy of Sciences
has recommended similar setbacks for all U.S. coastlines. Additionally several 
states - North Carolina and Florida among them - have further prohibited most 
engineering solutions except for beach nourishment.  With the cost of beach 
nourishment deemed unacceptable, shoreline setbacks and relocation of 
erosion-threatened buildings are the only options.  The intent is to avoid the 
problem initially and retreat from erosion as it threatens the building.<p>

<b>A Sea Grant Expert Source:</b>  Spencer M. Rogers, Coastal Construction 
and Erosion 
Specialist with the North Carolina Sea Grant Marine Advisory Service. A civil 
engineer, Rogers has been dealing with issues of coastal hazards and in 
particular erosion issues for a good number of years. He has testified before 
Congress on erosion issues and served as a consultant to FEMA as well.  In 
addition to erosion issues, Rogers can discuss hurricane-resistant construction,
in particular the importance of using non-corrosive hurricane clips and other 
connecting material in coastal construction, low cost changes that could 
significantly reduce storm-induced insurance losses.<p>

<b>A Possible Solution:</b> Rogers says that studies show that the 
chances of erosion 
reaching a building located on a 30-year erosion setback is 91 percent and that 
increases to 97 percent when minimal standards of 10-year erosion rates are 
allowed.  Given that the average building life is 70-years, most new buildings 
along a coast can expect to be threatened or moved several times.  Rogers 
recommends that setback standards be substantially increased to reduce the risk 
of long-term erosion impacting coastal structures. He notes that flood plains 
are defined by "100-year" floods and he recommends similar "100-year" erosion 
rate standards be adopted as setback requirements. He notes that most property 
owners tend to build no farther back from the shoreline than the minimum setback
requirements under the assumption that "if the state said it could be built 
here, it must be safe." Notes Rogers, "Clearly a low standard such as a 30-year 
setback may delay, but it does not eliminate the long-term erosion problem." 
<P>

Effective placement of a structure when constructed should make full use of the 
available setback space, thereby postponing the threat and allowing the 
structure the longest use of the lot before moving it would become necessary. 
"In areas where relocation is the planned response to long-term erosion, setback
standards would be more effective if the distances were increased to better 
reflect the expected lifetime of the building and the severity of the risk," 
says Rogers.  He points out that current setbacks in many coastal communities 
differ between private homes and commercial structures requiring commercial 
structures over 5,000 square feet be setback often twice as far as a single 
family dwelling.  At the same time he notes that the historical size of coastal 
structures has been increasing and that many single family coastal homes are now
larger than the 5,000-square foot commercial structure standard, often covering 
as much as 14,000 square feet.

<h3>A SEA GRANT SPOTLIGHT ON SOLUTIONS:<br>
 IMPROVING MINORITY MARINE SCIENCE EDUCATION 
TEACHING SKILLS</h3>

<b>The Issue:</b> Improving the quality and quantity of marine education at the 
elementary and middle school levels.  <p>

<b>Background / Overview:</b> Environmental education is a most 
important element 
affecting people's attitudes and behavior towards coastal resources. Science 
literacy among students in public schools has come under increased scrutiny and 
past attempts to improve science teaching have faltered because they did not 
address the scientific insecurities of teachers, particularly in primary 
schools.  Improving the quality and quantity of oceanographic science taught at 
the elementary and middle school levels is an important avenue for changing 
attitudes and increasing knowledge about the coastal environment, the level of 
environmental stewardship, and the understanding of scientific principles. 
Studies have shown that too few elementary and middle school teachers are 
comfortable or capable of teaching science. Also minority groups in the United 
States represent a part of the population which is basically an untapped 
audience for information of this nature.  Most often, these educators tend not 
to have studied science in obtaining their teaching credentials and thus need to
be encouraged and instructed in teaching science.<p>

<b>Sea Grant Expert Sources:</b> <br>
 Susan E. Yoder, Marine Advisory 
Leader, University of
Southern California Sea Grant Marine Advisory Service. Yoder holds a Ph.D. in 
biological sciences from University of California at Irvine and has been 
involved in teaching biological sciences at all levels for over 20 years.  She 
currently teaches at the collegiate level and has been the coordinator of USC 
Project Pathfinder efforts as well as special urban education outreach efforts 
by USC Sea Grant aimed at both English and Spanish speaking children. <p>

Sharon H. Walker, Marine Science Education Specialist with the 
Mississippi-Alabama Sea Grant Consortium.  Walker holds a Ph.D. in science 
education from the University of Southern Mississippi and has been active in 
teaching marine science for a number of years.  Her focus is on both informal 
and precollege environmental education issues.  She currently teaches education 
courses on the collegiate level and serves as Administrator of the J.L. Scott 
Marine Education Center and Aquarium at the Gulf Coast Research Laboratory in 
Ocean Springs, Mississippi.<p>

<b>A Possible Solution:</b>  Operation Pathfinder is a joint 
effort of the National Sea
Grant College Program, NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, NOAA's
International Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service, the Office
of Naval Research, the Naval Oceanography and Meteorology Command, and the U.S. 
Department of Interior's Office of Territorial and International Affairs.  
Operation Pathfinder is a 12-day summer course for teachers and presents an 
introduction to oceanographic and coastal processes for teachers of 
predominantly minority students. Offered at six sites around the United States, 
the program seeks improved teaching skills; increased information about the 
marine environment and human issues related to it; increased access to data and 
network information through emerging technologies; and ultimately potential for 
cultural diversity in marine careers.  The program provides hands on experience 
in applying marine and aquatic concepts in teaching a marine science curriculum 
both in the classroom and on the water. Scholarship stipends are provided 
annually to approximately 100 kindergarten through ninth grade minority teacher 
to attend a Pathfinder course.<p>

<h4>
What is the Importance for Earth Day 25 Years After its Start?</h4>

"Earth Day is significant, but I would like it to become as significant as Christmas and it is nowhere near that.  The positive thing of Earth Day is the focus on our global ecosystem and the relationship of humanity within that system.  The negative aspect is that people think that paying attention on just one day is sufficient. We need to make every day Earth Day - yes that is a slogan, but it is true.  Earth Day's biggest importance lies as a symbolic endeavor."
 --- <b>Rick Steiner, Alaska Sea Grant Marine Advsiory Agent</b><p>

"Earth Day is a vital anniversary to remember.  It's the one day of the year that focuses national attention on
our environment." ---  
<b>Bill Seaman, Associate Director, Florida Sea Grant</b>

"We were hoping it was going to be a time where we could look back at what we 
have accomplished, and then look ahead and see where we needed to go.  Now we 
are in a situation where many of the gains made through Earth Day are 
potentially going to be lost or rolled back by changes in Congress. Awareness 
and public concern are more important than ever at this time because of the 
debate concerning the renewal of the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species
 Act, The Clean Air Act, and other environmental laws that resulted in from 
initial Earth Day concerns 25 years ago." ---  
<b>Bruce Miller, Associate Director for Extension, Hawaii Sea Grant</b>

"Earth Day is needed now more than ever. The world we live in is more complex. 
It is much easier to loose touch with our natural heritage.  We have to 
maintain ties to the planet's ecosystem - to give us a sense of balance and to 
survive." --- 
<b>Mike McDonald, Director, Minnesota Sea Grant</b><p>

"Earth Day began as a grassroots celebration, but now it's a lot of hype. I 
would like to see Earth Day return to its beginnings - to an examination of 
what we can do in our own backyards to keep our environment healthy.  It 
should be a celebration of environmental education in schools, small towns and 
parks.  The enthusiasm should swell from the people of this country, not from 
Madison Avenue or Washington D.C." --- 
<b>Lundie Spence, Education Specialist, North Carolina Sea Grant</b><p>


<h4>HOW RELEVANT IS EARTH DAY? </h4>
"Earth Day is important as a symbolic endeavor. Because of it there has been 
some improvement in the environmental quality of the air and water, but no 
one should be so naive as to believe that the overall global environment has 
really improved over the past quarter century. Earth Day has helped people 
feel good about small things like recycling, but that is like rearranging 
the deck chairs on the Titanic. Population continues to skyrocket, per capita 
consumption of energy and material continues to go up and the disparity 
between rich and poor continues to grow.  In that sense I don't see how one 
can say Earth Day has made things better than they were 25 years ago.  I 
am a big supporter of Earth Day, but we need a radical shift in values to do 
anything substantive, and while Earth Day is a baby step in that direction, 
I'm not sure it is probable we will take the steps we truly need 
to make." --- 
<b>Rick Steiner, Alaska Sea Grant Marine Advsiory Agent</b><p>

"Of course it's relevant.  It symbolizes a whole cultural change in thinking 
about the individual's role in protecting the environment." --- 
<b>Bill Seaman, Associate Director, Florida Sea Grant</b><p>

"Earth Day in the '90s continues to wake us up and make us think about the 
impacts of our actions today on future generations. We must continue the 
progress made in restoring and protecting the degraded Great Lakes ecosystem. 
We must continue to educate citizens, industries, business, and government in 
the Lake Michigan region on effective management of the resources of this 
ecosystem and others like it." --- 
<b>Phil Pope, Director, Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant</b><p>

"On the first Earth Day, Lake Michigan was a mess, Lake Erie was a mess.  
Eagles had thin eggshells due to DDT.  Their survival was in jeopardy. Through 
Earth Day, people have learned that when working in concert they can make a 
significant difference.  The changes we've made have greatly improved the 
quality of life for our children and future generations." --- 
<b>Mike McDonald, Director, Minnesota Sea Grant</b><p>

<h4>
What is the Most Important Message that can be Delivered on Earth Day, 1995?
</h4>
 "We need to collectively redefine our notions of prosperity - redefine it 
to include the ecosystem. What I personally witnessed in the Exxon Valdez oil 
spill and the development of the Prudhoe Bay oil fields shows the tremendous 
ecological impact that development can have and the need for extraordinary 
consideration of the ecological impacts of such development.  People need to 
take a broader, less self-centered view of such projects." --- 
<b>Rick Steiner, Alaska Sea Grant Marine Advsiory Agent</b><p>

"Think about why we consume so much.  Do we really need to be 'owned' by 
our possessions and a lifestyle that consumes so many resources?" --- 
<b>Bill Seaman, Associate Director, Florida Sea Grant</b><P>

"One message I would send to the American public is to stand up and be 
counted as a voice for the environment, starting with a letter to the 
House of Representatives and two to the Senate. Those of us who have been 
caring for many Earth Days now are wondering when the confident empowered 
folks will wake up to the immediate danger posed by issues now being 
considered in the Congress, the measures that would weaken the laws that 
protect us as well as the natural system.  We can only hope that individually 
concerned citizens are using their empowerment to tell their elected 
representatives how they stand so that our laws for the environment will 
be strengthened, not weakened." --- 
<b>Rosanne Fortner, Ohio Sea Grant Education Coordinator</b><p>

<h4>
What Were You Doing on the First Earth Day in 1970?
</h4>
"In 1970, I was president of the Environmental Action Group at the University 
of Florida and I organized the first Earth
Day celebration held on the campus."  --- 
<b>Bill Seaman, Associate Director, Florida Sea Grant.</b><p>

"I was picking up Ralph Nader, Stewart Udahl and Victor Yanacone (early 
environmental lawyer) at the airport and serving as coordinator of the 
New England Earth Day activities at the University of New Hampshire.  Earth 
Day arose out of the college campus activism. There was a book called "The 
Environmental Handbook" that was compiled by Garrett De Bell that consisted 
of a series of essays that led to teach-in type activities.  It was really a 
conscious raising event. I remember people bring thousands of aluminum and tin cans to the center of the hockey rink in a statement on litter and the need for recycling. It was so different in that in 1970 we were focusing on individual actions, whereas today, here in Hawaii we are trying to promote group, community actions towards a sustainable community."  ---  
<B>Bruce Miller, Associate Director for Extension, Hawaii Sea Grant</b><P>



"On the first Earth Day I was teaching 7th grade science classes in Virginia.  We had a textbook that included a section called "IS LAKE ERIE DEAD?" It had a number of simple databases for the students to investigate, and the reasonable 
conclusion was that indeed Lake Erie was not dead at all!  Too bad Johnny Carson and the others who wagged about demise didn't know the truth.  Since just a little time after that I have been the Ohio Sea Grant Education Coordinator, with a mission of teaching people about the magnificence that is the Great Lakes.  Little did I know at that time where the Lake Erie part of the 7th grade science book would lead me!" --- 
<b>Rosanne Fortner, Ohio Sea Grant Education Coordinator</b><P>

"Earth Day is a time to tally our environmental scorecard. Where do we stand on the environmental quality of our estuaries, our groundwater, our fisheries, our national forest and so on.  It is a time for each person to consider a list of resolutions for the environment which will benefit themselves and their children." --- 
<B>Lundie Spence, Education Specialist, North Carolina Sea Grant</b><p>

<h3>TRADE BARRIERS LIFTED ON HAGFISH EXPORTS TO KOREA<br>
Earnings of Developing New England Fishery Expected To Double</h3>
</center>
 
<b>OVERVIEW - Troublesome By-Catch Transformed Into Valued Species</b><br>
"Worthless" was the term just two years ago. Today, the slime eel or hagfish 
is a rapidly growing fishery in New 
England where earnings nearly tripled in just one year, providing an 
alternative source of income in an area severely 
depressed by the restriction of traditional fisheries. Hagfish are valued 
for their skins, which are processed into eelskin 
leather boots, bags, wallets and other products in Korea. Additionally, 
Koreans consume nearly 5 million pounds of 
hagfish meat each year, but until now American producers were excluded from 
this market due to trade restrictions. 
The meat of hagfish sent to Korea for processing into eelskin leather products 
was either discarded, turned into 
fertilizer, or sold on the blackmarket. The removal of these trade restrictions 
this past January has the potential to boost 
the earnings of the New England fishery by at least $1.5 million this 
year, according to estimates by New England 
processors.<p>

<b>NEW FISHERY PIONEERED IN 1993 - Doubles In One Year</b><br>
Prior to 1993, fishermen along the Eastern seaboard thought of slime eels as 
worthless, disgusting pests with a nasty 
habit of eating their catch from the inside out. At that time, with the help 
of Maine / New Hampshire Sea Grant 
scientists, some New England fishermen began to tap a growing market for 
hagfish skins in Korea, where overfishing 
had caused the Asian stocks to collapse. The Koreans tan the eelskins and 
send them to China, where they are stitched 
into wallets, belts, and other leather products. The primary market for these 
products is back in the United States, at 
upscale department stores like Macy's. During the late 1980's Korea exported 
eelskin leather products worth about $80 
million per year. But by 1992, exports had dropped to around $20 million. 
The Korean industry was desperate for a new 
source of high quality skins, and these were found in the George's Bank 
fishery off the coast of New England. The 
result was a new fishery whose growth has more than doubled 
in two years as evidenced by an jump in earnings from 
$450,000 in 1993 to well over $1 million in 1994.<p>

<h4>FISHERY FOCUSED IN MASSACHUSETTS, MAINE AND NEW HAMPSHIRE </h4>
The new fishery is centered around the ports of Gloucester, MA, 
Portsmouth, NH, and Stonington, ME, according to 
George Nardi, a program director for the New England Fisheries Development Association. These ports are equipped 
with the freezing and packing facilities required to send the frozen product to Korea, where most of the skinning, 
tanning and meat processing is still being done. At any given time last year, anywhere from three to thirteen vessels 
were fishing for hagfish, Nardi said. <p>

<b>ECONOMIC IMPACT BOOSTED</b> - Local Processor Establishing Plant, Plans 
Expansion
A Korean businessman, K. H. Cho, has established a hagfish processing company, 
the New England Eel Processor, 
Inc., in Gloucester and is currently test-marketing hagfish meat in ethnic 
groceries in New York and Los Angeles, as 
well as exploring the possibility of sending the skins to upstate New York for 
tanning. The company then plans to send 
the tanned skins directly to China for stitching into final products. <p>

Cho says that between March and December of 1994 the company paid fishermen 
$460,000 for over 1 million pounds 
of hagfish and spent another $230,000 to freeze, pack and ship the fish 
to Korea. On average, a crew of two on a forty-
foot boat can catch a container-full of hagfish (about 45,000 pounds) in 
a week, earning $20,000 to $22,000 per 
container load, he said. This year, Cho said he expects to ship 3.3 million 
pounds of hagfish in the form of 40-50 
containers of whole hagfish, plus 12 containers of processed hagfish 
meat and skins. The result: a boost of well over $2 
million to the New England economy.     <p>

<b>STRATEGIES FOR THE FUTURE</b> - Science & Supply Guidelines, Not Demand 
Driven
After the George's Bank fisheries were closed down last fall, the search 
for alternative fisheries and new survival 
strategies has become essential for New England's fishermen, says 
Maine / New Hampshire Sea Grant Extension 
Agent Rollie Barnaby. However, Barnaby cautions that the hagfish fishery 
must be developed in a sustainable way. 
"The goal of the project is to have science and supply, rather than demand, 
guide the development of the fishery."  
Research is being done to learn about the lifecycle of the hagfish and 
determine the extent of exploitable stocks. The 
mud banks in which hagfish thrive actually extend from Newfoundland to as 
far south as the Carolinas, giving the 
fishery a large potential for growth. Efforts are also underway to develop 
domestic markets for value-added hagfish 
products, and train the local workforce necessary to process the hagfish meat 
and skins. Cho says he is eager to bring 
an expert skinner form Korea to train a minimum of ten full-time 
skinners for his company.

<h3>
Recreational Boating Provides $1 Billion Impact in Maryland</h3>



ANNAPOLIS, MD. (March 6)  Maryland recreational boating expenditures total $1.01 billion annually, providing a net economic boost of over $980 million annually to the State of Maryland according to the results of a Maryland Sea Grant study scheduled for release this morning in Annapolis at the 17th Annual Maryland Marine Trades Conference.  <p>


Coordinated by Douglas W. Lipton, Director of the University of Maryland Sea Grant College Extension Program, the report finds that, on average, boaters of all classes each contribute $5,136 annually to the state economic output.  Those expenditures generate over 18,000 full-time equivalent jobs in the Maryland economy, and 34 percent of the expenditures result in actual wage payments and compensation to Maryland residents. <p>

Maryland state and county governments benefit as well with sizable tax revenues from the recreational boating expenditures.  The state and local income tax generated is $4.3 million, an amount that is in addition to an estimated $3 million in taxes paid directly by the boaters themselves.  This tax revenue does not count state excise taxes on boat sales and local slip taxes, and sizeable business income tax.<p>

Funded through the cooperative efforts of the Maryland Boating Administration, Maryland Department of Natural Resources, and the Marine Trades Association of Maryland, the study's aim was to evaluate the spending by boaters, and how that spending affects both the state economy and Maryland businesses, from marine-related firms such as marinas and boat dealers to restaurants and service establishments. Support for the analysis was also provided by the Maryland Sea Grant College Program and the University of Maryland Cooperative Extension Service.<p>


Overall boaters spend over $1 billion annually in boating activities.  The study breaks those activities into three main areas: $438 million spent on boating trips for items such as boat fuel, food and lodging, fishing supplies, clothing and equipment; $428 million spent on boating-related expenditures such as slip fees and maintenance; and $144.5 million spent in the purchase of either new or brokered used boats.<p>

The study focuses strictly on the activities of registered and documented private recreational boats in Maryland during the summers of 1993 and 1994, and does not take into account the additional impact that transient boaters and others who spend money with Maryland marine trade industries likely have. Thus a boater registered in Delaware who spends most of the time boating on the Chesapeake Bay is not included in the report's results.  With Maryland being a major destination for boaters registered in other states, there is a significant amount of "out-of-state" expenditures not captured in the study. Additionally it does not include the economic impact of charter boat activity in Maryland such as fishing charters or tourist boat excursions.<p>

Lipton says "The study demonstrates that the restoration and protection of the Chesapeake Bay has important economic implications.  A degraded Bay means less boating, less income and less employment generated in the region.  The study also shows that boater spending has a wide impact both geographically, and across industries.  When boating is impacted, negatively or positively, there are concurrent impacts across the economy."<P>

Lipton says that similar studies conducted in Florida, Texas and Seattle areas have like results. He also notes that the boating industry is showing signs of rebounding from a deep recession in the early 1990's which means good news for Maryland's economy.  Lipton plans on updating the Maryland study annually based on new figures on boating registrations and price inflation.<p>

Based on 190,436 registered and documented boats in Maryland in 1993, the analysis by the Maryland Sea Grant Extension Program employed detailed survey questionnaires of boaters. The Department of Natural Resources Boating Administration and the Marine Trades Association of Maryland assisted in the design and sample selection of the survey. The University of Maryland Survey Research Center conducted the survey. <p>

Survey responses provided measures of expenditures and spending patterns (i.e., food and lodging, fishing supplies, boat fuel, transportation) by owners of trailered powerboats, in-water powerboats and sailboats. The average expenditures for each class of boat was then multiplied by the number of  registered boats of that class.  In 1993, the registered and documented boats were as follows:  trailered powerboats: 100,087;  in-water powerboats   60,021; and sailboats 30,328. 
<p>


To determine the economic activity generated by the recreational boating industry, an impact analysis planning (IMPLAN) model - a national input/output model - was used to assess how expenditures generated by the recreational boating industry affected various aspects of the state economy, for instance, their affect on income and jobs.<p>
    
The following summarizes boater expenditures and the resulting economic 
activity.<br>
<ul>
<li>  Spending related to recreational boating in 1993 totaled $1.01 billion.

Economic Activity (based on IMPLAN model)
<ul>
<li>  Over $356 million in total personal income (includes wages) was attributable  to spending by recreational boaters.

<li>  Total income from boater spending (the sum of business profits, proprietor  income and personal income) was $574 million. 

<li>  Of the $1.01 billion in expenditures by recreation boaters, approximately 34%  results in wages and compensation to Maryland employees.

<li>  Each recreational boater accounted for an average contribution of $5,136 to  the state economic output.

<li>  Total contribution to economic output in Maryland was approximately $980 million. Economic output is the value that adjusts boater expenditures ($1.01 billion) for  (1) dollars that leave the state because goods are imported and (2) multiplier factors that result from each dollar spent.

<li>  Over 18,000 full-time equivalent jobs in all sectors of economy can be attributed to the spending by Maryland-registered recreational boaters.

<li> Every 10.5 registered or documented boats is equivalent to one job.

<h4>ARTIFICIAL REEFS AIM TO IMPROVE NARRAGANSETT BAY 
LOBSTER FISHERY</h4>
Rhode Island Sea Grant researcher Kathleen Castro and
her colleagues are teaming up with the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to
increase lobster populations in Narragansett Bay.
<br>
The researchers have installed six cobblestone reefs
in Dutch Harbor, near Jamestown, RI, in hopes of
creating protective habitat, improving the bay's
lobster fishery and compensating the people of Rhode
Island and the lobster industry for injury resulting
from the 1989 World Prodigy oil spill.  The spill
soaked 120 square miles of Narragansett Bay and Rhode
Island Sound with more than 290 thousand gallons of
home heating oil during a peak spawning period for
fish and shellfish.<br>
The key to success in the Dutch Island Harbor
restoration is whether lobsters will call the
artificial habitat home.  To find out, Castro and her
colleagues will begin "seeding" three of the reefs
with hatchery-raised juvenile lobsters this spring.
<br>
According to Castro, "This experiment will look at the
effect of enhancement on the lobster population to
learn whether hatchery lobsters actually increase the
population or redistribute it."  The juveniles will be
tagged with tiny wires implanted in their abdomens so
that the scientists can track their survival and
growth.  The biologists will also monitor how many
wild lobsters take up residence on the six reefs.
Lobster harvests from the new reefs could begin within
five years when the stocked lobsters reach
legal size. If the experiment shows that there is a
benefit to adding hatchery-raised lobsters,  then this
approach could help in future restoration projects
such as those related to Rhode Island's 1996 North
Cape oil spill, noted Castro.<br>

<h4>RESEARCHERS WORK TO REDUCE COMMERCIAL FISHING 
BYCATCH WASTE</h4>
 If an unwanted fish is thrown back into the water,
will it live to be caught another day?  That is what
Washington Sea Grant Program researcher Ellen Pikitch
is trying to determine as part of her work to reduce
waste associated with commercial fishing bycatch, the
discard of  unwanted fish.<br>

Currently, Pikitch and her colleagues are studying the
survival of Pacific halibut that have been caught in
trawl nets and then discarded.  Trawl-caught halibut
are examined and tagged, then  placed in an underwater
cage for several days.  Researchers then bring up the
cages to see which fish survived, quantifying just how
much injury a halibut can sustain and live.<br>

This is a crucial multi-million dollar question in
North Pacific fisheries.  Once discards reach certain
pre-set levels, most groundfish fleets are barred from
further fishing, even if they have not yet caught the
entire quota of their target species. During 1996,
North Pacific trawlers discarded about 12.5 million
pounds of juvenile and adult halibut worth
approximately $30 to $35 million.<br>

Pikitch's research may increase the precision of
habitat mortality data, which is used to determine
when trawlers meet or exceed halibut bycatch limits.
The project may also help trawlers improve handling
and fishing techniques so that more halibut caught as
bycatch survive.<br>

Preliminary results indicate that halibut are most
likely to survive if they spent a short time in the
net and are returned to the water within 20 minutes.
Pikitch's methods for calculating mortality can be
transferred to other fisheries and are now being used
on the West Coast to help biologists estimate the
bycatch mortality of trawl-caught black cod.<br>

<h4>DIVING INTO MARINE SCIENCE:  HANDS-ON EDUCATION 
REACHES URBAN KIDS</h4>
 Nestled among paper kelp forests and painted sea
creatures, students are being transformed from
otherwise typical fourth and fifth graders to "Island
Explorers."  The students are part of a year-long
marine science education pilot program called Island
Explorers, a collaboration of The University of
Southern California Sea Grant and Foshay Learning
Center of Los Angeles.<br>

Through Island Explorers, about 70 children are being
introduced to the fundamentals of marine science
though hands-on activities, experiments and research
targeted at the ecosystems of San Pedro Channel and
Catalina Island.<br>

Phyllis Grifman, USC Sea Grant's Assistant Director
for Outreach says the Island Explorers program is a
perfect way for USC Sea Grant to reach out to the
community.  Sea Grant has been developing marine
education curriculum since the early 1980s, but Island
Explorers will provide a more focused curriculum for
urban children in Southern California.<br>

"Our program motto  is the Urban Ocean," Grifman said.
"Considering USC Sea Grant's urban ocean focus, our
location near downtown Los Angeles and our experience
teaching science education, we are well prepared to
develop science education for urban kids."<br>

Grifman hopes that the program will ultimately extend
to other classes and schools in Southern California and
has been working to produce a computer and video-based
curriculum using content from the Island Explorers
program.<br>

<h4>RECREATIONAL BOATING IN MARYLAND:  SMALL BOAT MARKET GROWS</h4>
Total spending by Maryland's recreational boaters increased by over
$70 million over the last two years to an aggregate of $1.1 billion in 
1995, according to a reportcoordinated by Doug Lipton, Director of the 
Maryland Sea Grant Extension Program.  Most of this spending increase 
is attributed to greater sales by licensed boat dealers, with the 
remainder due to increased spending in other marine-related businesses. 
Lipton found that the majority of this growth is in the small, 
trailered powerboats and personal watercraft (PWC) categories.  Between 
1993 and 1995, the number of PWC's increased by 43%, while the number 
of in-water powerboats and sailboats declined by 7.7%.  Lipton feels 
that this trend is important to the impact of recreational boating on 
Maryland's economy since the spending patterns of PWC owners often 
result in less overall contribution to economic activity than spending 
by larger boat owners. The economic impact has not increased greatly 
because growth is occurring in the smaller boat categories which 
require less marine trades industry support.  According to Lipton, 
"Personal and trailered watercraft are generally associated with 
spending outside of the boating and marine sectors.  Therefore, even 
though total spending is up, the impact is not reflected throughout the 
boating economy."  Using information from this study, the Maryland 
boating industry can identify steps that they can take to stimulate 
growth in the large boat category, which can have a greater impact on 
the marine industry.<br>

<h4>BIRDS IN THE BAYOU:  "OPERATION QUACKBACK" A SUCCESS IN LOUISIANA</h4>
In an attempt to provide winter habitat for migratory ducks, geese and other
birds, farmers in Louisiana have undertaken an important mission.  In 
1993, the Vermilion Parish Rice Growers Association along with the 
local Farm Bureau Office and Cooperative Extension Service initiated 
"Operation Quackback."  The voluntary program encourages farmers to 
hold rainwater on their rice fields or pump water from irrigation 
canals during the non-growing season to provide wetland habitat for 
waterfowl, shorebirds, wading birds, and other wildlife.  Last year, 
Quackback was adopted statewide in Louisiana to include over 60,000 
acres of habitat.  In return, the birds help the farmers prepare the 
fields for the next growing season by feeding on rice stubble, red rice 
and other weed seeds.   Sea Grant Marine Advisory Agent, Mark Shirley 
advises farmers on how to manipulate rice fields for crawfish 
aquaculture and wildlife management.  "Farmers are good stewards of 
their land," says Shirley.  "Operation Quackback is a voluntary program 
whereby progressive, conservation-minded farmers flood their fields to 
provide wetland habitat."  Shallow water habitat is essential to 
populations of wintering waterfowl and many other species of wildlife.  
Operation Quackback provides the additional habitat to nurture these 
migratory species.<br>

<h4>HIGH-TECH TAGGING MAY HELP PRESERVE SHRIMP HABITAT</h4>
A Georgia Sea Grant researcher hopes that a new high-tech method of tagging white
shrimp will allow scientists to learn how they move within coastal
marshes and determine which areas favor their survival and growth to 
adulthood.  "We don't know much about site differences in the estuaries 
and the growth rate and mortality of shrimp within estuaries," says Ron 
Kneib, a Georgia Sea Grant biologist.  "Finding out more could be 
important to those who make the rules and regulations about where and 
when shrimp can be harvested."  Kneib and his colleagues use two 
tagging methods to track shrimp:  injected non-toxic fluorescent 
material and a tiny coded microwire tag implanted in the tail of the 
shrimp.  The dye marker allows general area identification, the wire 
more specific information including growth rate and exactly where the 
shrimp was released.  One series of questions scientists hope the 
tagging will answer is how different drainage areas, with different 
environmental characteristics such as salinity and water quality, 
impact shrimp life.  The study has important implications for the 
coastal areas of the Southeast.  Management and regulatory 
agencies are facing increasing pressures to develop practices and laws
that balance coastal development with the need to ensure the 
preservation and fair allocation of the limited resources that 
estuaries produce.  Kneib hopes his project will provide a 
scientifically defensible basis for decision making to achieve a 
sustainable balance between coastal development  and a healthy habitat 
allowing continued production of white shrimp.<br>

<h4>HOLIDAY VACATIONS CAN BE MARRED BY "MAL DE MER"</h4>
Cruising away to a warmer clime this holiday season?  Before your
boat leaves the harbor, be sure that you're aware of an unpleasant,
yet realistic aspect of life on the ocean ( seasickness.  Any time
the human body is put into motion, other than on foot, motion
sickness can be the result.  The problem is one of a sensory
mismatch in the brain ( the inner ear sends out messages about body
position and movement that contradict information relayed by the
eyes.  Preventing and treating seasickness begins with adapting to
your new environment.  Here are some tips for cruisers from MIT Sea
Grant Ocean Engineering researcher, Charles Mazel:  "If you want to
use over-the-counter medications, it is a good idea to try them on
land to see if you experience any side effects ( consult your
physician if you are taking any other medications.  Eat and drink
in moderation ( don't consume things that you would normally make
you sick on land.  If feeling queasy on board, find a spot with
fresh air and a view of the horizon."  Those chartering smaller
boats may be at greater risk for seasickness, but Mazel points out
that the larger cruise ships are carefully designed to provide "a
stable ride."  If you should become seasick, drink fluids to avoid
dehydration.  Finally, says Mazel, "Don't let worry get in the way
of a great time."<br>

<h4>SKATING ON THIN ICE - UNPREPARED OUTDOOR ENTHUSIASTS
RISK HYPOTHERMIA</h4>
If sledding, skiing, ice skating, or other outdoor activities are
part of your plans this holiday season, be aware of a potentially
severe, cold-weather hazard ( hypothermia.  Endangering hunters,
fishermen, hikers or motorists stranded in blizzards, hypothermia
can afflict anyone unprepared for cold weather or cold water.
Hypothermia is a gradual lowering of body temperature and can lead
to death if left unchecked.  Symptoms are a blue appearance,
violent shivering, muscle spasms, loss of arm and leg control,
mental disorientation, and eventually loss of consciousness.  A
person's resistance to hypothermia depends on a number of factors
including length of exposure, clothing worn, nutrition and health,
and whether one has been smoking or drinking alcohol, notes John
McKinney, Michigan Sea Grant Agent.  "Prevention is the best
medicine," says McKinney.  "Wear layers of clothing, rather than a
single, heavy garment, a head garment (since 50 percent of heat
loss occurs there), and maintain proper nutrition and
conditioning."  In extreme conditions, wearing a scarf or mask over
the face will prevent heat loss and allow air to be warmed before
inhaling.  Mittens generally retain heat better than gloves.
Choose footwear that is well-insulated and waterproof.  Although
all hypothermia victims should be seen by a physician, McKinney
stresses the importance of immediate, in-the-field first aid.
"First, get the victim into warm, dry shelter.  Rewarming the
victim's body with hot packs, warm baths, mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation or other warm bodies can be crucial to preventing the
deepening of the hypothermia."<br>

<h4>CELEBRATING THE HOLIDAYS (SAFELY) WITH SEAFOOD</h4>
The holidays are a traditional time for celebrating and
entertaining with seafood.  Oysters, smoked salmon, crabmeat, and
shrimp are a few items on the consumer's shopping list this time of
year.  Many cooks are likely to find themselves feeling rushed and
pressured by the demands of the holiday season, so what better time
to prepare a quick-cooking, low-fat seafood dish.  However, it is
important to keep in mind several steps to insure the proper
handling and preparation of fish and shellfish.  According to Doris
Hicks, Delaware Sea Grant Seafood Specialist, "The most common
food-borne illnesses are caused by a combination of bacteria
naturally in our environment and food handling errors made in
commercial settings or at home."  Hicks suggests these tips for
holiday cooks:  "Keep cooking area, utensils and hands clean.  Raw
and cooked seafood should be kept away from each other to prevent
cross-contamination.  Keep seafood cold, and use it quickly.  Fresh
fish should be used within two days of purchase; for smoked fish
store no longer than four or five days.  The shelf life of
shellfish varies, however, from as long as ten days for oysters in
the shell to one day for squid."  Hicks notes that when preparing
for a buffet, small platters for replenishing the serving table
(prepared ahead and stored in the refrigerator or kept warm in the
oven) are safer than adding to a food platter that has already been
out on the table.  In addition, any foods that have been held at
room temperature for more than two hours should be discarded.<br>

<H4>NEW TECHNOLOGY ENHANCES UNDERSTANDING OF COASTAL POLLUTION</H4>

<P>Armed with state-of-the-art navigational equipment, an unusual fleet
of &quot;vessels&quot; is providing information critical to understanding
how pollutants move in California's coastal waters. Each &quot;craft&quot;
in this fleet is a &quot;drifter,&quot; an elegantly assembled floating
package of electronics housed in a case of plastic and fiberglass. The
role of the drifters is to record the positions of &quot;packets&quot;
of water over time as they move to and from nearshore waters. This movement
of water, called &quot;cross-shore&quot; flow, is sometimes present as
rip currents and undertow and it transports pollutants, larvae, nutrients
and sand. Realizing that cross-shore flow was only poorly understood, California
Sea Grant oceanographers, John Largier and Ron George designed a first-of-its-kind
drifter equipped with a high resolution differential global positioning
system (GPS). The drifter works by utilizing information from a network
of satellites orbiting the earth to accurately measure its position as
often as once a second ( ultimately providing a picture of current flow
over time. The advantage is that the measurement location is moving with
the water, much as an organism or pollutant would do. Largier sees great
potential for scientific, environmental, and commercial use of this new
drifter technology. The United States Navy has already funded deployment
of the drifters in San Diego Bay as part of an environmental research project.
In addition, there are plans to use to drifters to track dispersion of
pollutants in San Francisco Bay.<BR>

<H4>COMPUTER GRADING AIMS TO INSURE SAFETY, QUALITY OF SHRIMP</H4>

<P>With new regulations concerning the safety of the nation's seafood supply
slated to go into effect in December, 1997, Florida Sea Grant researcher
Murat Balaban is nearing completion of a new automated computer grading
system that determines the quality of shrimp. &quot;An objective, repeatable
measurement of quality is necessary because quality is directly related
to safety in seafood. The quality of shrimp can now be assured through
calculated and repeatable data,&quot; says Balaban. The system developed
automatically analyzes three criteria for freshness in shrimp: appearance,
ammonia levels (an indicator that shrimp are not fresh), and texture and
elasticity. All criteria for a batch of shrimp are calculated in less than
four minutes, including the number of shrimp per pound. An overall rating
is assigned, allowing the batch to be accepted or rejected. International
standards for measuring shrimp quality are important because about 70 percent
of the shrimp processed each year in the United States is imported, half
of that shrimp, entering through the Port of Miami. &quot;This automated
device will be a tremendous help in evaluating and regulating worldwide
standards for quality and safety of shrimp, and go a long way towards insuring
a safe, staple supply to the consumer,&quot; says Balaban.<BR>

<H4>PROTOZOA QUICKEN THE PACE OF OIL EATING BACTERIA</H4>

<P>Washington Sea Grant researcher, Evelyn Lessard has found that bacteria
digest oil five times more quickly if single-celled organisms called protozoa
are nearby. Because protozoa (a group of microorganisms that include blob-like
amoebas) eat pollution-consuming bacteria, some scientists thought that
eliminating them would increase rates of oil breakdown. &quot;But this
work has shown that protozoa are important,&quot; says Lessard. &quot;You
don't want to kill them. You want to encourage them to grow.&quot; Lessard
studies bioremediation, the use of microorganisms to clean up pollution.
She collects the protozoa from Eagle Harbor, a Washington state Superfund
site whose sediments have high concentrations of PAHs (polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons), toxic chemicals found in creosote, fuel oil and other substances.
One of her primary goals is to learn exactly what protozoa do to make bacteria
eat hydrocarbons faster. Preliminary findings show that protozoa may act
as a form of population control, grazing bacteria down to their most efficient
level or they may fertilize the bacteria, providing them with nitrogen,
a nutrient bacteria need to digest hydrocarbons. In addition, the movements
of the protozoa may aerate the bay sediments in much the same way that
earthworms aerate soil. Protozoa may also digest oil themselves. Although
Lessard is studying organisms from salt water environments, her work may
be of use to bioremediation technicians working on land and in fresh water.
Learning the best ways to encourage protozoan growth can help speed the
clean-up of contaminated sediments, soil and water.<BR>

<H4>COULD A FARMER'S TRASH BE A CRABBER'S TREASURE? </H4>

<P>What to do with poultry who die during market production is fueling
research aiming to benefit both the commercial crab and poultry industries.
North Carolina Sea Grant Marine Advisory Agent, Bob Hines, and his colleague,
Teena Middleton are testing the use of a poultry-based bait as an alternative
to traditional blue crab commercial bait. The grinding and fermentation
of &quot;poultry mortalities&quot; or dead chickens and turkeys, produces
a crab lure low in odor and free of harmful bacteria. Preliminary tests
show that crabs appear to be attracted to the bait, however the best method
of processing and packaging the poultry still needs to be determined. According
to Hines, &quot;Each year fishermen are having more and more trouble obtaining
crab bait due to fisheries regulations that prohibit the catch of a certain
size or species of fish traditionally used for bait. If the fermented poultry
proves to be a comparable and cost-effective alternative to traditional
fish bait, then it could be a competitive option.&quot; What is most significant
about this project, however, is its &quot;recycling&quot; capability. North
Carolina is a leader in poultry production with over 50 million turkeys
and more than 500 million broiler chickens produced each year. Since there
are a certain percentage of birds that die during production, disposal
is a significant logistical problem. Scientists hope that, if successful,
utilization of poultry waste as crab bait will be a viable option for other
states faced with the disposal problems of high-volume poultry production.

<H4>MICROBES MAY MUNCH PAPER PULP POLLUTION </H4>

<P>Water pollution from paper mills is a major problem in many states,
including Georgia where paper processing is the state's largest industry,
contributing thousands of jobs to the economy. One of the problems of producing
paper is the need to use large amounts of chemicals to remove the lignin
- or structure fiber - from the wood. The results are chemically laden
discharges of wood pulp by-products. Sea Grant funded researcher Mary Ann
Moran noticed that lignin exists naturally in coastal waters, decaying
plant life, and she wondered if the microbes and organisms that were biologically
degrading plant pulp in the natural environment could be used to do the
same with paper mill products. Moran and her team, in a newly funded project,
have gone &quot;fishing&quot; for those organisms, collecting water samples
along the Georgia coast. To date they have identified two organisms that
act as biodegraders, and two more that show promise. &quot;We are fairly
certain that there is no one organism that works to decompose the material,
but rather it is a team of them working together,&quot; says Moran. &quot;If
we can identify the right combination of microbes, we would have the potential
to accomplish several environmentally significant goals including the reduction
of chemicals used in the actual pulping process; breakdown of pulp lignin
by-products before their discharge and overall improvement of waste water
discharge.&quot; <BR>

<H4>NEW TEST HELPS &quot;NAB&quot; LOBSTER THIEVES</H4>

<P>In an attempt to decrease the number of &quot;berried&quot; or egg-bearing
female lobsters illegally harvested in New England, Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution Sea Grant researcher, Robert Bullis and Mike Syslo, director
of the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries State Lobster Hatchery
and Research Station have developed a new test that will aid law enforcement
officials in catching ( and prosecuting ( those who try and beat the system.
The current detection method utilizes a stain test that reacts with &quot;cement&quot;
(an egg-binding substance) residues alerting inspectors that eggs have
been removed from a seemingly non-berried lobster. However, by coming up
with an alternate approach, dishonest lobstermen now illegally dip berried
lobsters in a chlorine bleach solution which dissolves cement residues,
allowing the thieves to slip by the authorities. Combating this problem,
the new test detects the presence of bleach on one of the lobster's swimmerets
(small appendages on its abdomen) by a color change in test solution. &quot;Our
test,&quot; explains Bullis, &quot;will stand up in court, giving law enforcement
people what they need to prosecute and fine violators of the new regulations.&quot;
Regulations prohibiting the harvest of berried lobsters, including those
rules specifically addressing the dipping of lobsters in bleach, exist
to protect and ensure a steady population of lobsters for the future. Use
of this quick and inexpensive test may ultimately help in managing and
sustaining the vital New England lobster fishery. <BR>

<h4>SEA GRANT AGENT FORTIFIES CASE AGAINST 
POTENTIALLY DEVASTATING EROSION OF GULF INTERCOASTAL 
WATERWAY</h4>
At Sargent Beach in Matagorda County, Texas, 
construction crews are working overtime to erect 
fortifying stone barriers to protect the Gulf 
Intercoastal Waterway (GIWW) from erosion damage.  
According to Texas Sea Grant Extension specialist 
Willie Younger, "The waterway is a commercial artery 
of major significance to both the Texas and national 
economies.  A Sea Grant study demonstrated that the 
GIWW supports roughly 150,000 jobs and generates $4 
billion dollars a year in commerce."  However, despite 
the dramatic figures, it took a great deal of 
convincing by Younger, and community action 
initiatives, to convince the Army Corps of Engineers 
and businesses which depend on the waterway (such as 
Texas Petro Chemical and Dow Chemical) to see the cost 
benefit effectiveness in making the repairs.  Massive 
erosion in the area threatens to remove sand from 
beaches and banks and deposit it in the waterway. A 
breach by the sea, which would be most likely after a 
large storm or hurricane, could potentially choke the 
GIWW to a standstill.  Younger says that if this were 
to occur, it could take up to three weeks for a 
dredging operation to make it to the site to begin 
work, and that during this time $20 million dollars of 
commerce would be lost daily.  "It seemed to make clear 
sense to take action before the catastrophe," adds 
Younger.  So far construction appears to be ahead of 
schedule, and the operation could be complete by late 
1997 or early 1998.<br>

<h4>SEA GRANT RESEARCH AIMING TO SINK SHIPWORM 
DAMAGE</h4>
For centuries shipworms have feasted their way through 
wooden vessels, piers, and other structures in salt 
water, resulting in billions of dollars of damage.  
Over the last few years, New York City alone has spent 
over $100 million to brace and wrap plastic around 
thousands of pilings supporting its most vital piers.  
Looking to put an end to the carnage, a Delaware Sea 
Grant study, coordinated by marine molecular biologist 
Craig Cary, is investigating ways to make wood 
unpalatable. According to Carey, "An intriguing aspect 
that could offer enormous possibilities is the 
shipworm's symbiotic relationship with bacteria that 
allow it to digest wood. Specifically targeting this 
bacteria we could arrest the worm's ability to bore." 
Shipworms, which are actually clams specifically 
designed for boring, have shown enormous voracity in 
their destruction. "I've seen posts more perforated 
than Swiss cheese. Objects once dense and heavy can be 
crushed with little effort after shipworm 
infestation," says Carey. Discoveries from Carey's 
study could lead to the production of a new 
environmentally-friendly substance that could be 
applied to wood before submersion.  Presently, 
chemicals used for shipworm protection, such as 
arsenic, copper and other heavy metals, can leech into 
surrounding ecosystems, raising concern about harm to 
non-targeted organisms.<br>

<h4>HEALTHY HABITATS REDUCE IMPACTS OF 
CHEMICALS ON AQUATIC SPECIES SUCH AS SHRIMP</h4>
New testing methods utilized by South Carolina Sea 
Grant ecotoxologist Thomas Chandler show that thriving 
estuarine habitats can help absorb and reduce some 
impacts of toxic chemicals on aquatic creatures.  
Speaking of previous methods, Chandler says, "You can 
get an overestimate of a substance's toxicity to the 
multitude of species in an estuary based only on a 
single-species test in the lab."  Chandler and his 
colleague, Bruce Coull, took an intact community of 
five species of copepods (tiny shrimp-like creatures) 
from an estuary and kept it in a healthy state.  He 
then exposed the copepods to increasing doses of 
chlorpyrifos, a commonly used insecticide, looking for 
sublethal affects. "Chlorpyrifos can be very toxic to 
invertebrates such as shrimp and copepods, shutting 
down nerve function."  Yet, they could find no effect 
on the copepods in an intact community at a dose that 
will kill 50 percent of the organisms in a lab 
single-species test.  At higher levels, some problems 
began to develop, but in a natural environment where 
huge amounts of water heavily dilute chemicals, such 
levels are unlikely.  "Perhaps the pesticide binds to 
carbon-rich particles in the sediment of the intact 
community, or bacteria break down the chemical 
making it less available," Chandler speculates.  He 
hopes that his findings will lead to improved 
ecosystems-based approaches to pollution regulations 
and legislation.<br>

<h4>COASTAL SCIENTISTS MONITOR FROLICKING 
HARDBODIES ON BEACH</h4>
As droves of horseshoe crabs clamored to shore last month 
for their annual mass-mating, scientists and volunteers 
took to polling the high tide arrivals of the commercially 
significant species. Although it will take some time to 
amass a comprehensive finding for this year's studies, 
Delaware Sea Grant scientist Joe Farrell says, "Numbers 
from previous studies suggest a decline in the last ten 
years."  Possible reasons for a decline could include loss 
of habitat and a steadily increasing harvest.  Primarily, 
horseshoe crabs are taken for their meat, which serves as 
bait for eel, conch and catfish.  Commercial companies also 
utilize crab blood for processing substances that can 
detect bacterial contamination in pharmaceuticals and 
surgical implants.  In February, Farrell brought industry 
leaders together to discuss the importance of wise 
management of the resource, and to raise awareness of 
horseshoe crab conservation.  Farrell and other scientists 
are currently seeking funding to develop an artificial bait, 
containing all the fish-stimulating attributes of crab 
meat, to reduce the harvesting pressure on this species.<br>

<h4>SCIENTISTS MAKE NOISE ABOUT BIRD DROWNINGS 
IN GILLNETS</h4>
In a creative effort to reduce bird mortality in gillnets, 
scientists participating in a Washington Sea Grant-led 
effort, funded by the National Marine Fisheries Service, 
are experimenting with the use of underwater sounds to 
alert common murres and other fish-eating birds to the 
presence of gillnets.  Initial testing began at the Oregon 
Coast Aquarium, where the behavior of birds was monitored 
in relation to a variety of sounds at different frequencies 
and intervals. According to researcher Julia Parrish, "The 
sounds tested included a random series of beeps at 
different frequencies.   Most importantly, we had to make 
sure the sounds did not attract the birds."  Results from 
the aquarium study suggest that the birds can hear 
manufactured sounds and are not attracted to them -- at 
least not at the aquarium.   The next round of tests will 
take place in the Puget Sound sockeye fishery, where 
several gear modifications, including pingers, will be 
tested in a large cooperative effort among industry, state 
and Federal regulatory agencies.  Gear modifications found 
most effective will be phased into the fishery through new 
regulations.<br>

<h4>INTERACTIVE CLAM FARM PLANS TO RAKE IN 
TOURISTS, DOLLARS</h4>
Looking for something new and interesting to do on your 
beach vacation?   Try digging for clams.  In what has been 
compared to a "pick your own strawberry patch," a lease 
facility in Hatteras Island, NC, stocked full with clams, 
is offering visitors a chance at raking their own dinner.  
The project, funded by the National Resources Research and 
Development Institute (NCRI), is the brainchild of 
shellfish grower Kevin Midgett, who operates the lease, and 
the director of North Carolina Sea Grant's Marine Advisory 
Service, Jim Murray.  This project,says Murray, "has 
multiple appeals by increasing the economic opportunities 
offered by leasing projects, by expanding ecotourism, and 
by providing a framework for studying shellfish culture." 
So far, business at the clam farm, where visitors pay about 
22 cents per clam (slightly cheaper than at the market), 
has been great since opening June 1.  According to Murray, 
"Midgett has reached the point where he is afraid he might 
have to start turning people away" due to over crowding.  
Murray expects to see similar farms springing up along the 
East Coast in the future.<br>

<h4>VW BUG AIMS TO BE ZEBRA MUSSEL HOME & EVENTUAL MUSEUM EXHIBIT</h4>

A gleaming white 1969 Volkswagen Beetle will disappear
beneath the waves of Lake Erie tomorrow (Wednesday, June
26) morning.  When it is pulled from the lake bottom in
late fall, it will become a major exhibit on how damaging
and rapid the spread of zebra mussels has become in the
Great Lakes.  The project will create a central exhibit
piece for the American Museum of Natural History in New
York City.  The museum is opening a major exhibit on
endangered and introduced species next March, and the
museum project organizers anticipate that the VW "Bug" will
be completely covered with zebra mussel colonies an inch
and a half thick.  Ohio Sea Grant scientists and
researchers at Ohio State University's Stone Laboratory
will film and document the car's transformation in the
coming months.  The zebra mussel is an example of a
non-indigenous species with no effective predators.
Since first appearing in Lake St. Clair in 1986, they
have spread into 19 U.S. states and have clogged
navigation systems, water treatment and industrial
plants, and marinas as far north as Canada's Hudson
Bay, and as far south as the Gulf of Mexico. Stone
Laboratory is located in Put-in-Bay, Ohio, midway
between Cleveland and Toledo.<p>

<h4>FURTHER GROUNDFISHING RESTRICTIONS SET FOR NEW ENGLAND WATERS JULY 1ST</h4>

MIT Sea Grant scientist Madeleine Hall-Arber says that new
fishing restriction regulations intended to restore New
England's stocks of cod, haddock and yellowtail flounder
could be "a potential no-win situation." Hall-Arber says
"We have the dilemma of protecting a critically declining
fishery with regulations that could prove devastating to
New England's groundfishermen."  The regulations,
which go into effect July 1 for marine waters from New
York to Canada, will close some fishing grounds,
drastically reduce the number of days boats can spend
at sea each year, and limit the total groundfish
catch. According to the National Marine Fisheries
Service, the New England groundfish stocks have
decreased to 10% of their former numbers, hence the
drastic steps.  Hall-Arber, who studies the impact of
regulations on fishing communities, says "Many things
could be done to ease the impact on fishing
communities which are certain to suffer from the new
regulations."  Hall-Arber's suggestions include
"increasing direct aid packages and renewing funds for
Fishing Family Assistance Centers, which offer
job-training, education courses, information about
other Federal assistance, and perhaps most importantly
develop programs which deal with transferring valuable
fishing skills to other lines of work."<p>

<h4>SEA GRANT INVESTIGATOR SIFTS THROUGH SEA SHELL MURDER MYSTERIES</h4>
No crime scene tape ropes off the beach-side murder site.
A clam shell lies closed, a small hole drilled near its
hinge - the calling card of the moonsnail, a patient,
persistent killer who feeds by penetrating the calcium
carbonate shell of the clam, spitting acidic digestive
juices and rasping with a sandpaper-tough "tongue."  North
Carolina Sea Grant coast expert Lundie Spence notes, "Shell
finds can unravel fascinating mysteries in coastal predator / prey 
relationships, often revealing clues to murders that
took place months or years ago."  Shelled organisms are
constantly being stalked by carnivorous neighbors such as
marine snails and certain species of crab.  "Another
ferocious predator, the whelk," says Spence, "preys on
clams by utilizing the prying power of its 'foot' and conch
shell to tear the clam open and expose its vulnerable
meat."  Yet, in this world of murder and mayhem, predator
can also be prey, and the whelk is no exception.  "If you
find a conch shell with a narrow grove that follows along
the spiral, it indicates the modus operandi of the box or
flame crab, whose can-opener-shaped claw cuts down the
conch to reach the whelk," says Spence.  So when out
beachcombing this summer collecting the shelled remnants of
past murders, take note of the eerie details.<p>

<h4>CLONED GENETIC CODE COULD MEAN SOFT-SHELLED CRABS YEAR-ROUND FOR DINNER</h4>
The popular seafood delicacy of soft-shelled crabs might be more than just a 
seasonal treat in the near future. A team of researchers led by Doug Watson of 
the University of Alabama-Birmingham and Mississippi-Alabama Sea Grant has 
successfully cloned genetic material that codes for blue crab MIH, or 
molt-inhibiting hormone. The results have the potential to revolutionize the 
soft-shelled crab industry. To date, the industry has always been limited due to
the lack of dependability of obtaining crabs in molt stage.  Having the ability 
to force crabs to the pre-molt stage could produce "an abundant, year-round, and
controllable supply of soft-shelled crabs for the Gulf of Mexico soft crab 
industry and consumers of seafood," says Watson.  The cloning of the MIH gene 
material, which was accomplished through the construction of a high-tech 
genetics library of cloned DNA, is an enormous step in producing a substance 
that would arrest the protein's activity and force the crab into molting.  
Investigating cheap and efficient production of large quantities of MIH, 
researchers have inserted vectors containing MIH-gene codes into insect cells to
take advantage of the cells' DNA replicating machinery.  With larger quantities,
researchers can begin experimenting with substances to block the action of MIH 
and rocket the soft-shelled crab industry forward.<br>

<h4>FLOODING FALLOUT HITS OREGON'S OYSTER INDUSTRY</h4>
More than a month after spring flooding hit Western Oregon, the effects are 
still being felt in the near-shore sea, where the state's oyster farms may have 
lost as much as 25 percent of the 1996 harvest, according to Oregon Sea Grant 
Extension Agent John Faudskar.  The normally salty bays and tidal zones were 
inundated with billions of gallons of fresh water, blanketing oyster estuaries 
with silt and dramatically altering the water's salinity.  Two of Oregon's five 
oyster estuaries were affected, both in the northern half of the state.  The 
1994 harvest for these two estuaries, where three private businesses are now 
claiming significant losses, was roughly 20,000 bushels.  One farming operation,
located in Yaquina bay, estimates that they have lost $100,000 worth of 
harvestable oysters.  "Aside from the loss of this year's adult oysters, which 
suffered from the appreciable drop in salinity, some regions also lost 
considerable juvenile populations which were buried in silt," says Faudskar.  
The turnaround time for a juvenile to reach commercial maturity is roughly three
years.  Thus, the overall loss in oyster production could persist for several 
years to come.<br>

<h4>
VIRAL COURIERS TO DELIVER VITALIZING GENES TO SHELLFISH</h4>
In a project led by Sea Grant scientists Jane Burns, of the University of 
California, San Diego, and Thomas Chen, of the University of Connecticut, 
researchers genetically altered the dwarf surfclam using modified viral 
particles, known as retroviral vectors. "This work may provide a new tool for 
marine biologists to accelerate shell-fish growth and protect against diseases 
that attack commercial stocks of oysters, clams, mussels, and abalone," 
according to Burns.  Once desired genes have been identified, retroviral vectors
could be used to deliver them directly to broodstock.  "We disarm the viruses by
removing their genetic material so that they are incapable of replicating," says
Dr. Burns, "and then add foreign genes as a 'payload' to the virus."  Although 
the procedure has been widely used with human gene therapy, vectors have had 
difficulty entering non-mammalian cells.  This was overcome by substituting a 
new viral coat, enabling vectors to enter virtually any cell type.  The genes 
inserted into surfclams were "reporter" genes, which cause the fertilized 
surfclam to display a blue color, indicating that the implanted genes were 
present and functioning.  With promising results, this experiment predicts 
larger, healthier shell-fish for future harvests.  The research was funded 
jointly by California Sea Grant, the UCSD Gene Therapy Program Grant-In-Aid, and
the National Science Foundation<br>

<h4>JAMA FEATURES IMPORTANCE OF DRUG LEADS FROM THE SEA</h4>
The importance of looking to the oceans for possible new pharmaceutical and 
medical treatments for such diseases as cancer, AIDS and arthritis is the focal 
point of a major article, which highlights Sea Grant research,  in this week's 
edition (April 3, 1996) of JAMA, The Journal of the American Medical 
Association.  Historically, the pharmaceutical industry has been based on 
substances extracted from micro-organisms found in soil.  However, with the 
current onslaught of diseases rapidly developing drug resistance, "it is 
imperative that new microorganisms, producing radically new antibiotics, be 
isolated from diverse habitats over the next decade," says California Sea Grant 
Researcher William Fenical.  Fenical has uncovered anti-inflammatory compounds 
known as pseudopterins from the Caribbean sea whip.  One of the more effective 
compounds, cyclomarin, has been licensed for development to the pharmaceutical 
company Phytera, Inc.  Also looking to the enormous biodiversity of the oceans, 
Gregory M. L. Patterson of Hawaii Sea Grant has recently discovered certain 
species of blue-green algae to contain effective anti-tumor compounds, known as 
cryptophycins.  His findings have led to a licensing agreement with Eli-Lily & 
Company for the future development of cryptophycins.  Inspired by the previous 
success of those tapping this incredible marine resource,  Puerto Rico Sea Grant
Researcher Edmundo Kraiselburd searches for substances effective against 
virological diseases in his work with HIV, SIV and Dengue.  Counting on the vast
materials of this largely unexplored realm, Fenical believes "the marine 
microbial environment could provide the next 50 years of interesting drug 
leads." <br>

<h4>NEW TUNA LABEL LETTERS (HACCP) SPELL QUALITY SEAFOOD</h4>
Hitting supermarket shelves last week, cans of Van Camp's "Chicken of the Sea" 
brand tuna are now labeled with the letters "HACCP" marking the company's 
commitment to new seafood safety regulations which go into effect at the end of 
1997.  HACCP, which stands for "Hazardous Analysis Critical Control Points," is 
the FDA's step by step process for Federal inspection of seafood processing.  
Steven Otwell, Florida Sea Grant Researcher, says "HACCP represents the most 
significant change toward food safety in the past 50 years. Van Camp is ahead of
the commitment curve in advancing safety for foods."  Otwell heads the National 
Sea Grant team responsible for training seafood processors in how to comply with
the new seafood handling regulations.  The National Sea Grant Program has been 
conducting a multi-year effort aimed at providing training to successfully 
implement the new safety regulations.  Central to that effort has been the 
creation of the Seafood HACCP Alliance.  The alliance's goal is to foster a more
uniform and current national education, training and technical assistance 
program for the seafood industry.  Otwell says  that "this partnership will 
focus seafood training and education in the industry with the aim of providing 
the American consumer with more confidence in the nation's seafood products." 
Through continuing project funds from Sea Grant, the alliance is providing 
provide a number of actual training sessions for the regional industries and 
inspectors and will publish, jointly with the FDA, the National Seafood 
Hazardous Analysis and Critical Control Point Training  Curriculum, a guide for 
all components of the seafood industry, but aimed in particular at seafood 
processors and importers across the nation who will be responsible for 
implementing the required HACCP guidelines by December, 1997.<br>

<h4>WHAT DO BOAT BOTTOMS AND BABY BOTTOMS HAVE IN COMMON?</h4>
In a fairly light-hearted yet practical study, Maryland Sea Grant researchers 
have been exploring the use of diaper cream as a cheap repellent for zebra 
mussels on boat bottoms.  An exotic species and fouling organism, zebra mussels 
first appeared in the Great Lakes region in the late 1980s and have quickly 
spread throughout most of the country, largely from hitching rides on boat 
bottoms.  David Wright, co-investigator in this project, first heard of the 
cream's use by boat owners seeking a cheap alternative to standard anti-fouling 
products in Europe.  According to Wright, "Diaper cream is roughly ten times 
cheaper than current anti-fouling paints." Wright and other researchers placed 
cream-coated ceramic tiles and un-coated control tiles in tanks with zebra 
mussels.  Cream-coated tiles significantly deterred settling in comparison to 
un-coated tiles.  Initial findings show that the substance has both physical and
chemical components in deterring settlement (although the degree to which each 
is a factor has yet to be determined).  The major chemical irritant to mussels 
appears to be zinc oxide.  Practical application of this product awaits further 
research..<br>

<h4>INNOVATIVE GREEN STICK TUNA GEAR MAKES BELIEVERS OF FISHERMEN</h4>
Recently arriving to waters off the coast of North Carolina, a fishing gear new 
to the U.S. has shown revolutionary success in harvesting tuna, with numbers at 
least three times greater than traditional gear.  Adoption of the "green stick" 
in this region comes largely from information provided by Wayne Wescott of North
Carolina Sea Grant.  Wescott, also a fishermen and green-stick convert, says, 
"the method is so attractive to tuna, that the fish strike even when they are 
not hungry."  Designed in Japan, the "stick" is an olive-colored fiber glass 
pole that stretches 35-45 feet high and holds a long, high test line. That line 
stretches several hundred feet behind a trolling boat and is kept taut by 
dragging a wooden structure called a "bird."  Fastened to this main line, five 
lines dangle artificial-squid bait that just dances on the water's surface.  The
incredible effectiveness of the gear has been attributed to two main factors: 
(1) The bait dangling at the surface of the water apparently mimics flying fish,
a favorite food of tuna and (2) the bird, which evidently resembles a large 
predator following the bait, stimulates the tuna to strike in a competitive 
frenzy.  According to Wescott, many vessels boast catches 12 to 15 times higher 
after installing green stick gear.  Several orders have been sent to Japan for 
green sticks to be used in the 1996 fishing season.  On April 25 in Manteo, NC, 
Wescott and participating fishermen will host a free workshop to explain 
rigging, setting and fishing of the gear for recreational and commercial 
boats. <br>

<h4>HISPANIC POPULATION, A GROWING MARKET, HAS TASTE FOR SEAFOOD</h4>
As one of the fastest growing ethnic groups in the U.S., the Hispanic population
represents a significant market for fish and shellfish.  A recent study 
sponsored by New York Sea Grant found that despite some safety concerns, the 
majority of Hispanics (85 percent) in New York City enjoy the taste of seafood 
and consider it healthful and worth buying.  The study, conducted by Cornell 
University associate professor of nutrition Carole Bisogni and Sea Grant scholar
Stephanie Weinstein, set out to identify some of the beliefs and preferences 
about fish and shellfish that exist in the Hispanic community.  Hispanics 
traditionally have included fish in their diets as part of their native 
country's culture.  However, trends indicate that young Hispanics are adapting a
fattier diet in the United States, a trend that is of concern to nutritionists. 
U.S. Department of Health statistics show that Hispanics are at greater risk 
than the general population for weight gain and diabetes.  Results of the survey
show that 97 percent of respondents who said they found seafood enjoyable 
consumed it an average of 3.3 times in a two-week period.  Maintaining this high
level of consumption may be critical to future health trends, and is an 
important factor for seafood marketing efforts.<br>

<h4>PANIC UNDERWATER</h4>
More than half of the scuba divers in a national survey have experienced a 
"potentially life-threatening" panic attack according to a newly release study 
by Wisconsin Sea Grant researcher William Morgan, director of the University of 
Wisconsin-Madison Sport Psychology Laboratory. Morgan's studies were conducted 
over 10 years and published in the December, 1995 issue of Sports Medicine. 
There is general agreement among diving authorities that panic behavior is 
responsible for many of the diving accidents and fatalities that occur in 
recreational scuba divers. Other findings included: <br>
<ul>
<li>Incidence of panic was 
higher in women (64%) than men (50%), though more men (48%) than women (35%) 
perceived the events as life-threatening; 
<li> Panic attacks are not restricted to 
novice divers.  Divers with many years of experience can experience attacks for 
no apparent reason; 
<LI> It was possible to predict panic behavior in beginning 
scuba divers with 88% accuracy using a measure of trait anxiety. 
</ul>Using 
psychological treatments to reduce anxiety responses in scuba divers exposed to 
various stressors has not been successful in the limited research conducted up 
to this time.  Additionally the risks and dangers of panic attacks during scuba 
diving are not well known among scuba divers.<br>

<h4>SPINY LOBSTERS RUN FOR "COVER" IN FLORIDA BAY</h4>
A bomb shelter for lobsters?  Not exactly, but Florida Sea Grant researchers 
have been testing the efficiency of artificial, concrete shelters in the 
development of juvenile populations of spiny lobsters, a commercially important 
species, in the Florida Bay.  Beginning in 1992, massive die-offs of sponges, a 
key habitat component for juvenile lobsters, resulted in a 70% population 
decline in some bay regions.  In these areas, juvenile lobsters have little or 
no shelter from predators.  Project co-director Bill Herrnkind says "that 
lobsters do not appear to distinguish between crevices created by sponges and 
those offered by concrete structures," first placed in the bay last year.  
Herrnkind stresses the importance of "determining if lobsters seeking refuge in 
the shelters were originally from that area, or if they migrated from outlying 
areas where sponges may still provide juveniles with homes."  For this reason, 
postlarval lobsters are collected, tagged, and then released where concrete 
shelters have been placed.  Results of this research will direct future use of 
these shelters, which could prove influential in sustaining this species and its
increasingly valuable fishery.<br>

<h4>JOINT PROGRAM AIMS AT IMPROVED MARINA WASTE MANAGEMENT</h4>
Joint efforts by Texas and Louisiana Sea Grant extension services have developed
an award-winning education program aiming at reducing marina-generated water 
pollution. Texas A&M Sea Grant researcher Dewayne Hollin and Louisiana Sea 
Grant's Michael Liffmann and Marilyn Barrett-O'Leary founded the Gulf of Mexico 
Waste Management Program to educate marina owners in waste management and 
recycling programs.  In 1995, seven workshops in the Gulf Coast region drew more
than 300 people.  "The workshops forced a lot of marina owners to put together 
recycling programs. The program informed them of waste management rules that 
they weren't aware of, particularly those dealing with hazardous wastes," Hollin
said. The program resulted from a survey of 2,000 Gulf Coast marinas, and uses 
the best approaches from the region as models for others. Covering aluminum, 
plastics, glass, paper, engine oil and filters, anti-freeze, and batteries, the 
program was cited in the 1996 issue of the Environmental Success Index, 
published by Renew America.  Success of the program is attributed to its 
collective benefit for all involved.  Cleaner marina environments attract more 
visitors, boosting business for marina owners and local communities<br>

<h4>"FISH TV" PROVIDING ACOUSTIC VIEW OF LIFE IN THE SEA, MAY BENEFIT RESOURCE 
MANAGEMENT </h4>
Underwater images generated by sound, not light, will provide biologists with 
important new understandings of how marine animals live and behave over the 
coming decade, according to Dr. Jules Jaffe, a California Sea Grant ocean 
engineer at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, part of the University of 
California, San Diego.  Jaffe initially created the sonar system called FTV (for
"Fish TV") to study microscopic animals known as zooplankton, which form a 
critical link in the ocean food web.  His system is the first remote sensing 
device to precisely image the three dimensional distribution of zooplankton, 
following the animals as they move in real time. Ultimately, it will allow 
marine biologists to answer many basic questions about these animals:  How do 
the animals behave in the ocean, that is, apportion their energy in terms of 
searching vs. migration? How big are their colonies, and how do they evolve in 
time? How might a population decline in zooplankton affect fish? The answers to 
those questions just might help fisheries management and water quality officials
do a better job of managing fishing and water resources.<br>

<h4>ENZYMES FROM UNDERSEA VOLCANOES HEAT UP DNA SYNTHESIS</h4>
Resistant to scalding temperatures, enzymes from heat loving organisms may soon 
allow scientists to duplicate DNA with greater ease and efficiency.  These 
organisms, called archaebacteria, flourish in the extreme environments offered 
by hydrothermal vents on the sea floor.  Washington Sea Grant researcher John 
Baross extracts enzymes from these organisms collected in the Juan de Fuca 
Ridge, an undersea mountain chain 2,000 ft below the surface and several hundred
miles west of Washington State.  Baross says, "We're finding a great variety of 
enzymes that could have a wide range of applications in industry."  Some species
can survive temperatures of 350 degrees C (hot enough to melt lead) where water 
flows are heated by magma (at this depth, pressure keeps water from becoming 
vapor).  At room temperature, archae turn dormant, enabling them to be "deep 
frozen" by simply setting them on a shelf. The resilience of the enzymes could 
allow them to be recycled many times in the process of DNA duplication, proving 
beneficial for tasks requiring large amounts of DNA, such as new crop 
development or identifying crime scene blood.  <br>

<h4>NEW TECHNOLOGY HELPING SCIENTISTS LEARN MORE 
ABOUT UNDERWATER LIGHT SHOWS</h4>
With fiery, fluorescent displays, many of the ocean's organisms, dull and dreary
under natural light, come alive when stimulated by ultraviolet light.  Certain 
species of shrimp, coral, anemones, and other organisms are among the creatures 
capable of bioluminescence, a phenomenon that remains somewhat of a mystery.  
Searching for answers, Charles Mazel, MIT Sea Grant researcher, dives to the sea
floor to study these creatures with his invention, the benthic 
spectrofluorometer, which enables scientists to measure spectral distributions 
of fluorescence without bringing creatures to the lab.  According to Mazel, 
"light coming into the ocean affects what grows and what pigmentation it has, 
and that affects light coming off the bottom."  Mazel's technology could have 
significant benefit for benthic optics, the study of how light interacts both 
with the sea floor and the organisms that live there.  One benefit could be in 
providing a library of species-specific signatures.  That could help explain the
biological process of how fluorescent light is generated at the tissue level.  
Hooked up to a computer that logs data, the Mazel-invented spectrofluorometer is
comprised of two water-tight plastic boxes that can be strapped to a diver's 
wrist or chest.    <br>

<h4>SALMON "BAR CODES" BRAND HATCHERY FISH</h4>
Utilizing an amazing discovery, fisheries scientists, working with Alaska Sea 
Grant, have developed a technique to mark hatchery salmon, allowing scientists 
to distinguish them from their wild counterparts.  Looking much like a grocery 
store bar code when viewed through a microscope, these salmon "bar codes" grow 
naturally on the inner ear of the fish.  "This bar code gives the manager a tool
to measure how many fish are wild and how many are hatchery fish," says Alaska 
Sea Grant fisheries scientist Bill Smoker.   Induced by fluctuating temperature,
black and white bands appear on the fish by raising and lowering the temperature
by a few degrees in hatchery tanks, producing a customized mark that brands all 
of the stock at the same time.  This new technology replaces artificial tags 
that were impossible to place on all the specimens and often proved fatal for 
the fish.<br>

<h4>GLOW IN THE DARK GENES IDENTIFY BACTERIA</h4>
The traditional method of studying bacteria through the microscope often does 
not allow one to differentiate between species or distinguish between live or 
dead cells.  According to Robert Hodson, Georgia Sea Grant scientist,  "What we 
need is a personal genetic snapshot for each cell." Hodson, who studies marine 
bacteria, is one of a team of scientists that have developed a technique for 
identifying bacteria by producing glowing copies of the organism's  DNA.  This 
allows scientists to distinguish between different bacterial species much the 
same as a fingerprint gives information about human individuals.  Expected to 
produce enormous benefits for medicine, this technology can reveal how an 
infection is progressing, or whether or not bacteria are developing drug 
resistance.  <br>

<h4>COMPUTER PROJECTION MODEL AIDED OIL SPILL CONTROL</h4>
Rhode Island Sea Grant researcher Malcolm Spaulding has developed a number of 
computer models that predict where oil and other pollutants will end up once 
they enter a body of water. Combining hydrodynamic factors (wind, tides and 
current) and information on the physical properties of the spilled substance, an
animated model can be produced representing the pollutant's path. OILMAP, the 
commercial version of the oil spill software, has been used to estimate 
trajectories of oil spills all over the world, including the January 19th North 
Cape spill on the coast of Rhode Island. Spaulding is currently refining and 
testing COASTMAP, a software program that will determine the paths of water 
movement and pollutants in coastal waters. This software, which incorporates a 
geographical information system (GIS) database, will have direct application in 
coastal management and decision making. It will be distributed free to state and
municipal managers in a target area of Rhode Island (Greenwich Bay), and Sea 
Grant Marine Advisory Service staff will provide training in its use.  <br>

<h4>
FISH "ANTI-FREEZE" HOLDS POTENTIAL FOR CITRUS CROP PROTECTION
</h4>
As another winter arctic blast flows over the nation, potentially threatening 
Florida's citrus crops this weekend, ice-suppressing proteins that protect fish 
in polar environments may be the source of future crop protection from such 
cold.  That's the theory behind a  Virginia Sea Grant research  by Thomas Caceci
(pronounced KU CHAY CHEE) and Thomas E. Toth, that's lead to successful 
production of artificial antifreeze proteins (AFPs), proteins that may increase 
profits for agriculture and other industries. According to Caceci  "the greatest
economic benefits could come for citrus crops, and other plants especially 
sensitive to frosts if these AFPs could be applied as a biodegradable, non-toxic
spray."  Diverging from natural AFPs, the proteins are manipulated for maximum 
efficiency and ease of handling during production.  "The major hurdle was being 
able to produce a protein that worked in aqueous solutions," says Caceci, 
explaining that effectiveness requires water-solubility.  With an enormous range
of applications, artificial AFPs could be used for food storage, tissue and 
organ preservation, and environmentally-safe road and aircraft de-icing.  Field 
testing and further research refinements, however,  means that commercial 
application and production of such a product remains several years away.<br>

<h4>ARCTIC ENZYMES MAY ONE DAY LOWER YOUR POWER BILL</h4>
Need more cleaning power from your cold-water wash?  Help may come from arctic 
bacteria enzymes being studied by University of Washington Sea Grant researchers

applications, "one of the largest biotech markets for cold-tolerant enzymes is

clothes in cold, rather than hot, water could significantly reduce power 
consumption.  Collected in the Norwegian and Greenland Seas, these bacteria, 
which can survive in sub-zero temperatures, are cultured in the laboratory so 
useful enzymes can be extracted.  Arctic enzymes have already proven useful in 
the dairy industry, allowing users to sweeten milk, form curds, and culture 
cheese at temperatures that minimize the risk of bacterial contamination.  
Scientists expect continued research to yield enzymes that can function at 
colder temperatures than those now in use, and for industry to develop wider

<h4>RESEARCHER SEEK TO SUSTAIN URCHIN FISHERY</h4>
Japan's consumption of sea urchins' roe has made the small invertebrate, a 
popular target for New England's fisherman - too popular says University of New 
Hampshire Sea Grant zoologist Larry Harris who is working to sustain the Gulf of
Maine's urchin fishery, which he believes will be depleted after another season.
Harris attributes the decline to overfishing and believes the fishery's future 
is in aquaculture operations.  Exported to Japan where their roe is a delicacy, 
high-quality urchins bring fishermen $2-3 per pound.  "The basic problem is that
overfishing of urchins allows the urchins' favorite food, kelp, to take over the
bottom," explains Harris.  He says to have a thriving urchin fishery, there must
be enough urchins on the bottom "to keep the lawn mowed and make sure the urchin
barrens are a hospitable site for juveniles to settle." Establishing aquaculture
operations won't be easy. Harris points to the need to control urchin rights of 
football-field sizes of ocean bottom and the difficulty of restricting dragging 
rigs which catch juveniles as well as disrupts needed habitat as two major 
stumbling blocks.

<h4>FUTURE LOBSTER DINNERS THREATENED BY RHODE ISLAND OIL SPILL</h4>
The spill of nearly a million gallons of heating oil off the Rhode Island 
coast may impact the availability of lobster dinners in the near future.  
"This spill has certainly seen a lot of lobster die-off, but the most 
important aspect here is the significant reduction of the juvenile lobsters.  
The key for the lobster is whether or not the nearshore habitat has become 
heavily oiled.  If it has, you could see long term effects on lobsters 
effecting their feeding, reproduction rates, molting growth and so forth 
for the next few years, " says Judith McDowell Woods Hole Sea Grant Program 
Director. McDowell, said that heating oil, unlike the crude oil spilled in 
the Alaska Exxon Valdez accident, "will not produce decades-long effects.  
The bad news, however, is that refined 
products such as heating oil are much more toxic."  The spill's proximity to 
coastal habitat will cause immediate mortalities to wildlife such as fish, 
shellfish and waterfowl. McDowell says, "Once it works into coastal sediments 
the oil can still have sub-lethal effects on such areas as rate of growth, 
reproduction, settling and migratory behavior,  and food chain transfer."

<h4>GENETIC ENGINEERING BREAK-THROUGH COULD IMPROVE FISH SUPPLY

U.S. consumers may find a larger supply of quality fish in the future due to a 
break-through by a Minnesota Sea Grant genetics research team led by Perry 
Hackett.  Hackett's team has established a method for inserting genes into fish 
chromosomes that will, according to Hackett, "give any fish biologist the 
ability to genetically engineer any species of fish using any gene available.  
It will make marine biotechnology more efficient and reliable." Prior procedures
involving fish were difficult to control, often producing side-effects.  
Hackett's technique should yield fish with more uniform traits, (i.e. growth 
rates, disease resistance,) which will benefit the growing aquaculture industry 
in the U.S.  However, more research addressing possible adverse ecological 
effects, such as the impact of genetically engineered fish escaping into the 
wild, will be undertaken before the procedure becomes commercially adapted.

The voyage marks the first dive for the Lab's Odyssey IIB-class vehicles, the 
most recent addition to a fleet of small, adaptable autonomous underwater

England fisheries, accurate assessment of stocks and their habitats is sorely

the ocean floor, collecting video and acoustic data, which, when correlated can 
accurately measure the depths and roughness of the sea floor and assess fishery 
stocks.  The AUV also took measurements of water temperature and salinity, which
provide critical information about where nutrients and animals congregate.<br>

A new marsh-tracking tool, a high-resolution Global Positioning System (GPS)

Grant Program Researcher Charles Simenstad, and his research team, to track 
changes in estuarine marshes with the hope of restoring them.  They are using 
the GPS to measure the spread of Spartina alterniflora, a non-native species of 
marsh grass that is colonizing 5-10 percent of the intertidal mudflats in 
Willapa Bay and Puget Sound, Washington.  Simenstad says, "High resolution GPS 
is very precise.  We can pinpoint location (latitude and longitude) within one 
centimeter and elevation within two centimeters.  Until GPS came along, 
intertidal elevation has been particularly difficult to measure easily, rapidly 
and with high precision."  Spartina initially grows in circular clumps that 
collect sediment, which raises tideflat elevations and alters plant and animal 
communities.  <br>

<h4>SCIENTISTS RACE TO SOLVE MYSTERY OF DISAPPEARING SEA LIONS</h4>
Michael Castellini, Alaska Sea Grant's marine mammal scientist, is working to 
find out why Alaska's Stellar sea lions have been disappearing so quickly.  "We 
still have no reason to believe it's a major change in their predators. We 
continue not to have evidence that suggests it's direct human interaction, nor 
is it subsistence hunting," says Castellini.  Extensive studies have been done 
on two population groups -- the adults and the pups - and both groups are 
healthy.  Thus, the juvenile sea lions are now being studied.  Scientists 
categorize the sea lions into two groups -- those that live east or west of Cook
Inlet.  The eastern sea lions, now listed as threatened, appear to be stable.  
Sea lions to the west, in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands, have been 
declining each year by about 8 to 10 percent.  This year, the National Marine 
Fisheries Service proposed listing the western group as an endangered species.

Service, has evolved into an annual special event in which volunteers stake down
Christmas trees to assist in sand dune development.  Trapping wind-blown sand, 
the trees help establish a strong frontal dune line to protect the shoreline 
from erosion and high tides. During storms, the dunes also protect the 
hinterland where there are valuable properties.  Last January's event drew more 
than 300 volunteers who staked an estimated 14,000 trees on Surfside Beach - ten
miles west of Galveston, Texas - and along the San Luis Pass.  The tree project 
averages about five miles of dune lines annually. On Dunes Day 1996, January 
20th, volunteers will help stake trees along the Brazos River, just outside of 
Freeport, Texas. <br>

<h4>DECLINING CORAL REEFS THREATENED BY HOLIDAY TRAVELERS</h4>
Heading south for some snorkeling above the Caribbean coral reefs?  If so, 
remember you are a guest in the home of a living organism - one that is dying  -
and one that is an invaluable resource for food, tourism, coastal protection and
high biodiversity in the tropics.  Reports show ten percent of the earth's reefs
have collapsed, and more risk destruction in the next 20 years.  Florida Sea 
Grant researcher Richard Dodge is studying coral skeletons for reasons of their 
demise. He suspects algal blooms may be killing reefs off southeast Florida.  
Scientific evidence, so far, implicates diminished water quality as the main 
cause of coral reef decline.  The first step in addressing the problem, says 
Dodge, is for coastal populations to maintain the necessary high-quality 
nearshore waters.  Unless conditions improve, increased population, pollution 
and overuse of these fragile resources will accelerate the reef decline and 
cause detrimental impacts far beyond reef environments.<br>

<h4>WHALE-WATCHERS GET A HOLIDAY TREAT, AS LEVIATHANS HEAD SOUTH TOO!</h4>
Snowbirds from the Midwest are not the only ones heading for Southern California
and Mexico this holiday season. Some 24,000 gray whales are heading south too.  
Each whale, roughly the size of a bus, travels annually from the Bering and 
Chukchi seas, off Alaska, down to Baja, Mexico and back. Bruce Mate, Oregon Sea 
Grant's marine mammal expert, organizes a program to assist visitors in getting 
a better look at the annual whale migration, which has spawned an entire 
whale-watching subculture in the Northwest. Mate trains volunteers, who, for two
one-week periods, are stationed at key whale-watching locations to help visitors
spot whales off the Oregon coast.  Southbound whales pass Oregon from early 
December through mid-February.  After bearing their young, they make the return 
trip from April through late June.  The first whale-watching week, expected to 
attract 20,000 people, is December 26 through January 2.<br>

<h4>THE SECRETS OF SURFACES</h4>
Sea Grant researchers are developing new, environmentally friendly coatings that
may help surfaces stay clean of zebra mussels and other fouling organisms.  Dr. 
Robert Baier, a New York Sea Grant researcher, and his research team tried to 
discover why, for example, the surface of the cornea repels dust and the inside 
of a cheek resists dental plaque.  They have found that lipids, which make up 
the outermost cell membranes of these non-stick surfaces, can be copied using 
synthetic materials.  These coatings prevent biofouling because of their atomic 
surface energy, and several industry collaborators are now manufacturing 
coatings based on this work.  Baier's biofouling research first began with 
surface design studies of Barney Clark's artificial heart. Today he and a 
graduate student are studying surfaces that show both non-stick and 
drag-reduction characteristics. Their work could lead to the design of ships 
that go faster and consume less fuel while staying clean.  <br>

<h4>QUESTIONING SAFETY, MANAGING PERSONAL WATERCRAFT ON THE COAST</h4>
The recent collision of a jet-ski operator with the boat of pop-singer Gloria 
Estefan highlights the rise in personal watercraft injuries.  A U.S. Coast Guard
study found that in 1994, there were 766 more personal watercraft accidents than
the previous year, resulting in 423 more injuries and 21 additional fatalities. 
North Carolina officials are taking steps to address this problem, and their 
results may serve as a model for other states dealing with this issue.  Walter 
Clark, North Carolina Sea Grant's coastal law specialist, met with local 
government officials, personal watercraft manufacturers and dealers to discuss 
how local governments can work with the state and the personal watercraft 
industry to regulate watercraft activities to increase safety.  First steps they
agreed should be setting age restrictions for equipment rental and use, as well 
as marking designated personal watercraft zones in coastal waterway areas to 
reduce likelihood of collision with other crafts and people in the water.<br>

<h4>HAVE TRUNK, WILL TRAVEL  </h4>
Zebra Mussels Mean Math, English and Science <br>
A treasure trove of interactive and multi-disciplinary educational activities is
traveling cross-country.  The Zebra Mussel Traveling Trunk aims to teach 
students about the problems - and solutions - linked to the spread of zebra 
mussels and other non-indigenous aquatic species.  Created by Illinois-Indiana 
Sea Grant, the science kit integrates subjects such as math, English, social 
studies and the arts, and can be targeted to both younger and older students.  
The "Zebra Mussel Mania" curriculum guide assists educators in conducting 
hands-on experiments, games and stories.  The trunks are being distributed at 
nine locations around the country, including the Indianapolis Zoo and Chicago's 
Shedd Aquarium.  Twenty more will be available within a year at other locations.

<h4>GEORGIA CLAM FARMING HAS PROFITABLE FUTURE</h4>
Clam research conducted by Georgia Sea Grant Research Scientist Randal Walker 
shows that Georgia's commercial fishermen may soon have a new, profitable catch.
 Because Georgia clams grow to market size in just two years--less than half the
time of their Northern counterparts--they are ideal for aquaculture.  Walker has
developed a low-tech operation to plant and harvest clams.  On firm creek 
bottoms, gravel-filled, mesh-topped wood boxes set upon cinder- blocks are used.
 To produce the more difficult "seed" clams, a greenhouse was designed, which 
uses sunlight to grow algae and the young clams.  "Our building is designed to 
grow the seed to that larger size, and then we move that seed out to the river,"
says Walker.  Today, Georgia's clam fishery brings in about $40,000, down from a
1988 peak of more than a quarter million dollars.  <br>

<h4>EDMUND FITZGERALD SHIPWRECK VIDEO AVAILABLE TO PUBLIC</h4>
Michigan Sea Grant's (MSG) Extension Program has made five hours 
of videotape of
the wreck of the Great Lakes freighter Edmund Fitzgerald, plus expert 
commentary, available for public viewing in the Michigan State University 
Library.  The Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society had MSG use a new, 3-D 
system of technology they were testing to explore the Society's video of the 
wreck.  To help the Society discover what may have contributed to the tragedy, 
MSG also organized a panel of experts to analyze the exploration video.  The 
experts' comments were then simultaneously recorded on a copy of the Society's 
wreck footage.  In July, the Society presented their consolidated tapes to MSG,

<h4>NJ SEA GRANT SAFETY TRAINING COURSE PROVES TO BE A REAL LIFESAVER</h4>
New Jersey Sea Grant's Marine Advisory Service (MAS) sponsors five Drill 
Conductor Training courses, one of which has recently been credited with helping
to save a boy's life.  The 13-year old accidentally fell into a 32-degree-water 
tank on his father's boat.  The captain's mate administered hypothermia 
treatment, which he learned in one of the training courses.  The course 
curriculum, which incorporates Sea Grant marine safety training resource 
materials, was designed by New Jersey Sea Grant Marine Agent Stew Tweed and 
approved by the U.S. Coast Guard.  Participants, in collaboration with the Cape 
May Seafood Association, are certified as Drill Conductors, and are approved by 
the USCG to conduct the required monthly safety drills.  According to Tweed, 
"...This incident vividly illustrates  the importance of safety training, the 
value of these courses."  The rescue will be featured on an upcoming broadcast 
of the nationally-syndicated television show "Rescue 911."<br>

<h4>SEAFOOD SAFETY INCREASED WITH NEW TRAINING PROGRAM</h4>
Pending federal regulations for Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points 
(HACCP) inspection procedures _ requiring seafood workers to be trained to 
properly handle seafood _ prompted Florida Sea Grant to form "The Seafood HACCP 
Alliance" of industry leaders, regulatory agencies and educational groups to 
help the seafood industry and regulatory agencies implement proper HACCP 
programs.  Sea Grant programs nationwide will help train seafood quality control
workers, as well as federal and state seafood inspectors, which will increase 
the safety and quality of processed seafood while improving consumer confidence 
in the product.  "When the new regulations go into effect, we want to make sure 
the industry not only understands them, but can also complies with them in a 
reasonable manner," says Steve Otwell, Florida Sea Grant Seafood Specialist.  
The federal regulations, which affect some 5,000 seafood processing plants and 
at-sea factory ships, take effect in 1996.  <br>

<h4>GRILLING MAKES "BEST" FOOD BETTER</h4>
Grilling seafood is "the only way I know to make the best food better," says 
North Carolina Sea Grant Seafood Education Agent Joyce Taylor.  Taylor offers 
several tips:  (1) The fire, whether gas-generated, charcoal or wood, shouldn't 
be too hot, and the grill shouldn't be too close to the fire.  Either can result
in a charred exterior of the food being grilled; (2) The fat content in fish or 
shellfish needs to be considered when grilling it _ lean fish need to be basted 
frequently to keep moist whereas fatty fish doesn't usually require basting; (3)
Do not overcook seafood.  Cook fish only until it flakes easily when tested 
lightly with a fork.  Generally, fish require ten minutes of cooking per inch of
thickness, but Taylor suggests beginning to check for doneness in about half 
that time; (4) When your seafood is done, be sure to place it on a clean plate 
to avoid contamination.<br>

<h4>ROUGHY NOT SO FAT AFTER ALL</h4>
Most of the fat content once reported for orange roughy is not digested by 
people, according to Doris Hicks, Delaware Sea Grant Seafood Technology 
Specialist.  Orange roughy, found off the coasts of New Zealand and Australia, 
was originally said to have 7.0 grams of fat per 100 grams of raw product.  
However, about 90 percent of this fat is a waxy ester, a type of fat that some 
fish, like orange roughy, need for survival in cold, deep waters.  The good news
is that because this fat or wax ester is not digested by people, it is not 
counted as calories because it doesn't provide energy.  Under the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration's voluntary labeling program for seafood, orange roughy's 
fat content is now reported at 1.0 grams for three ounces of cooked product, 
with no saturated fat making it a healthy meal for people seeking to avoid fatty
foods.  <br>

<h4>CATCHING TOXIC ALGAE BEFORE IT KILLS</h4>
A single-celled, microscopic algae, "Heterosigma carterae," releases a toxin 
that has caused multi-million dollar fish kills worldwide.  Washington Sea Grant
Program Researchers Rose Ann Cattolico and Laurie Connell are developing a test 
to predict the presence of this toxic algae before it can reach densities high 
enough to injure fish.  During one algae bloom in 1989, 95 percent of the salmon
at three Washington salmon farms died, a loss estimated at $2 million.  The 
toxin can also compromise reproduction of sea urchins, a valuable commercial 
fishery, and one that plays a critical role in coastal ecosystems. Heterosigma 
blooms may also reduce food supplies for shellfish by using up nutrients in the 
water, or by producing substances that suppress the growth of more beneficial 
algae.  "Pacific oysters may become weak because they won't eat the Heterosigma.
Oyster larvae also seem to be affected by these toxic blooms," says 
Cattolico.  <br>

<h4>YELLOW PERCH FISHERY LOOKS BLEAK</h4>
The yellow perch fishery in southern Lake Michigan is rapidly deteriorating for 
reasons not yet known.  Fishing groups and managers at a recent Kenosha, 
Wisconsin conference agreed management action should be taken in this situation.
 "The near future looks bleak.  It's ironic _ you could close down the perch 
fishery completely, and four years from now it will still be in poor shape, 
because it takes young perch three to five years to grow to catchable adult 
size," says University of Wisconsin Sea Grant Fisheries Specialist Clifford 
Kraft.  The Great Lakes Fishery Commission has organized the Lake Michigan 
Yellow Perch Committee, a group comprised of biologists from surrounding states,
to coordinate interstate efforts in addressing the Lake Michigan perch 
decline. <br>

<h4>ALARMS KEEP PORPOISES FROM DROWNING IN NETS</h4>
A new device has been successfully tested by New Hampshire Sea Grant researchers
to curtail the growing problem of harbor porpoises drowning after becoming 
entangled in gill nets.  The acoustic alarms, which have battery-operated 
noisemakers inside to make the fishing gear more "visible" to marine mammals, 
were tested for three months last year in the Gulf of Maine.  Fifteen commercial
fishermen set strings of experimental gill nets in an area where large numbers 
of porpoises were known to be.  Each string of net was comprised of 12 nets and 
had either 13 active or 13 control (non-functional) alarms.  Twenty-five 
porpoises were taken in 421 control strings and two porpoises were taken in 423 
active strings, thus indicating the alarms' effectiveness in the Gulf of Maine. 
The alarms may be modified for use in other areas around the country.  <br>

<h4>BLADDER VENTING HELPS SAVE GAMEFISH</h4>
When recreational anglers pull reef fish up from deep water, the changes in 
pressure often result in the overinflation of the fish's swim bladder.  As a 
result, if the fish is too small to keep and is returned to the water it will 
probably float helplessly until eaten by predators.  To help solve this problem,
Florida Sea Grant agents are teaching charter boat crews and individual anglers 
how to successfully "vent" these fish to relieve the excess pressure.  By 
inserting a specially-designed tool into the fish, the excess pressure is 
released and the fish can return to deep water.  Jay Humphreys, Florida Sea 
Grant Communications Director says, "We haven't completed studies on the 
released fish yet, but it is obvious the venting greatly increases their chances
of surviving to maturity."  <br>

<h4>A GROWING GOBY THREAT IN THE GREAT LAKES</h4>
Lake Superior has received an unexpected and unwelcome visitor -- a round goby. 
The four and one half inch, bottom dwelling fish was found in the 
Duluth/Superior Harbor by a National Biological Service (NBS) crew trawling for 
Eurasian ruffe, another exotic fish infesting the harbor.  NBS routinely 
conducts surveillance and monitoring for ruffe throughout the Great Lakes.  "Due
to its size, this round goby likely got here sometime in the last two years from
ship ballast water taken from another infested Great Lakes port.  It's likely 
that if there is one, there are many more," says Doug Jensen, Minnesota Sea 
Grant Exotic Species Information Center Coordinator.   The goby is considered 
undesirable because new populations tend to grow rapidly, aggressively taking 
over prime habitat, and displacing native fish.  The recent sightings of new 
infestations in Lake Superior, Ashtabula River and Lake Erie have fishing 
interests concerned  throughout the Great Lakes region.<br>

<a name="toxin">
<h4>DEADLY TOXIN ON THE RISE</h4>
Despite Alaska's pure water image, scientists say Alaska's recreational and 
subsistence shellfish harvesters are increasingly at risk for paralytic 
shellfish poisoning (PSP).  PSP is a naturally occurring, but sometimes deadly 
marine toxin that can infect shellfish.  The toxin attacks the nervous system of
people who eat PSP-tainted shellfish, and can cause paralysis or death.  "We 
think for the next several years, the occurrence of toxic algae blooms will 
become more frequent along coastal Alaska increasing the chances for PSP 
outbreaks," says Ray RaLonde, Alaska Sea Grant Aquaculture Specialist.  He 
points to changing ocean conditions and increased pollution as the source of 
nutrients that stimulate growth of the algae carrying the toxin. Although 
shellfish from many popular subsistence and recreational beaches in Alaska are 
not tested for PSP toxin, commercially harvested and cultured shellfish must 
pass rigorous screenings for marine toxins before they are sold. Still RaLonde 
suggests people be careful in digging for clams and other shellfish on their 
own. Last year one person died of PSP and at least an additional 26 people 
became seriously ill. <br>

<h4>SAVING THE SALMON MAY BE MORE CONTENTIOUS THAN SPOTTED OWL</h4>
Regional settlement and development have put the Northwest in the midst of a 
salmon crisis, and the struggle to save them "seems likely to become the most 
costly, complicated and contentious biological restoration effort ever 
undertaken," states Joseph Cone, Oregon Sea Grant Communications Director, in 
his recent book <i>A Common Fate</i>.  
Proposals to modify operations of Columbia River
dams carry price tags into the billions of dollars, while salmon protection and 
restoration efforts on public and private forest and range lands could have much
broader economic consequences than efforts to protect the northern spotted owl. 
According to Cone, many argue that "the salmon crisis will make the furor over 
the owl look like a 'walk in the park'."  Cone believes the fate of the region 
and our own future is connected to that of the salmon. <br>

<h4>FISH KILLER PRESENT ALONG EASTERN ATLANTIC SHORE</h4>
A toxic dinoflagellate which paralyzes fish and sucks away their flesh has been 
discovered by North Carolina Sea Grant Researchers JoAnn Burkholder and Ed Noga.
 With at least 15 life stages, the dinoflagellate has been found in North 
Carolina estuaries and other spots along the East Coast.  "Right now, we are in 
the middle of a 13-day fish kill.  A 17-mile stretch of North Carolina's Neuse 
River has lost three million fish so far to the dinoflagellate," notes 
Burkholder.  Lab workers have suffered memory loss, disorientation and speech 
impediments after prolonged exposure to the dinoflagellate's active, 
toxin-emitting phase.  North Carolina Sea Grant has received $585,000 in state 
funding to further research the dinoflagellate's role in coastal fish kills, the
"hot spots" where it occurs, its ecological requirements and management,

<h4>NAVIGATION SAFETY IMPROVED, DOLLARS SAVED</h4>
Taxpayers should save millions of dollars thanks to a device designed by New 
Hampshire Sea Grant researchers to improve navigational safety.  The new 
collision tolerant pile structure (CTPS), will be used to support the markers 
known as aids to navigation (ATONs).  The rigid, wood pile structures now used 
by the U.S. Coast Guard are easily damaged when struck by commercial vessels, 
and hundreds of these structures are lost annually--each costing $5,000 to 
$10,000 to replace.  By replacing the wood piles with the new CTPS, costs can be
reduced and navigation safety enhanced.  The new device is hinged just above the
mudline and has compression springs that return it to an upright position after 
a collision.  Thirty CTPS were built for the Coast Guard for about $20,000 each.
 They have already been deployed in San Francisco Bay, New York City's Harbor, 
Mobile Bay, and the Houston Ship Channel. <br>

<h4>CRAB SHELLS MEAN BETTER POTATOES, MORE WHEAT, FASTER 
HEALING BURNS</h4>
Discarding crab shells at a summer cookout might mean throwing away a 
possible medical cure and disease preventative for both plants and animals.  
Chitin, a biodegradable, non-toxic compound found in crab shells, is uniquely 
able to bond with many other compounds.  One of the compounds derived 
from chitin is chitosan, and its ability to bond with plant DNA could mean 
higher crop yields for farmers around the world.  Washington Sea Grant 
researcher Lee Hadwiger discovered that chitosan can trigger genes in 
plants that fight disease.  Using that basic research, he has developed  a 
process that today is helping potatoes fight "Verticillium wilt," a threat to 
Washington State's $469 million potato industry.  He has also developed an 
anti-fungal treatment for wheat seeds.  "Chitosan is a reasonable, 
economical treatment," notes Hadwiger.  Additional Washington  and Delaware 
Sea Grant research has laid the foundation for the development of a chitosan 
burn dressing that fights infection and chitosan fibers that filter heavy 
metals from sewage and toxic waste. Over 15 patents have been awarded for 
Sea Grant chitin research, and major companies such as Dupont and ConAgra 
are field testing chitin-based products.<br>

<h4>FEDERAL COASTAL EROSION RELOCATION FUNDING GOING OUT WITH THE 
TIDE</h4>
With the busiest hurricane season on record only half over, shore-front 
property owners face major changes in federal coastal erosion insurance 
policy funding. After September 23, individual property owners will be
 personally responsible for funding the demolition or relocation of their 
erosion-threatened buildings.  Congress has repealed the legislation that 
provides public assistance through the National Flood Insurance Program 
(NFIP) and placed the September deadline on filing claims.  North Carolina 
Sea Grant coastal construction and erosion specialist Spencer Rogers says 
in the future, flood insurance will cover only losses from actual storm or 
flood damage. Since 1988 more than 240 erosion-threatened buildings on 
the North Carolina coast have been voluntarily moved or demolished using 
federal funds. In that same time span, the program cost $24 million 
nationwide, with $13.3 million of that awarded in North Carolina. Intended 
to save tax dollars by encouraging property owners to move buildings 
before harmed, the legislation left the choice to individual owners.  The 
majority chose demolition at an average cost of $66,000 per building 
versus $32,000 for relocation, despite the fact that many buildings were 
in good shape and the cost of moving was cheaper.  <br>

<h4>AquaNIC --- SEA GRANT'S EASY USE COMPUTER WINDOW TO 
AQUACULTURE INFORMATION</h4>
Microsoft's release this week of Windows '95, has no doubt peaked the 
curiosity of computer users.  Sea Grant has helped take the lead in the 
world of fish farming with the new AquaNIC computer system--access 
to aquaculture information made easy.  "One of the system's unique features 
is its linkage to other aquaculture databases on the Internet," says 
LaDonn Swann, Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant Aquaculture Extension Specialist.  
AquaNIC provides fast access, a wide variety of information, individualized 
searches, and better yet, it is free of charge provided one has direct Internet 
access. Commercial carriers such as Prodigy, CompuServe and Delphi, all 
of which charge an access fee, also link to AquaNIC. Aquaculture, the farming 
of fish, shellfish and plants, is nearly a $1 billion dollar industry in the 
United States and has grown 425 percent over the last decade. <br>

<h4>
SPACE SATELLITE, SHUTTLE TECHNOLOGY AIDING UNDERWATER RESEARCH 
</h4>
The Space Shuttle and high-flying satellites hundreds of miles above the 
Earth are helping unlock the secrets of coastal waters, thanks to research efforts in remote sensing being conducted by the Delaware Sea Grant program.  Vic Klemas, Director of Delaware's Center for Remote Sensing, says the high tech cameras used by satellites and on the Space Shuttle flights are a big boost to researchers trying to understanding ocean currents and how they impact weather, coastal erosion, water quality and fishery stocks. Klemas notes that "having quick access to this information can be invaluable in anticipating the path of an oil spill, in conducting more effective search-and-rescue missions at sea, and in analyzing coastal water quality."  One way Klemas has used the satellite technology is mapping changes in coastal wetlands and submerged vegetation that play a key role in near shore fisheries. Now he is working to integrate the remotely sensed satellite and Space Shuttle data with geographical information system (GIS) techniques to study relationships between land use changes in coastal watersheds and the health of wetlands and estuaries.  "The combination of these technologies can provide significant information for policy makers in developing coastal management plans," say Klemas.<br>

<h4>
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SITE FOR NEW SEWAGE POLLUTION MONITORING TECHNIQUES
</h4>
Researchers with the University of Southern California Sea Grant program 
have developed new technologies to monitor sewage outfalls, a major 
challenge for water quality and waste water management authorities in 
large urban areas.  Working with Los Angeles and Orange County Sanitation 
District 
officials, USC Sea Grant researchers developed a special "Tow-Yo" sensing instrument package that allows on site mapping of sewage plumes, gathering simultaneous physical and bio-optical data. The results are multi-dimensional maps of effluent plumes, identification of particulates and the 
ability to distinguish effluent particles from phytoplankton and resuspended sediment particles.  Moored instruments which also measure physical and optical variability have been developed to provide time-series information which complements the tow-yo observations. These technological improvements foster improved information for coastal water quality authorities concerned with historical and present deposits of contaminants on the ocean bottom -- contaminants that could impact marine life.  The technology will also allow scientists to better determine what clean-up and preventive measures are most 
effective -- both scientifically and economically.

<h4>
IRISH AMERICAN EXCHANGES BENEFITING LOBSTERS
</h4>
Credit an Irish-American exchange program on aquaculture with helping promote 
better management of lobster.  Recognizing that they share common waters, many 
common marine species, and common problems, Connecticut Sea Grant Director 
Ed Monahan has guided an informal idea into an ongoing program that has 
resulted in a series of scientific symposium; student, researcher, and 
fishermen exchange visits; and research that is impacting the aquaculture 
of lobster and other crustaceans. Results of this exchange include new 
techniques to determine the age of lobsters aiding in population management; 
the establishment of an Irish Lobstermen's Association promoting industry 
regulations designed at bettering management and conservation; research 
on breeding a better commercial lobster; and new ways to reduce the harmful 
effects of dragging fishing gear on lobster habitat.  As the project develops 
new focuses including other species such as salmon, oysters, sea urchins and 
abalones, it is attracting an expanding pool of scientists beyond its 
Maine-Connecticut-Rhode Island base to other areas of the United States such 
as Hawaii and California  and throughout the European Community.<br>

<h4>
STUDY PROVIDES MOST COST EFFECTIVE MODEL FOR GREAT LAKES CLEAN-UP
</h4>
New EPA Great Lakes' clean-up plans, announced March 13, give Great Lake 
state and tribal governments flexibility to choose local strategies for 
reducing the amounts of toxic pollutants such as mercury, PCBs and dioxin in 
the lakes to federally mandated levels.  A five-year study of PCBs in Green 
Bay funded by the EPA, and based on over 25 years of Wisconsin Sea Grant 
research, offers a model for determining the most cost-effective strategies 
for  meeting the standards. The Green Bay study shows most of the PCBs 
entering the bay today come from contaminated Fox River sediments, but 
that attempting to remove them would retard the bay's recovery by churning 
up the pollutants into the water. "Except for cleaning up one highly 
contaminated stretch of the Fox River, modeling results show that the most 
effective strategy for eliminating PCBs from Green Bay over the next 25 years 
was simply to let them become buried in bottom sediments," says Anders 
Andren, Director of the University of Wisconsin Sea Grant Institute. The 
result: a projected $500 million clean up bill will be reduced to around 
$15 million. Anders points out the Green Bay model might be an approach that 
could be adopted by other Great Lakes communities seeking cost-effective 
clean-up strategies for reducing toxic pollution.<br>

<h4>
"NOT IN "MY" LAKE!"  ---  BOATER  EDUCATION NEEDED TO SLOW 
SPREAD OF ZEBRA MUSSEL PEST </h4>
A recent Minnesota Sea Grant survey of 2,400 boaters in Ohio, Wisconsin and 
Minnesota shows that recreational boaters represent both a significant risk 
for spreading exotic aquatic species like the zebra mussel, as well as 
a potentially significant deterrent in their spread.  Minnesota Sea Grant 
researcher and project director Jeff Gunderson says that many boaters have a 
sense of personal responsibility and a desire to keep the pests out of 
"their" lake or stream. Gunderson's study found that while significant numbers 
of boaters were unaware of the zebra mussel problem, those that were aware 
often did take action to help slow its spread..  The survey also showed that 
educational programs do have an impact on boater awareness and behavior 
toward the spread of exotics. "These programs must continue if the spread of 
the zebra mussel is to slow down," says Gunderson. A tiny European shellfish, 
the zebra mussel was first found in the Great Lakes in 1986, and has since 
spread to waterways in 20 states, causing hundreds of millions of dollars 
in damages to power and water treatment plants and other industries. Boaters 
need to exercise caution and take preventative measures when transporting 
their craft. Among the actions recommended are taking care to clean outer 
hulls and trailers for all exotic species and marine vegetation, and avoid 
transporting of any kind of water (bilge, bucket, ballast or transom), which 
is ideal breeding grounds for such exotics.

PANAMA CITY, FLORIDA: #1 SPRING BREAK BEACH</h4>
With its clear, sky-blue water, gentle slope and some of the best fine-white 
sand in the country, Panama City, Florida has always been an idyllic 
setting. Now make the panhandle resort the number one Spring Break destination 
says Steve Leatherman, a Maryland beach expert better known as "Mr. Beach" 
for his annual ratings list of America's best beaches. Leatherman notes that 
Panama City government and Chamber of Commerce team to attract nearly  
500,000 vacationers from the East,  Midwest and as far as Canada during the  
seven-week spring break season. "They're doing a great job allowing the 
kids to raise a little hell without getting anyone hurt," says Leatherman. 
Just down the road is St. Andrews State Recreation Area, one of Leatherman's 
national "Top 10" beaches, a spot where spring breakers can beat the crowds 
and save some money by camping. Leatherman's other top spring break beach 
destinations: #2 - South Padre Island, Texas;" #3 - Daytona Beach, FL; 
and #4 - Ft. Lauderdale, FL. Leatherman's next "Top 10" rating of beaches 
nationwide is due out Memorial Day.

<h4>RECREATIONAL BOATING PROVIDES $1 BILLION IMPACT IN MARYLAND</h4>

Maryland recreational boating expenditures total $1.01 billion annually, 
providing a net economic boost of over $980 million annually to the state of 
Maryland, according to a Maryland Sea Grant study released this week. 
Coordinated by Doug Lipton, Director of Maryland Sea Grant Extension Program, 
the report finds that, on average, boaters of all classes each contribute 
$5,136 annually to the state's economy, generating the equivalent of over 
18,000 full-time jobs. Thirty-four per cent of the expenditures result in 
actual wage payments and compensation to Maryland residents. "The study 
demonstrates that the restoration and protection of the Chesapeake Bay has 
important economic implications," says Lipton. "A degraded bay means less 
boating, less income, and less employment generated in the region. When 
boating is impacted, positively or negatively, there are concurrent impacts 
across the economy."  Lipton said economic studies in other areas of the 
country - Florida, Washington State - have shown similar results. The study 
was based on a 1993-1994 survey of owners of private recreational boats 
registered in Maryland.<br>

"CELIBATE" OYSTERS STAY FIRM DURING SUMMER
Oyster lovers generally avoid indulging during the summer months because they 
know that shellfish become watery and less appetizing during the 
warm-weather spawning season. But a new breed of genetically-engineered 
oysters may challenge this popular wisdom. The new oysters, called triploids 
because they have three sets of chromosomes rather than the normal two, 
produce practically no sperm or eggs during the spawning season. Thus, they 
retain the body size and texture of cold weather oysters during the summer 
months, and are more resistant to parasitic diseases. They also grow faster 
in warm, nutrient-rich waters. The down side: triploid oyster seeds are more 
expensive. Triploids are being farmed on about 450 acres of tidelands in 
Washington and Northern California. "I estimate the triploid harvest this 
year will total about 540,000 gallons with a wholesale value of about 
$16.2 million," says Washington Sea Grant Specialist Terry Nosho.  A second 
triploid oyster evaluation program is underway in North Carolina where 
11 aquaculturists are working with North Carolina Sea Grant aquaculture 
specialist Skip Kemp to determine ways to make the oysters 
economically feasible.<br>

<h4>NORTH CAROLINA CRABBERS LAND 22 TONS OF TRASH</h4>
Nearly a quarter of a million crab pots are discarded each year in 
North Carolina, and many have ended up polluting tidal creeks and riverbanks, 
giving crabbers a reputation of poor environmental stewardship. That 
reputation may change if a North Carolina Sea Grant pilot recycling project 
first tried last month continues. Between January 24 and February 5, crab 
fishermen, many affiliated with the North Carolina Crabber's League of Aware 
Watermen (CLAW), turned in a total of 4,600 pots, weighing nearly 20 tons, 
as well as 1.75 tons of used trawl nets to 17 community drop-off sites along 
the  North Carolina coast. The nets were baled and shipped overseas for 
recycling into sneakers, bicycle seats or jacket liners, while uncoated metal 
crab pots went to local scrap dealers. The fact that the project encourages 
proper disposal of used gear, and provides new solid waste options for the 
commercial fishing industry has crabbers exploring continuing the project 
on their own.<br>

<h4>MIDAS TOUCH CONVERTS "TRASH" FISH, FUELING ECONOMIC GROWTH IN PACIFIC

Oregon Sea Grant researchers have the King Midas touch successfully converting 
a traditional "trash" fish, Pacific whiting, into a valuable fishery

in the Pacific Northwest.  Found in abundance off the Oregon and Washington 
coasts, Pacific whiting had been a  "trash" fish because its' flesh 
quickly turned mushy after being pulled from the water. As a result it 
was rejected by processors. That was before Oregon Sea Grant researchers 
developed new processing techniques to make high quality products - such 
as imitation shrimp and crab - from whiting surimi. The mixture of 
abundant supply and technical innovation fuels an economic boom on 
the Oregon coast. In 1990 Oregon landed only 5,000 metric tons of 
Pacific whiting. By 1992, landings totaled 50,000 metric tons, generating 
more than $30 million in income.  Projections for 1995 onshore processing 
anticipate $50 million in income for Oregon - 60% growth in just two years.  
Further evidence of the value of the Pacific whiting industry came last 
week, when Oregon Senator Mark Hatfield (R) and Rep. Elizabeth Furse (D) 
attended a groundbreaking for the $4 million OSU seafood research lab and 
$2 million seafood consumer center in Astoria. The ceremony followed a  
recent $20,000 gift to the lab for continued development of value-added 
whiting products from a whiting fishing boat owner. "The gift," says OSU lab 
director Michael Morrissey, "indicates laboratory research is on target 
with valuable information being transferred to the fishing and 
processing industry, both on and off shore."  <br>

<h4>NEW TUNA TRAWLING TECHNIQUES PROVING SAFER FOR DOLPHINS AND SEA 
TURTLES</h4>
Specially designed nets, state-of-the-art handling gear, and depth-monitoring 
equipment are enabling a group of New England fishermen to reduce the 
risk of sweeping up dolphins, sea turtles and other endangered species while 
pair trawling for tuna.  Pair trawling, which involves dragging a net 
from both ends by two boats working in tandem, has been banned because 
of high bycatch problems. However, with the approval of the National Marine 
Fisheries Service (NMFS), MIT Sea Grant fisheries engineer Clifford Goudey 
has worked with 10 fishing vessels to fine-tune pair trawling 
techniques to reduce the bycatch problem while fishing for bigeye, yellow 
fin and albacore tuna along the southern edge of George's Bank. Goudey 
reports fishermen have succeeded in narrowing their catch to the target 
species. NMFS regulators will review results of the experiment this March 
and may allow the fishery to continue. However, they may limit access 
to experienced or specially trained crews. If approved, pair trawling for 
tuna could provide boats with an economically feasible fishery alternative 
to severely depleted groundfish stocks of cod, haddock and yellowtail 
flounder.<br>

<h4>"THE CHILD" THROWS A TANTRUM: WARM, WET WINTER LINKED TO EL NI&Ntilde;O</h4>
Record high temperatures across the northern and eastern United States, 
combined with record-setting rainfall in California can be blamed on the 
temper tantrums of ocean and weather patterns known as "the Child" or El 
Ni&ntilde;o. Named after the Christ Child by Peruvian fishermen, El 
Ni&ntilde;o is an 
annual Christmas-time warming trend in South Pacific ocean currents off 
Peru that periodically creates dramatic changes in overall atmospheric 
temperature patterns. This year the patterns have moved the jet stream north, 
allowing a warm air flow resulting in the unusual temperature readings and 
rainfall patterns. According to Alaska Sea Grant climate expert Joseph 
Niebauer, the El Ni&ntilde;o weather pattern is both a blessing and a bane - 
Alaska temperatures are warmer, skiing conditions improving in the West, 
longer harvest seasons in the Midwest, but flooding in California and Europe 
and dramatic migratory shifts in fish populations.  Niebauer notes that the 
term El Ni&ntilde;o can be confusing - some 
use it in reference to seasonal weather 
and ocean patterns in the South Pacific, others using the term to describe 
globally disruptive or unpredictable weather activities. <br>

<H4>CHESAPEAKE BAY'S BLUE CRAB POPULATION DECLINING</H4>
Preliminary results of a six-year survey show a 62 percent decline in the 
blue crab population of Chesapeake Bay,. The Maryland-Virginia crab fishery 
is considered the last commercially healthy fishery in the Chesapeake and in 
1993 its 112.1 million pounds of blue crab landings accounted for 45 percent 
of the blue crab caught in the United States.  The survey begun in the winter 
of 1988-1989, raises concerns that the Bay's most valuable fishery may be in 
danger of depletion through overfishing. Sponsored by the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration and coordinated by the University of Maryland's 
Chesapeake Biological Laboratory, the survey involved sampling the density 
of crabs at 1,200 sites chosen randomly around the bay. Researchers estimate 
that the crab population dropped from 1.75 billion in 1988-1989 to 664 
million last winter, and preliminary indications are for further declines to 
be posted at the end of this winter's sampling in late February.  While the 
commercial harvest reached a six year high of 113 million pounds in 1993, 
scientists fear that intensive fishing methods in which 50 to 92 percent of 
all commercially viable crabs are caught each year may be reducing the 
breeding stock to dangerously low levels.  The result has been increasing 
debate between resource managers, environmentalists and watermen over the 
need for further restrictions beyond recently imposed limits on hours and 
gears imposed by both Maryland and Virginia in the past year. <br>

<H3>Here are a couple of Valentine's Day theme stories on seafood 
safety and healthy eating:</H3>
<a name="message">
<H4>A MESSAGE FOR LOVERS: EAT SAFE - COOKED SHELLFISH BETTER THAN RAW </H4>
Roman emperors, Casanova and Henry the Eighth are said to have devoured 
large quantities of shellfish to boost their famous libidos. The legendary 
potency of oysters, clams, mussels and other shellfish may have a grounding 
in scientific fact: Shellfish are known to be among the best sources of 
zinc, copper, manganese, iron and other trace minerals that are essential 
to vigorous sexual function.  Today shellfish like oysters retain that 
mythological attraction as an aphrodisiac, but seafood experts say consumers 
should practice safe seafood eating by avoiding the tradiional raw oyster 
on the halfshell for the cooked ones.  "The chances of getting a bad oyster 
from a reputable dealer are virtually nil," says Mike Oesterling, a Virginia 
Sea Grant Advisory Specialist. Shellfish sanitation agencies regularly 
conduct rigorous inspections of shellfish waters and of processing, 
packing and shipping facilities to ensure that all products delivered to the 
consumer are free from bacteria and other contaminants.  Still he says that 
for maximum protection, shellfish should be cooked before eating. "Cooking 
destroys all harmful bacteria, so shellfish can be enjoyed risk-free." 
Oesterling points out that all shellfish-producing states adhere to 
rigorous national safety standards - standards that will improve even 
more in 1996 when "HACCP - Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point " 
regulations will affect some 5,000 seafood processing plants and at-sea 
factory ships. The National Sea Grant College Program is the leader of 
an alliance forged between industry and government regulators aimed at 
training the thousands of workers who monitor the nation's seafood 
safety and quality in the procedures needed to implement HACCP procedures.<br>

<a name="heart">
<H4>HAVE A (HEALTHY) HEART - TOSS THE FRY PAN ! </H4>
Throw away the frying pan!  Yes that's the advice of North Carolina 
Sea Grant's Joyce Taylor. The healthy heart benefits of eating 
seafood and fish are well known: high in protein, low in harmful fats 
and cholesterol. Also, fresh seafood is naturally low in sodium and 
most finfish contain fewer than 100 milligrams of sodium for each 3 
1/2 ounce serving, compared to about 2000 milligrams in a single 
teaspoon of salt. The problem says Taylor is that people often fail 
to reap the full health benefits of seafood by cooking it improperly 
or choosing processed rather than fresh foods. Taylor, a seafood education 
and safety specialist, suggests baking, broiling or grilling fish and 
shellfish. She points out that these methods make for a more moist, 
flavorful fish with fewer calories and saturated fat. If one must fry, 
she suggests using a vegetable oil with a high unsaturated/saturated 
fat ratio, such as canola or safflower oils. While cardiologists used 
to recommend lean cuts of fish, recent research into the fish-rich 
diet of Eskimo Indians indicates that omega-3 fatty acids, found most 
readily in fatty fish, actually help to fight heart disease.<br>

<center><h2>Sea Grant's Basic Science Yields Good Return on Investment</h2>
</center>

        As the great budget debate ensues in Congress the importance of funding
basic scientific research is often overshadowed. Science projects and programs
are seen as easy targets for reduced funding or elimination. Basic scientific
research provides our nation's technological and intellectual infrastructure. 
Ignoring the importance of funding scientific research programs is as dangerous
to mortgaging our future, as is allowing uncontrolled deficit spending.<P>

        Most of us recognize government cannot finance all societal needs.  Not
every problem can be solved by throwing government money at it. A good number of
government programs have failed, but there are others that have succeeded - some
remarkably so despite little public fanfare or significant taxpayer dollars. 
The National Sea Grant College Program is one such program.<p>

        Today nearly 100 million United States citizens live within 100 miles of
a coastal waterway - the Great Lakes, the Atlantic or Pacific Oceans or the Gulf
of Mexico.  Just 15 short years from now that population mass will total in
excess of 127 million.  These population demographics alone dictate just how
valuable this $55 million basic science program aimed at coastal and ocean
issues is to the future of America's taxpayers.<p>

        NOAA's National Sea Grant College Program is based at universities
throughout the United States. It is a program providing critical, objective 
information leading to the wise use, conservation and management of our coastal 
and marine resources.  Established by Congress 30 years ago, Sea Grant does 
problem and issue-oriented basic research. Its scientific research is 
peer-reviewed with an unique value-added component that also enables Sea Grant 
to educate and transfer technology to citizens. By addressing its research into 
areas that will make a difference in large sectors of society such as coastal 
communities, Sea Grant is a model for inventive and flexible approaches to 
problem solving.<p>

       Unfortunately there are those in Congress today who don't place a high
value on scientific problem solving.  They are the ones that tend to forget that
science is not about the future, but rather it is the future.  Science is the
bricks and mortar which has built many of the things we take for granted in our
life today.  <P>

        Sea Grant, through a cost-sharing partnership among universities,
government and the private sector, has played a major role in aquaculture,
fisheries management, marine biotechnology, marine education, coastal
engineering, seafood safety, coastal and estuarine environmental management, and
marine technology development.<p>

        Real world problem solving applications of Sea Grant research has
produced, among many things,  improved hurricane resistance construction
designs, new medical products produced from crab shell wastes, desalination of
sea water for irrigation and drinking water, oil spill clean-up procedures, and
a better understanding of the science of our fisheries resources which will
insure that they will be available for our children and grandchildren.<p>

        As Congress debates needed budgetary and government reform, hopefully 
America's citizens won't abandon the bricks and mortar of their future. With
nearly half the nation's population residing in our coastal areas, and millions
of our citizen's visiting our coasts as tourists, Sea Grant activities are
vitally important.  The National Sea Grant College Program is building bridges
between academic scientists and the real needs of citizens.  Today it needs your
voice in support in this debate. <p>

<center><h2>Science Education Critical to our Children's Future</h2>
by Lundie Spence<br>
North Carolina Sea Grant</center><p>


       As a marine educator, I am most interested in focusing on environmental 
and earth sciences and with providing educators with information, tools and 
techniques for better educating students about nature, geology, ecosystem health
and global change. <p>

        For more than 20 years, marine educators from NOAA's National Sea Grant 
College Program and the National Marine Educators Association have introduced 
teachers to the concepts of  marine science and served as a conduit for relaying
the latest ocean and coastal research from the laboratory to the classroom. 
These training sessions, workshops and field trips are paying off. <p>

        It is estimated that by the turn of the century, more than 75 percent of
the American population will live within 50 miles of a coastal or Great Lakes 
shoreline. It is time we teach our children how they will affect these valuable 
and fragile ecosystems. They need to understand that coastal and Great Lakes 
water quality is important if we want to continue to harvest fish and shellfish 
for the table. They should realize that trash tossed in our waters kills aquatic
life. They need to know that fish, shellfish, beaches and marshes are common 
property resources that belong to all of us, and for which we all share 
responsibility.<p>

        Likewise, our children need to understand how the oceans affect them. 
They need to know the power of a hurricane, the unrelenting nature of erosion, 
the influences of ocean currents such as El Nino and the warnings of ecosystem 
degradation that come in the form of algal blooms, fish kills and red tides.<p>

        It is clear we need to keep teachers informed about new ocean 
discoveries, such as the deep-sea communities of crabs, clams and tube worms 
found hot vents. We need to bring new technologies and scientists directly into 
the classroom, but here's the challenge: Wouldn't it be wonderful if our 
children held the same esteem for scientists as they hold sports figures such as
Michael Jordan, Shaquille O'Neal, Joe Montana or Mike Schmidt?  We as a adults, 
especially parents and teachers, must have more understanding of our nation's 
scientists and their discoveries and contributions to our society before we can 
expect the same from our children. <P>

        One way to increase student interest in science, particularly marine 
science, is to stress the subject's relevancy. More and more teachers are trying
to capture student attention and overcome the stigma of difficulty associated 
with science by showing children why the subject is important to them.  
Environmental study allows students to observe and analyze science in their own 
backyards. Science projects such as stream and river monitoring help children 
link the health of streams in their neighborhood to connecting rivers and 
eventually to the ocean. Soon students see that actions in their homes --- water
 consumption, pesticide use and waste disposal --- have effects on marshes and 
offshore waters hundreds of miles away. By making the topic relevant, students 
now understand the complicated concept of watersheds.  <P>

        It should be obvious that marine and coastal studies are not just for 
students in coastal states. The ocean, as part of the earth science curriculum, 
is studied nationally. Educators with the National Sea Grant College Program, 
the National Estuarine Research Reserves and National Marine Sanctuaries 
routinely receive questions from teachers in non-coastal states like Colorado 
and Kansas.  Much of the geology of this country has been shaped by the rise and
fall of sea level and crustal plate movements. Why else are Cambrian 
trilobites--about 600 million-year-old marine, crablike fossils --- found in 
Cincinnati, Ohio?<P>

        NOAA brings its research, prediction and modeling capabilities into our 
lives daily through  weather forecasts, navigational charts, fisheries research 
and ecosystem studies. Students are the future explorers of our earth 
environment, which is every bit as exciting as space exploration. In fact, 
Kathryn Sullivan who until recently served as Chief Scientist of NOAA was a 
three-mission veteran of NASA's Space Shuttle. Sullivan is both a geologist and 
oceanographer, bridging the gap between space and ocean research and 
exploration.<P>

        Educators should reaffirmed the importance of including environmental 
science in the their curriculum.  Secondly, they must also understand that many 
environmental changes are based on the actions of people. <P>

        People, particularly children, should be taught to understand their own 
impacts on the environment and develop a sense of stewardship for our natural 
resources. The ability to take tools, access or generate data and solve problems
is one of the goals of science education and one of the products for 
environmental education. Without teachers who convey this message to our youth 
--- teachers with confidence based on their continued learning and association 
with researchers --- science education loses its relevancy.<P>

<h2>Aquaculture - The way to meet growing fish demand without depleting wild
fisheries?</h2>


Here are some basic facts about aquaculture in the United States as well as 
brief examples of Sea Grant research efforts in this developing industry.  
Contact names and phone numbers are provided for each story idea. If you have 
further questions, please contact Sea Grant Media Relations Coordinator Ben 
Sherman at 301-405-6381.<p>

<b>AQUACULTURE - A BRIEF OVERVIEW:</b>
        Aquaculture, the farming of fish, shellfish and plants, is nearly a $1 
billion dollar industry in the United States.  Aquaculture growth nationwide has
accelerated rapidly in the U.S. and abroad --- accounting for nearly 20 percent 
of the world's harvest of fish, shellfish and seaweeds.  Between 1980 and 1990, 
U.S. production grew 425 percent increasing in value from $192 to $760 million. 
In Maryland, with hundreds of small aquatic farmers, that value is currently 
estimated at an annual production value of  $18 million, up from $10 million in 
1988.<p>

        While the U.S. exported $3.1 billion of seafood in 1993, the nation 
imported $5.8 billion for a negative balance of payments of $2.7 billion. Most 
of the nation's shrimp consumption depends on farm-grown shrimp from other 
countries. Aquaculture represents a possible way to significantly reduce this 
area of the U.S. trade deficit.<p>

        With commercial fisheries in the United States under a great deal of 
stress from overharvesting, farmed fish and shellfish hold promise to meet the 
rising worldwide demand. "Promise," however, is the important qualifier. Without
substantial scientific breakthroughs in techniques to reduce the cost of 
producing farm-reared seafood, aquaculture will remain an industry of promise.
<p>
        
        For the next stage of aquaculture growth _ for more business start-ups, 
for greater production, for improved profits and reduced risk _ advanced 
research must help find ways for helping to better control reproduction of 
broodstock, to grow fish faster, to improve nutrition, to control diseases and 
develop new disease diagnostic methods.<p>
        
        Sea Grant sponsored scientists around the country are working at the 
forefront of such techniques in molecular biology and biotechnology, in 
developing new hybrid strains, in producing new tools for diagnosing disease. 
<p>

        Here are several examples of Sea Grant science projects / presentations 
in aquaculture from the around the nation:<p>


<h4>LOUISIANA SEA GRANT</h4>
    Biofiltration units:  Researchers at LSU have developed a cost-efficient 
biofiltration unit that is finding new uses in a many areas of aquaculture - 
from crawfish farms to tropical fish for the pet store industry. The unit is the
result of efforts to provide a reliable, easily-maintained water quality control
systems that meets needs for efficient nitrification, maintenance of adequate 
dissolved oxygen and acid levels, and provides solids removal --- qualities that
are the key to success in large-scale recirculation aquaculture technology. 
Using a bead-filtering technique the unit can be produced in a variety of sizes 
to meet needs of small users such as home water gardeners or large users like 
commercial tilapia facilities.<br>

<h4>MARYLAND SEA GRANT</h4>
       Control of spawning of striped bass:  Advanced molecular research by 
Yonathan Zohar at the University of Maryland's Center of Marine Biotechnology at
the new Columbus Center in Baltimore has been leading to successful development 
of techniques to breed captive striped bass all-year round. Currently, striped 
bass farming is limited to capturing fertile fish on the spawning grounds in a 
short period during the spring. Zohar's work could profoundly affect striped 
bass farming, production of which has already climbed from 200,000 pounds in 
1990 to more than 650,000 pounds in 1994. <br>

       Oyster disease: Gerardo Vasta at the University of Maryland's Center of 
Marine Biotechnology has been among the leaders in the laboratory rearing of 
Dermo, the deadly parasite responsible for the near-elimination of harvestable 
oysters in Chesapeake Bay. The ability to culture Dermo is the first major step 
in early detection of disease and in exploring techniques to combat Dermo. 
Robert Anderson at the University's Center for Environmental and Estuarine 
Studies has been uncovering cellular mechanisms that appear to restrict the 
effectiveness of the oyster immune system.<br>

       New farm-reared species: Reginal Harrell of the University's Center for 
Environmental and Estuarine Studies is examining the potential of different 
strains of hybrid striped bass, crosses of striped bass with other species that 
can lead to faster and hardier growth. Species new to the region, tilapia, for 
example, are already being produced, while other species are currently under 
consideration for growing in ponds as well as in recirculating systems.<br>
<b>Contact For More Information:  Reginal Harrell  410-228-8200</b><p>

     Maryland aquaculturists: The industry is made up of many small aquatic 
farmers _ some 200 have permits to grow finfish, while 400 hold leases on bottom
grounds of the Chesapeake Bay to rear oysters.  <br>

<h4>NORTH CAROLINA SEA GRANT</h4>

    Flounder In Aquaculture's Future: North Carolina Sea Grant researchers are 
working to make the summer flounder the next fish to make a splash in 
aquaculture ponds. Flounder are one of the most popular fish worldwide, but wild
stocks are declining. To feed the world's hunger for this mild-flavored finfish,
aquaculture offers the possibility of a constant supply of quality fish. 
Research is aiming to domesticate a broodstock, manipulate the flounder's 
spawning cycle and acclimate the saltwater fish to freshwater ponds. Already, 
the researchers have spawned their first larvae, trained the juveniles to live 
in ponds and introduced the flounder to commercial fish feeds. <br>

<h4>OHIO SEA GRANT</h4>

    Improved Hatchery Yields:  A 15-year project at Ohio State University, 
funded by Sea Grant, has resulted in new aquaculture hatchery techniques that 
have dramatically increased survival rates of fry.  Changing the time when 
rearing ponds were filled in relation to when fish were added, changing the 
timing, amount and type of fertilizer added to the ponds, and significantly 
increasing the number of fish in the ponds are proving to be major boosters to 
efforts to maintain natural fish stocks by increasing hatchery fingerling 
success.  The Ohio Sea Grant project has seen the quadrupling of walleye and 
saugeye output and survival rates increase tenfold.  Researchers have been able 
to increase Ohio's fingerling yields from 1.3 to 6 million annually without 
increasing pond area or personnel.  At the same time fertilizer costs were cut 
95 percent.<br>

<h4>VIRGINIA SEA GRANT</h4>

       Bay Scallops Marketing:  Scientists and marketing experts at the 
Virginia Institute of Marine Science are working on developing the potential of 
the bay scallop as a whole, in-the-shell product. Although the culturing of bay 
scallops is beginning to expand, the marketing of whole in-the-shell product is 
in its infancy. Efforts in bay scallop culture include working with cooperators 
to grow, harvest and market the product. Work is also being done to better 
evaluate alternative market forms, such as individually quick frozen whole 
animals.<br>

    Aquaculture Recirculating Water Systems: Scientists at Virginia Tech's 
Recirculating Aquaculture Demonstration and Research Facility, the largest  and 
most sophisticated of its kind in the U.S., are conducting research aimed at the
growing competition for limited water resources. Minimizing water use and waste 
water discharge on fish farms is critical to the future of aquaculture 
development. Growing fish in recirculating aquaculture systems is a new concept 
that is sometimes compared to poultry or pork production methods. This approach 
allows systems that can maintain fish at extremely high densities while keeping 
water quality near optimum conditions. The results should allow the expansion of
aquaculture opportunities into geographic areas that are sited near large urban 
markets or are normally unsuitable to grow fish.<br>

    Genetic Engineering of Shrimp:  Virginia Tech College of Veterinary 
Medicine researchers introduced a foreign "marker" gene into freshwater prawns 
in order to develop and refine procedures for DNA insertion. These protocols are
now being adapted for a species of saltwater shrimp that ranks high in economic 
significance in both American and foreign aquaculture. The results from this 
study will lay a foundation for transfer of genetic codes to enhance production 
and profitability for crustacean aquaculturists.  A follow-up project will 
demonstrate and quantify the effect of growth hormone (GH) on prawns, and 
genetically modify prawns to produce GH. Animals engineered to produce extra 
growth hormone are expected to grow faster and/or to a greater size than 
untreated animals -- a definite plus for aquaculturists. According to the 
investigator, "Success in these efforts would constitute a milestone in the 
application of biotechnology to aquaculture, and usher in a new approach to 
problems of husbandry and culture of invertebrate food animals."<br>

<h4>WASHINGTON SEA GRANT</h4>

    Selective Breeding Triples Salmon Growth:  Sea Grant researchers at the 
University of Washington are using selective breeding techniques -- the same 
approach that has allowed for the development of larger broiler chickens for 
example --- to transform the wild native coho salmon into a tamed food source.  
Theresearch has developed a new coho salmon breed that is helping support a 
domestic industry worth approximately $5 million at the wholesale level. The aim
of the research has been to produce a broodstock capable of rapid growth and 
good survival in intense culture conditions. Starting with as many as 120 coho 
families, the result was two principle coho lines that have tripled the 
traditional size of aquacultured salmon raised in the U.S. In 1978 a yearling 
weighed no more than 0.6 pounds - by 1990 yearlings tipped scales at 1.45 to 2 
pounds.  More significantly the weight a mature two-year old increased from an 
average of 1.9 lbs to 6.7 pounds - a 250 percent increase. Work continues on the
project.<br>

<h2>Reef Life Important Part of Planet Ecosystem</h2>

Coral reefs are a resource of immense value for 
food, tourism, coastal protection and biodiversity of species. They are in 
serious decline, with 10 percent of the earth's coral reefs having already been 
destroyed.  It is estimated that unless stringent protection measures are taken 
soon, most of the world's reef resources will be lost within the next 100 years.
Water quality has been identified by scientists as a major contributor to coral 
decline. Commons sources of this degradation include: sediments from poor 
land-use management, coastal dredging, heated, chemically-treated effluent from 
power plants, nutrient-enriched human sewage, pesticides, industrial sewage, oil
spills, and oil and gas exploration and extraction. The loss of coral reef 
ecosystems will cause societal and ecological impacts extending far beyond the 
immediate reef environments.<p>

<h3>EXPERT SOURCES / COMMENTARY:</h3>

<h4>MARYLAND SEA GRANT</h4>
<b>Christopher F. D'Elia, Director Maryland Sea Grant College 
Program, Professor of
Marine Biology, University of Maryland, (O) 301-405-6371, 
E-Mail: <a href="mailto:sherman@umbi.umd.edu,
delia@cbl.umd.edu">delia@cbl.umd.edu</a></b><br>
<b>Areas of Research / Media Topics:</b> Estuarine and coral reef 
ecology with emphasis
on nutrient processes and materials budgets; Eutrophication; Population issues; 
Global warming. D'Elia is one of the scientists credited with discovering the 
importance of nitrogen as a nutrient pollutant.<br>
<b>D'ELIA COMMENTS:</b><br> " Coral reefs, 
like coastal communities world-wide, are under 
great stress.  Reefs are important in numerous ways.  For example, they are 
reservoirs of oceanic biodiversity; they protect coastal shorelines; they 
provide habitat and productivity for coastal fisheries; they provide economic 
value in tourism and 
recreation; and they provide great natural beauty.  The U.S. has coral reefs in 
Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Hawaii and U.S. Pacific island 
territories such as Guam.  The "health" of all of these reefs is of concern, but
probably nowhere is the threat to reefs greater than in the Florida Keys.  Since
sediment and nutrient inputs are known to be particular "enemies" of coral 
reefs, most reef restoration efforts are now focusing on reducing sediment and 
nutrient inputs from landward sources.  There is presently little reason for 
optimism in the near term, as the task of reducing inputs has only just begun, 
whereas the problems have been in the making for decades."<p>

<h4>FLORIDA SEA GRANT</h4>
<b>Walter Goldberg, Chair and Professor of Biological Sciences, Florida 
International University
(O) (305) 348-3659<br>
Areas of Research / Media Topics:</b> Goldberg is currently conducting 
a Florida Sea
Grant project looking at the effects of turbidity on the growth and health of 
corals.<br>  <b>GOLDBERG COMMENTS:</b><br>  "As coastal 
development accelerates worldwide, 
turbidity also increases due to construction, nutrient loading, and numerous 
other factors.  The resulting decreases in water clarity can have serious 
impacts on the survival of coral reefs."<p>

<b>Richard Dodge, Assistant Director, Oceanographic Center, Nova Southeastern 
University
(O) (305) 920-1909, e-mail: <a href="mailto:sherman@umbi.umd.edu, 
DODGE@ocean.nova.edu>
DODGE@ocean.nova.edu</a><br>
Areas of Research / Media Topics:</b> Dodge is looking at the trend of  recent 
years, in which widespread algal blooms have had a severe impact on the health 
of the coral reefs off southeastern Florida.  Nutrients are fueling these 
blooms, but the source of these nutrients, whether natural or human-caused, 
remains unknown. This Florida Sea Grant project focuses on the study of the 
skeletons of stony corals to determine their chemical and growth chronology as a
way to identify the sources of the harmful nutrients. <br>
<b>DODGE COMMENTS:</b> "Algal 
blooms pose a serious threat to the survival of America's only living coral 
reefs. Identifying the source of the nutrients feeding these blooms is not only 
imperative in Florida, it can also have a major impact on  reducing harmful 
algal blooms that threaten other reefs throughout the world."<p>

<b>Brian Lapointe, Dennis Hanisak, Associate Scientists, Harbor Branch 
Oceanographic Institution
(O) (407) 465-2400<br>
Areas of Research / Media Topics:</b> Since 1991, widespread blooms of Codium 
isthmocladum have smothered hard and soft corals, as well as sponges, along the 
coastline of Palm Beach and Broward counties.  This Florida Sea Grant project is
testing the hypothesis that sewage outfalls and outwelling from inlets in areas 
with high human populations are initiating and feeding the blooms. The results 
could have major impact on how the development of urban areas is regulated to 
protect corals and other coastal resources.<p>

<br>
<b>DOLLAR COMMENTS:</b><br>
 "The Clean Water Act and other regulations implemented in the 
`70s have given reefs in the United States the ability to recover, and now the 
reefs here in Hawaii are in relatively good health.  Our work has shown that man
and nature can co-exist without negative impact on the environment, given 
careful management and regulation."  <P>

<h2>Waste More Than Just An Aesthetic Problem</h2>

 Marine debris and litter has become both a 
significant coastal and open ocean problem. Considerable portions of this debris
is made of persistent synthetic materials such as plastics, and is not 
biodegradable as past product waste has been.  Surveys have indicated that 
nearly 80 percent of marine debris originates from land-based activities.  The 
increasing influx of people into coastal zones _ nearly 50 percent of the U.S. 
population now lives within 100 miles of the oceans boarding the country or 
along the shores of the Great Lakes _ has exasperated the problem. This trend 
has increased dependence on processed, manufactured and packaged goods.  Marine 
debris not only is an aesthetic problem, but has become a serious threat to 
marine life, a marine transportation hazard, and can threaten human healthy and 
safety as well as inflict serious economic loss. Estimates of marine life 
endangered by debris included most of the world's turtle species, 25 percent of 
marine mammal species, and more than 15 percent of seabird species.  Plastic in 
water appears as food to many varieties of marine life resulting in often fatal 
ingestion. For boats, both commercial and recreational, debris entanglement in 
motors or water intake valves can prove costly. Human activities such as 
swimming, diving and simple walks along the beach can also result in injury or 
entanglement.  Debris , especially plastic film and sheeting, can settle over 
immobile plants and animals including valuable ecosystem habitats such as coral 
reefs, effectively smothering them and rendering them uninhabitable and 
unproductive. Reducing waste, promoting recycling, public education efforts and 
volunteer coastal monitoring are major means of addressing coastal sources of 
marine debris.<p>

HART COMMENTS:</b><br> "Ten years ago, North Carolina Sea Grant recognized 
that marine 
debris was becoming a significant problem. More people were living and playing 
in our coastal zone, and a significant portion of these people were leaving 
behind their litter. We launched the state's first beach cleanup. It was small 
at first - 1,000 volunteers. But we soon expanded, enlisting other state 
agencies, nonprofit organizations and corporations. We also realized that marine
debris was more than a beach problem. It was a watershed problem. Litter was 
flowing down our state's rivers to the sea. We expanded the cleanup inland to 
include all North Carolina counties. Big Sweep became the nation's first and 
largest statewide waterway litter cleanup. We secured a title sponsor and 
funding for the cleanup event and a host of other corporate sponsors for our 
educational efforts, which include two aquatic litter activity books for 
teachers, a recyclable boat litter bag for boaters and anglers, a video, 
brochures and more. In 1991, North Carolina Big Sweep incorporated as nonprofit 
organization with the sole mission of reducing waterway litter. We're having an 
impact. Our trash totals from the cleanup have dropped for three consecutive 
years while our volunteer turnout has remained steady. More municipal and county
governments are placing trash receptacles at waterfront recreational areas. In 
general, more people are aware of aquatic litter and the problems it poses. Big 
Sweep has won numerous awards and been cited as a stellar, national example of 
what a public-private partnership can accomplish."<p>

<h2>Metals Toxicity Can Contaminate Human Food Chain</h2>

Dissolved metals are a part of a health marine 
environment.  However, when additional concentrations of metals accumulate as a 
result of land-based activities, marine organisms and humans can be at risk 
through contamination of the food chain. Among metals that can become toxic 
under certain conditions are arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, 
silver, and tin.  The effects of mercury in fish can impact their reproductive 
rates, and thus their sustainable use as well as impact the health of those who 
depend on fish as a food source. Municipal wastewater, as well as economic 
activity such as mining, manufacturing, and power production are sources of 
additional metals in the marine environment.<p>

<h2>EXPERT SOURCES / COMMENTARY:</h2>

<h4>MARYLAND SEA GRANT</h4>
<b>Joel E. Baker, Professor, University of Maryland System's Center for 
Environmental and Estuarine Studies, Chesapeake Biological Laboratory
(O)(410) 326 7205,  E Mail: <a href="mailto:sherman@umbi.umd.edu, 
Baker@cbl.umd.edu">
Baker@cbl.umd.edu</a><br>
Areas of Research / Media Topics:</b> Modeling contaminant transport 
and fate in 
natural waters; atmospheric deposition of contaminants; aqueous physical 
chemistry of hydrophobic chemicals; organic carbon dynamics in marine, 
estuarine, and lacustrine systems; environmental analytical chemistry; Pollution
in Chesapeake Bay and the Great Lakes; Atmospheric Deposition; Biomagnification 
of Chemicals in Sport and Commercial Fisheries.  Baker has been a lead 
researcher in a five-year toxics research program funded by Maryland and 
Virginia Sea Grant, and NOAA's Chesapeake Bay Office.<br>
<b>BAKER COMMENTS:</b><br>  "Are toxics causing people to 
drop dead in the streets? Of, 
course not. Are toxics causing a widespread, ecosystem-level change to the 
Chesapeake Bay comparable to that which resulted from excess nutrient loadings? 
Probably not. ... Are there regions where levels are high enough to cause toxic 
effects on (i.e. kill) the native organisms? Absolutely.  Are we exposing 
ourselves to harmful levels of toxics.  Probably depends upon who you are, where
you live, and what you eat.  Relative to smoking and driving, the risks of 
Chesapeake Bay toxics to a healthy adult are likely small.  Whether the same is 
true for a child breathing contaminated, ozone-rich air in a city and getting a 
large fraction of their dietary protein from catfish and crabs caught from 
beneath an interstate overpass is much less clear.   Who is the regulatory 
system trying to protect?  This comes down to a value judgment. More knowledge 
helps us sharpen that judgment and more intelligently weigh the costs and 
benefits involved.  No research study, however, will alleviate our 
responsibility to make tough calls. I believe, when in doubt, we should err on 
the side of the non-renewable resources than favor the short term gain."<p>

much of the history of 
social progress, of technological innovation, of war and peace, and of economic 
growth and decline, all mixed with the complex array of chemical properties that
characterize the metals themselves and the various physical forces that 
determine the movements of water and sediments. ...  In Rhode Island remarkable 
reductions in the inputs of metals to Narragansett Bay have been achieved over 
the past 40 years, and especially over the past eight to 10 years. For metals 
such as copper, chromium, and lead, the current inputs are almost certainly 
lower than they have been for over a century. The reductions have come about as 
a result of air and water pollution control legislation, as well as changes in 
the economy of the bay watershed...It is also true, of course, that legislation 
has no effect if it is not enforced and that sewage treatment plants only 
function as well as they are staffed and maintained."<p>

<b> CHURCH COMMENTS:</b> <br>"When people are present and using such 
waters to dispose of 
trace metals that have been concentrated during ore refinement or manufacture of
metal products, for example, it's just as likely that a toxic metal is limiting 
plant growth.  It doesn't take much metal disposal in coastal waters and 
estuaries to have an adverse effect on marine life because toxicity can occur at
very low levels _ say, one millionth of a gram per liter of water.  That's 
roughly equivalent to a grain of sand in an Olympic-sized swimming pool."<p>

<h2>Both Good And Bad For Marine Environment</h2>

 Nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus are 
essential for a healthy marine environment. However an overabundance of 
nutrients can literally be too much of a good thing. Excessive nutrients can 
trigger excessive algae growth, or eutrophication. The result is reduced 
sunlight penetration, reducing vegetation, reduction of bottom-dwelling animal 
habitat, and an increase in oxygen consumption.  Nutrient run-off from farmland 
and urban landscaping is a major cause of this pollution problem.<p>

<b>NIXON COMMENTS:</b><br> "It is certain that large areas 
of the world's coastline have 
been, and will continue to be exposed to inputs of nitrogen that are many times 
greater than they were prior to the introduction of urban water supplies, the 
intensification of agriculture, and the combustion of fossil fuels. It is highly
likely that these factors will conspire to spread the phenomenon of coastal 
marine eutrophication to the shores of many developing nations in the coming 
decades. ... It seems inevitable that coastal waters around the world will 
become greener, browner, redder [as a result of increased plankton growth due to
eutrophication]. We are still far from understanding all the consequences of 
that coloring, but it signals a major change in an important part of the ocean. 
As the human population continues to expand, the environmental costs of feeding 
people and processing their wastes will continue to grow."<P>

<b>D'ELIA COMMENTS:</b><br> "Nutrients, the nitrogen 
and phosphorus compounds that are 
by-products of sewage treatment and are also found in fertilizers used to 
promote the growth of crops, gardens and lawns, can, in excess, be deleterious 
in coastal waters.  Increasing development and population growth in coastal 
areas world-wide are causing increasing runoff of nutrients from the land and 
inputs of sewage wastes to coastal waters.  This may cause overgrowth of algae 
in receiving waters--the algae then die and consume oxygen needed for survival 
by fish and shellfish.  Chesapeake Bay is a well known example where this has 
occurred.  Efforts are now underway to limit both the runoff of nutrients from 
the land and to treat sewage effluents to reduce nutrients.  It is too early to 
say whether the goal of 40% reduction in inputs will be met or whether success 
will be achieved in restoring the oxygen content of the Bay's waters, however, 
early indications are that the nutrient control strategy adopted has at least 
stemmed further deterioration in water quality."<p>

<h2>Louisiana Sea Grant Bio-Remediation Research Shows Promise </h2>

 Oils contaminate the marine environment from a 
variety of sources: onshore and offshore petroleum exploration, production, 
refining and storage activities; urban and industrial run-off from paved areas 
where vehicles are serviced; casual disposal of oil-change material into storm 
drains or onto the ground; and lubrication leakage from both commercial and 
recreational marine vessels. Oil can cause behavioral changes, and retard growth
and reproduction rates of marine organisms ranging from plankton to marine 
mammals and humans. If not degraded or absorbed into the atmosphere, oil settles
into the bottom sediments where it can have long lasting impacts on the marine 
ecosystem. Estuaries,  with shallow water levels and a high presence of young 
aquatic life highly sensitive to contaminants, are a major area of concern with 
oil pollution.  <p>

Like oil persistent organic pollutants (POPS) are toxic chemicals that may pose 
significant risk to both humans and marine organisms.  POPS are easily dispersed
into the environment, and are often transported far from their origin, making 
clean-up difficult. Examples include such chemical compounds such as DDT, 
chlordane and PCBs.  While many of these compounds are no longer manufactured, 
the existing supply continues to be used in some areas, and they have a long 
half-life in the environment.  Human exposure comes through the food chain, or 
exposure to contaminated water or air. Many of these POPS are carcinogenic and 
are easily absorbed into body fat tissues of mammals where they cause 
reproductive failures, immune dysfunction and mortality.<p>

Areas of Research / Media Topics:</b> Commercial fishing, natural resource

noted as being one of the principle coordinators of the environmental clean-up 
in response to the Exxon Valdez oil spill. Since then he has become an advocate 
for environmental safeguards. <br>
<b>STEINER COMMENTS:</b><br> "We do not live in a risk-free world, 
so we must focus on how 
best to prevent spills, prepare for them, and pay for them.  History is clear on
one point: Most of our effort should be on prevention.  Once oil is in the 
water, seldom is more than ten percent recovered. While financial compensation 
can serve as a palliative for some of the human pain, money does not mitigate 
environmental destruction."<p>

<h4>LOUISIANA SEA GRANT</h4>
<b>Ralph Portier, Associate Professor, Institute for Environmental Studies, 
Louisiana State University
(O) (504) 388-4287<br>
Areas of Research / Media Topics:</b> Bioremediation; detoxification bioreactor 
design; aquatic-marine
toxicology; marine industrial microbiology; developer of patented microbes that 
neutralize toxins in both fresh- and saltwater environments. Expert on use of 
microbes in cleaning up major oil spills, Super Fund sites and hazardous wastes 
in both salt and fresh water environments; and in developing water system for 
use in space by NASA.<br>
<b>PORTIER COMMENTS:</b><br> "Petrochemical industries and 
others generate some complicated
mixtures of sludges and dealing with their impacts on the environment is our 
most pressing problem. Ideally someday scientists will be able to go routinely 
to a polluted area, draw water samples, and then in their labs design bacteria 
to clean-up the site.  Either by direct application or by addition to waste 
water treatment systems."<p>

<b>Louisiana Sea Grant Research:</b>  Along the lower 
Mississippi and other United 
States rivers, diverse industrial, agricultural and maritime activities compete 
with metropolitan residential areas for available water resources.  Accidental 
chemical spills and the discharges of industrial waste in to these natural 
waterways have caused serious concerns about the contamination of drinking 
water, the creation of public health problems, and damage to the environment.  
Since 1970 United States industry has become acutely aware of the necessity to 
prevent these problems, but present methods for recovering toxic wastes or at 
least reducing their levels in waste streams are often inadequate and 
prohibitively expensive. In addition industry has found that a method 
appropriate to treatment  of one toxic substance maybe useless against another. 
Combining detoxification approaches is costly, and sometimes results in a final 
product that is as toxic and difficult to deal with as the substances in the 
original wastes stream.  <p>

Ralph Portier, a Louisiana Sea Grant research scientist, has addressed the 
problem of multiple effluent treatment strategies through the genetic 
manipulation of various strains of bacteria.  The result is bacteria that can 
destroy hazardous wastes such as PCP, PAH, and creosote in brackish and 
saltwater environments as well as freshwater.  He has, for example, developed a 
colony of microbes that feed on polychlorinated biphenyls or PCPs, highly 
controversial industrial materials used as insulating heat conductors in 
electrical equipment. Portier's research has been approved by the EPA for use in
cleaning up several Super Fund waste sites.  His patented microbes have been 
used to clean-up oil spills including the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska, and the 
enormous Iraqi oil spills in the Persian Gulf.  Portier's microbes are one of 
the products on the U.S. Coast Guard's contingency list for use in oil spill 
clean-up.  Portier frequently designs waste treatment strategies for oil 
refineries and chemical industries; has worked with NASA to develop compact 
water treatment systems for astronauts; and recently developed a method 
detoxifying salvaged marine timber and pilings to remove creosote and heavy 
metals.<p>

<h2>Preventative Measures Needed To Reduce Sediment Pollution From Human
Land Usage</h2>

Sediments are eroded soil that is deposited in 
waterways  both from natural erosion processes as well as from human land-use 
activities. Erosion beyond natural levels can have serious impacts on 
agricultural productivity and  watershed ecosystems. Examples of human 
activities that generate sediments are agriculture and grazing, open pit mining,
road and housing construction in urban areas; and dam construction for water 
storage and flood control.  Sediment becomes a concern in marine environment 
because it can smother sensitive nearshore coastal habitats, carries excessive 
nutrients, pesticides and other contaminants, and can reduce the water 
conveyance ability of water bodies.  Modern technology can help reduce most 
major erosion problems today.

<b>TEBO COMMENTS:</b>  "Metal pollutants in sediments are by-products 
of numerous 
manufacturing processes from mining to the manufacture of circuit boards. New 
technologies are badly needed for removing these metals from waters and 
sediments, and, if possible, recovering them for recycling.  In research for 
California Sea Grant, I am employing the metal-precipitating properties of 
marine bacteria to accomplish the low-cost removal of metal pollutants. 
Specifically, I am using the techniques of biotechnology to provide a "tailored"
microbe for use in a new technology called biomagnetic separation.  The 
potential applications of biomagnetic separation technology for removal of toxic
metals is immense."<p>

<b>USC Sea Grant Sediment Research:</b> The Palos Verdes 
continental shelf contains 
large amounts of DDT and trace metals in the sediments near the White's Point 
Outfall in Los Angeles  County. White's Point is one of the nation's largest 
sewage outfalls.  Since the early 1970's DDT and other mass emissions from the 
ocean  outfall have dropped precipitously due to improvements in waste water 
treatment and better source control, but a large field of contaminated sediments
deposited from earlier years remains. Erosion from winter storms and other 
natural processes can re-inject these toxins into the water column where they 
can re-enter the food chain, damaging marine ecosystems and ultimately 
threatening human health.  The Southern California Sea Grant Program has 
sponsored research developing and utilizing cutting edge technology to provide 
information on  the mixing processes which disperses these contaminants in the 
local marine environment.  Future decisions on upgrading waste water treatment, 
on source control, and remediation of the contaminated sediment problem can be 
made on the basis of sound scientific information about natural processes in the
local marine environment, and impacts on the marine ecosystems.<p>

<h2>Wastewater Major Pollutant Challenge</h2>

Sewage is a threat to the marine environment 
because it often contains harmful chemicals, disease-causing bacteria and 
viruses, and dissolved material and solid matter. It enters the marine 
environment either through direct pipeline discharges or is carried from 
upstream sources via river systems. Storm water runoff from streets, parking 
lots, lawns and commercial and industrial developments are often combined into 
common collections systems draining directly into major watersheds with minimal 
or no treatment. The presence of contaminants in wastewater is a direct threat 
to human health. Pathogens can cause a variety of illnesses. Humans are exposed 
to these organisms through contaminated water and fish.  Many chemicals pose 
risks even at very low concentrations and can remain a threat for long period of
time as they bioaccumulate in animal or human tissue. Technology has brought a 
new viewpoints to wastewater treatment and is moving towards rapidly lowering 
the high economic costs associated with water treatment.<p>

<h4>LOUISIANA SEA GRANT</h4>

ornamental fish, and producing soft-shelled crabs and crawfish.  Holds patent on
bead biofilters being used nationwide in a variety of aquaculture 
applications--hatcheries, commercial facilities, university aquaculture 
laboratories, and even for a fish exhibit at EPCOT. Malone and his associates 
are now working at adapting this biobeadfilter process to treatment of municipal
waste water. Preliminary research indicates strong potential for a 
cost-effective system  that could treat sewage and wastewater for small cities.
<p>

<b>Louisiana Sea Grant Research:</b>  Louisiana 
Sea Grant research in the development 
of a biofiltraion unit for treating the water used in aquaculture systems is 
showing promise for meeting needs in other water treatment areas. The patented 
bead filters developed by Ronald Malone and his associates at Louisiana Sea 
Grant accomplish both nitrification and solids removal in a single efficient 
unit  that can be built in various sizes to accommodate applications ranging 
from home water gardens to commercial aquaculture facilities.  Malone believes 
the same biofiltration process can be applied to assist small towns and 
third-world areas treat waste water in an economical manner. Industries could 
also apply the filter treatment process to better reduce their waste water 
discharges as well. The fact that the biofiltering systems can be easily 
maintained, have proven reliable over long-term usage and are well-adapted to 
automation is a major plus in their future application to sewage and wastewater 
treatment. <p>

<b>USC Sea Grant Sediment Research:</b>  Ocean outfalls 
in Southern California pump a 
tremendous quantity of particulates, metals, dissolved organic matter, and 
pathogens into the local marine environment.  Although the quality of effluent 
discharged from Southern California's ocean outfalls has improved greatly since 
the early 1970's due to improved waste water treatment and better source 
control, large quantities of pollutants continue to be discharged into the local
marine environment.  Storm drain sources, in particular, emit large amounts of 
untreated waste water into the nearshore environment, especially in periods of 
heavy rainfall. Recent improvements in the technology of mapping  the coastal 
ocean are now being used to evaluate how storm water run-off affects nearshore 
habitats. Oceanographers at the University of Southern California, supported by 
the Southern California Sea Grant Program, have been pioneers in the development
and application of instrument packages which map large ocean outfall "plumes," 
and measure their dispersion and effect on marine ecosystems. This research has 
helped municipal authorities to make decisions on how to most economically and 
effectively manage their emission and wastewater treatments. Examples of 
successful applications of  this management decision process can be found in 
Orange County, California where savings are projected to be approximately $50 
million dollars per year for the next 30 years.  The application of the research
in Southern California can be extended to other regions where large populations 
live adjacent to the coastal zone.<p>

<H1>AMSEA Training Helps<BR>

Save Lives At Sea</H1>

</CENTER>

While Sea Grant research and outreach typically supports coastal economic development, one strong Sea Grant-supported program helps preserve our most valuable asset: human life.

<P>

Through a national marine safety training effort spearheaded by Alaska Sea Grant, the national Sea Grant network helps teach people in all walks of life how to stay safe and alive while working or playing on marine and inland waters.

<P>

The current national effort in safety and survival training stemmed from Alaska Sea Grant's years of working with that state's huge commercial fishing industry. Commercial fishing accounts for about half of all work-related fatalities each year in Alaska, a state where the overall worker fatality rate is 40 times the national average.

<P>

Alaska Sea Grant's marine safety and survival training effort got underway more than 20 years ago. Early projects included producing award-winning safety training videos and publications and delivering workshops for fishers.

<P>

Once effective training procedures were established, the Alaska program multiplied the scope of its effort by forming a statewide affiliation of groups called the Alaska Marine Safety Education Association (AMSEA). 

<p>

The thrust of AMSEA was to train people to become marine safety instructors who would be qualified to train other people. This approach dramatically increased the number of people who could take advantage of Alaska Sea Grant's pioneering work in marine safety and survival training. 

<P>

With passage of the Commercial Fishing Vessel Safety Act in 1988, Congress mandated the use of specific safety gear aboard fishing vessels and required that commercial fishers undergo marine safety training. 

<P>

Recognizing Alaska Sea Grant's work in this field, the fishing industry, U.S. Coast Guard, National Transportation Safety Board, and an array of other state and local agencies looked to Sea Grant to help set up delivery of new, federally mandated safety and survival training. <P>

<H2>Program Goes National</H2>



As of July 1994, nine Sea Grant programs have delivered AMSEA training to 323 marine safety instructors, 52 of whom have been accepted by the U.S. Coast Guard as certified marine safety instructors in seven states -- California, Washington, Oregon, Texas, Rhode Island, New Jersey and Virginia, with one pending in Maine. Alaska Sea Grant now is working with Hawaii Sea Grant to conduct AMSEA training for fishers in Hawaii.

<P>

Sea Grant-AMSEA training also has reached as far afield as Antarctica. In late 1993, four staff members of the McMurdo Sound research station underwent AMSEA training and now use AMSEA materials and techniques to train others at the Antarctic site. AMSEA training also is provided in Chili, South America, to crew members who work on cargo ships that supply the McMurdo research station.

<P>

<H2>Survivors Credit Training</H2>



In the first six months of 1994, about 8,350 people -- fishers, government and marine industry workers, recreational boaters, children, and others -- received marine safety training through the national Sea Grant-AMSEA collaboration. 

<P>

Over the same time, the U.S. Coast Guard counted at least 70 lives saved in Alaska alone, thanks in part to Sea Grant's leadership in the nationwide safety training effort. And a recent survey found that 23 people who underwent AMSEA training credit the training for giving them the knowledge and skill they needed to survive subsequent accidents at sea.

<P>

Sea Grant and AMSEA personnel have adapted training methods for delivery to children from kin-dergarten through high school. Sea Grant and AMSEA have collaborated to produce teacher guides, student workbooks, curriculum books and videos. These resource materials, along with instructor training, are provided to teachers so they can help their students learn the mental attitudes and survival techniques that will help them avoid and cope with outdoor emergencies.

<P>

Although it may seem callous to assign economic value to human life, the National Transportation Safety Board sets the value at $1 million per person, while the U.S. Coast Guard estimates the total at $1.2 million. Sea Grant also has worked closely with the insurance industry to identify ways the commercial fishing industry can lower risk and insurance rates.

<P>

At an even more practical level, Sea Grant-AMSEA training helps people correctly select, install and maintain high quality safety equipment. Such greater safety consciousness nourishes a growing industry that designs, manufactures, sells and services life rafts, flares, radios, survival suits, fire extinguishers and other life-saving equipment. 

<P>

This fact is borne out in a survey of graduates of AMSEA training, which showed that 58 percent of them bought new safety equipment or updated existing equipment after going through AMSEA training.

<H3>Fisheries</H3>



<H1>Observer Data Essential To<BR>

$1 Billion Fishery</H1>

</CENTER>

Wanted: Rugged, high-spirited men and women who love the sea. Must have a college degree in fisheries biology or related field.  

<P>

With the help of Alaska Sea Grant, those who fit the profile could be high seas fisheries observers, spending months at sea working in the nation's most dan- gerous industry -- commercial fishing in Alaska. Observers brave frigid seas and 40-foot waves aboard cramped ships for months at a time, all the while recording the catch of the commercial fishing fleet. At the end of each day, they radio harvest reports to scientists on shore hundreds of miles away. These reports help scientists manage the $1 billion U.S. groundfish fishery off Alaska.

<P>



<H2>Impartial Observers</H2>



The U.S. North Pacific once was the domain of huge foreign factory ships. But by the mid-1980s, the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) was established, prohibiting foreign ships from fishing within 200 miles of U.S. shores. American fishers took over where the foreign fleets left off, eager to harvest the millions of tons of groundfish -- mostly pollock and cod.

<P>

 Today these fisheries, combined with salmon, crab and halibut caught in Alaska's nearshore state-managed waters, account for more than half the nation's domestic se food harvest. Much of this seafood is exported to Japan, the major seafood export market for the United States.

<P>

 The economic boon groundfish brought to the nation's fishers also brought unique challenges for fisheries scientists charged with managing the stocks. Chief among those problems was how to get real-time harvest data from a fishery that takes place hundreds of miles from the nearest port on some of the most inhospitable seas on Earth. One idea was to place federal fisheries observers on vessels throughout the fleet, but industry, suspicious of "Big Brother," objected to the proposal. To solve the problem, the North Pacific Fishery Management Council -- a panel appointed by the U.S. Secretary of Commerce that manages the fisheries inside the federal EEZ -- asked Alaska Sea Grant to launch a pilot program to hire, train and place nongovernment observers aboard ships in the groundfish fleet.

<P>

<H2>Unbiased Third Party</H2>

 

"Sea Grant was able to bring the idea of onboard observers to industry because we are seen as an unbiased party interested in resolving fisheries conflicts and pro-moting long-term resource use," says Alaska Sea Grant Director Ron Dearborn. "Sea Grant's involvement was the critical factor in getting industry to evaluate the benefits of using observers to improve fisheries management."

<P>

With crucial industry support secured, Alaska Sea Grant launched its Pilot Domestic Observer Program in 1987. During the next three years -- using observers trained by the National Marine Fisheries Service and experienced in foreign and joint venture fisheries -- Alaska Sea Grant placed a dozen observers aboard U.S. high seas fishing ships. Sea Grant also worked with the international insurance industry on liability issues, addressed safety training needs, and reported to the North Pacific Fishery Management Council at each meeting on the progress of the pilot program. 

<P>

<H2>An Overwhelming Success</H2>



The pilot observer program was so successful that the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, with the support of the industry, mandated that nearly all groundfish ships carry observers to record the catch. Seeing the success of the Sea Grant model, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game asked Sea Grant to imple- ment an observer program for the crab and scallop fleets. Sea Grant staff also designed and implemented an observer program for marine-mammal interactions that helped specific fisheries contain costs and better protect mammals.

<P>

Soon, demand for observers far outstripped supply. More than 400 observers were needed for the crab and groundfish fleet working in Alaska. To train the required number of observers, Alaska Sea Grant nurtured the Alaska Observer Training Center at the University of Alaska-Anchorage. And Sea Grant Marine Advisory program personnel also designed the manuals used to train observers at the center.

<P>

In operation since 1990, the center has trained young biologists to identify different species of fish, crab and marine mammals, and how to record and report their ship's intended and unintended catches. Observers also are briefed on the various state and federal fisheries laws and are trained in marine safety.

<! 02-08-96  Marine Compound Makes UC's List of "Top 10" Inventions>


<center><h2>MARINE COMPOUND MAKES UC'S LIST OF "TOP 10" 
INVENTIONS</h2></center>

<font size=+1>L</font>AJOLLA, CA: A unique class of marine 
compounds developed jointly by scientists 
from the San Diego and Santa Barbara campuses of the University of California 
generated $686,000 in royalties in FY '94-95, placing the invention among the 
University's list of top ten royalty-producing inventions, according to the 
system-wide Office of Technology Transfer in Alameda.<p>

The compounds, a closely related group called pseudopterosins, are extracted 
from a Caribbean sea whip. They have been licensed to two companies for very 
different purposes.<p>

For cosmetic application, use of the natural extract has been licensed to a 
specialty chemicals firm that supplies natural bulk ingredients to the cosmetics
industry. At present, the natural extract is included in a boutique line of skin
care products.<p>

For medical use as anti-inflammatory drugs, pseudopterosins have been licensed 
to a small pharmaceutical firm. The company has completed preclinical tests of 
one pseudopterosin, a potent topical anti-inflammatory compound, and filed an 
Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration. Clinical trials on human subjects for irritant contact 
dermatitis are anticipated.<p>

"These represent just the first of what we believe will be a number of 
significant uses for derivatives of the pseudopterosins," says Dr. William 
Fenical, a marine organic chemist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UC San
Diego. With support from California Sea Grant, Fenical first developed the 
pseudopterosins in collaboration with Dr. Robert S. Jacobs, a professor of 
pharmacology at UC Santa Barbara. "The beneficial anti-inflammatory properties 
observed from these compounds are leading to their exploration in a number of 
drug therapies," says Jacobs.<p>

Fenical and Jacobs are looking ahead to the next generation of 
pseudopterosin-derived drugs, which they will develop in conjunction with the 
pharmaceutical licensee. "Our next attempt will be to develop drugs for 
inflammatory diseases such as arthritis and asthma, among others," says Fenical.
Their approach will be to "strip down" the naturally occurring molecule to one 
that is simple in structure, but nonetheless effective against systemic 
inflammatory conditions.<p>

"We are pleased to see technology transfer between the academic and commercial 
worlds occurring so successfully," says Dr. James J. Sullivan, director of the 
California Sea Grant College System, which has been supporting marine natural 
products research since 1977. "We're very confident that the marine world will 
provide any number of important new drugs and other materials for human use," he
adds.<p>

For FY '94-95, the University of California reported revenues of over $63 
million in fees and royalties on over 400 inventions. Net income (that is, 
income after expenses and distributions to joint holders, inventors, and the 
State of California) is available to support ongoing campus research and 
education programs.<p>

<H1>U.S. Scientists Lead Way In Marine Pharmacology</H1>

</CENTER>

Despite sweeping changes in health care, the drug industry remains one of the strongest sectors of the U.S. economy. In fact, high value-added chemical exports such as pharmaceuticals represent one of the nation's strongest positive trade areas.  

<P>

The U.S. Office of Technology Assessment predicts that the pharmaceutical 
industry will be "the first and perhaps most intensive proving ground 
for U.S. competitive strength in biotechnology." Like any competitive 
industry with its basis in science, however, this industry's future strength 
requires continued breakthroughs in research and development.

<P>

With support from the National Sea Grant College Program, U.S. university scientists have led the way in developing a particularly promising area of pharmacology: marine pharmacology. 

<P>

A program organized by the California Sea Grant College in 1979 and continuing today was the first systematic effort within the United States to discover and develop new drugs from marine plants, animals and bacteria.



<H2>An Untapped Resource</H2>



The interdisciplinary research conducted as part of this program by scientists at several campuses of the University of California is based on two major rationales. First, the number of new compounds being discovered from traditional drug sources -- land plants and bacteria -- has declined sharply at a time when a number of infectious organisms have developed drug-resistant strains. Second, marine organisms have never been surveyed for their biomedical potential, even though 80 percent of all life forms on Earth inhabit the oceans.  

In a pioneering effort, Sea Grant-supported scientists collected sponges, soft coral and other marine organisms in the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea and extracted promising compounds for extensive testing. 

<P>

Early on, researchers were impressed not only with the variety of marine organisms that produced promising compounds, but also with the fact that these molecules have unique structures and behave in novel ways.



<H2>Cooperation with Industry</H2>



Because an effective program of technology transfer requires  participation of industry, scientists were aggressive in introducing pharmaceutical companies to their work. The researchers have continued to interact closely with industry to make, patent and develop numerous discoveries.

<P>

Firms associated with the marine pharmacology program are impressive: Eli Lilly, Hoffman-La Roche, Allergan, Syntex, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Sterling Drug, Smith Kline Beecham, Ligand Pharmaceuticals and others. A number of firms also are marketing marine natural products discovered by this program for research purposes.

<P>

Today, the California Sea Grant group lays claim to having discovered and described more than 1,000 compounds, and 14 patents have been awarded to the University of California for this work. Marine-derived compounds with preclinical or clinical potential are emerging for many important disease areas, including cancer, in-fectious diseases and inflammation.

<P>

California Sea Grant's marine pharmacology program has become the primary 
resource for marine compounds being developed to treat inflammatory diseases. 
Scientists have identified more than 50 compounds with significant 
potential to treat arthritis, asthma, psoriasis and a host of less serious 
inflammatory conditions like injuries and headache pain. 

<P>

A new collaboration with OsteoArthritis Sciences, Inc., seeks treatments for arthritis using pseudopterosin, a compound developed by this program. Another compound, manoalide, has proved to be the model for a whole class of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.



<H2>Future Investment</H2>



Sea Grant recognizes that educating students is an effective mechanism for technology transfer. Over the past 15 years, California Sea Grant has helped train more than 80 graduate students in this dynamic new field, thereby contributing to the "intellectual infrastructure" needed if the United States is to maintain its competitive position in this field.

<P>

Along with the Sea Grant programs in Hawaii and Puerto Rico, California Sea Grant also sponsored development of a proposed national research strategy in marine pharmacology and bio-organic chemistry. The results were incorporated into a national Sea Grant initiative in marine biotechnology that received Congressional support in 1994.  

<P>

For nearly two decades, the National Sea Grant College Program has been the single major funding source for marine pharmaceutical research and development. Sea Grant has provided the U.S. drug industry with a competitive edge in using marine resources and will help ensure that our nation retains its leadership in marine pharmacology.

<H1>Sewage Outfall Study Improves Coastal Waters</H1>

</CENTER>

Ocean sewage outfalls are major sources of contaminants to coastal ocean ecosystems. This method of disposal has advantages in terms of economy and relative societal impact, but it also raises important concerns about seafood safety, public health, and ecosystem health and preservation.

<P>

The ocean offers relatively rapid dilution of many harmful substances, but it also carries particulates bearing trace metals, bacteria, viruses, DDT and other harmful substances. What are the potential impacts of these substances on urban populations and on coastal ocean ecosystems?

<P>

For several years, the University of Southern California Sea Grant Program has sponsored investigations of ocean processes and biology associated with the White's Point sewage outfall, the largest sewage outfall in the United States, discharging an average of 330 million gallons per day onto the Palos Verdes shelf adjacent to Santa Monica Bay. 

<P>

In several interdisciplinary research projects, Sea Grant scien-tists have investigated the complex oceanographic processes affecting dispersion of the outfall plume and the resuspension of trace metals and nutrient fluxes from bottom sediments near the outfall.

<P>

<H2>Contributions to the Field</H2>



Sea Grant studies have contributed greatly to knowledge of the behavior, characteristics and effects of sewage effluent plumes.  The studies have successfully mapped the resuspension of bottom sediments associated with oceanographic mixing processes.  

<P>

In addition, these studies have described the impact of the outfall plume on primary productivity, documenting the enhancement of production from nutrient input and the inhibition of growth from trace metal contaminants.

<P>

Based on the results of work by Sea Grant scientists, ocean outfall plumes can now be discriminated from other particle sources based on their physical, chemical and bio-optical properties. 

<P>

The Sea Grant studies are among the first efforts to map the spatial distribution of resuspended sediments on the continental shelf.  These measurements are important to understanding and predicting the long-term fate of particles and associated contaminants discharged presently and historically from ocean outfall systems.

<P>

<H2>Direct Benefits</H2>



The White's Point Studies have given sanitation authorities a wealth of information about the behavior of effluents in the marine environment, adding to their capacity for developing environmentally sound policies for managing urban waste. The Los Angeles County Sanitation District considers plume identification to be a major direct benefit of the Sea Grant work, enabling the agency to monitor and define the plume "envelope."  

<P>

Jan Stull, senior environmental scientist with the L.A. County agency, says Sea Grant research also contributed greatly to their ability to define and measure resuspension events.

<P>

<H2>Information Reduces Costs</H2>



Sea Grant studies on White's Point have direct implications for other sewage management agencies. For example, the White's Point research aids in modeling efforts at the Orange County Sanitation District sewage outfall, enabling them to assess the effect of sewage effluents on nearby coastal ecosystems.

<P>

According to Irwin Haydock, compliance division manager with the Orange County Sanitation District, Sea Grant helped the district save rate payers $50 million per year. Orange County is the largest sewage management agency to qualify for a full secondary treatment waiver under the Clean Water Act.

<P>

"The Sea Grant work lets us be confident that the effluent has no negative effect and, in fact, may have a beneficial effect on primary nutrients and productivity in our coastal waters," Haydock says.  "The information we've gained from Sea Grant research has helped us to achieve compliance with stringent 301(h) requirements by providing us with the information necessary to understand the dynamics of the effluent plume and the effects of the nutrients on phytoplankton."

<P>

Haydock says construction of a full secondary treatment plant -- which would be mandated without the 301(h) waiver -- would cost Orange County approximately $1.4 billion dollars, thus the savings of $50 million per year over a 30-year period.

<P>

The Los Angeles and Orange County sanitation authorities have been enthusiastic about the usefulness of these important Sea Grant-sponsored projects. In addition to research on the characteristics and behavior of the outfall plume, Sea Grant scientists have examined fluxes in the seafloor near the sewage outfall and the identification and survivability of marine viruses in nearshore waters.

<P>

One net benefit of this work is the potential for improved monitoring and decision making by sanitation authorities. As demonstrated by Los Angeles and Orange County sanitation authorities, Sea Grant research at the White's Point Outfall greatly improved the information base from which to make decisions regarding treatment of wastewater in Southern California lesson learned here can be applied to other large sewage treatment plants around the nation.

<H1>Effluent Plume Studies Yield New Technologies</H1>

</CENTER>

Studying sewage outfalls is a major challenge for water quality and wastewater management authorities in large urban areas. The University of Southern California Sea Grant Program, in a suite of interdisciplinary studies at the White's Point sewage outfall, has developed new methods for studying major sewage effluent plumes. 

<P>

These new methods let scientists accurately map effluent plumes, identify particulates and distinguish effluent particles from phytoplankton and resuspended sediment particles. This Sea Grant work is among the first to systematically map the spatial distribution of resuspended sediments on the continental shelf, a measurement that is important to under- standing ocean outfall systems. Work sponsored by USC Sea Grant also has improved a towed sensor array, initiated the measurement of plume optical properties, improved methods for extracting pore water from cores, developed a Benthic Sampling Effectiveness Measure and allowed the first in situ testing of outfall plume models.

<P>

Sea Grant research has been important in improving the "tow-yo" package for coastal research. The package is a towed sensor array adapted by Sea Grant scientists to gather simultaneous physical and bio-optical data at sites near the White's Point sewage outfall. The combination of "tow-yo" mapping with moored time series data in the outfall plume area has enabled scientists to increase the resolution of ocean sampling. 

<P>

The Orange County Sanitation District plans to adopt the "tow-yo" package for monitoring, to replace the current use of fixed location profiles, and to develop a more dynamic sense of effluent dispersion and primary productivity response to the discharged nutrient regime in nearshore coastal waters. Other sanitation districts around the country may adopt this technology to improve their data-gathering capabilities.

<P>

USC Sea Grant research also provided some of the first measurements of the spectral optical properties of effluent plumes. These optical properties can distinguish effluent particulates from phytoplankton and bottom resuspension. This work opens the possibility of monitoring effluent plumes with remote-sensing technology, using satellite or high resolution aircraft sensors to increase accuracy and efficiency. 

<P>

<H2>Ocean Outfall Study</H2>



In closely related studies, Sea Grant researchers have developed technology and techniques for extracting pore water from benthic cores, allowing scientists to measure the flux of metals and nutrients into the water column from the sediments around sewage outfalls. 

After modifying the "USC Lander" for core sampling and applying their new methodology, the researchers analyzed changes in pore water associated with fluxes of trace metals and nutrients around the sewage outfall. These are the first direct measurements of benthic recycling rates and the mechanisms that release bottom sediments containing heavy metals, nutrients and toxins, including DDTs. This and other USC Sea Grant research can be used to study the resuspension of contaminants on any continental shelf.

<P>

USC Sea Grant sponsored the development of the "BENSEM" (Benthic Sampling Effectiveness Measure) at California Polytechnic University, Pomona. Standard sampling methods involve towing an otter trawl net along the bottom to collect organisms and count changes in population density for resident species, but there is no way to determine whether the trawl is running on the ocean bottom or  is skipping over the research area during the 10-minute sampling run. The BENSEM device counts the actual time the trawl is in contact with the ocean bottom, allowing for major improvements in the accuracy of coastal sampling methods.

<P>

<H2>Prototypes Tested</H2>



Prototypes of the BENSEM device were tested by the Los Angeles and Orange County Sanitation Districts. Local sanitation districts now use the BENSEM device and thus rely on Sea Grant results for improved standardization in sampling. This improved coastal monitoring procedures.

<P>

In addition to improvements in methodologies for gathering data and developing detailed maps of effluent plumes, techniques developed by Sea Grant scientists have provided accurate data for evaluating plume models developed by ocean engineers. The in situ testing of new technologies accomplished by USC Sea Grant researchers is one of the few outfall plume studies conducted under real ocean conditions using natural tracers. Previous analog studies of ocean plume behavior have relied upon artificial conditions in laboratory tanks.

<P>

Improvements in ocean modeling, sampling and coastal research are promising methodologies developed by Sea Grant researchers. These technological improvements foster improved information for coastal water quality authorities concerned with historical and present deposits of contaminants on the ocean bottom. 

<P>

New and more accurate data collection will provide an improved information base upon which municipalities can make better, more informed decisions about wastewater treatment and disposal around the nation.

<center><h2>Discovery Revolutionizes Shrimp Aquaculture</h2></center>

A  method devised by a Connecticut Sea Grant researcher to increase 
the production of shrimp could revolutionize world crustacean aquaculture, 
brighten- ing the outlook for the global food supply and whetting the appetites 
of shrimp cocktail lovers every- where. The research has brought the University 
of Connecticut a U.S. patent (no. 5,161,481) and prospects for commercial 
profits.<p>

<h4>Fertility Food For Shrimp</h4>

Crabs, lobsters and other crustaceans harvested from the sea don't reproduce 
well in captivity. Female shrimp hormones are adversely affected, and larvae do 
not readily mature. This results in a shortage of both viable eggs and larvae 
that has until now thwarted fish farmers' hopes for successful shrimp 
production. <p>

Hans Laufer, a professor of molecular and cell biology, has devised a method for
introducing a vital reproductive hormone into the feed of shrimp to grow them to
maturity in commercial hatcheries. Laufer's research into improved, controlled 
shrimp farming offers the best means to produce abundant supplies of the tasty 
crustaceans.<p>

With funding from the Connecticut Sea Grant program, based at the University of 
Connecticut's Avery Point campus in Groton, Laufer and his associates in 1987 
discovered methyl farnesoate, a hormone that stimulates reproduction and growth 
in crustaceans. The discovery came by way of Laufer's studies of the similarity 
of the hormone in insects and crustaceans. (The crustacean hormone has one less 
oxygen atom.) <p>

Additional Sea Grant funding led Laufer to apply modern methods of biotechnology
to synthesize the growth hormone and incorporate it into a special shrimp 
"fertility food" made of blood- worms, squid, and mussels. The result is 
enhanced egg production -- nearly double in tests. The shrimp used in the 
research was the Pacific white shrimp, Penaeus vannamei, a tasty and hardy, 
disease-resistant species of shrimp that grows quickly to a large, plump 
size.<p>

<h4>Worldwide Implications</h4>

There are important commercial applications for Laufer's method, and it is 
eliciting interest from commercial industries both within the U.S. and overseas.
Improved shrimp farming would be a boon to the U.S. balance of trade, which owed
$2 billion to shrimp imports in l991. Imported shrimp account for 83 percent of 
the U.S. seafood deficit. Two-thirds of all shrimp consumed in the U.S. come 
from shrimp farms in Ecuador, China, Malaysia and other parts of the world, 
Laufer says.<p>

Laufer joined the University of Connecticut faculty in 1965 and has maintained a
summer laboratory at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass., for 
more than 30 years. He is a managing editor of the international journal 
Invertebrate Reproduction and Development, and edited the Invertebrate 
Endocrinology Series, published by Alan R. Liss, Inc.<P>

<center><h2>Delaware Sea Grant Releases Seafood Cookbook</h2></center>

Newark, DE. "Seafood Delaware Style," a popular cookbook first produced by the 
University of Delaware Sea Grant College program in 1988, has been reprinted and
is once again available to the public, according to Doris Hicks, seafood 
technology specialist with the Delaware Sea Grant Marine Advisory Service and 
author of the cookbook.<p>

The cookbook contains more than 30 recipes for seafood appetizers, entrees,
soups, and salads largely developed by Hicks for use in her seafood handling
and preparation workshops for audiences of all ages. Each recipe comes
complete with preparation times, serving suggestions, and nutritional
information such as calorie, protein, fat, and sodium content.<p>

"Our goal with this cookbook is to provide cooks with all the information they
need to easily and properly prepare seafood and serve it with style," Hicks
says. "Most of the recipes are simple to make, even for cooks whose experience
with seafood is limited. We wanted to encourage people to try new ways of
incorporating seafood into their diets."<p>

In addition to the recipes, the cookbook's introduction provides practical
information on the varieties of fish and shellfish available in local markets,
purchasing and handling fresh and frozen seafood, seafood preparation and
cooking, and the role of seafood in a healthy diet.<p>

The importance of the latter was underscored recently by a new study on the
benefits of fish oils in the diet published in the November 1 issue of the
Journal of the American Medical Association. In the study, researchers at the
University of Washington in Seattle found that a weekly serving of a fatty
fish such as salmon, mackerel, or albacore tuna may reduce the risk of cardiac
arrest by 50% or more. While fish and shellfish are generally low in overall
fat content, their oils contain a large proportion of polyunsaturated fatty
acids known as omega-3 fatty acids, which are thought to reduce coronary
spasms and the clumping of blood platelets, among other effects. The
researchers' results are based on both food intake surveys of more than 800
people, 334 of whom had been treated for primary cardiac arrest between 1988
and 1994, and the use of a biomarker to measure levels of the fatty acids in
the subjects' blood.<p>

"While the latest news on fish oils is positive," says Hicks, "nutritionists
have known for years that seafood is an excellent dietary choice. It's high in
protein and generally low in sodium, calories, and total fat--as long as it's
prepared without frying or rich sauces-- and it's packed with vitamins and
minerals. Of course, to maximize the health benefits of eating seafood, the
product should be fresh and handled and stored in a manner that discourages
the growth and spread of dangerous bacteria. That's why we have also provided
tips on selecting, storing, cooking, and handling fresh or frozen seafood and
leftovers."<p>

Additional information on safe seafood handling and the nutritional benefits
of seafood is also available from Delaware Sea Grant. An eight-page bulletin,
"A Consumer Guide to Safet Seafood Handling," and a two-page note, "Seafood Is
Good for You," are both available free of charge for single copies.  The
cookbook, "Seafood Delaware Style," is $4 per copy, which includes shipping
and handling. To order any or all of these publications, send your request
along with a check or money order payable to the University of Delaware, to
the Marine Communications Office, University of Delaware, Newark, DE
19716-3530. For more information about these or other Delaware Sea Grant
publications, call (302) 831-8083.<p>

<H1>Crab Wastes Developed Into Multiple Products</H1>

</CENTER>

Blue crabs represent an economic boon to Delaware's Delmarva Peninsula, yet seafood processors face a problem of significant proportions -- for every 2 million pounds of crab meat produced each year,  they must dispose of  about 21 million pounds of crab shell and waste. Because of the sheer volume and powerful polluting nature of this waste, some county landfills and dump sites have been closed to crab processors, forcing them to find new ways to dispose of the waste.

<P>

More than a decade ago, University of Delaware Sea Grant scientists developed a method to extract an important component from blue-crab shells, called chitin, that can be made into a wide range of products, including its acid-soluble derivative, chitosan. To date, Delaware Sea Grant has contributed to the development of several major applications for chitin/chitosan, including surgical dressings and sutures, wound-healing promoters, nutritional additives, nonallergenic cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and preservatives.



<H2>Fourteen Patents Awarded</H2>



Fourteen chitin-related patents have been issued to Delaware Sea Grant researchers and licensed by companies in the United States and abroad. DuPont ConAgra Vision (DCV), a joint venture between the DuPont Company and ConAgra, recently created a subsidiary called Vanson, which is now seeing success in several major applications areas, according to a DCV spokesman. For example, chitosan is being field tested in paper making, since a chitosan additive may improve paper's strength. Another evolving application is the use of chitosan as a seed coating to improve yield in major crops; field trials have begun on rice and wheat.

<P>

"I think chitin is going to make it," says a DCV spokes- person. "The Sea Grant research is paying off and will continue to be beneficial in the future."

<P>

In Japan, Unitika, Ltd., a major textile fiber and hospital supply firm that also has licensed some of the Delaware patents, has manufactured dressings for burns, surface wounds and skin-graft donor sites, and is developing absorbable, non-allergenic sutures from chitin that are stable in mild alkaline body fluids, such as those in the intestinal and urinary tracts.

<P>

Sea Grant's chitin research has received extensive national media coverage. A research feature in the University of Delaware Sea Grant Reporter newsletter attracted significant attention, spawning articles in the Washington Post, Business Week, Biotechnology Digest and a variety of other publications. The research also has been featured on television programs in Delaware, and even in a documentary produced by Australian TV.

<H1>Filter Desalts Seawater, Launches New Company</H1>
</center>


As a graduate student at the University of Delaware College of Marine Studies, Doug Hicks was intrigued by advisor Mic PleassÕ vision of providing coastal communities with drinking water by removing salt from ocean water using the very energy of the ocean itself: waves.

<P>

Fresh Water From Seawater



With support from the University of Delaware Sea Grant College Program, Hicks and Pleass designed, engineered and patented DELBUOY. This wave-powered buoy drives a high-pressure pump that forces seawater through a reverse-osmosis filter, which captures dissolved salts but lets pure water flow through. An especially attractive design for island nations, the DELBUOY was tested in the mid-1980s in the Caribbean Sea off Magueyes Island, Puerto Rico, in cooperation with the University of Puerto Rico Sea Grant College Program. Tests found the DELBUOY could provide drinking water at the cost-effective price of about $20 per thousand gallons.

<P>

Hicks, who earned his doctorate in 1985, now is president of Composite High Pressure Tech- nologies, Incorporated (CHPT, Inc.) in Lewes, Del. There, he and his colleagues have capitalized on the engineering know-how derived from the DELBUOY technology to create a full product line as well as custom-made versions of the DELPUMP. This patented line of motor-driven pumps is made from high-performance plastics and composite materials. 

<P>

The DELPUMP's corrosion-resistant construction, lightweight size and 
high-speed operation have made it well-suited for a wide range of 
applications, including providing drinking water for U.S. Army troops in the 
field, food and chemical processing, mining and even propelling submarines. 
DELPUMPs presently are used by all branches of the U.S. military, by the 
Canadian Army and Navy, and by businesses around the world. The DELPUMP 
product line is  being marketed internationally by FMC, a Fortune 500 company.



Commercial Potential



Although the motor-driven DELPUMP presently is the chief product of CHPT, Inc., Hicks is working to secure the capital needed to bring its forerunner, the wave-powered DELBUOY, to its full commercial potential. 

<P>

"When I was a graduate student, Delaware Sea Grant provided my advisor and me with the seed money to explore new ideas," Hicks says. "Without Sea 
Grant's
 support of that research and the engineering principles we discovered from it, this company would not be here today."

<H1>Delaware Estuary Work Affects 5 Million Residents</H1>

</CENTER>

From one of the world's largest oil ports to one of the world's most 
important staging areas for migratory shorebirds, the Delaware Estuary 
means many things to the more than 5 million people who occupy its 
shores. To University of Delaware Sea Grant scientists and outreach 
staff, the Delaware Estuary has been the focal point of more than a 
decade of work aimed at generating a portrait of the estuary's health to 
aid area residents in making wise decisions about its future.

<P>

<H2>Educating Managers</H2>



Delaware Sea Grant research has led to a better understanding of dissolved oxygen dynamics and improvements in the upper estuary; the distribution of nutrinents and organic matter; the source, pathways and forms of several trace metal contaminants; and some of the natural processes affecting summer flounder, croaker and blue crab fisheries. This information is important to resource managers who  formulate regulations regarding nutrient controls in industry, wastewater treatment and land runoff. The research also helps fisheries managers grapple with a decline  in several major fisheries.

<P>

Sea Grant research on the Delaware Estuary will continue to grow in importance as future management strategies are developed through the Delaware Estuary Program. As part of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Estuary Program, the Delaware Estuary Program seeks to bring together citizens, scientists, legislators and resource managers to plan for the estuary's improvement.  Jonathan Sharp, an oceanographer at the University of Delaware Graduate College of Marine Studies who has conducted more than a decade of Sea Grant research on the estuary, chairs the program's Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee.

<P>

<H2>Educating the Public</H2>



Outreach specialists at the University of Delaware Sea Grant College 
Program also have made significant contributions to public education about 
the estuary. Sea Grant's award-winning book, <i>The Delaware Estuary: 
Rediscovering a Forgotten Resource</i>, helped nominate the Delaware 
Estuary to the National Estuary Program in 1988 and serves as a primary 
educational tool for agencies, educators, students and the public in the 
Delaware Valley. A review in the Philadelphia Inquirer sums up the 
book's importance:



<P>
If the public is unaware of the cultural and natural richness of the 
Delaware, how can we participate in the important debates about how 
it is to be maintained? How can we assess the often conflicting 
needs of conservation and development, making reasonable choices for 
ourselves and our children? Unless we use resources like this fine, 
timely book, the simple answer is that we can't.
<P>

Sea Grant outreach staff also have surveyed area residents to assess their attitudes toward the estuary, conducted annual workshops to provide teachers in the region with curriculum materials about the resource, spearheaded organization of an annual census to gather data on horseshoe crab populations in the estuary and developed the Delaware Estuary Situation Report series to transfer research information to the public on issues ranging from fisheries fluctuations to sea-level rise. Delaware Sea Grant also produces SeaTalk radio and Coastline  television public service announcements to reach the residents who reside along and depend upon the Delaware Estuary.

<H1>Improved Sea Oats Restore Ecosystems</H1>

</CENTER>

Sea oats planted in Delaware to hold a dune in place and along the Louisiana shore to provide wildlife habitat may have more in common than appearance.

Many of these plants came to life in a Florida test tube and grew to maturity in a nursery that supplies clients with the best plantings modern science and master gardeners can produce.

Horticultural Systems, Inc., (HSI) of Parrish, Fla., has established itself as one of the nation's leaders in the growth of coastal and wetlands vegetation. Through the use of Florida Sea Grant research and the support of Sea Grant marine extension agents, Horticultural Systems has grown from a backyard, two-person hobby into a 15-acre nursery with 50 full-time employees who produce four million plants each year.

<P>

From New Jersey to Texas, in Mexico and throughout the Caribbean, plants from HSI are helping restore damaged coastal ecosystems and protect fragile beach environments from natural as well as human threats. The company's many clients include government agencies at the federal, state and local levels, and private firms involved in coastal engineering.

<P>

Science and Inspiration



Otto Bundy, president of HSI, says Sea Grant provided much of the inspiration he needed for his decision to go into the business of producing coastal vegetation. As one of the original members of the advisory committee begun by Sea Grant Marine Extension Agent John Stevely in Manatee County, Bundy learned how to combine the scientific expertise and practical advice made available by Florida Sea Grant. As his business grew, so did his use of the Sea Grant network.

<P>

"Today, I keep an open line to Sea Grant offices throughout the 
Southeast," Bundy says."I try to keep my finger on the pulse of what's 
happening, both regionally and nationally. Sea Grant not only provides a 
good source of leads for new business, it also helps me keep in touch 
with the latest technological developments."

<P>

Techniques for Success



Bundy gives Sea Grant-funded research much of the credit for the success of his business. Of particular importance to HSI was work by Sea Grant researchers Kimon Bird and Mike Kane that explored the use of micropropagation techniques to produce a variety of coastal vegetation. 

<P>

Micropropagation involves the creation of"offspring" from a superior plant in a laboratory setting. This technique allows growers to"custom design" vegetation that has a much greater chance for survival than would similar plants growing in the wild.  This enhanced survivability is particularly valuable in the harsh growing conditions found in coastal and beach environments.   Bird and Kane's research was so successful that its results were used by HSI to establish its own micro-propagation lab where various types of vegetation are produced.

<P>

Another Sea Grant-funded project that was of vital importance to HSI was David Sylvia's work with vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi-- better known as VAM fungi. Sylvia's work showed conclusively that sea oat seedlings inoculated with VAM fungi in the nursery had a much greater survival rate when transplanted at the beach than did untreated sea oats.  

<P>

In addition, their ability to hold sand in place with their root systems, a very desirable trait, was increased. Sea Grant's work also showed that the use of VAM fungi could reduce the amount of irriga-tion and fertilizers previously used to grow sea oats in the nursery.  Since 1992, when Florida Sea Grant made the VAM fungi technology available through an extension bulletin, HSI and other commercial growers have used the fungi to increase the success of efforts to replant sea oats on damaged or threatened dunes.

<P>

In return for the support HSI has received from Sea Grant, the company has served as a valuable test ground and experiment station for Sea Grant researchers. The company has made available its nursery, field projects and personnel to Sea Grant researchers nationwide who are working to create the vital vegetation need to protect America's increasingly threatened shorelines. Together, HSI and Sea Grant have shown what can be accomplished through a partnership approach between industry, universities, governments and people.

<H1>Crab Meat Recovery Increases Industry Yields</H1>

</CENTER>

Anyone who's cracked a steamed blue crab knows that a pile of waste remains after every obtainable morsel of its meat has been devoured. Steam-processed blue crabs yield only about 10 percent meat by weight when hand-picked, and the blue crab industry generates about 180 million pounds of waste each year. 

<P>

In Georgia, the picking room scrap was either discarded in land- fills or processed into low-value crab meal --until two of the state's largest crab processors contacted Sea Grant researchers at the University of Georgia for help in recovering meat from crab picking wastes.

<P>

Costs Down, Profits Up



During a three-year project supported by Sea Grant, annual minced meat recovery by the two processors increased from 20,000 pounds the first year to more than 400,000 pounds. Waste disposal costs were lowered, while profits increased from the sale of recovered meat for pet food and for human consumption as an extender in deviled crab, seafood stuffings, soups and chowders. One processor reports that minced meat sales makes the difference between net profit and net loss for his operation.

<P>

To achieve this, Sea Grant researchers first conducted studies to determine the yields and to evaluate characteristics of byproducts separated into four groups --minced white meat (recovered from "slabs" removed by the picker's first dorsal cut), minced leg meat (recovered from walking and swimming legs), minced claw meat (recovered from claws), and mixed minced meat (recovered from all picking-room byproducts except claws). These studies were completed over two summers for both commercial and experimental production of minced meat. Chemical, sensory, microbiological and nutritional qualities were then determined for these meats.

<P>

Finally, Sea Grant seafood technologists developed processing recommendations for minced meat products. They found that low temperature pasteurization and selective extraction of body parts reduced discoloration, or blueing, of minced meat. Lactic acid dips or mild steaming of picking-room byproducts also reduced bacterial levels. Blending surimi with minced crab meat was found to improve the flavor, odor and texture charac-eristics of recovered meat.



Classic Example



As a classic example of the Sea Grant concept, which places research and outreach in tandem to solve real problems for people who make their living from the sea, this project did more than cut costs and increase profits and employment in Georgia's blue crab industry. Consumers benefit from safe, new seafood products and extenders; stress on landfills was lightened, and science  advances with  new data added to the literature. 

<P>

As this work progressed, the resulting information was shared with industry and scientists through meetings and scientific journals. The Georgia Sea Grant researchers received requests for the project's technical manual from throughout the Gulf and Mid-Atlantic region. Networking within the National Sea Grant College Program also facilitated information and technology transfer: Sea Grant scientists in Louisiana, for example, moved quickly to extend Georgia's research and are now working to develop further applications for it.

<H3>Aquaculture</H3>

<H1>Hawaii Sea Grant Spurs Pacific Aquaculture</H1>

</Center>

<P>When a Sea Grant program was established at the University of Hawaii in 1968, the aquaculture industry was virtually nonexistent in the state. Although the Hawaiian Islands have the oldest tradition of aquaculture in the United States, it was looked upon an artifact of an ancient Hawaiians. Few people outside the University of Hawaii Sea Grant program and the state's Anuenue Fisheries Research Center expected the economic impact that aquaculture would have less than three decades later.

</P>

<P>The first Sea Grant aquaculture research grants to the Hawaiian program were small by today's standards -- just $25,000 the first year. But the effects of these few research dollars were far reaching. By 1990, the economic benefits of the Hawaiian aquaculture industry, based on cumulative revenues, totaled more than $315 million.

</P>

<P>Several national issues led to aquaculture research and development in the late 1960s -- growing concern about the U.S. trade imbalance, natural resource preservation and the need for rural development. One reason for Hawaii's receptivity to aquaculture was its interest in preserving the Hawaiian culture, according to John Corbin, director of the state's Aquaculture Development Pro- gram. "At that time, in the late sixties, there was an interest in preserving the walled fish ponds," he says. "There was a lot of interest in the cultural value of aquaculture."</P>

<P>During the first years of the Hawaii Sea Grant program, research in aquaculture was aimed at evaluating the culture potential of various species. This led to the creation of a coordinated program in prawn aquaculture in 1973; in the late 1970s prawn aquaculture was effectively transferred into the commercial sector. Hawaii Sea Grant then focused on culturing shrimp and studying disease prevention  in cultured species.</P>



<H2>Drawing Cold Ocean Water</H2>



<P>Hawaii Sea Grant also was one of the first to become involved in an exciting new venture: ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC). OTEC utilizes a virtually limitless natural resource around the Hawaiian Islands: deep ocean water. This pure, cold, nutrient-rich and pathogen-free water is ideal for the culture of temperate fish and other marine sources of protein. Despite skepticism, Hawaii Sea Grant researchers effectively proved the concept in projects focused on two commercially valuable cold-water species (salmon and trout) and on growing nori, an algae popularly used in many island foods. Sea Grant was the first to show the potential of deep ocean water as a valuable resource.</P>

<P>Today, OTEC aquaculture is a multimillion-dollar industry. Cold water is being utilized for the generation of energy at the Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii at Keahole Point on the Island of Hawaii. Cold water also has been used to successfully grow abalone and oysters as well as salmon and trout. Agricultural practices also have benefited from the use of cold water to cool the soil. Cyanotech, a commercial grower of seaweeds, is another highly successful OTEC aquaculture venture. The algae is used in health food products, driving the expansion of a worldwide $4 million industry.

According to the state Aqua- culture Development Program director, "All of this really resulted from Sea Grant research money and support for the potential of deep ocean water."</P>

<P>Another fundamental benefit of Sea Grant's contributions to aquaculture was the technical talent and energy provided by the Hawaii Sea Grant program's Marine Option Program (MOP). An undergraduate certificate program for students interested in careers in marine sciences, fisheries or resource management, MOP programs are now offered at various university campuses statewide.

"Sea Grant supported MOP students and research, which led to important research assistantships that  brought the industry to people all over the world," Corbin says.



<H2>Diversifies Economy</H2>

</P>

<P>Indeed, Hawaii Sea Grant projects have spawned successful independent aquaculture programs both in Hawaii and throughout the Pacific Basin. Aquaculture is becoming increasingly viable in Hawaii, given its declining pineapple and sugar industries and the need to diversify its economic base.</P>

<P>"Aquaculture can fill the gap," recently retired Hawaii Sea Grant 
Director Jack Davidson says. "With knowledge and trained people, we 
can develop the industry so that it is a major contributor to the 
state's economy."</P>

<P>Today, Hawaii Sea Grant supports several aquaculture extension projects and research, currently focused on aquacultural feeds technology.</P>

<P>"Sea Grant has a formula for good science," Corbin said, citing the input of user groups on the Sea Grant Advisory Council and the strict standards of peer review for every Sea Grant project proposal. "The result is top-notch science being applied to industry needs."

SLUG: 06-25-96 SEA GRANT DEVELOPS TEACHING TOOL ON NONINDIGENOUS SPECIES IN THE
 GREAT LAKES REGION>
                                       
<center><h2>Sea Grant Develops Teaching Tool on Nonindigenous Species in the
 Great Lakes Region</h2></center>

 
<font size=+1>C</font>HAMPAIGN, IL: Whether they are called "exotics" or 
"nonindigenous species," zebra mussels have created 
problems in the Great Lakes since the late 1980s.  In 
response to this serious threat to the  Great Lakes 
ecosystem, Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant has developed Zebra 
Mussel Mania Traveling Trunk, a teaching tool to help 
teachers incorporate nonindigenous species information into 
current curriculums.  <p>
     Drawing on its science-based research, Sea Grant joined
forces with the Illinois Rivers Project.  Robert Williams,
director of the Illinois Rivers Project, incorporated elementary
teacher input to develop this teaching tool, assuring its
"teacher-friendly" design.<p>
     Teachers may borrow a traveling trunk from lending centers
located throughout the country.  The trunk contains resources for
experiments and other hands-on activities to teach about problems
associated with aquatic nuisance species in the Great Lakes and
inland waterways.  Zebra mussel shells, videos, worksheets,
posters and tests are examples of the included materials.  A
curriculum guide and resource portfolio enhance learning
potential.  <p>
     The guide and portfolio may be purchased for $35 each.  The
entire traveling trunk is an excellent teaching resource for
schools and school districts to have on hand permanently and may
be purchased for $380.  Lending sites include Illinois-Indiana
Sea Grant, Shedd Aquarium in Chicago, Indianapolis Zoo,
Cincinnati Zoo and a number of other educational sites.<p>
     "Zebra mussels and other nonindigenous invaders pose an
economic threat to the Great Lakes region," said Phillip E. Pope,
program director of Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant.  "Through
research and education, Sea Grant has made a significant
contribution to efforts to reduce the effects of these invaders
upon industrial, municipal and recreational water users." <p>
     Following earlier nonindigenous invaders into the Great
Lakes, zebra mussels arrived in the mid-1980s and have clogged
water intake lines and damaged boat hulls and engines.  These
pesky mollusks recently have moved into inland waters where they
also threaten native mussel populations.<p>
     Sea Grant nonindigenous specialist Patrice Charlebois noted,
"Nonindigenous species have a history of significant impacts upon
the Great Lakes ecosystem.  For example, the lamprey took a
terrific toll on lake trout populations.   Educating youth about
nonindigenous species and their potential effects is a great way
to affect actions and decisions.  Children  pass on their
knowledge to adults and tuck away that knowledge for use into
their adulthood."<p>
     During the last century, more than 125 species of plants and
animals have been introduced into the Great Lakes ecosystem. 
While some species have been intentionally introduced -- such as
the chinook salmon -- other introductions have been
unintentional.  Eurasian ruffe, spiny water flea, zebra mussels
and round gobies are examples of unintentional introductions,
primarily through ballast water of international ships.  <p>
     These species have created serious ecosystem threats and
economic havoc throughout the Great Lakes region. According to
National Fisheries Research Center-Great Lakes, zebra mussels may
cost Great Lakes water users an estimated $2 billion in cleanup
costs and equipment re-fitting over the next decade. <p>
     Zebra mussels are spread primarily by recreational boaters.  
Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant has responded to the zebra mussel
invasion in three primary ways:  research, control training, and
education. <p>
     To purchase or borrow the Zebra Mussel Mania Traveling
Trunk, or to request a lending center list or nonindigenous
species information, contact project coordinator Robin Goettel,
Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant, Communications Office, University of
Illinois, at 217 333-9448 or via the Internet at

<center><h2>Aquaculturists Get World of Information</h2></center>

        Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant has pioneered a number of novel ways of 
providing aquaculture information to current and potential fish farmers and 
to extension specialists and educators nationwide. The effort has 
already enabled thousands of Americans to broaden their knowledge of 
production and management methods, resulting in improved aquaculture 
operations and increased expertise. <p>
        Led by Sea Grant Aquaculture Extension Specialist LaDon Swann, the 
effort has been instrumental in fostering partnerships and exploring ways to 
deliver objective information in a timely and accessible manner.<p>

<h3>Technology Transfer </h3>

        Exploring cutting edge, state-of-the-art techniques in technology 
transfer, Swann chaired a special session, "Education in the Age of 
the Information Highway," at the 1995 World Aquaculture Society Meeting 
in San Diego. Sea Grant set the agenda for this session, which examined the use 
of teleconferencing, expert systems, the Internet and interactive media 
technology. <P>
        AquaNIC, the new global aquaculture information computer network based 
at Purdue University, will be one of the featured presentations. This new 
electronic information system, developed by Sea Grant and the Cooperative 
Extension Service, will be intro duced to attendees to demonstrate its 
information capabilities. <p>
        This conference session is designed to improve specialists'
communications and teaching skills by showing them the wide array of 
available technology transfer devices. Current and potential fish 
producers who receive training from these specialists can more rapidly 
acquire and easily retain aquaculture information.<p>

<h3>A Nationwide Forum</h3>

        Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant was the primary coordinator of a recent 
national satellite teleconference that introduced to fish producers a wide 
variety of production techniques for many fish species. The teleconference, 
"Investing in Freshwater Aquaculture," reached a national audience of 700 
participants, offering an impressive number of topics, visuals highlighting fish
farm operations and the opportunity for participants to interact with 
presenters.<p>
        Another important outcome of the teleconference was the strengthening of
working relationships among 28 aquaculture specialists in 27 states. Through new
partnerships, state aquaculture specialists have been able to draw upon 
expertise at a national level. Sea Grant's role in organizing the teleconference
facilitated increased cooperation among specialists within the United States, 
particularly within the North Central Region.
<P>
<h3>National Task Force </h3>

        Because of his involvement in cooperative aquaculture projects and 
demonstrated leadership in aquaculture extension, Swann was chosen to speak on 
AquaNIC to the Joint Subcommittee on Aquaculture (JSA) coordinated by the U.S. 
Department of AgricultureUs (USDA) Office of Aquaculture. Swann spoke to 
representatives of 24 federal agencies and national organizations about using 
the AquaNIC information network to disseminate and exchange information. As a 
result, agencies now have a greater outreach ability. Some examples include:<p>
<ul>
<LI>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration can more widely disseminate new 
regulations and updates on new animal drug compounds.
<li>The Cooperative State Research Service, USDA, can reach more people 
with its listing of aquaculture-funded projects.
<li>The National Sea Grant College Program can provide a complete listing 
of new research and outreach publications through its Sea Grant Abstracts 
Service.
<li>Aquaculture Information Center, National Agriculture Library, can make
more readily available its aquaculture publications, directories and government 
documents.
</ul>
        Swann is Sea Grant's representative on JSA's National Task Force on 
Aquaculture Information and Technology Transfer. Through this role on the Task 
Force, Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant will provide leadership on behalf of the 
National Sea Grant College  Network in coordinating information collection and 
dissemination, enhancing communication system networks and facilitating 
technology transfer.<p>

<h2><center>Louisiana Revises Commercial Flounder Rules</center></h2>

Although still concerned with overfishing of southern flounder, Louisiana has 
revised its rules for commercial flounder fishing. The new rules took effect May
1.
<p>
Licensed commercial vessels containing legal commercial gear other than strike 
nets may have no more than 10 southern flounder per person on board, said Jimmy 
Jenkins, Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries. This 
is a revision from an April ruling, when Jenkins closed the commercial fishery 
on southern flounder for one year.
<p>
The new southern flounder rules are as follows:<br>
<ul>
<li>Properly licensed commercial fishermen who are not on a vessel and who
are using legal gear other than strike nets may possess up to the daily 
possession limit of 10 southern flounder.
<li>Southern flounder possessed under this rule may be purchased, bartered,
traded, exchanged or sold.
<li>Nothing shall prohibit the possession or sale of southern flounder
legally taken prior to the May 1 closure providing that all dealers possessing 
southern flounder maintain appropriate records in accordance with R.S. 56:306.4.
<li>All wholesale/retail dealers shall maintain records indicating the
numbers and pounds of southern flounder bought, sold or possessed.
<li>Commercial dealers possessing southern flounder legally imported into
the states shall maintain appropriate records in accordance with other 
provisions of law.
</ul>
This new restriction will affect Texas shrimp vessels, too, since many Texas 
vessels off-load their catch, including flounder, in Louisiana. Texas shrimpers 
may be cited if caught off-loading more than this 10 fish per person limit.

<H3>Aquaculture Systems</H3>



<H1>Biofiltration Unit Finds<BR>

Large-Scale Use</H1>

</CENTER>

Unlike life-supporting water in the natural environment, water used in aquaculture systems requires intense and special treatment. The high density of animals and the feeding levels used in commercial aquaculture systems require efficient nitrification ability, maintenance of adequate dissolved oxygen and acid levels, and solids removal. 

<P>

Louisiana Sea Grant research in the development of biofiltration units for recirculating aquaculture systems has improved the efficiency of aquaculture enterprises nationwide and has provided the technology needed to produce a wide variety of species in high-density systems. 

The patented bead filters developed by Ronald Malone and his associates in the Civil Engineering Aquatic Systems Laboratory at Louisiana State University accomplish both nitrification and solids removal in a single, efficient unit that requires far less space than alternative filters.

<P>

These versatile units are being manufactured by companies in Louisiana and Texas and are available in various sizes to accommodate applications ranging from home water gardens to commercial tilapia facilities. Bead filters are used in the commercial production of soft-shelled crabs and crawfish, alligators, turtles, ornamental fish and food fish, as well as in broodstock holding facilities and nursery systems for mollusks, crustaceans and finfish.  

<P>

The filtering systems have proved reliable, easily maintained and well-adapted to automation -- qualities believed by many in the aquaculture industry to be the key to success in large-scale recirculating aquaculture technology. The advantages of this new approach include excellent water conservation, reduced environmental impacts from wastewater discharge, and better control of the animals'feeding, health and habitat requirements.

<P>

<H2>National Applications</H2>



The bead filter is now used by aquaculturists throughout the United States in a variety of applications:

</P>

<UL><LI>Dallas Weaver, a tropical fish producer with facilities in California, Florida and 

Pennsylvania, purchased 10 of the large bead filters for his systems.



<LI>Louisiana's first tilapia producer, Steve Abernathy of Til-Tech, Inc., operates a 

multiple 40,000-gallon tank system with eight bead filters. Til-Tech markets tilapia 

across the United States and around the world. Other tilapia producers nationwide

also are purchasing the filters.



<LI>A bead filter was installed to purge crawfish for market by a Louisiana firm, Craw Co.  The company sold 1.2 million pounds of crawfish in 1993 and obtained a contract to supply crawfish to all Albertson's supermarkets in Texas.



<LI>Two ornamental fish retailers in Baton Rouge have purchased several hundred small bead filters for in-store use so they can improve profits through better control of fish disease and mortality in display tanks.



<LI>A Louisiana alligator producer uses the bead filter to maintain water quality for his commercial alligator facility.

NATIONAL CONFERENCE IN AUGUST
>
 
<center>
<h2>Marine & Aquatic Education Focus of National Conference in August</h2>
</center>
 
 <font size=+1>O</font>RONO - Educators and teachers from throughout the 
United States and
 Canada will gather at the University of New Hampshire in Durham on
 August 1-5 for the 20th annual National Marine Educators Association
 (NMEA) conference "Making Connections: Global Lessons from the Gulf of
 Maine."
 <p>
  The keynote speaker for the conference will be Sylvia Earle, one of
 the world's leading marine biologists and renowned underwater explorer
 and global educator. Author of Sea ChangeA Message of the Oceans,
 Earle will speak about the critical condition of the world's oceans and
 offer some suggestions for change. The opening general session features
 Richard Wheeler, a retired schoolteacher and naturalist who journeyed
 alone in a kayak from Newfoundland to Cape Cod, tracing the 1700-mile
 migration route of the now-extinct great auk. Wheeler, the subject of a
 Nova television special, will share his spectacular photography of the
 trip as well as insights he gained about the Gulf of Maine.
 <p>
  Watershed Day is a special event scheduled for Friday, August 2, at
 Merrowvista Education Center in New Hampshire's Ossippee Mountains. At
 this 720-acre mountain site, conference participants will explore
 freshwater and land use issues that impact the Gulf of Maine. Sessions
 will include forest "best management practices," water quality
 monitoring, mapping techniques, watershed education programs, aquatic
 organisms, natural pollution control, and others. The day will end with
 a cruise and buffet on Lake Winnepesaukee aboard the M/S Mt. Washington.
 <p>
 On Saturday, August 3, a fisheries panel of experts from the northeast
 will discuss the current groundfish controversy in the Gulf of Maine,
 offer possible solutions, and relate what is happening in the Gulf to
 other areas of the world. A Taste of the Seacoast Food Bazaar,
 featuring coastal cuisine from many of the areas finest restaurants,
 will be offered in the evening. The bazaar and auction following it are
 open to the public. 
<p>
  A Computer Smorgasbord and Media Sampler will take place throughout
 the weekend where participants can check out the lastest software, CDs,
 and videos about the world of water. On Sunday morning, August 5, a Sea
 Faire will be held where teachers and educators can buy or swap
 materials and ideas for innovative programs, projects, and curricula.
 <p>
  Other highlights of the week-long conference include an evening at the
 New England Aquarium in Boston; field trips to 16 sites; and over 150
 workshops offered by a diverse group of educators, scientists, and
 resource managers on topics such as proven programs, and cutting-edge
 methods and research currently addressing complex marine and aquatic
 issues. The conference will end with a traditional Downeast lobster
 bake and a dynamic concert by the entertaining folk group Schooner Fare.
 <p>
  The conference is sponsored by the Gulf of Maine Marine Education
 Association (GOMMEA), NMEA, the Maine/New Hampshire Sea Grant College
 Program, University of New Hampshire Cooperative Extension, and the
 Gulf of Maine Council on the Marine Environment.

<center><h2>DR. SYLVIA EARLE TO KEYNOTE MARINE AND AQUATIC EDUCATION 
CONFERENCE</h2></center>
 
<font size=+1>ORONO, ME.</font> In 1979, Dr. Sylvia Earle broke all records 
by diving untethered 1,250
feet into the depths of the ocean. Throughout her career as a leading marine 
biologist and deep-sea explorer, Earle has logged over 6000 hours underwater. 
Although less than half of one percent of the ocean has been explored, Dr. Earle
has seen much of it. <p>

When she says "Our future is in jeopardy because the ocean is in jeopardy," she 
knows what she's talking about. As the keynote speaker at the 20th annual 
National Marine Educators Association (NMEA) conference Making Connections: 
Global Lessons from the Gulf of Maine, Dr. Earle will address the critical 
condition of our oceans and offer a blueprint for change. The conference will be
held August 1-5, 1996 at the University of New Hampshire in Durham. <p>

Dr. Earle was the first woman to serve as chief scientist of the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; has led more than 50 scientific 
expeditions including the first, all-woman team of aquanauts conducting research
in an underwater habitat for two weeks; was a pioneer in developing technology 
for deep-sea research; and has written numerous publications and books. In 1995,
Dr. Earle received the prestigious Bradford Washburn Award at the Boston Museum 
of Science for her outstanding contributions toward public understanding and 
appreciation of science and the vital role it plays in our lives. <p>

In her most recent book, <i>Sea Change- A Message of the Oceans</i>, Dr. Earle 
makes an
impassioned plea for a "sea change" in our attitudes about our oceans. She 
points out that overfishing, pollution, oil spills, plastic marine debris, and 
sewage sludge are all threatening the marine ecosystem's health. However, 
according to Dr. Earle,"We can still heal our oceans...but we must move 
quickly." Using the Gulf of Maine and its watershed as a workshop, NMEA 
conference participants will explore how education, research, and advocacy are 
helping to create solutions today in the Gulf and throughout the global ocean.
<p>

Other highlights of the week-long conference Making Connections:<br>
Global Lessons from the Gulf of Maine include an evening at the New England 
Aquarium in Boston; a watershed day at Merrowvista Education Center in the 
Ossipee Mountains; field trips to over 15 sites; a fisheries forum involving 
resource managers, industry representatives, scientists, fishing community 
members, and economists; and over 100 workshops featuring cutting-edge methods 
and research, as well as proven programs and processes, addressing current 
marine and aquatic issues. <p>

Conference participants will also enjoy a dinner cruise of Lake
Winnipesaukee aboard the M/S Mt. Washington, sample a traditional Downeast 
lobster bake, and end the week with a dynamic concert by the entertaining folk 
group Schooner Fare.<p>

The conference is sponsored by the Gulf of Maine Marine Education
Association (GOMMEA), NMEA, the Maine/New Hampshire Sea Grant College Program, 
University of New Hampshire Cooperative Extension, and the Gulf of Maine Council

<H3>Fishery Developments</H3>



<H1>Disgusting Slime Eels Just<BR>

Got More Attractive</H1>

</CENTER>

Gulf of Maine fishermen have long considered the Atlantic hagfish one of the most disgusting creatures in the ocean. But this unpleasant, mud-dwelling creature may represent a great economic opportunity.

<P>

With cod, haddock and flounder stocks at all-time lows and a growing demand for hagfish skins in the Korean eelskin industry, several fishermen from Gloucester, Mass., and Stonington, Maine, have outfitted their boats with eel traps and begun fishing for hagfish. 

<P>

In 1993, those fishermen and the processors who prepared the hagfish skins for shipment to Korea earned $450,000 from the new fishery. They expect to triple their earnings in 1994.



<H2>An Export Opportunity</H2>



Over the past 30 years, Korean demand for hagfish skins for boots, handbags and other similar products has depleted Asian hagfish stocks. Ed Melvin, an agent with Washington Sea Grant, tried to get a North Pacific hagfish fishery started in the 1980s, but the skins there were of poor quality. 

<P>

In the Gulf of Maine, where hagfish skins are of high quality, Sea Grant is working with other appropriate groups to help build a sustainable hagfish fishery.

<P>

Hagfish, also known as slime eels, live in the mud at the ocean bottom. They grow to be about two feet long, develop tooth-like structures on their tongues, and have a collection of barbels or tentacles on their snouts. Eyeless, they depend on their sense of smell to find food.

<P>

They invade and feed on the bodies of dead or helpless fish, often those trapped in fishing nets. Hagfish secrete a slimy substance that in addition to giving them their nickname, probably helps them get around and protects them from the digestive juices of their involuntary hosts.

<P>

Rollie Barnaby, a marine educator with New Hampshire Sea Grant Extension, observed fishing boats involved in the unsuccessful North Pacific hagfish fishery while visiting the West Coast in 1990. Back in New England, he teamed with George Nardi of the New England Fisheries Development Association to investigate the possibility of developing an Atlantic hagfish fishery. 

<P>

In 1992, the two received a $75,000 grant from the Saltonstall-Kennedy Program, which supports fisheries development. 

<P>

Barnaby and Nardi used the funds to ship some North Atlantic hagfish to Korea to make sure the Gulf of Maine hagfish were of marketable quality and to learn more about the mechanics of getting the hagfish to market. They also outfitted a fishing vessel for the fishery to test different techniques for catching hagfish. When their efforts proved the Gulf of Maine had a viable fishery, they convened two meetings to bring interested regional fishermen up to date on their findings.

<P>

Barnaby predicts the fishery will continue to grow for a few years and then level off. He emphasizes that during that window of opportunity, Sea Grant and other organizations will continue to learn more about the life history of the Atlantic hagfish, as well as its range, population and other possible commercial uses. The goal will be to have science and supply, rather than demand, guide the development of the fishery.

<H3>Seafood Marketing</H3>



<H1>Auction Displays Fish To Bring<BR> 

In Top Dollar</H1>

</CENTER>



A Sea Grant economist at the University of Maine helped launch a revolution in fish marketing more than a decade ago.  The idea he proposed -- the first "display" auction in North America -- became the rallying point for the $22 million fish pier in Portland, Maine.

As a result of Sea Grant research on the institutional structure of the market, the Portland Fish Exchange facility, completed in 1986, has changed the way the fishing industry does business. With its emphasis on high-quality product, the display auction puts all transactions into the open, allows dealers to buy only as much fish as they need, clears the market quickly and gives fishermen immediate knowledge of prices.

<P>

Dennis Frappier, general manager of the exchange, says the level of activity at the auction has gone "way beyond expectations, with boats getting better prices for their catch and buyers having better access to fish." That, he says, means higher quality fish for consumers.

<P>

<H2>A Premium for Quality Fish</H2>



The idea of making quality pay is the reason Jim Wilson, a Sea Grant economics researcher at the University of Maine, proposed this type of economic exchange for Maine's groundfish industry a decade ago. Wilson was a consultant to the city of Portland when it developed a $25 million Fish Pier facility. He promoted a pier and the display auction as an integrated facility to "introduce a price differential for higher quality fish and ensure a predictable supply with 25 boats landing fish directly and, perhaps, the equivalent number of trucks bringing in fish."

<P>

The reality already is double what Wilson predicted. In the past two years, nearly 300 harvesters have unloaded fish, and 31 million pounds of fish have been displayed in Portland Harbor, making it sixth in the nation by volume of fish landed and the biggest groundfish port on the East Coast. 

<P>

Unloading usually begins before dawn, with as many as 25 buyers waiting to bid for the high- quality product. All fish are weighed, culled by size, species and quality, and then placed in iced boxes before going on display.

<P>

<H2>Difference in Display</H2>



In traditional fish auctions, a buyer usually purchases an entire "trip," or boatload, sight unseen.  Fish that were iced and boxed at sea usually command the same price as fish that were shoveled into the hold. In the display auction, all fish are exhibited in the refrigerated auction building. In countries where display auctions are common, such as Japan and the nations of northern Europe, buyers consistently bid higher for the higher quality product.

<P>

Wilson first proposed the concept of a display auction in a 1976 Sea Grant report on the potential impact of the 100-mile limit on the Maine fishing industry. He and Robin Peters (Alden), editor/publisher of Commercial Fisheries News and then a Sea Grant fisheries specialist, developed the idea in subsequent studies for the State Planning Office and the city of Portland.  

<P>

Wilson was later contracted by the city's Fish Pier Operations Committee to design the rules of operation for the fish auction and, more important, to strike a balance between the demands of the harvesters and the dealers/processors.

<P>

Wilson's contribution to the successful development of the Portland Fish Exchange also helped earn him the 1987 President's Public Service Achievement Award at the University of Maine.

their research project in the Houston Ship Channel, they usually learn 
it's been struck again by a tug or barge. This is good news. 

<P>

Over the past four years, each of the two collision-tolerant pile structures the engineers designed has survived more than 20 major hits and an unknown number of minor ones.

<P>

The devices, called CTPSs for short, serve as mounting platforms for various aids to navigation. They are hinged at the mudline and designed to yield to the impact of an errant vessel. After a "hit," the steel piles, powered by up to 40,000 foot-pounds of leverage from three large compression springs, right themselves and return to their sentinel duty. While a major collision will destroy the navigational aids, they easily can be replaced.

<P>

<H2>A Safer Alternative</H2>



When a traditional wooden pile is destroyed in a collision, it costs the U.S. Coast Guard about $5,000 to locate the pile, pull the stub and replace it. Until this is done, the unmarked area presents a greater danger to navigation and a threat to the environment as well. 

<P>

The Coast Guard is responsible for maintaining navigational devices in all the 
country's navigable waters, which encompass hundreds of miles of channels 
and thousands of pilings. 

<P>

The Coast Guard has found that certain pile locations are the sites of frequent collisions. According to a Coast Guard spokesman, piles #35 and #36 in the Houston Ship Channel, the sites of the CTPSs, used to get destroyed about once a month.

<P>

<H2>Applications Nationwide</H2>



With support from Sea Grant and the Coast Guard, and help from graduate 
and undergraduate students, the two UNH engineers developed and refined the 
CTPS during the mid to late 1980s, then worked with the Coast Guard to 
test the devices in Texas. In addition, the researchers installed a third 
CTPS off Frost Point in Rye, N.H., to monitor the device's responses to wind, 
waves, tides and other environmental forces.

<P>

The CTPSs have worked so well the Coast Guard has ordered 30 to mark critical hazards to navigation around the country. These sites primarily will be in the South, where muddy, shifting channels present more of a threat to navigation than do the rocky channels of the North. 

<P>

The CTPS is designed to work in water depths of 15 to 30 feet, and each is customized for the spot it will mark. An average CTPS weighs about three tons and costs about $20,000 to construct. Adding the cost of installation, a CTPS will pay for itself after surviving five major or minor hits. But more important, the margin of safety it represents will always be there.

<H3>Student of the Chesapeake</h3>

    Jill Stevenson lifts the lid of a freezer at the University of Maryland's 
Chesapeake Biological Lab, releasing the pungent smell of dead fish.  "Isn't she
beautiful?" she asks, smiling.  From the freezer she takes the severed head of a
sturgeon, its mouth agape, breathing frost.
<P>
    "A cow," Jill explains, "from the Hudson River."  
<P>
    One can't help but wonder, looking at Jill's bright and enthusiastic smile, 
what has brought her to this great enthusiasm for sturgeon, even dead ones.
<P>
    The answer begins, no doubt, a long time ago, but one important waypoint 
between Jill's studies in geochemistry at Columbia University and the staring 
sturgeon in her hands was the summer of 1991.  That summer Jill came to the 
Chesapeake Bay as part of a Maryland Sea Grant Research Experiences for 
Undergraduates program, sponsored by the National Science Foundation.  Student 
fellows are paired with researchers on Bay-related science projects, mostly at 
the University's Center for Environmental and Estuarine Studies and its two Bay 
laboratories, the Chesapeake Biological Laboratory (CBL) and the Horn Point 
Environmental Laboratory (HPEL).
<P>
    During that summer Jill worked with research scientist Jeff Cornwell at the 
Horn Point Lab, near Cambridge. She worked with others as well, who both 
challenged her and supported her, she says.  The work D on sediments and 
biogeochemistry D was not easy.  
<P>
    "The exposure to the Bay and the research community was really important.  I
also got a very good sense of graduate school," she says.  "After that, I 
decided to wait for a couple of years [before going back to school]."
<P>
    She did not wait to go back to Nature.  Right out of college, Jill worked 
with the Conservation Career Development Program, taking urban kids into the 
woods. "I lived in a tent," she says, "at the foot of Old Rag Mountain." In her 
care were eight young people from Newark, New Jersey. She set them to work on 
the Old Rag trail with picks and shovels D for nearly six weeks. "We moved a lot
of rock," she says. "There were many erosion problems, due to overuse."
<P>
    For her efforts she won an "Excellence Award" from the Shenandoah National 
Park. Working with young people and living outdoors had great appeal, but, she 
says, "I missed the water."
<P>
    Drawn back to the Bay, Jill worked for the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, the 
largest Bay education and advocacy group in the region. She ran a canoe program 
for middle and high school students and adults, working out of Harrisburg.  One 
important focus was the Susquehanna as it passes through Lancaster County, site 
of heavy fertilizer inputs to the Bay downstream. "But I still wasn't seeing 
enough of the Bay," she says.  Her next move took her into Maryland, where she 
helped to manage a CBF education program throughout the northern Bay.  
<P>
    "I love to watch the changes in the Chesapeake," she says.  "The ospreys 
leaving and coming  back.  And there are many inspiring people who work on the 
Bay."  
<P>
    In January 1995 Jill entered graduate school at the University of Maryland, 
where she now works with David Secor and others on the Atlantic sturgeon. "My 
whole day revolves around the Bay," she says, adding, "I don't want to leave."
<P>
    Beyond just being near Chesapeake Bay, Jill wants to make a difference.  
"The ideal job," she says, "is one where I can solve a problem." Graduate school
is an important step toward her goal. "Without graduate school," she says, "I 
couldn't do what I wanted to do."
<P>
    One important benefit of the REU program, says Jill, was that it helped her 
decide what to do with her life.  "I asked myself, 'Do I really want to do 
this?'" she says.  "Yes," she answers, "I do."<p>

<h2>Multispecies Management in Chesapeake Bay A Far Future?</h2>

    Ten years ago, Maryland banned the taking of striped bass from its portion 
of Chesapeake Bay at least until clear signs indicated the fishery was 
recovering. Maryland's controversial action was part of a Congressionally backed
restoration plan that required states from Maine to North Carolina to make major
changes in striper fishing in their coastal waters. Those changes included 
raising the minimum catch sizes in some cases from 18 inches to 32 inches 
and reducing the daily creel limit. The aim was to allow striped bass to mature 
so they could return to their native rivers in the Bay to spawn. And they have. 
<P>
    Today striped bass are back, and the state has declared the fishery 
recovered. A rare success story and a heartening one at a time when the 
Chesapeake's oyster fishery has been nearly eliminated and concern is mounting 
over a possible decline of blue crabs.
<P>
    Only recently, however, have questions been asked about the implications of 
the striper recovery for the productivity of the Bay ecosystem as a whole, for 
the abundance of other popular species, bluefish and weakfish, for example. Does
the increasing abundance of stripers mean anything with respect to the prey they
all go after anchovy and menhaden and crabs, for that matter?
<P>
    Some fishermen have speculated that diminishing crab stocks if in fact 
they are decreasing could have more to do with voracious predation by stripers
than human predators. This conjecture was based on large numbers of small crabs 
found in the stomachs of some striped bass.
<P>
    There has not yet been evidence to support the argument that stripers have 
put a dent in the crab population, at least according to studies by the Maryland
Department of Natural Resources and the Virginia Institute of Marine Science.  
Though those studies are probably right, says Ed Houde, a fisheries scientist at
the Chesapeake Biological Lab, part of the University of Maryland's Center for 
Environmental and Estuarine Studies (CEES), striped bass might be having an 
impact on crab dynamics. "Historically, you would guess that they [stripers] had
little impact," he says. "But sea grass habitats have been disappearing in the 
Bay for years, and young crabs rely heavily on those grasses. Crabs may now be 
more vulnerable to predation, perhaps far more than they would have been."
<P>
    Whether or not further research turns up a significant relation between 
striped bass and crabs, the issue raises a question that offshore fisheries 
managers from Georges Bank to the Bering Sea have been struggling to answer for 
years namely, does a boom for one species mean a bust for others? Since, as 
Houde says, "most fish are killed by other fish," how does the harvesting of one
fish species affect the abundance and dynamics of other species? And do we need 
to account for such interactions in fishery management plans in the Chesapeake?
<P>

<h4>Multispecies Management</h4>
    Ed Houde and Tom Miller, also at CEES' Chesapeake Biological lab, have 
undertaken a literature review and synthesis to ask just that question. With 
support from the Chesapeake Bay Program's Scientific and Technical Advisory 
Committee (STAC), they are focusing on the multispecies nature of Bay fisheries 
and possible interactions. "The goal," says Miller, "is to ask whether there is 
even compelling evidence that we need to adopt a multispecies approach in the 
Chesapeake."
<P>
    Some years ago, Harley Speir of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources
examined a set of sportfishing data collected in the same location to see if he 
could detect an inverse relation between striped bass and bluefish catches. If 
bluefish catches were up, he asked, were striped bass down or vice versa? He 
found no such connection. For the most part, though, such investigations in the 
Bay have been cursory, mostly localized, and they've played no part in fisheries
management. "We've primarily considered the effect of removal rates of one 
species on the abundance of that species," says Speir. "We've never examined to 
see if removal of that species will affect other ones." 
<P>
    Until now, no multispecies studies, let alone management practices based on 
multispecies models, have been undertaken in major estuaries like the 
Chesapeake. Most research has been done in offshore fisheries, for example, 
Georges Bank and the North Sea. In the North Sea multispecies models such as 
the Multispecies Virtual Population Analysis have had an impact on how quotas 
are set. (That commercial fisheries have been collapsing is not a shortcoming of
multispecies models, says Miller, as much as the general failure of management 
practices simply too many fish being caught.)  "What a multispecies approach 
should presumably allow you to do," Miller says, "is to modify the catches of 
individual species based upon the removal of other components in the food web." 
Are there ecosystems where these ideas are firmly in practice? Not fully, says 
Miller, who points out that trophic food webs are extraordinarily complex and 
depend not only on predation and competition among species for a variety of 
prey, but a host of other factors climatic conditions, physical properties, 
let alone human issues of commercial and sportfishing, together with their 
political implications.
<P>
    A symposium on multispecies management several years ago in The Hague 
pointed to these problems directly.  From a fishery manager's perspective, while
species-interaction models may be conceptually more realistic than managing 
single species alone, their complexity and the results they produce may run 
counter to conventional wisdom. As Ed Houde points out, multispecies analysis in
the North Sea shows clearly "that most fish are killed by other fish" through 
predation and that "how you manage top predators such as cod and whiting can 
have major impacts on other fish in the system." Multispecies models, however, 
often lack sufficient data, so as realistic as they may be conceptually, they 
may not adequately represent the ecosystem because of their incompleteness. In 
the North Sea, for instance, the multispecies model considers only nine species 
and then only from the post-larval stage meanwhile, the model treats the North
Sea itself as a single box.
<P>
    Nevertheless, what makes the idea of multispecies management attractive, 
says Houde, is its taking into account interactions among species and the 
effects of fishing on relative abundance, predator-prey relationships and 
competitive relationships among species.  For example, the harvest of a top 
predator (like striped bass or bluefish) may allow numbers of its prey species 
(like menhaden) to increase, affecting populations not only of prey species, but
also of species it consumes in the food chain, a kind of ripple effect.     
<P>
    If multispecies management has a future for the Chesapeake, the review and 
synthesis by Houde and Miller could provide a stepping stone.   The two 
researchers will scour historical records in trying to detect trends over the 
years among important popular and commercial species, among them, striped bass, 
bluefish, flounder, sea trout, croaker and blue crab. They will be looking for 
cycles of abundance and occurrences of explosive growth and collapse. "We will 
look to see if there are clear indications of variations in abundance between 
species that suggest predator-prey interactions," says Miller, "for instance, if
bluefish are abundant, are menhaden less abundant? 
<P>
    Menhaden and anchovy are major prey of bluefish, striped bass, weakfish and 
other finfish they are the two most abundant fish in the Bay and on the whole 
east coast. Unlike anchovy, which travel in small schools and for which there is
no commercial fishery, menhaden are the major commercial finfishery in the 
entire Chesapeake, some 200,000 tons a year. Bay harvests of menhaden have 
remained steady, though there are no limits on those harvests on the other 
hand, bluefish landings along the east coast have declined sharply in recent 
years. Is there any relationship? Right now, it is impossible to say. 
<P>
    Teasing out underlying causes is an important goal of their study, says 
Miller: "Can we find something in the data that suggests if not for the whole 
Bay ecosystem, at least for key components  we need to consider them in unison
rather than in isolation?"
<P>
    For example, he asks, do we see variations in catch related to phytoplankton
productivity of the Bay if it is a particularly wet or dry year? "Certain things
we can factor in quantitatively," he says, "river runoff, seasonal water 
temperature, estimates of productivity and sea grass coverage over time."  In 
other words, not all shifts in abundance will be due to multispecies effects of 
fishing, predation and competition.  "We're not trying to find a single smoking 
gun," Miller says. 
<P>
    One problem they face is that the historical data he and Houde will be using
weren't collected with their interests in mind records of abundance for 
example. While there are statistics on commercial landings, landings are a 
measure of catch, not necessarily of abundance. Furthermore, the records on 
recreational catch are poor to non-existent. "We will have to assume fishing 
effort [the total fishing gear in use over a period of time] was constant or, in
scaling, somehow, convert catch statistics to species abundance."
<P>
    For now, that's the best they can do.<p>
 
<H4>Fisheries Management and Ecosystem Stability</h4>
    There is another view to multispecies management beyond predator-prey and 
competitive relationships among fish, one that has to do with the effects of 
fisheries on the health or the stability of the ecosystem itself. Just how 
important is the ecological role of certain species of oysters, for instance; 
perhaps of menhaden?  Such multispecies management considerations are a first 
step on a long road that could lead to ecosystem-based management of our 
fisheries.
<P>
    We have already learned much, in the past two decades, about the 
interconnectedness of the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem. The widespread decline of 
underwater grasses and an increase in summer depletion of oxygen in bottom 
waters, for example both attributed to excessive nutrients entering the Bay 
have meant the loss of healthy habitat for young crabs, oysters and other 
species. Overnutrification has overfertilized these waters and led to explosive 
algal growth far beyond the Bay's assimilative capacity. Consequently, a major 
goal in the cleanup of the Chesapeake Bay is the reduction of nutrients by 40 
percent such reductions, it is hoped, will significantly lower algal 
production and such consequences as oxygen depletion. 
<p>
    The Bay's poor assimilative capacity, some have argued, may also be due to 
the near-elimination of oyster stocks and oyster reefs. Several years ago, Roger
Newell of the CEES Horn Point Environmental Lab estimated that oyster stocks in 
the late 19th century could have filtered, on average, the entire Chesapeake Bay
in three to five days; in 1988, it would have taken more than a year. With the 
further decline of oysters since then as reflected in lowered harvests and 
monitoring, such filtering comparatively would take even longer. Newell's 
estimates helped catalyze concern over the oyster's ecological role and while 
oysters continue to be managed primarily for commercial use, for the first time 
resource managers have begun to acknowledge and take into account the oyster's 
ecological importance.
<P>
    Menhaden may also have an important ecological role in the Bay by 
sequestering nitrogen in the enormous amounts of phytoplankton they consume: 
since they move out into coastal waters, they become potential exporters of 
nitrogen. A number of CEES scientists have argued that menhaden could sequester 
and export much more nitrogen by limiting the commercial catch to fish aged at 
least three to four years. (Menhaden generally do not reach sexual maturity 
until age two; the largest menhaden on record, at three pounds, was eight years 
old.) That is not the case now. "In the lower part of the Bay," says Ed Houde, 
"a fishery is hammering on them at most of the ages, from juvenile stages 
through age one and two." 
<P>
    We are still a long way from using commercial and recreational landings as a
tool for managing nutrient levels or other measures of Bay health. The 
complexity of trophic food webs, let alone the political and social issues at 
stake, may make that more an ideal than a reality. But before they can become 
practical tools, such issues as multispecies and ecosystem-based management must
first become part of the ongoing conversation and that has begun. The far 
future may hold surprise connections between striped bass and crabs, between 
oysters and menhaden that we cannot yet foresee.    <p>

<h3>Can We Bring Back Sturgeon?</h3>

    That giant 500-pound sturgeons once roamed the bottom waters of Chesapeake 
Bay tributaries and were once part of a thriving Bay fishery may come as a 
surprise to those who associate sturgeon caviar with Russia's Caspian Sea. That 
these ancient creatures are no longer native to the Chesapeake should be less of
a surprise, conditioned as we are to the impact of human activities on other 
once-abundant species D oysters and shad and herring and submerged grasses.
<p>
    Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus) D which date as far back as the 
Cretaceous period 150 million years ago D have fared even worse, perhaps because
of their special habitat needs, let alone their peculiar biology, says Dave 
Secor, a fisheries scientist at the Chesapeake Biological Lab, part of the 
University of Maryland System's Center for Environmental and Estuarine Studies. 
<p>
    Cruising low to the river bottom, their hanging whiskers on the alert for 
potential food, sturgeon suck up benthic molluscs, worms, gastropods, and other 
inhabitants of sediment. Yet during spring and summer in the Chesapeake, it is 
these bottom habitats that are often starved for oxygen, thus making a desert of
some sturgeon feeding grounds. 
<p>
    Then there is the matter of their slow sexual maturity D for males, 9 to 12 
years, females at least 14 years.  If they aren't netted by commercial and 
recreational fishermen before maturity, females are often harvested at first 
maturity for their valuable roe. That is the case in the Hudson River where a 
dozen or so sturgeon fishermen operate, according to Jill Stevenson, a graduate 
student working with Secor. A mature female sturgeon may bring fisherman two or 
three thousand dollars for the roe; then there is a market for the flesh as 
well, known in New York as "Albany Beef." 
<p>
    Even when sturgeon do reach maturity, they produce a relatively low number 
of eggs D ten times fewer eggs than produced by striped bass or shad. 
Furthermore, unlike striped bass which release fertilized eggs into the water, 
sturgeon deposit their large, sticky eggs on hard surfaces. Siltation of bottom 
habitats and the loss of submerged grasses may have greatly reduced the areas 
suited for sturgeon reproduction.  There is no evidence of reproduction in Bay 
waters in more than 20 years D the sturgeon that have been spotted here appear 
to be visitors from other estuaries where remnant populations remain.
<P>
    Despite these seeming odds against restoring sturgeon to the Chesapeake, 
Dave Secor is an optimist about the potential for success and has been working 
with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, with the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service, with NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service, with the Hudson
River Foundation and with Maryland Sea Grant to try to determine what it will 
take to bring sturgeon back to the Bay. Such a restoration, he says, will depend
on using hatchery-produced sturgeon. 
<p>
    Since 1993, the USFWS Northeast Fishery Center in Lamar, Pennsylvania, has 
been producing large numbers of juveniles from large sturgeon captured in the 
Hudson River. While young sturgeon are already being stocked in the Hudson 
River, some basic questions need answers if there is to be a good chance of 
survival. What kind of habitats should juveniles be stocked into? What kind of 
environments would best promote populations to reproduce? Do we even have 
sufficient habitats in Bay waters any more?
<p>
    Overfishing may have reduced sturgeon numbers, but have habitat problems 
prevented them from reestablishing themselves? For example, how does hypoxia 
(severe oxygen depletion) in vast stretches of bottom waters in spring and 
summer affect sturgeon behavior?  Secor is investigating questions such these in
his lab using small hatchery-reared fish.
<p>
    Raising young sturgeon has been a new experience and a challenge, says 
Secor. Because they hug the bottom of the tank where everything collects (like 
uneaten food or feces), they are quite prone to bacterial infection D 
consequently, he has had to keep the tanks immaculate, while treating the fish 
with antibiotics. The young sturgeion are now large enough for the first 
experiments, which will study the combined effects of fish size, hypoxia and 
temperature on growth and survival. Similar laboratory experiments will be 
repeated next year as well, to see if older fish respond differently to similar 
conditions. These experiments, coupled with current monitoring of bottom 
habitats and ongoing study of the feeding habits of Atlantic sturgeon, could be 
used, says Secor, to chart habitats for Atlantic sturgeon in the Bay. "Habitats 
in the Bay could be measured in terms of their potential contribution to 
sturgeon growth" he says, creating a kind a sturgeon map.
<P>
    Within the next couple of years, Secor hopes, it will be possible determine 
those habitats appropriate for tagging and release. "Despite the uncertainty on 
the success of sturgeon reintroduction into the Chesapeake Bay, we will never 
know unless we try," says Secor. The disappearance of sturgeon from the Bay, he 
points out, "was brought about by centuries of exploitation and alterations to 
their habitat. Their recovery would  be an important indicator of improvement of
water quality, habitat and management of our fisheries resources [in the 
Chesapeake Bay]. "<p>

<H3>Water Quality</H3>



<H1>Chesapeake's Health Hinges<BR>

On Oxygen Levels</H1>

</CENTER>

<P>

Chesapeake Bay is North America's largest estuary. Restoring it to its former productivity is an immense undertaking with enormous implications for Maryland and Virginia. The economic value of the Chesapeake to both states, according to conservative estimates by the Maryland Department of Economic and Employment Development, approaches $700 billion. This figure includes land value premiums that people will pay for waterfront, waterview or water-access residences, as well as the annual incomes generated by major economic activities that depend on the bay.

<P>

Declines in the bay's environmental quality translate into real economic loss. With so much money at stake, there is strong governmental and citizen support for action. States in Chesapeake Bay's 64,000-square-mile watershed, extending from New York to Virginia, have spent hundreds of  millions of dollars to upgrade sewage treatment plants, reduce urban and agricultural runoff, and limit discharges from industrial smokestacks.

<P>

They are trying to reduce nutrient inputs by 40 percent and strictly limit inputs of toxic con- taminants by the year 2000. Man agement actions can be costly, so they must be based on sound technical information. For example, will a 40 percent nutrient reduction be enough? And how will we know if we succeed?



<H2>Pioneer Research Effort </H2>



<P>

A key indicator of Chesapeake Bay's environmental quality is dissolved oxygen, which is vital to survival of estuarine organisms. Each spring, dissolved oxygen declines in the deeper bay waters, and large areas of its productive bottom become lifeless throughout the summer due to this hypoxia.

<P>

Maryland and Virginia Sea Grant pioneered a major, coordinated research effort to examine hypoxia-- its causes and frequency, the species it affects and the way it can be controlled. The Hypoxia Research Program, funded by NOAA, began in 1985 to identify the major factors, par- ticularly nutrient enrichment, that contribute to oxygen depletion, and to determine the effects of hypoxia on the bay's ecosystem.

<P>

This program focused on ecosystem-level interactions of nutrients, the production and con- sumption of organic material, changes in the food web and  development of oxygen depletion. The scientific and management communities have recognized the results of this research, results that apply to similar problems in coastal waters throughout the world.

Researchers believe, however, that oxygen depletion may be a natural feature of bottom waters in the deep channel of the estuary. Fresh water flowing seaward passes over dense, saltier water that flows into the bay. The result is a barrier layer, called the pycnocline, that prevents oxygenated surface waters from mixing with waters below.

<P>

Oxygen depletion has increased in severity and duration since colonial settlement. Defores-tation, increased sediment runoff from farms and developed areas, and growing human population have altered the watershed. Significant changes in the bay's ecosystem and its trophic structure have occurred as a result.



<H2>Too Many Nutrients</H2>



<P>

Excessive nutrient enrichment has exacerbated natural oxygen depletion. Annual cycles of phytoplankton growth in spring are the result of nutrients flowing into the bay from hundreds of streams and rivers. Excessive nutrient loading from point and nonpoint sources stimulates the growth of more algae than higher organisms can consume. Severe oxygen depletion occurs in bottom waters as bacteria decompose the dead algae.

<P>

The goal of restoring dissolved oxygen concentrations needs to be based on what is realistic historically in Chesapeake Bay's bottom waters. Modest increases in oxygen concentrations may be the best that can be achieved with 40 percent nutrient reduction goals, but they will still have profound effects on the system. Small increases in oxygen levels in bottom waters will help restore a functioning benthic community, increase habitat for commercially important fish and shellfish, and reduce the flux of toxics and nutrients from bottom sediments to the overlying water.

<P>

The network of complex feedback loops among physical, biological and geochemical processes is integral to controlling oxygen depletion. Consequently, a small initial improvement in dissolved oxygen can cause a chain of events that will further improve the Chesapeake Bay system.



<H2>Reaching Out With Results</H2>



<P>

A major thrust of the federal-state Chesapeake Bay restoration program is the reduction of nutrient inputs from land and other sources into the bay's many tributaries. Successful nutrient reduction depends on setting realistic water quality criteria for each tributary and establishing strategies for meeting them. The results of continuing Sea Grant research on the factors regulating oxygen depletion are helping scientists and resource managers refine the three-dimensional models that serve as the major tool in these efforts. Equally important, Sea Grant is working with state and business leaders to help communities explore innovative ways for raising funds to meet their goals. Sea Grant is helping to marshal the collective expertise of business, government and universities to improve our efforts to restore the economic vitality of the Chesapeake Bay.

<center><h2>Sea Grant Experiment Shows Promise For Pair-Trawling For Tuna</h2></center>

<font size=+1>C</font>AMBRIDGE, Mass.--MIT research indicates that an 
alternative 
approach to landing bigeye, yellowfin and albacore tuna may 
be more effective, resource-sparing, and 
marine-mammal-friendly than the methods currently used. Data 
from the two-year study, which was authorized by the 
National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), is now being 
examined by the agency as it considers making midwater pair 
trawling an approved method for catching tuna.<p>

	Since 1993, NMFS has permitted only long-lining and gill 
netting for commercial tuna fishermen on the East Coast. 
While little data exists regarding the exact bycatch (the 
catch of untargeted species) with these techniques, both 
involve levels that concern fishermen and environmentalists 
alike. <p>

	In the study, which was conducted by the MIT Sea Grant 
Center for Fisheries Engineering Research (CFER), a small 
group of fishermen spent two seasons midwater pair trawling 
for tuna in the Northwest Atlantic. With this method, two 
vessels work together, with each boat pulling on one side of 
a net. Accompanied by NMFS observers, the fishermen 
documented the performance of their fishing gear for each 
haul and recorded all catches.
<p>
	Results from both seasons show a small number of encounters 
with sea turtles and marine mammals, due in large part to 
the fact that the nets are quickly lowered to depths where 
tuna, and not the protected species, congregate. The large 
mesh-size of the pair trawl nets also allows smaller fish to 
escape. As a result, the average size of trawled tuna are 
larger than those caught by long liners. The unharmed, 
smaller fish are thus left to grow, reproduce and rejuvenate 
the stocks.
<p>
	The extensive documentation of the pair-trawling study, in 
which nearly 95 percent of the fishing trips were made with 
NMFS observers, offers the agency the opportunity for using 
scientific data in its decision-making. "This experimental 
fishery represents a new way of getting things done," said 
Cliff Goudey, director of CFER and coordinator for the 
experiment. "By allowing the experiment and providing 
observers, NMFS was able to get the data it needed to make 
an informed decision, with minimal expense." 
<p>
	The study, which was funded by MIT Sea Grant, also 
represents an example of research being supported by the 
industry it will affect-in this case, the fishermen. With 
the tuna-fishing season starting in mid-August, NMFS is 
expected to make its decision regarding the approval of the 
fishery very soon. The full report on the study, The 1995 
Experimental Pair Trawl Fishery for Tuna in the Northwest 
Atlantic (report no. MITSG 96-17), is available through MIT 
Sea Grant by calling 617-253-7041.

<center><h2>Marsh Grasses Key To Coastal Water Quality</h2></center>

The salt marsh is a delicate ecosystem that many forms of life call 
home: zooplankton and periwinkles, ribbed mussels and green crabs, fish 
such as the mummichog and silverside, the fox and the great blue heron, 
myriad marsh grasses, and on some days, a bipedal visitor armed with 
fluorescent dye.<p>

The visitor is Heidi Nepf, assistant professor in the Department of 
Civil and Environmental Engineering. And what brings her to the marsh is 
Spartina alterniflora, a sea grass common to New England marsh flats.<p>

As a buffer between land and sea, the salt marsh plays an important 
role in regulating the amount of nutrients and pollutants that are 
shunted from the land into coastal waters. With increased residential 
development around coastal areas, coastal water quality is increasingly 
affected by fertilizers, pesticides and the leaching of septic waste. 
The degree of this impact depends in part on the filtering capacity of 
the salt marsh system. <p>

Along with tidal currents, marsh vegetation is a critical factor in 
determining how various substances are transported, diluted and 
deposited within the marsh. Professor Nepf's work focuses on 
understanding the hydrodynamic effects of vegetation to better predict 
circulation patterns in a salt marsh. Her research is funded by MIT Sea 
Grant through the Henry L. and Grace Doherty Professorship in Ocean 
Utilization.<p>

Because vegetation is an obstruction, it enhances the diffusion of 
substances in the water. "If you pull something through a liquid, it 
will mix and stir, just like if you pull a spoon through coffee," 
explained Professor Nepf. "People know that, in general, vegetation can 
enhance mixing. I am trying to quantify the mixing effect and create a 
basic model that can be used to predict the mixing in different systems 
of marine vegetation."<p>

The first part of Professor Nepf's study has focused on a simple 
model, with imitation plant stems constructed of dowels attached to 
plywood boards. By varying the number of dowels and their proximity to 
each other, Professor Nepf mimics the varying densities of marsh 
vegetation.<p>

Laboratory experiments conducted with Jennifer Sullivan, a graduate 
student in civil and environmental engineering, will compare predictions 
from the model to observations in Woods Hole's Great Sipewisset Marsh on 
Cape Cod.  <p>

Along with an improved understanding of how nutrients, pollutants and 
different animal species are dispersed, Professor Nepf's findings could 
also have engineering applications. "There's a lot of interest in 
constructed wetlands," she said, because observations have shown that 
water flowing through natural wetlands "comes out cleaner, may have 
lower levels of suspended sediment and sometimes even has lower chemical 
constituencies." The idea "is to create a wetland and let waste water 
flow through it, emerging cleaner on the other side." In this manner, 
constructed wetlands would provide a natural way of treating waste 
water.<p>

<H3>Ocean Exploration</H3>



<H1>AUV's to Revolutionize Underwater<BR>

Exploration</H1>

</CENTER>

Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are on the verge of revolutionizing ocean exploration by providing an economical means for expanded access to the ocean. This revolution was created largely by work at the Underwater Vehicles Laboratory supported by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sea Grant College Program.

<P>

Unlike remotely operated vehicles, AUVs need not be tended by a costly surface ship. They operate without tethers, cables or remote control, and present an affordable means for exploring regions unreachable by humans. 

<P>

Since its inception, the MIT Sea Grant laboratory pioneered the creation of small, inexpensive, high-performance AUVs. But five years ago, MIT Sea Grant was virtually alone in focusing on the vehicles. Then, researchers concentrated on larger systems that cost millions of dollars to build and required large support vessels and sophisticated handling capabilities. Many believed that small vehicles lacked sufficient payload capacity, range and durability. The success of Odyssey, a prototype high-performance AUV designed and built at MIT Sea Grant's lab, has prompted many institutions to refocus their research on AUVs.

<P>

<H2>Vessels Deployed</H2>



In 1993, an oceanographic research vessel successfully deployed Odyssey on its first mission in Antarctica. In March 1994, its progeny, Odyssey II, was used beneath the Arctic ice to study sea-ice mechanics. The Arctic ice plays a significant role in air and sea interactions, and understanding its mechanics is essential for predictions regarding global climate. 

<P>

The 360-pound Odyssey II has a range of 170 miles, a depth rating of 3.7 miles and a component cost of less than $75,000. The vehicle has one-sixth the weight, twice the range and a fraction of the cost of any previous deep-diving AUV in the world. Odyssey II is also the first deep-diving AUV to carry a sonar system and two acoustic navigation systems. 

<P>

In upcoming deep-ocean survey missions, Odyssey II will study hydrothermal vents and the aftermath of volcanic events on the Juan de Fuca Ridge off the coast of Washington State (August 1994) and on the East Pacific Rise, west of Central America (October 1994). In the East Pacific Rise experiments, Odyssey II will be used as a complement to the manned submersible, Alvin, thereby optimizing the efficient and economical use of that vehicle.

<P>

<H2>Commercial Application</H2>



Results from these missions should help pave the way for commercial AUV applications by lowering the cost of surveying, sampling and inspecting marine environments. Missions will be more economical because small AUVs are less expensive than other submersibles. More dangerous missions will also be tried because of the relatively minimal ramifications of vehicle loss.

<P>

One of the labs most exciting long-term projects is the Autonomous Oceans Sampling Network concept, in which moored buoys supply power and communication nodes to a group of AUVs working together. Fleets of AUVs patrolling the oceans could regularly collect and relay data for a wide geographic area, providing a wealth of information on subjects ranging from coastal processes and deep ocean ridges to pollution and fish populations.

<P>

<H2>Ideal Student Project</H2>



An integral component of the National Sea Grant College Program is education. The Underwater Vehicles Laboratory is a stimulating training ground for students and visiting engineers and scientists from around the world. Because of their small size and level of complexity, AUVs serve as ideal research projects for students. Over the last six years, 12 graduate students and more than 50 undergraduates have participated in laboratory work, and many vehicle subsystems were designed and built by students.

<P>

<H2>Wide Support And Interest</H2>



MIT Sea Grant lab has been supported by numerous institutional and industrial sponsors, including the Office of Naval Research, the National Science Foundation and the National Undersea Research Program. The many collaborating laboratories include the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute for Research and Sea Exploitation, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

<P>

MIT Sea Grant researchers are routinely approached by scientists interested in using their AUVs. But lab manager James Bellingham recalls the program's early days when sponsors were reluctant to support such a high-risk project, regardless of the potential rewards.

<P>

"Without the early and continued support of Sea Grant" says Bellingham, "these vehicles would not exist today."

INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE HIGHLIGHTS GROWING AQUATIC NUISANCE SPECIES PROBLEM
</h3></center>
Want to learn how zebra mussels affect contaminant levels in their environment? 
What unique methods, such as plant extracts and diaper cream, are being tested 
for zebra mussel control? How zebra mussels cause taste and odor problems in 
drinking water? Answers to these questions and many more will be presented at 
The Sixth International Zebra Mussel and Other Aquatic Nuisance Species 
Conference in Dearborn, Mich., March 5-7. Speakers from around the globe will 
address aquatic nuisance species--what's being done to prevent their spread, 
problems encountered, educational programs, policy initiatives, and promising 
research and control methods. Participants will learn about two new aquatic 
nuisance fish species in North America--the Eurasian ruffe and round goby; the 
next freshwater macrofouling mussel that may invade North America; and what 
the shipping industry is doing to combat future invasions of aquatic nuisance 
species. For registration information, contact Elizabeth Muckle-Jeffs, 
1-800-868-8776.<p>

<center><h3>
ZEBRA MUSSELS AFFECT CONTAMINANT CYCLING IN THE GREAT LAKES
</h3></center>
Zebra mussels are filter feeders, removing suspended particles from the water 
column and depositing leftover material into the sediment. This trait enables 
zebra mussels to transfer contaminants from the water column to their bodies or 
the sediment. Russell Kreis Jr. of the U.S. EPA studied levels of heavy metals 
and organic contaminants in zebra mussels from the lower Saginaw Bay in western 
Lake Huron. Kreis will report how levels of contaminants found in zebra mussels 
varied depending on levels of contaminants in their surrounding 
environments--pointing to possible uses of zebra mussels as indicators of 
environmental quality. Contaminants not absorbed by the mussels are transferred 
to the sediment. Researcher Chris Marvin of the Ontario Ministry of Environment 
and Energy studied sediment in eastern Lake Erie, western Lake Ontario and the 
Bay of Quinte in the northeast sector of Ontario, and will report changes in 
nutrients, organic carbon, trace metals, and organic contaminants since zebra 
mussel colonization.<p>

<center><h3>
BABY BOTTOMS, BOAT BOTTOMS, AND ZEBRA MUSSELS
</h3></center>
What could baby bottoms, boat bottoms and zebra mussels possibly have in common?
For several years, European boaters have experimented with diaper cream as a 
deterrent to keep mussels from attaching to boat hulls. Recent trials in 
Chesapeake Bay have proven diaper cream is a deterrent to zebra mussel 
settlement. David Wright and John Magee of the University of Maryland will share
their research findings and discuss ongoing efforts to determine the larvicidal 
properties of the diaper cream.<p>

<center><h3>
NATURAL PLANT EXTRACT TESTED FOR SAFETY AS MOLLUSCICIDE
</h3></center>
Eino Heitanen, a researcher at the University of Turku in Finland, is testing 
Endod powder , a natural plant extract, as a possible control for zebra mussels.
Tests show that the Endod powder is biologically effective in eliminating zebra 
mussels in water systems. However, Heitanen says, too few toxicological studies 
have been conducted to ensure its ecological, occupational and environmental 
safety over the long term, which prevents Endod from being registered as a 
molluscicide. He is currently conducting studies using rodents, which show an 
adverse effect at a dose of Endod lower than required to be effective with zebra
mussels.<p>

<center><h3>
COMPLAINTS NOT COINCIDENTAL
</h3></center>
It's not surprising that numerous complaints from residents of Erie County, New 
York, about the taste and smell of their drinking water coincided with the first
infestation of zebra mussels in Lake Erie and the Niagara River. Some scientists
believe that the exotic mussel is partly to blame because it contributes to the 
rapid decomposition of phytoplankton in the drinking water source. This 
increases production of known odor and taste compounds. Cameron Lange of Acres 
International and Sabrina Wittmeyer and David Fredericksen of the Erie County 
Water Authority will discuss the zebra mussel's role in this process.<p>

<center><h3>
RESEARCHER PREDICTS NEXT MUSSEL TO INVADE NORTH AMERICA
</h3></center>
What will be the next nuisance mussel to hit North America? Anthony Ricciardi, 
graduate student at McGill University, predicts that the Asian freshwater 
mollusc Limnoperna fortunei (Dunker), known to foul water supply systems in Hong
Kong and Thailand, will be arriving here soon. This new species of mussel would 
likely cause significant economic and ecological impacts if it were introduced 
into North America. In its native range, L. fortunei normally lives at 
temperatures of 8 to 32 degrees Celsius--limiting its potential range to the 
southern U.S. While similar to the zebra mussel, L. fortunei tolerates slightly 
lower calcium concentrations and higher temperatures, and thus may invade 
habitats that provide refuge for endangered native clams. "Like the zebra 
mussel, this species has a planktonic larval stage, and therefore can spread to 
other continents in ship ballast water," says Ricciardi. L. fortunei recently 
invaded South America, presumably via shipping traffic between Hong Kong and 
Argentina.<p>

<center><h3>
U.S. AND CANADIAN COAST GUARDS JOIN FORCES TO ADDRESS INVASIONS
</h3></center>
The U.S. and Canadian Coast Guards will team up to present the latest news from 
the shipping industry regarding dealing with and combatting invasions of aquatic
nuisance species. Ships' ballast water has been identified as a major way 
aquatic species are uprooted from their native homes and transferred around the 
globe. Approximately 30 percent of the aquatic species introduced to the Great 
Lakes are presumed to be the result of ballast water discharge. To combat future
introductions, ships are required to exchange ballast water in mid-ocean before 
entering the Great Lakes. Cmdr. Eric Reeves, U.S. Coast Guard, will discuss 
defense mechanisms currently in place and needs that still must be met to impede
invasions of new freshwater species. Christopher Wiley, with Transport 
Canada-Ship Safety, will discuss the safety issues and technological problems 
associated with ballast exchange at sea. Zebra mussels are also a detriment to 
the ships themselves as they rely on freshwater to run numerous shipboard 
operations. If mussels clog ship piping, the availability of freshwater for fire
protection and cooling systems is hampered. Cmdr. William Hall, U.S. Coast 
Guard, will present possible solutions for how the shipping industry can cope 
with zebra mussels on board.<p>

<center><h3>
IT'S  RUFFE TO CURE; BETTER TO PREVENT
</h3></center>
It's been almost a "mission impossible," but limited success controlling the 
spread of  the ruffe makes Thomas Busiahn believe that it's still preferable to 
try to prevent invasions of exotic species than to try to control them after 
they have become established. The ruffe successfully colonized the 
Duluth-Superior harbor and other portions of the Lake Superior shoreline -- 
increasing to several million in number, while populations of other species 
declined. More recently, the ruffe has been discovered in Lake Huron, and could 
also find a happy home in many inland lakes. Busiahn will also address the 
questions of how to control further intrusion of the ruffe into inland lakes and
to prevent its spread into the Mississippi River system.<p>

<center><h3>
RESEARCHER PREDICTS EFFECTS OF NEW FISH IN THE GREAT LAKES
</h3></center>
First discovered in the St. Clair River in 1990, round gobies have made their 
way through all five of the Great Lakes as freighter stowaways. As large adults,
these fish almost exclusively eat mollusks---particularly zebra mussels. As a 
result, gobies flourish where zebra mussels are abundant. University of Michigan
Researcher David Jude will present evidence showing how the ever-expanding goby 
population may impact native fish species, change food web relationships and 
other ecological interactions, and how gobies may eventually transfer toxins 
through the food chain to your dinner plate.<p>

<center><h3>
MUSSELS GAIN A COSTLY GRIP ON POWER PLANTS
</h3></center>
Industries and municipalities have incurred significant damage from zebra 
mussels and have paid a heavy price for controlling the problem--at least $69 
million through 1995. According to two surveys, nuclear power plants have been 
hardest hit. A Great Lakes Sea Grant Network study reports that 88 percent of 
such plants in the Great Lakes region have been infested to some degree, while 
preliminary results of a study conducted by the National Zebra Mussel 
Clearinghouse indicate that controlling zebra mussel damage at nuclear 
generating stations in the Great Lakes and Mississippi drainage basin cost an 
average of $825,000 per plant. Half of the Great Lakes region's industrial 
process water plants have also been infested. The preliminary cost results will 
be reported by Charles R. O'Neill of New York Sea Grant. Murari Suvedi of 
Michigan State University will present the findings on infestation and on the 
effectiveness of Sea Grant's educational outreach efforts to industries and 
municipalities.<p>

<center><h3>
MORE MICHIGAN LAKES HAVE MUSSELS
</h3></center>
Michigan has the dubious distinction of having more inland lakes infested with 
zebra mussels than any other Great Lakes state. So far, the state has at least 
20 known infested lakes compared with seven in Wisconsin and five in Indiana, 
according to a Sea Grant study conducted by Ladd Johnson of the University of 
Laval, Quebec, and Clifford Kraft of the University of Wisconsin Sea Grant 
Institute. Michigan's large number of lakes and rivers close to the initial 
mussel infestations in Lake Erie and Lake St. Clair and its longer period of 
exposure are likely reasons, say Jeff Hieb of the University of Wisconsin-Green 
Bay and Paul Marangelo of the University of Michigan. Hieb and Marangelo will 
discuss zebra mussels' present and potential patterns of dispersal.<p>

<H3>Underwater Preserves</H3>



<H1>Shipwreck Parks Boost Small<BR>

Town Economies</H1>

</CENTER>

The cold fresh water of the Great Lakes preserve the remnants of prehistoric cultures and several thousand shipwrecks that hold clues to the vital maritime history of the region. These shipwrecks attract thousands of recreational divers each year, as well as many archeologists. 

<P>

Over the past 15 years, Michigan Sea Grant research and outreach has facilitated the development of underwater preserves in Great Lakes waters. These shipwreck preserves help protect priceless artifacts for historians and future generations, enhance their recreational value, and permit sustainable economic development of these unique resources to the benefit of local coastal communities. 

<P>

These efforts have produced an internationally respected model for the management of underwater cultural resources and the stimulation of coastal economies.

<P>

The efforts of Sea Grant research, education and outreach at Michigan State University and the University of Michigan -- the partner institutions of the program -- have been the guiding force in moving from basic documentation of the resources to maximizing economic returns to international collaboration on the development of management policy.

<P>

<H2>Preserved from Plundering </H2>



Sea Grant research at Michigan State University in the late 1970s demonstrated the archeological, recreational and economic desirability of establishing preserves to protect Great Lakes shipwrecks and to stimulate recreational scuba diving and associated tourist spending in coastal communities. These findings culminated in state legislation authorizing the designation of state bottomland preserves.

<P>

Michigan Sea Grant Extension agents have subsequently helped establish nine bottomland preserves and are working on a proposed tenth one. They have helped coastal communities to draft formal legislative proposals, including one that expanded the number of square miles that could be set aside as preserves in the state's Great Lakes waters. 

<P>

The agents have helped communities secure financial resources for important projects, such as buoying shipwrecks in the preserves so they can be easily found and protected from dive boats inadvertently dropping anchor on them. Preserve communities are now tapping Sea Grant assistance in using such new research technologies as remotely operated vehicles and video mosaic imaging to search for undiscovered wrecks and to map and document the wrecks. This documentation is used for archaeological studies and for development of interpretive features in the historical museums along the Great Lakes coast.

<P>

Sea Grant agents have facilitated communication among the widely scattered preserve communities along Michigan's 3,300-mile coastline along Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron and Erie, resulting in the formation of the Michigan Underwater Preserves Council. The council markets diving in the preserves and encourages appropriate state policy for managing the resources. 

<P>

Sea Grant agents help the council develop promotional strategies such as cooperative advertising and feature stories in national diving magazines.

<P>

<H2>Small Communities Benefit</H2>



Michigan Sea Grant agents and campus researchers have conducted several studies documenting the economic impact of diving activities on coastal communities. One study indicated that recreational divers who live in the region average more than four trips annually to Great Lakes destinations, spending nearly $250 per trip. 

<P>

Another study documented at least 6,000 divers visiting eight of the underwater preserves during a two-year period. At expenditures of $250 each, this suggests an economic stimulus of at least $1.5 million during this period for the small towns near the preserves. 

<P>

Forty percent of these expenditures are for dive services; the other 60 percent are for other services in the community, such as lodging and food. Thus the development of underwater preserves has boosted significantly the economy and well-being of a wide range of businesses in Michigan's coastal communities.

<P>

Sea Grant-sponsored diving safety research at the University of Michigan and other U.S. universities has provided vital guidance to preserve committees in developing diver education programs and coordinated dive accident management plans. Michigan Sea Grant's diving specialist also trains dive rescue personnel and emergency medical technicians in proper rescue techniques and emergency treatment procedures. 

<P>

A series of Sea Grant diver education publications with nationwide and international distribution contributes to the enjoyment and safety of scuba divers throughout the United States and around the globe.

<P>

In 1993, Michigan Sea Grant specialists and agents led an international conference on aquatic park policy, the results of which are now being considered by the National Park Service in its implementation of the federal Abandoned Shipwreck Act of 1987. Several other Great Lakes states, Florida and the nations of Belize and Malaysia currently are using the Michigan Sea Grant model in underwater preserve establishment, development, marketing and safety.

<!-- SLUG: 02-29-96:  Round Goby I.D. Card Available from 
Sea Grant, Anglers Urged to Take Action -->

                          
<center><h2>Round Goby I.D. Card Available from Sea Grant;<br>
Anglers Urged to Take Action</h2></center>

<font size=+1>D</font>uluth, MN: Minnesota Sea Grant has produced a 
wallet-sized card to aid anglers in 
identifying the round goby -- a new, potentially harmful exotic fish found in 
parts of the Great Lakes.  The "Round Goby WATCH" card describes why gobies are 
a problem, how to identify them (color photo and illustration included), what 
anglers can do to prevent accidental transport to uninfested waters, and what 
they should do if they find a goby.  This handy, water-resistant card designed 
with fishing in mind is small enough to fit in a tackle box, wallet, or pocket.<p>

 "We designed the card especially for anglers because they are often the first 
to find a round goby," said Doug Jensen, Minnesota Sea Grant Exotic Species 
Information Coordinator.  "Wild baitfish harvesters, and fishery researchers and
managers should also be on the look-out."<p>

 Anyone who catches a round goby is urged not to throw it back alive.  They 
should kill it and contact one of the agencies listed on their card.<p>

 Over 100,000 cards were produced jointly with many agencies around the Great 
Lakes.  Single cards are free.  Individuals or organizations wishing to obtain 
cards should contact their state Sea Grant office or state resource management 
agency.  For more information, contact Jensen at (218) 726-8712.<p>

 The round goby is a small bottom-dwelling fish that is mostly slate-gray, with 
a distinctive scallop-shaped pelvic (bottom) fin, frog-like raised eyes, and 
usually a prominent black spot on the dorsal (top) fin.  It was originally 
introduced through ballast water discharge from transoceanic ships.<p>

 Like the zebra mussel and Eurasian ruffe, the round goby is native to the Black
and Caspian seas.  Round gobies were first discovered in North America along 
with their cousin the tubenose goby in 1990 in the St. Clair River near Detroit.
The tubenose goby did not thrive, but the round goby quickly spread into lakes 
Erie and Michigan where large infestations are now found.  The first goby 
discovered in Lake Superior was detected in the Duluth-Superior harbor in July, 
1995.  Gobies also infest Lake Huron, Lake St. Clair, and the St. Clair and 
Detroit rivers.<p>

 Gobies eat aquatic insects, mussels and snails. They can grow up to a foot 
long.  Gobies are considered undesirable because they can compete with native 
fishes for habitat and change the balance of the ecosystem.  They are already 
causing problems for other  bottom-dwelling Great Lakes natives, especially 
sculpins.  Gobies eat fish eggs and young, take over optimal habitat, spawn 
multiple times a season, and can survive poor water quality conditions.<p>

 The card was produced in cooperation with the Great Lakes Sea Grant Network, 
the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, and
state natural resource agencies.  The first press run includes customized 
versions for Ohio, New York, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, 
and Ontario (in English and French).  Because regulations vary, each of the nine
versions contains a slightly different message regarding possession or transport
of gobies.  Cards will be distributed through bait shops, marinas, public 
events, associations, environmental education organizations, and local, 
state/provincial/tribal and federal resource management offices.<p>

<h2>Glossary of the Great Lakes Available from Minnesota Sea Grant</h2>
</center>
 
 The University of Minnesota Sea Grant program has produced a new publication, 
Glossary of the Great Lakes.   The 71-page glossary provides a quick and easy 
reference to environmental programs related to the Great Lakes.  It defines 
organizations, regulations, initiatives, terms and acronyms.<p>

 RPeople are confused about the many programs and initiatives related to 
managing the Great Lakes,S said Cindy Hagley, glossary project leader and 
environmental quality educator with Minnesota Sea Grant.  RThrough our effort to
sort out all these programs, we found that nearly everyone with an interest in 
the Great Lakes shared our confusion.  We developed the glossary to help make 
sense of it all.<p>

 The cost for the Glossary of the Great Lakes is $4 for single copies or $3.50 
for bulk orders.  Contact Minnesota Sea Grant, (218) 726-6191.<p>

<center><h2>Goby Found Again in Duluth-Superior Harbor</h2></center>

<b>Duluth, MN:</b>  A second round goby 
(Neogobius melanostomus), an exotic fish, has 
been found in the Duluth-Superior harbor.  The 4-inch fish was found in five 
meters of water  near the Blatnik Bridge on November 7 by a National Biological 
Service (NBS)  research crew.  (The first goby found in Lake Superior was 
discovered in July, also by an NBS crew, very close to the same location.)  The 
NBS crew was trawling for Eurasian ruffe, another exotic fish, for a 
collaborative project with Minnesota Sea Grant and the University of Minnesota. 
<p>

"The second sighting suggests there is a small adult population of round gobies
in the Duluth-Superior harbor," said Jim Selgeby, Director, National Biological 
Service's Ashland, WI, Laboratory.  "Although no young gobies have been found 
yet, this adult population is capable of reproducing.  I expect we'll find more 
next year."<p>

 The round goby is a small bottom-dwelling fish that is mostly slate-gray, with 
frog-like raised eyes, a prominent black spot on the dorsal (top) fin, and has a
distinctive scallop-shaped pelvic (bottom) fin.<p>

 A  one-page fact sheet, Round gobies invade North  America, is now available 
from Sea Grant.  It describes the gobiesU range and spread, characteristics and 
habitat, and potential impacts, along with information on what can be done to 
stop their spread.  For copies of the sheet, please contact Minnesota Sea Grant,
(218) 726-6191.  To aid people in identifying this nuisance species, Sea Grant 
is also preparing a wallet-sized card, which will be available by early 
February, 1996.<p>

 If anglers catch a round goby in Lake Superior, they are urged not to throw it 
back alive.  They should kill it, freeze it, and contact Minnesota Sea Grant, 
(218) 726-8712; or the National Biological Service in Ashland (715) 682-6163; or
the Minnesota DNR Exotic Species Program in St. Paul, 1-800-766-6000, (612) 
296-2835; or a local fishery office.<p>

 The round goby was introduced through ballast water exchange by transoceanic 
ships.  At about the same time the first round goby was discovered in the Great 
Lakes, the federal Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act  
(NANPCA) of 1990 was passed by Congress to help prevent introductions of problem
species such as the round goby.  The NANPCA is up for reauthorization by 
Congress this year.  Many experts from the Great Lakes states think it is 
essential to reauthorize and strengthen the act in order to prevent future 
introductions of harmful species such as the round goby, ruffe, and zebra 
mussel.<p>

 Like the zebra mussel and Eurasian ruffe, the round goby is native to the Black
and Caspian seas.  Round gobies were first discovered in North America along 
with their cousin the tubenose goby (Proterorhinus marmoratus) in 1990 in the 
St. Claire River near Detroit.  The tubenose goby did not thrive, but the round 
goby quickly spread into lakes Erie and Michigan where the largest infestations 
are now found.  Gobies eat aquatic insects, mussels and snails.  They can grow 
up to a foot long, but specimens found in the Great Lakes so far have not 
exceeded 10 inches.<p>

 Gobies are considered undesirable because they can compete with native fishes 
for habitat and change the balance of the ecosystem.  Round gobies are already 
causing problems for other  bottom-dwelling Great Lakes natives like sculpins 
and darters.  Gobies eat fish eggs and young, take over optimal habitat, spawn 
multiple times a season, and can survive poor water quality conditions.<p>

<b>For additional information about the round goby, please contact Jim Selgeby, 
National Biological Service, Ashland, WI, (715) 682-6163, or Doug Jensen, 
Minnesota Sea Grant, (218) 726-8712.</b><p>

<H1>Safeguards Proposed For Genetically Altered Fish</H1>

</CENTER>

Fish farmers dream of the perfect fish -- disease resistant, fast growing, great tasting and easy to raise in a pond. Genetic engineering could make this dream come true. Consider what could happen, though, if this dream fish got out of the pond and into the wild.

<P>

Would it out-compete native species? Would it mix with native wild fish and create new fish hybrids? Or would it die out because it couldn't compete in the natural environment?

<P>

These questions must be answered if genetic engineering is to help make aquaculture more productive and efficient, says Anne Kapuscinski, Minnesota Sea Grant aquaculture research and policy specialist. Kapuscinski is a member of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Biotechnology Research Advisory Committee (ABRAC), and Minnesota's Biotechnology Risk Assessment Working Group. ABRAC reviews research proposed for USDA funding, weighs risks and makes recommendations to USDA about whether projects should proceed.

<P>

Kapuscinski is an expert on the ecological effects of breeding and selection in fish. She understands how subtle difference between fish of the same species affect their ability to survive and reproduce.

<P>

"We are just beginning to understand the importance of genetic diversity in fish," Kapuscinski said. "We've seen how subtle genetic changes caused by human pressures on fish populations can harm the fishery. Genetic engineering is not nearly as subtle, and the effect of accidentally releasing human-created fish could be more profound than the changes caused by generations of selective breeding."

<P>

<H2>Finding Practical Solutions</H2>



Sea Grant policy specialists are taking the lead in finding practical solutions to minimize the risk associated with releasing genetically engineered organisms. For ex-ample, Kapuscinski convened a working group of national experts to develop protocols for working safely with genetically modified fish and shellfish. Sea Grant then organized a national interdisciplinary workshop to review the proposed safety standards.

<P>

"We're not talking about a Frankenstein fish," she said. "Most genetically engineered fish will not cause problems; some will probably be beneficial. But a few could be harmful if they are released into the environment. The trick is to devise a system to figure out ahead of time which ones are going to be harmful." Genetically engineered fish are much riskier than genetically engineered agricultural animals, she said. Animals bred for domestic agriculture have lost many of their natural traits, such as the ability to reproduce or the drive to aggressively defend a territory.

<P>

Genetically engineered fish, on the other hand, can be very similar to wild fish and may survive, reproduce and influence the natural environment.



<H2>An Emphasis On Safety</H2>



An emphasis on safety will not necessarily slow the development of genetic engineering, Kapuscinski said. For instance, much of the technology needed to sterilize genetically engineered fish is already available, but it needs to be studied further and improved for commercial-scale application. New facilities are needed to keep these new organisms from escaping while they are being studied.

<P>

How long will this take?

<P>

"It will depend on he product, but it will take less time if safeguards are developed in parallel with product development," she said. " It is in the industry's best interest to develop these safeguards before problems develop."

<h2>Marine Education Effort Trains Future Scientists</h2></center>

        The impact of science education on coastal and ocean science, policy, 
 management and technology is often evaluated in terms of training and education
at the college level. But pre-college students must be in the science education 
pipeline to maintain a steady and diverse cadre of graduate students in 
marine-related studies. <p>
        Sea Grant meets that need well. A look at major meetings, such as the 
Marine Technology Society's annual conference, will show that Sea Grant 
educators are in the forefront of hands-on, discovery education in marine 
sciences for pre-college students and the adults who teach them.<p>

<b>Model K-12 Programs</b>
<p>

Pilot studies in Mississippi supported by Mississippi-Alabama Sea Grant 
established national models for programs that introduce students and 
teachers to the marine environment and ignite their enthusiasm for science. 
For example, "Project Marine Discovery" reaches 31,000 students each year 
with structured field trips and other hands-on marine science programs. 
The project started as a three-hour field trip program for four school 
groups at kindergarten through 12th grade levels; it now encompasses a 
variety of programs run by a corps of professional marine educators and 
docents for individuals from nursery school to the elderly. <p>
        The Renew America Foundaation selected "Project Marine Discovery" as 
the nation's top environmental education program in the marine and 
coastal protection category and gave the program its 1993 National 
Environmental Achievement Award.<p>
        Building on the successful hands-on, in-the-field teaching techniques 
adapted and refined for specific ages, the  Mississippi-Alabama Sea Grant 
Consortium, Gulf Coast Research Laboratory (a consortium member) and the 
National Sea Grant College Network piloted a global change education 
course for teachers with the support of the National Science Foundation 
in 1992-94. <p>
        The results of the 1991-94 effort show 144 teachers in the Gulf region 
sharing curriculum resource materials and training an additional 4,000 
teachers and curriculum specialists in their districts. The total number 
of students who will be reached by this program is 200,000 across a 
four-state region. <p>
        Similarly, the U.S. Navy funded a one-hour, four-semester oceanography 
and coastal processes course for middle-school, minority teachers 
through Mississippi-Alabama Sea Grant and Gulf Coast Research Laboratory in the 
summer of 1993. In 1994, the course was expanded to include elementary educators
and teachers of predominantly minority students. <p>
        That course served as a model for similar courses conducted by Sea 
Grant educators in six regions of the country and funded by the U.S. 
Navy, Sea Grant, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and 
the Department of the Interior.<p>

<b>Students Captivated</b>

        Marine science captivates students and provides tangible experience with
concepts encountered in varied scientific disciplines. Keeping students, 
especially women and minorities, interested in science education strengthens the
pool of students who will eventually become tomorrow's marine scientists, 
engineers and policy makers. It also contributes to a literate populace aware of
the realities of marine environments and knowledgeable about the questions to 
ask and information to seek when making scientifically sound decisions 
involving the environment and people's lives and livelihoods.<p>

<H1>Control Of Algal Blooms Studied At Barnegat Bay</H1>

</CENTER>

Lately, excessive blooms of algae have become a common occurrence in U.S. coastal waters. As a result, researchers and water resource managers have begun paying close attention to the causes and effects -- especially the negative effects -- of algal blooms on the health of aquatic ecosystems.

<P>

A New Jersey Sea Grant-funded project -- "The Effect of Increased Nitrogen Loading in Coastal Lagoon Ecosystems: Denitrification as a Sink for Nitrogen Inputs" -- initiated in 1988 by Sybil Seitzinger of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, Pa., has  blossomed into a full-range, interdisciplinary water quality monitoring and management project with potential national application.

<P>

Seitzinger's Sea Grant project focused on eutrophication, a situation where excessive nutrients create a negative effect and pose a threat to coastal lagoons. It examined the relationship between nitrogen loading and removal rates in shallow lagoons, the factors controlling those rates, and it compared the magnitude of denitrification rates in vegetated and unvegetated sediments. The resulting data was translated into a format useful for developing nutrient control strategies for shallow coastal lagoons.

<P>

New Jersey Sea Grant subsequently supported another research project by Seitzinger and Roberto Sanders that is evaluating the contribution of pollution-related inputs of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) to estuarine eutrophication. This effort represented some of the first direct studies on the utilization of external inputs of DON in estuaries, and it has already provided information that has proven useful for local, state and national agencies that set policies and make management decisions regarding nutrient  inputs to estuarine and coastal waters

<P>

<H2>Helps Management Plan</H2>



While Seitzinger was conducting her Sea Grant research, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and Energy began developing a Watershed Management Plan for Barnegat Bay, which provides major recreational, economic and aesthetic benefits to the state's coastal residents and seasonal tourists. These benefits depend directly on the vitality of the bay's ecosystem. 

<P>

Prior studies indicated that the bay's water quality is degraded by nonpoint source pollution emanating primarily from land-based development and associated activities. Current bay conditions reflect excessive nutrient inputs, resulting in high levels of algal growth and turbidity. These conditions upset the natural balance of the bay's ecosystem. Because eutrophication and nonpoint source pollution of the bay were being investigated by the state, Seitzinger was asked to apply her Sea Grant data and methodology to Barnegat Bay. This proved useful in developing effective nutrient control strategies to reduce future eutrophication.

<P>

<H2>Bay Watch Set Up</H2>



In addition to New Jersey Sea Grant research results, Barnegat Bay is also benefiting from outreach initiatives by the New Jersey Marine Sciences Consortium and New Jersey Sea Grant Marine Advisory Service. In 1991, the Barnegat Bay Watch Monitoring Program was initiated under the direction of Sea Grant agent Eleanor Bochenek. The program provides for ongoing monitoring of ecological conditions of the bay, including episodic events and trends or changes in habitats and water quality. Data collected by dozens of volunteers will provide a constant flow of information about the bay's health and vitality.

<P>

This Sea Grant information will be useful for solving problems associated with nonpoint source pollution, nutrient enrichment and eutrophication, the development and distribution of algal blooms, and identification of critical habitat for not only Barnegat Bay but all U.S. coastal waters experiencing similar problems.

<!-- Slug: 04-18-96 :  $1.5M Research Initiative Targets Brown Tide -->


<center><h2>$1.5M Research Initiative Targets Brown Tide</h2></center>

<font size=+1>S</font>tony Brook, NY: New York Sea Grant is currently using the 
peer review process to evaluate 28 research proposals 
focusing on brown tide which have been submitted in response
to a $1.5 million research call. The Brown Tide Research 
Initiative (BTRI) is being administered by New York Sea 
Grant with Coastal Ocean Program (COP) funding from the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).<p>
 	
	Decision on which projects will be funded will be 
determined in May.<p>

	Over 60 scientists, from nearly two dozen research 
and educational institutions from Maine to Texas to 
Washington State have submitted proposals.<p>

	The BTRI was created following a Brown Tide Summit 
held last Fall which drew internationally recognized 
scientists, as well as federal, state, and local managers, 
and the interested public to discuss what is already known 
about brown tide and to develop a research agenda to 
provide the information needed to prevent or best manage 
it. In conjunction with the resulting research call, a 
Brown Tide Steering Committee, with broad representation, 
was formed to develop a comprehensive research and 
management plan for the region. Although the BTRI is 
designed to address regional problems associated with brown 
tide, it is hoped the information gained will assist the 
international effort confronting the increasing 
incidence of harmful algal blooms worldwide.<p>
 
	In the summer of 1995, extensive blooms of the 
brown tide (Aureoccoccus anophagefferens) returned to Long 
Island coastal waters having devastating impacts on coastal 
resources. The return of brown tide at intensities similar 
to its initial outbreaks in the mid-1980s made obvious the 
need for a significant coordinated effort to search for the 
causes of this phenomenon and for effective measures to 
prevent its recurrence or minimize or mitigate its effect. <p>

	The objectives of the BTRI is to understand the 
factors that lead to bloom initiation, maintain blooms, and 
cause them to crash.<p>

	Research priorities for the BTRI are guided by the 
report from the Brown Tide Summit. A complete description 
of identified research needs and brief summaries of 
available information on brown tide can be found in the 
"Proceedings of  the Brown Tide Summit." Copies are available from New York 
Sea Grant. <p>

<center><h1>
Sea Grant Extension Team Honored for Native American Land Initiative
</h1></center>
   
<font size=+1>STONY BROOK, NY.</font> "The Native American Lands 
Initiative," a New York Sea Grant  
Extension Program, has been awarded the Northeast Director's Cooperative 
Extension Award of Excellence from Cornell Cooperative Extension in recognition 
of outstanding programming accomplishment. <P>

The initiative was  started by Sea Grant extension specialists in 1993 to 
establish communication  and contact with the natural resource leadership of the
reservations. New York Sea Grant Extension Specialists David Greene, Robert  
Kent, Jay Tanski, Diane Kuehn, David MacNeill, and Sea Grant researcher  
Joseph Buttner, have been cited for establishing communications between Native  
American audiences to promote cooperative efforts on environmental concerns  and
educational programs.  New York State is home to 10 Native American reservations
which are confronted by a myriad environmental problems including toxic dumping,
sewage disposal, tank leakage, agricultural runoff and the ensuing contamination
of group and surface waters.<P>

"This is a very prestigious award, and a wonderful accomplishment for the New 
York Sea Grant Institute," said New York Sea Grant Associate  Director and 
Program Leader Dale Baker. New York Sea Grant was chosen from among 30 programs 
to receive the honor. The award plaque, along with a $1,000 check, was presented
to David Greene at the Northeast Director's annual meeting held in February.   
<P>
Though the initiative formally began in the 1990s, Sea Grant has worked with 
Native American audiences since the 1970s. From  hard clam aquaculture on Long 
Island, to concerns about Cattaraugus Creek on  Lake Erie, Sea Grant has 
provided information on various problems.  <P>

The Initiative's first efforts involved workshops and an environmental  
conference that was attended by over 50 Native American environmental leaders  
from seven different reservations. In 1994, Sea Grant established links to the  
extension agents working with Native Americans across the country and regular  
contact has been maintained through a computer bulletin board. <p>
 
Several workshops and consultations have also taken place ranging from 
hospitality / tourism training to erosion control, fisheries development and 
natural resources inventory mapping. Among the projects directed under the 
initiative were:<P>
<ul>
    A Shinnecock Nation tribal member was  trained by the Cornell Laboratory
of Environmental Applications of Remote Sensing to conduct a natural resource 
inventory of 800-acre reservation on Long Island; <br>
    A Sea Grant specialist conducted a tourism and hospitality training  
workshop for over 125 Seneca Nation employees; <br>
    A meeting identified financial matters as a concern with the Oneida 
Nation and future workshops are in the planning stages; <br>
    A Sea Grant specialist is providing assistance to solve erosion
problems with the Shinnecock reservation, and programming is also being  planned
to address erosion problems at Akwesasne on the St. Lawrence River.  <br>
</ul>
    Sea Grant is working with the Akwesasne reservation to investigate the  
possibility of placing an extension agent on the reservation to provide  
educational programming. 

<P>

Community youth programs have been a vital part of the initiative. Activities in
this area included:<br>
<ul>
        A Native American graduate student was supported by Sea Grant during the
 summer and fall of 1993 to assist in organizing the Seneca Nation's new  
environmental department; <br>
        A summer intern supported by Sea Grant worked  with a Sea Grant 
researcher on Akwesasne's aquaculture program in 1994;<br>
        A student was hired to work with Cornell faculty members at the new 
Akwesasne  Environmental Laboratory last summer. <br>
</ul><p>
"Through the Native American Lands Initiative new lines of communication and 
partnerships have been forged that have produced  significant collaborative 
educational efforts," said Nancy Hicks, assistant  director for Cornell 
Cooperative Extension in her letter of nomination. <p>

<H3>Recreational Fishing</H3>



<H1>Science Helps Sustain Great<BR>

Lakes Fisheries</H1>

</CENTER>

Nearly destroyed by overexploitation, invasions of nonindigenous species and pollution in the first half of this century, the fisheries of the Great Lakes have undergone a remarkable rebirth.  

<P>

Today, the Great Lakes support world-class recreational fisheries that generate more than $4 billion in regional economic activity. Commercial fisheries generate another $270 million.

<P>

Through coordinated research and direct interaction with state and federal management agencies over the past 25 years, the region's Sea Grant programs have contributed significantly toward sustained development of these fisheries. Thanks to the scientific data, techniques and new management tools provided by Sea Grant-funded research, Great Lakes fishery policies now are determined more by the lakes' biological capacity than by political and short-term economic pressures.

<P>

As a microcosm of the global ocean, the Great Lakes offer a natural laboratory for developing and implementing science-based fisheries management and a model for improving the management of the nation's overexploited ocean fish stocks.

<P>

<H2>Lake Ontario Example</H2>



Like the other Great Lakes, the Lake Ontario sport fishery, valued at $100 million a year, is sustained largely by the stocking of Pacific salmon, which feed on unstable populations of forage fish that also consist mostly of nonindigenous species.

<P>

Like the other five programs in the Great Lake Sea Grant Network, New York Sea Grant supports a wide range of research, outreach and education aimed at improving the management of this economically important recreational fishery through better scientific understanding of the natural and human pressures that threaten it.

<P>

For example, a series of New York Sea Grant-funded projects examining ecosystem and forage base issues is being led by State University of New York researcher Donald Stewart. By characterizing and estimating biomass production dynamics in Lake Ontario, this work is providing technical information needed to set stocking policies in response to observed declines in fish biomass in the Lake Ontario fishery. 

<P>

With Sea Grant support, Cornell University researchers Tommy Brown and Barbara Knuth are analyzing how anglers adjust their habits in reaction to declines in fish stocks so that New York and other Great Lakes fishery managers can anticipate how anglers might react to sport fishery management plans.

<P>

These research efforts are complemented by extensive sport fishery outreach by New York Sea Grant Extension Specialists. In 1987, New York Sea Grant funded the development of educational programs to provide technical information on forage base dynamics to various Lake Ontario sport fishery stakeholders through newsletters, presentations to anglers and charter boat organizations, and other educational forums. An educational program also was developed on the complex interplay between forage fish, their predators and other biological components.

<P>

These programs emphasized the management uncertainties associated with sustaining a fishery so dependent on unstable prey fish populations. During the early 1990s, several issues of New York Sea Grant's Charterlines focused on the forage base issue and the management implications of a decline in forage fish populations. 

<P>

The educational service publication also provided continuous updates on the latest scientific research and modeling efforts. The series was widely praised by fishery stakeholders, researchers and fisheries managers alike as the most comprehensive, accurate and unbiased overview of the current predator-prey situation in Lake Ontario.

<P>

<H2>Conflict Diffused</H2>



Sea Grant research and outreach have significantly reduced the polarity between the Lake Ontario sport fishing community and fisheries managers.  This has enabled both groups to make informed decisions on fish management and stocking strategies aimed at economic stability in the communities that rely on the sport fishery. Forage fish forecasts based on Sea Grant-supported research also prepared managers and the sport fishing community for the severe, weather-related die-off of alewives in Lake Ontario during 1993.

<P>

New York Sea Grant also recently organized a roundtable forum that effectively diffused conflicts betweeen resource managers and anglers over the downturn in Lake Erie's walleye fishery. In cooperation with the University of Buffalo Great Lakes Program, New York Sea Grant organized another public forum last spring on "Ecosystem Changes in the Lower Great Lakes" to present information about major changes in the ecosystems of Lakes Erie and Ontario that are likely to occur as a result of improving water quality and predator fish stocking programs, and possible implications of these changes for the future of the immensely valuable sport fisheries of both lakes.

<P>

<H2>Not Bound by State Borders</H2>



Sea Grant research and outreach are not bound by state borders. New York and the five other Great Lakes Sea Grant programs collectively support a comprehensive array of fisheries research and outreach aimed at helping managers, users and the public throughout the region develop enlightened, science-based management for sustaining the nation's multibillion-dollar Great Lakes recreational and commercial fisheries.

<H1>Striped Bass: From Lab To<BR>

$7 Million Industry</H1>

</CENTER>

Fifteen years ago, the culture of hybrid striped bass for food was no more than a hope for the future.  Today, thanks to the efforts of North Carolina Sea Grant researchers, the hybrid bass has moved out of the laboratory, into the ponds of Southeast farmers, and onto menus in upscale restaurants in the Northeast and Midwest.

<P>

In 1993, Southeastern fish farmers harvested about 1.5 million pounds of hybrid bass valued at $3.75 million. Fish brokers pay an average of $2.50 per pound for these farmed fish, which weigh two to three pounds at harvest.

<P>

In 1994, farmers expect to double their harvest, netting three million pounds of fish worth $7.5 million. By the turn of the century, the Hybrid Striped Bass Association expects the industry to produce 10 million pounds of fish and to soon rival the production  and pond acreage of catfish and trout.

<P>

<H2>Technology Fills Need</H2>



Fifteen years ago, the hybrid was little more than a novelty. Scientists knew how to fertilize striper eggs with white bass sperm to produce a hybrid that grew faster and was more disease-resistant than its parents. But that's where the technology stopped.

<P>

Then wild populations of the popular striped bass plummeted because of environmental conditions and water quality problems. In the wake of this decline, an opening appeared on East Coast dinner plates and restaurant menus -- just the kind of opening that could be filled by a hardy hybrid. Sea Grant scientists saw the opportunity for making the hybrid bass a food fish for the future. But first the hybrid needed more research.

<P>

<H2>Pond Culture</H2>



While some scientists pursued cage culture of the fish, North Carolina Sea Grant researchers saw pond culture as a more cost-effective method to produce the pounds of hybrids needed to satisfy a fish-hungry American public.

<P>

Sea Grant programs in North Carolina and South Carolina began sponsoring research into the pond production of hybrid striped bass in 1979 and 1981, respectively. The hybrid adapted to ponds easily, and scientists were able to grow a marketable fish with a firm texture and a mild flavor in 18 months. By the mid-1980s, scientists were ready to transfer their research knowledge about pond production to a commercial-scale operation.

<P>

The Sea Grant researchers found a North Carolina farmer willing to experiment, secured a grant from the National Coastal Resources Research and Development Institute, and, in 1987, established a commercial-scale demonstration project.

<P>

Within 18 months, the first crop of 70,000 pounds was out of the water. The next year, the Tar Heel farmer produced 90,000 pounds. Word of the hybrid's success spread. Other farmers came to see how to raise the newcomer to the aquaculture industry. 

<P>

<H2>Rapid Technology Transfer</H2>



To disseminate information about the new arrival, manuals and videos were produced that de- scribed pond-rearing techniques for the hybrid. From spawning to harvesting, from investment costs to marketing, Sea Grant reseasrchers gave interested farmers step-by-step guidance for getting into the business of raising hybrid bass.

<P>

The effort paid off. The hybrid bass pond industry has grown exponentially over the last seven years. Most of the growth has occurred in the Southeast, which is blessed with flat, clay land and an ample supply of quality water for pond construction. 

<P>

Now, Sea Grant researchers are back in the lab completing the loop on hybrid production. They are striving to domesticate a parental broodstock of fish that will end the arduous task of catching stripers from the wild and guarantee a ready supply of female fish. 

Researchers are also testing ways to alter the female striper's reproductive cycle. Using hormone, light and temperature manipu lations, the scientists hope to encourage the female fish to spawn more frequently. 

<P>

If these two objectives are met, raising hybrid  bass could become "as routine as raising broiler chickens," says one researcher.

<H3>Coastal Hazards</H3>



<H1>Preparedness Limits Losses To Hurricanes</H1>

</CENTER>

If you're going to look a hurricane in the eye, you'd better be prepared. That's what Sea Grant specialist Spencer Rogers has been telling coastal homeowners, building code councils from North Carolina to Texas, and federal insurance and emergency management officials for more than a decade.

<P>

For more than a decade, Rogers has preached the benefits of hurricane-resistant construction. He's urged homeowners to build their beach houses high atop pilings sunk deep in the sand and fastened securely together with corrosion-resistant hurricane clips and connectors. He's educated the construction industry and helped make the North Carolina Building Code a model for other South-eastern states that want to shore up their coastal construction standards against the monster storms.

<P>

<H2>$80 Million Saved</H2>



Rogers' sermons have paid off. A comparison of the post-storm damage and costs resulting from Hurricane Diana in North Carolina and Hurricane Alicia in Texas -- storms of comparable size -- shows that Tar Heel coastal homeowners saved $80 million in repairs. The difference? North Carolina had  tougher construction standards for coastal buildings.

<P>

Rogers' construction lessons have other payoffs too. They can help homeowners save on their annual federal flood insurance premiums. Each year, homeowners who live in coastal flood zones pay an average of $367 to the National Flood Insurance Program to insure their homes against high waters from hurricanes and other storms. 

<P>

But those homeowners who heeded Rogers' advice and built piling-supported houses can get a 60 percent savings on their premium payments. For an average owner of a beach house, that can be a yearly savings of $220. In the Southeast, homeowners can  collectively save more than $18 million a year. 

<P>

New beach homes can be built so that savings are assured, Rogers says. Over the 70-year life of a house, a coastal homeowner can save more than $15,000.

To spread the word about this  windfall, Rogers has been talking to homeowners, builders, architects and insurers. He's written fact sheets and talked to the media. Homeowners from Corolla, N.C., to Brownsville, Texas, got the message and pocketed the savings.

<P>

<H2>Stronger Straps</H2>



In another effort to save homeowners time and repair costs, Rogers worked with the LaQue Corrosion Center in Wrightsville Beach, N.C., to study the corrosion rates of metal tie-down straps in the beachfront environment. He found that typical hurricane straps used in oceanfront and first-row homes corroded within five years and were ineffective in securing the connections between roofs, walls and foundations. To withstand corrosive forces, clips need to be heavily galvanized with zinc coating or made of stainless steel.

<P>

Based on Rogers' findings, the North Carolina Building Code Council adopted regulations requiring builders to install corrosion-resistant connectors in new oceanfront construction. Again, the news of Rogers' work spread to other Southeastern states, particularly Texas, and homeowners began asking building suppliers for galvanized and stainless steel connectors.

<P>

In response to the growing demand, two national companies added stainless steel clips to their product lines. Other companies offered clips with a heavier galvanized coating. Now, the market for corrosion-resistant hurricane clips is estimated at $250,000 annually. And home- owners who use them save untold millions in roof and foundation repairs after a hurricane strikes.

<H3>Hatchery Aquaculture</H3>



<H1>New Ways To Rear Fry Raises<BR>

Hatchery Yields</H1>

</CENTER>

Many important fisheries in ocean waters and in lakes, rivers or streams are not maintained by natural reproduction. Instead, natural resource managers maintain fish populations with stock that are raised in hatcheries. They bolster natural populations by culturing and releasing millions of fry, which often are reared to fingerling size to increase their chances of survival.

<P>

Rearing fry, however, has been a hit-or-miss undertaking, making it difficult to predict how many fish will be available for stocking each year. Success rates for survival in ponds can range from as low as zero to as high as 90 percent.  

<P>

This makes it especially difficult to satisfy natural resource management plans and programs.  Moreover, the lack of reliable culturing makes each fish more expensive to rear.

<P>

As a result of work initially supported by Ohio Sea Grant, the total output of three percid (walleye and saugeye) hatcheries has quadrupled and survival increased as much as 10 times. This increased output has been consistent and reliable from year to year.  

<P>

This project, begun in 1980 by Ohio State University zoologist David Culver, was funded first by Ohio Sea Grant and the Office of Research and Water Technology, and subsequently by the Ohio Division of Wildlife.  

<P>

Culver's stunning success lay in adjustments of three hatchery practices. He changed the time when managers filled rearing ponds in relation to when they added fish. He changed the timing, amount and type of fertilizer added to the ponds. And he added many more fish to each pond, creating more crowded conditions.

<P>

<H2>A Matter of Timing</H2>



Hatchery stocking ponds are usually filled with water from nearby lakes, rivers or streams.  This water contains microscopic animals (zooplankton), which are food for the fry. It also contains microscopic plants (phytoplankton), which are food for the zooplankton.  

<P>

Earlier research showed that ponds filled and allowed to sit had a dramatic drop in their total plankton populations after four to five weeks.  Since fry require up to six weeks to grow to harvestable size, stocking the ponds right after filling them would be the most productive practice.  

<P>

Nonetheless, some hatcheries were filling ponds and waiting a month before introducing fry, presumably to give zooplankton time to increase their numbers.  During the month without fish, zooplankton populations flourished, but then they collapsed because they had wiped out the phytoplankton -- their only source of food.  

<P>

Adding fish early on, Culver discovered, kept the fry fed and the zooplankton in check. Ponds filled a month before fry were added showed only 14 percent survival; those filled on Culver's schedule, a week before, averaged 64 percent survival.



<H2>Fertilizer Costs Reduced</H2>



The complex and dynamic relationship between fry, their food (zooplankton), and the zooplankton's food (phytoplankton) fueled Culver's other two adjustments. To maintain a constant source of food for fry, managers must maintain stable populations of zooplankton and phytoplankton. 

<P>

They do this by fertilizing the ponds with phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) to promote plant (phytoplankton) growth. Prior to Culver's work, the times when managers fertilized, and the amounts and types they used, varied greatly among hatcheries.  Culver's work showed that they were all adding too much P fertilizer and using an inappropriate N/P ratio.  

<P>

They were also stimulating the growth of harmful algae by adding lots of P fertilizer occasionally, rather than applying small amounts more often. Culver's results reduced the amount of phosphate added and increased the amount of nitrogen -- both of which created healthy, stable, reproducible environments -- and dramatically cut fertilizer costs.

<P>

<H2>Fish Stocks Doubled</H2>



Although it seems counterintuitive, previous studies by Culver and others showed that fish that are crowded in ponds do better than fish that are not. Culver not only increased the number of fish in his experimental ponds, he doubled it to 450,000/hectare. More fry survive this way, and their size and health are unaffected.  

<P>

The fry's growth and health in crowded conditions had nothing to do with cannibalism, as some hatchery managers had feared.  The fish were simply eating zooplankton, which reproduce so quickly in response to the fertilizer-stimulated phytoplankton that only dense crowds of fish can keep their numbers down and keep them from overgrazing their own source of plant food.

<P>

<H2>Yields Up, Costs Down</H2>



Between 1986 and 1991, Culver's research increased Ohio walleye and saugeye hatchery yields from 1.3 million fingerlings to 6 million, without an increase in pond area or personnel.  

<P>

Fertilizer costs were cut 95 percent, from 80 cents per thousand fingerlings to 4 cents. The American Fisheries Society named Culver's work the best 1992 research project in the Wallop-Breaux/Aquatic Resources Trust Fund Program, and it allowed Ohio State hatchery managers to set a walleye and saugeye stocking record of 7 million in 1992.

<H3>Commercial Fishing</H3>



<H1>Whiting Changed From Trash To Cash Catch</H1>

</CENTER>

Pacific whiting swims in abundance off the north-west U.S. coast during much of the year. Until recently, however, the fish was shunned by commercial fishers because its flesh deteriorates quickly after the fish is caught. Although whiting could be processed at sea by modern factory ships, the economic potential of shore-based processing went unrealized.     

<P>

Oregon Sea Grant research and outreach helped develop new harvesting, onboard handling and processing techniques that have overcome the rapid breakdown of whiting flesh. Whiting became feasible for onshore processors to use in creating new "analog" products, such as imitation shrimp and crab.

<P>

This mixture of abundant resource supply and technical innovation fueled an economic boom on the Oregon coast. Approximately 50,000 metric tons of whiting were landed and processed at Oregon shore-based plants in 1992, generating more than $30 million in income.

<P>

A decade ago, the whiting story was still looking for this happy ending. At that time, scientists had not been able to solve what was artfully referred to as "the texture problem" -- the tendency of whiting to turn mushy as it warmed up.

<P>

In 1988, Sea Grant seafood researcher David Crawford was one of two researchers in the Northwest to announce a technical breakthrough. The breakthrough involved surimi. 

<P>

To this mixture of washed, deboned and concentrated fish protein, Crawford added potassium bromates, a common food additive that inactivated the enzyme that caused whiting flesh to deteriorate. By using the additive, it was clear that surimi could be produced from whiting. The surimi option made a high-volume fishery viable.     

<P>

Getting the volume to onshore processors however, was not assured. Initially, the allocation request of onshore processors was denied, partly over a concern that the plants would not be able to operate profitably because harvests were limited to only part of the year. Also, it was believed that frozen whiting would not keep well.

<P>

But Oregon Sea Grant researcher Ed Kolbe demonstrated that whiting surimi would keep fine in frozen storage for as long as 10 months if certain routine conditions were met.    

<P>

Kolbe's information helped convince regulatory agencies that shore-based processors could compete with offshore factory ships.

<P>

<H2>Several Industries Assisted</H2>



Meanwhile, as interest was first being expressed by private industry in developing the onshore processing plants for whiting, Sea Grant's Ken Hilderbrand contributed to the principal  report that demonstrated the economic feasibility of the plants.     

<P>

But Hilderbrand did not stop with reporting on the infrastructure requirements to set up the plants. When the development of the processing plants started in 1991, Hilderbrand, a seafood specialist, provided crucial assistance. He tracked down the necessary information about wastewater at fishmeal and surimi operations and presented it to the state Department of Environmental Quality. As a consequence, the agency decided to allow the plants to discharge their liquid wastewaters under existing permit rules.

<P>

His intervention saved each operator $6,000 in application fees, additional money for consultants, hearings, and probably six months of waiting for the permits to be approved.

<P>

Mark Conrad, research and development director for Arctic Alaska Fisheries Corporation, said that the value of the Sea Grant specialist's assistance went beyond the time and money saved, directly affecting the outcome of the company's entire multimillion-dollar enterprise.

<P>

"It's fair to say that without Ken's help we may not have had the plant completed in 1992," Conrad said. 

<P>

Hilderbrand has been helping the fledgling whiting industry in yet another way. He continues to work with fertilizer, meal and compost producers to create a market for whiting waste. One example of the result of his efforts: in 1993, one Oregon small business used 2,500 tons of whiting carcasses to produce compost; sales of the compost product were valued at approximately $750,000.

<P>

The economic potential of Pacific whiting looks very promising. Onshore processing in 1994 is expected to generate $60 million in personal income for Oregon -- twice the 1992 figure. Through its expertise in research, technology transfer and outreach, Oregon Sea Grant is happy to have played a role in this economic development success.

<h2>Ciguatera Loss Reduced by More than $500,000</h2></center>

        Puerto Rico has quarantined sales of the tropical reef fish species that
frequently carry a dangerous poison, ciguatera. <p>
        Despite the quarantine, these fish continue to be sold illegally to 
consumers in Puerto Rico and the United States, causing outbreaks of ciguatera 
poisoning. In the United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, 
morbidity rates of diagnosed cases of ciguatera poisoning range from 10 to 27 
people per thousand each year.  <p>
        Ciguatera fish poisoning causes expensive, though usually treatable, 
health problems. Losses in worktime and medical expenses from ciguatera 
poisoning in Puerto Rico average $1,000 per case. But the region's fishing and 
seafood industries are also damaged when ciguatera outbreaks cause consumers to 
avoid buying seafood.<p>
        In a comprehensive initiative, the University of Puerto Rico Sea Grant 
College Program has addressed the problem of ciguatera poisoning through 
research and education, significantly decreasing the number of poisoning cases 
and reducing recent economic losses to the regional fishing industry.<p>
        Sea Grant Advisory Service agents throughout Puerto Rico and the U.S. 
Virgin Islands disseminate information about ciguatera to prevent consumer panic
when seasonal outbreaks of poisoning occur. Sea Grant researchers also discuss 
the results of their investigations on ciguatera with health professionals. <p>
        In seminars, workshops and presentations in hospitals, Sea Grant 
researchers instruct physicians and nurses on the symptoms and treatment of 
ciguatera fish poisoning, which in the past has not been recognized or treated 
properly. Sea Grant agents and researchers have trained fishery industry 
inspectors to identify and test fish likely to carry ciguatera, which has helped
reduce ciguatera poisoning by at least 10 percent in Puerto Rico alone. <p>
        Today, the public is reducing consumption of species likely to contain 
ciguatera toxins. Meanwhile, consumers are increasingly buying "safer" species 
of tropical reef fish and other seafood, such as tuna, octopus and shellfish. As
a result, the regional decline in fish and seafood sales has leveled off, and 
work-time losses and medical expenses due to ciguatera poisoning have decreased.
<p>
        Puerto Rico Sea Grant's research and education about ciguatera poisoning
has saved the region somewhere between $500,000 and $2 million per year 
in avoided medical expenses, reduced worktime loss and steadier seafood sales<p>

<center><h2>Local photographers spotlighted in new Bay calendar, exhibit </h2></center>

  <font size=+1>N</font>ARRAGANSETT-From February's quiet solitude in a skiff off Bullocks
Cove to June's hard-working women on the docks of Galilee to September's
scuba diving exploration of Bay caverns, the new 1997 Narragansett Bay
Calendar is filled with images by Rhode Island photographers. <P>
        Designed around seasonal photographs portraying the varied uses of
the Bay, the calendar is being introduced with an exhibition of photographs
chosen from the nearly 300 images contributed to the calendar project. The
exhibit, Bay Exposures: Life on the Water, will be hosted by Arnold Art
Gallery, 210 Thames Street, Newport, from October 25 through November 4. <p>
        Along with the colorful views of the Bay at work or play, the
calendar features brief narratives and intricate historical pictures that
tie into each month's theme, as well as date blocks that include historical
events and daily tide information. <P>
        The calendar and the exhibit are sponsored, in part, by a grant
awarded to the Narragansett Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve by the
NOAA Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management's Sanctuaries and
Reserves Division, with additional funds from the Narragansett Bay Estuary
Program and Rhode Island Sea Grant. The project was developed to heighten
awareness of the beauty of the Bay and its importance as a resource to the
people of Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts. <p>
        The calendar is $10. To order, or for more information, write:
Rhode Island Sea Grant Communications Office, University of Rhode Island,
Narragansett Bay Campus, Narragansett, RI 02882-1197, or call (401)

SLUG: 09-27-96 Safety for Vessels, Crews Brings Sea Grant 
Workshops to Fish Expo 
-->

<font size=+1>N</font>ARRAGANSETT-Commercial fishing is the most
dangerous occupation in the
United States. Capsizing, equipment failure, fire-not to mention fickle
weather-routinely threaten life and limb. But Rhode Island Sea Grant is
trying to improve the odds with safety training sessions to be offered as
part of the Fish Expo exhibition at Boston's World Trade Center October 18
and 19. <p>
        Demonstrations and interactive activities will cover both personal
and vessel safety in two days of workshops. Participants will brush up on
emergency communications and discuss safety tactics for air-sea rescues.
They will practice fire fighting, don immersion suits to fend off
hypothermia, and deploy a life raft to learn how to enter and exit as well
as how to right a capsized raft. Participants should wear old clothes and
bring their own immersion suits.<p>
        "We make it as real as possible," says Neil Thompson, Sea Grant
research assistant, who is coordinating the sessions. In the drill training
segment on day two, Thompson points out, each participant will lead an
emergency drill exercise. This training certifies fishing vessel captains
or owners to conduct Coast Guard-required monthly safety drills for their
crews. Completion of both days of instruction is required for Coast Guard
certification.<p>
        The workshops run from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on both days.<p>
        Conducted by certified instructors from the University of Rhode
Island Fisheries Center, the program is sponsored by Rhode Island Sea Grant
and the AT&T Cable Protection Division in cooperation with U.S. Coast
Guard, First District. Sea Grant, a university-industry-government
partnership dedicated to the wise use and management of marine resources,
has trained more than 1,000 fishermen through sessions offered at major
trade shows such as Fish Expo. The annual Fish Expo is a showcase for new
products, technologies, and services of interest to commercial fishermen,
seafood processors, and others involved in marine trades.  <p>
        Both Sea Grant workshops are free, but preregistration is required.
Call Fish Expo at (609) 587-6771 to register for the safety workshops.
Registration for the three-day Fish Expo itself is free in advance or $5 at
the door. To register for Fish Expo, call (800) 261-8925.<p>

SLUG: 09-21-96  Sea Grant Seminar at Fish Expo
-->

<center><h2>Management, Selectivity, Stock Enhancement: 
Are They Saving the Groundfish Fishery?</h2></center>

<font size=+1>N</font>ARRAGANSETT-First, fishermen were called on to cut their fishing effort by
half within five years. This fishery management tactic-Amendment 5 to the
Northeast Multispecies Groundfish Management Plan-was meant to salvage
depleted groundfish stocks. Now, Amendment 7 of the management plan calls
for an 80 percent reduction in fishing effort as soon as possible.<p>
        Is it working? Are these restrictions having any impact on
exploited stocks of cod, flounder, and haddock that once sustained the
Northeast fishing industry? How severe is their effect on the people whose
lives and livelihoods depend on fishing?<p>
        These questions will be addressed in a panel discussion sponsored
by the Rhode Island Sea Grant Marine Advisory Service and the University of
Rhode Island department of fisheries, aquaculture, and veterinary science
as part of this year's Fish Expo in Boston. "Rebuilding the Ground
Fisheries for the Year 2000" will be held Thursday, October 17, from 1:30
to 5 p.m. at Boston's World Trade Center.<p>
        The annual Fish Expo is a showcase for new products, technologies,
and services of interest to commercial fishermen, seafood processors, and
other marine tradespeople. Sea Grant, a university-industry-government
partnership dedicated to the wise use and management of marine resources,
is tapping into this forum to explore the state of the fishery. The Sea
Grant seminar is designed to encourage face-to-face dialogue among
fishermen, fishery managers, scientists, and others with a stake in the
status of groundfish stocks and the human impacts of stock restoration
measures. <p>
        Andy Rosenberg, regional administrator for the National Marine
Fisheries Service, will talk about the anticipated response of groundfish
stocks to the conditions of Amendment 7. Other speakers, including
regulators, Sea Grant scientists, and fishermen, will cover issues ranging
from gear selectivity and bycatch reduction to stock enhancement projects
to "safety net" resources available for fishing families. Question and
answer sessions will allow audience interaction with panelists.<p>
        Seating for the panel discussion is limited, and registration is
advised. To register for the panel discussion, contact Dana Morse at the
URI fisheries department, (401) 874-2012. Registration for the three-day
Fish Expo itself is free in advance or $5 at the door. Call (800) 261-8925
to register for Fish Expo.<p>

SLUG: 07-10-96	Aquaculture Conference Farming the Sea:
		Not 'If,' But 'When'>
                                                    


<center><h2>Aquaculture Conference Farming the Sea: <br>
 Not 'If,' But 'When'</h2></center>

<font size=+1>N</font>ARRAGANSETT-It may not feed the world or cure cancer.
Then again, it may.
Panacea or not, aquaculture is the key to turning dwindling resources into
food and medicines for a booming population. <p>
        "To do or not to do aquaculture is not the option," declared David
Vaughn, executive director of the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute in
Florida. "We need 160 to 170 million metric tons (of fish) just to feed
people in the next 25 years. It's not going to come from leveled off
landings," he cautioned, referring to the depressed state of the fishing
industry. "It's going to come from aquaculture." <p>
        This sentiment surfaced repeatedly during a recent conference,
"Defining the Future of Aquaculture in Rhode Island," sponsored by the
Rhode Island Legislative Commission on Aquaculture, the Narragansett Bay
Commission, Rhode Island Sea Grant, URI-Partnership for the Coastal
Environment, the Northeast Regional Aquaculture Center, and the Ocean State
Aquaculture Association. Fishermen, businesspeople, scientists, regulators,
and environmentalists gathered more than 200 strong in Newport and
Narragansett to determine what their roles might be in the sea-farming
future.    <p>
        Although aquaculture tends to focus primarily on food production,
it could have equal significance in drug development. But the promise of
pharmaceuticals from the sea is tempered by the problem of supply. "About
70,000 compounds have been isolated from marine organisms in the last 20
years, yet not one serious drug has been developed," stated Yuzuru Shimizu,
URI professor of pharmacognosy and environmental health sciences. "You
extract tons of material to get only a few milligrams of compound," Shimizu
said, "and no pharmaceutical company will finance that." The only way to
obtain marine organisms in the quantities required, he said, is by
culturing them. <p>
        Shimizu is developing large-scale culture systems intended to
ensure adequate and reliable supplies of marine organisms with a grant from
the National Sea Grant College Program.<p>
         Rhode Island has the resources to be a major 
player in global aquaculture efforts, asserted state Rep. 
Eileen Naughton, chair of the R.I. Legislative Commission 
on Aquaculture. "A maritime heritage dating to the
earliest colonies, a ready workforce, the brain power at URI, and a
duty-free facility at Quonset Point" could put this state in the
aquaculture vanguard. Yet, of the 49 jurisdictions with an aquaculture
harvest last year, Naughton noted, "Rhode Island came in dead last."<p>
        The problem is partly the state's "torturous" regulatory process,
several conference speakers conceded, and partly a wariness stemming from
turn-of-the-century conflicts between shellfishermen and oyster-culture
bottom-lease holders. Naughton expressed optimism that her commission's
bill to streamline the regulatory process would speed up permitting. She
also suggested that the commission's meetings with shellfishermen have
helped persuade fishermen "that we mean what we say and that there's room
for everyone."<p>
        Transient gear and land-based aquaculture are emerging techniques
that allow fishermen and fish farmers to ply their trades without violating
each other's turf. Transient gear-still under regulatory consideration in
Rhode Island-permits aquaculturists to grow shellfish in portable cages,
therefore avoiding interference with natural shellfish beds. Land-based
aquaculture grows finfish in tanks, where temperature, diet, and other
factors can be controlled, therefore speeding growth and shortening the
time for getting a fish to market, explained David Bengtson, URI biological
sciences associate professor. Bengtson and Jennifer Specker, URI biological
sciences professor, are working under Sea Grant funding to culture summer
flounder, a species of strong biological and economic potential. "The
Japanese flounder industry realizes a $100 million a year profit," Specker
said. "Japanese flounder is the same genus as the Rhode Island summer
flounder. So if we move quickly, we can do similarly well."<p>
        As the work of the Sea Grant scientists suggests, a crucial issue
for aquaculture is funding. That issue is beginning to be addressed, said
Marcel Valois, director of the R.I. Economic Development Corporation, who
reported that aquaculture is one of six industries targeted by the governor
for economic development. Lenders and venture capitalists also need to be
educated about the potential of aquaculture, added John Toic, Economic
Development Corporation research analyst, so the industry can be assured
access to financing.<p>
        Naughton's vision extends to a commodities exchange for cultured
fish, similar to grain exchanges. If aquaculture can ensure steady
supplies, she reasons, "there's no reason why Rhode Island can't take the
lead."<p>

Warwick, East Greenwich, N. Kingstown town boards
earn Sea Grant citations
</h2></center>
<p>
<font size=+1>N</font>ARRAGANSETT, RI
 -Municipal board and commission members from Warwick, East 
Greenwich, and N. Kingstown were honored Wednesday night, 
May 29, by > the Rhode Island Sea Grant Program. Awarding 
the certificates was Scott Nixon, Rhode Island Sea Grant 
director.<p>
        The 28 members of the three town boards and commissions completed
an eight-week course that will help them do their job better-make wise
decisions on the future of Greenwich Bay. <p>
        Greenwich Bay, a 15-square-mile shallow estuary, is typical of
other bays along the coast: Water quality is deteriorating, fisheries are
closed, and conflict for use of limited space is increasing. <p>
        Last August, Rhode Island Sea Grant was awarded a two-year,
$534,538 grant from the National Sea Grant College Program to assist the
citizens of Greenwich Bay in their fight to reclaim the bay. The
multi-faceted Sea Grant program combines research and education. Its goals
are to increase understanding of pollutants in Greenwich Bay and to
translate this knowledge to assist in improved management of the bay and
its resources.<p>
        Unfortunately, very little is known about the bay as an ecosystem.
Government is prepared to take action to stop the pollution and to sustain
the fishery. Yet there is a paucity of information to set priorities to
guide decisions.<p>
         Sea Grant research is focusing on four broad     
questions: What are
the principal contaminant loads entering the bay and when? How are these
contaminants transported and dispersed in the bay? Does the bay have a low
dissolved oxygen problem? What remedial measures will be most effective in
improving the water quality of the bay?<p>
        The eight-week Sea Grant education short course was developed and
conducted by Pam Pogue, Coastal Resources Center (CRC) project coordinator.
Its objectives were to equip the watershed's volunteer board and commission
members with the knowledge necessary to make well integrated local land use
and waterfront decisions regarding Greenwich Bay. Central to the course was
a training manual that covered information pertinent to the issues
affecting Greenwich Bay. Before launching the program, Pogue met with local
and state officials in the watershed to obtain a needs assessment for the
training program.<p>
        "The people that serve on Rhode Island's numerous local volunteer
boards dealing with environmental issues are not only asked to give up
tremendous amounts of their own time, but increasingly asked to deal with
sophisticated technical issues," says Nixon. "Since most of the people are
not scientists or engineers, we think it is really important for Sea Grant
to try to give them some of the background information they need to reach
better decisions and to protect the environmental for all of us."<p>
        The unprecedented commitment of the public, local, and state
government to restore the bay makes it an ideal place to focus Sea Grant
research, outreach, and coastal management strategies, says Virginia Lee,
R.I. Sea Grant and CRC coastal management coordinator. <p>

<center><h1>Two URI Students Named to Knauss Sea Grant 
Fellowships</h1></center>

<font size=+1>NARRAGANSETT</font>-Two University of Rhode 
Island (URI) graduate students in marine 
affairs are among 26 graduate students nationwide who have received one-year 
National Sea Grant College Program Dean A. Knauss Marine Policy Fellowships. 
Laura M. Ernst and Andrea L. Oliver, both of Wakefield, are working at the 
National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) in Washington, D.C. <p>

Ernst, a master's degree candidate in marine affairs, is in the NMFS Office of 
Habitat Conservation. A native of Block Island, she worked at the University of 
Rhode Island Coastal Resources Center (CRC) from June 1994 until she received 
the Knauss Fellowship. At CRC, she served as a research assistant on a project 
for the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council, which examined 
nutrient inputs to Rhode Island's south shore salt ponds over a 15-year period.
<p>

Oliver, who completed her master's in marine affairs in December, is doing her 
fellowship at the NMFS Office of Protected Resources. She has worked in 
Washington, D.C. as a legislative staff assistant, and in Switzerland for the 
World Health Organization. She has also served as a mate and instructor aboard 
traditional sailing ships.<p>

Both candidates were nominated by the Rhode Island Sea Grant College Program at 
URI. Announcement of their final selection was made by Scott Nixon, Rhode Island
Sea Grant College Program director. <P>

Established in 1979, the Dean John A. Knauss Marine Policy Fellowship Program 
was designed to offer select students the unique opportunity to learn how marine
policy is developed and implemented at the national level. The National Sea 
Grant College Program was established in 1966. Its mission is to advance 
research, education, and outreach on marine issues for the public benefit.<P>

<center><h2>Large-scale Culturing Key to Drugs from Sea</h2></center>
        
        Although expectations have remained high that new drugs would one day 
emerge from the ocean, not a single serious drug has so far been developed from 
natural marine products. The problem is not one of potential -- which is 
enticing -- but of supply. <p>
        With Sea Grant support, Yuzuru Shimizu, University of Rhode Island (URI)
professor of pharmacognosy and environmental health sciences, and a team of URI 
scientists from pharmacognosy, oceanography, and chemical engineering, are 
addressing the frustrating dilemma of how to bring promising, anti-tumor 
compounds that exist in the marine environment to commercialization so they can 
be used in the fight against cancer and other diseases.   <p>
        To date, literally thousands of new compounds have been isolated from 
marine organisms, many with unique and exciting biological activity. The 
problem is getting enough material to ensure a steady supply. <p>
        "It is our firm belief that without securing replenishable sources of 
material, no marine products will become practical drugs," says Shmizu.<p>
        Not only is the challenge to obtain enough of the material, it is to 
ensure a steady supply so that drug companies can make the necessary time 
and financial commitment to bring these compounds to commercialization.<p>

<h3>A Culture System</h3>

        During the next three years, Shimizu and his research team will develop 
large-scale culture systems for a marine organism with particularly exciting 
anti-tumor capabilities -- dinoflagellates (unicellular phytoplankton). The 
particular promise of metabolites from some of these organisms is well supported
by ShimizuUs past work with the National Cancer Institute and Bristol-Myers 
Squibb. And, while this project will concentrate on dinoflagellates, the outcome
can be applied to other marine organisms. <p>
        "If we can show that metabolites from these organisms can be cultured 
and grown on a large scale, then we will have answered the major hurdle 
to the use of the vast potential of unknown therapeutic compounds waiting 
for discovery and development from the sea," Shimizu says. "Once that's 
shown, investigation and development could be rapid."<p>

<h3>Large Tank Production</h3>

        Two approaches will be taken. To test the feasibility of the large 
scale-up needed to produce enough quantity of a select compound for 
commercialization, the researchers will capitalize on the unique, large 15,000 
liter tanks housed at the Marine Ecosystem Research Laboratory (MERL) at URI. 
The second approach will be to build a continuous culture system using a 
fermentor with fiber-optics and state-of-the-art control and monitoring systems.
<P>
        Such a demonstration of large-scale culturing success is clearly 
essential before marine-derived pharmaceuticals can become a reality. It is 
hoped that by scaling up to the 15,000-liter level of the MERL tanks, it will 
dispel industry's concerns about the ability to supply the quantity of the 
compound needed for suc- cessful development. The MERL tanks are particularly 
well-suited because they're about the same size as industrial production units. 
<p>
        "It is not an overstatement that without the establishment of mass 
culture systems, all past and ongoing efforts in marine natural products 
chemistry will be wasted," Shimizu says. "The successful mass culture will 
enable us to conduct preclinical and clinical tests of promising potential 
drugs, and will eliminate the industryUs concern about the supply of the 
compounds in the event they become therapeutic drugs."<p>
        "If successful, this project will remove the biggest obstacle in the use
of marine organisms for drugs," Shimizu says.<p>

<H3>Environmental Quality</H3>



<H1>Volunteers Help Monitor U.S. Coastal Zone</H1>

</CENTER>

Volunteer environmental monitoring has become a national movement.  From a
series of disjointed, grassroots monitoring efforts that began in the
freshwater environment in the 1970s and in the marine environment in the
1980s, volunteer monitoring has grown into a national network -- thanks to efforts by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Rhode Island Sea Grant, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

<P>

Although volunteers had been used for more than 100 years by the National Weather Service to record daily temperature and rainfall statistics, water quality monitoring, particularly in the marine environment, is complex. In addition to temperature, marine sampling requires readings on salinity, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll, nutrient concentrations and depth. 

<P>

The first volunteer water monitoring pilot projects began with lakes and streams in the 1970s. Then Rhode Island Sea Grant established the first volunteer pilot project in the marine environment  in 1979. Led by Sea Grant coastal management coordinator Virginia Lee, the Rhode Island Salt Pond Watchers became a model for volunteer marine monitoring efforts in the Chesapeake Bay and on Cape Cod. 

<P>

<H2>Establishing Credibility</H2>



In the late 1980s, however, the question of reliability concerned EPA and state agencies. At first, government officials did not think that volunteers could gather credible data. They thought only scientists could perform reliable tests. 

<P>

But that opinion changed. First, volunteers became sophisticated about quality assurance, achieving a demonstrable record of success in collecting credible data that could be used for management decisions.  

<P>

A milestone was reached in 1987 when the Alliance for the Chesapeake Bay prepared the first EPA-approved Quality Assurance Project Plan for a volunteer monitoring project. As the National Estuary Program evolved, volunteer monitoring grew as a component of these programs. Today, it's a component of all the National Estuary Programs in the country. 

<P>

A further boost to credibility was EPA's formal guidance to states to use volunteers in monitoring state waters. Since 1991, EPA has considered quality-assured data produced by trained volunteers equal to, and on par with, professional data for states' 305(b) reports.

<P>

"This marks just one of the ways in which we are seeing volunteer data come of age in the 305(b) process," says Alice Mayo, EPA volunteer monitoring coordinator. Today, Mayo says that state officials use the 305(b) reports to decide which waters to  clean up. "And EPA and Congress rely on the national 305(b) reports to tell us where we as a nation need to focus our pollution control resources," she says.

<P>

The second factor that contributed to the growth of volunteer monitoring was that government agencies increasingly began to see the value of volunteer monitors as their own budgets shrank, forcing cutbacks on data collection. In addition, the shear magnitude of the monitoring effort was daunting. As one Minnesota researcher says, "How can the state of Minnesota afford to monitor 12,000 lakes?" The answer, it seems, is trained volunteers. As a result, by 1993, many states were utilizing trained volunteers to monitor water quality. 

<P>

<H2>Network Grows Tenfold</H2>



From the disparate, disjointed grassroots efforts of the late 1970s and 1980s, a national network has now emerged. The success of the program can perhaps best be seen in the national directory of monitoring programs published by Rhode Island Sea Grant and EPA over the past six years. The first edition, published in 1988, listed only 44 environmental monitoring programs. The fourth edition, published in 1994, now lists more than 500 environmental monitoring programs nationwide. 

<P>

As for the future, Sea Grant's Lee says, "We will see volunteers linking up along whole water- sheds. We will see environmental quality as a critical social issue for urban and rural communities."

<H3>Coastal Archaeology</H3>



<H1>2,500-Year-Old Village Predates Agriculture</H1>

</CENTER>

Sea Grant research has changed our perception of Native American history in New England. Based on this discovery, we now know that by 500 B.C., Algonquian-speaking Indians of the Eastern Seaboard, closely related to Narragansetts, had settled into permanent, year-round village life on Block Island, some 10 miles off the coast of Rhode Island.

<P>

The discovery has startled anthropologists and set the archaeological timetable for southern New England back by more than 1,000 years. Before this discovery, the traditional view was that year-round villages only became possible with the rise of agriculture. In the Northeast, the earliest known use of maize (corn) did not occur until 1160 -- nearly 1,500 years after people had settled into permanent villages on Block Island, where the economy was based on marine resources.

<P>

"As far as we know, this is the oldest evidence we have for year-round villages in southern New England -- and maybe for the whole Northeast," says Kevin McBride, Rhode Island Sea GrantÐsponsored archaeologist who led the Block Island excavation.

<P>

<H2>Archaeological First</H2>



Until this discovery, the Northeast was thought an archaeological backwater compared to the rest of the United States.

<P>

While modern humans (Homo sapiens sapiens) first appeared on Earth only 40,000 years ago, it wasn't until 30,000 years ago that they began to penetrate the colder regions of the world. Scientists estimate that the earliest arrivals in North America did not cross the then-exposed Bering Strait land bridge until 27,000 to 28,000 years ago.

<P>

Once in North America, this migration spread both south and east. Given this west-to-east movement, the Northeast might logically seem one of the last places to experience human habitation, but this lateness was compounded even more by the existence of huge glacial ice sheets that then covered the area. It wasn't until 15,000 years ago -- about the time that humans reached Peru -- that the retreat of the existing glacial ice sheet gave them access to the Northeast.

<P>

It was not an accident that early people chose the Block Island site, says Nicholas Bellantoni, Connecticut state archaeologist.  "It was like a Garden of Eden, rich with resources."

In fact, it was Bellantoni's find of a few small fragments near Block Island's Great Salt Pond that began the search. But it was funding from Rhode Island Sea Grant that allowed the search to continue and led to the discovery.

<P>

"The money from Sea Grant allowed us to take an intensive look at this site," McBride says. "This is something you rarely get to do."

<P>

Evidence shows that houses at the site were 30 feet long by 18 feet wide and probably constructed of saplings bent over like present-day Quonset huts. Because the houses were so large, they may have been multi-family. Some 15 to 20 houses would fit in the area, with a distance between households of nine to 18 yards. 

<P>

<H2>Results Startling</H2>



At first, McBride thought he had discovered a 16th-century site. After all, archaeologists didn't expect to find a permanent year-round site pre-dating the rise of agriculture. Even when preliminary information began to indicate that the site might be early -- earlier than anyone had suspected possible -- McBride resisted the idea. "You fit the evidence to suit your predisposition," he says.

<P>

But hints at earliness kept surfacing. Early pottery was pointed to fit into a fire; later pottery was rounded, with constricted necks that could be tied and hung over a fire. The pottery at this site was all pointed. But that was not conclusive. 

<P>

"If you find rounded pottery, you know you have a late site," McBride says. "But the case is not so clear with pointed pottery. All you can say for sure is that it may be early. " 

<P>

To find out the site's date for sure, Sea Grant funded the radiocarbon dating of three samples. When the results came in, the dates were startling--all ranged from 2,400 to 2,450 years old. McBride now has a total of five separate radiocarbon dates for the site. All fall between 2,350 to 2,550 years old.

<P>

The discovery not only pushes back the date for year-round settlements in southern New England, it also provides evidence that permanent settlements were possible without agriculture.

<P>

The site is now part of a 1,500- acre area listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<center><h2>First International Conference on Shellfish 
Restoration Set for Nov. 20-23, 1996, on Hilton Head  
Island, S.C.</h2></center>

<font size=+1>C</font>HARLESTON, SC The International Conference on Shellfish 
Restoration (ICSR '96) will focus on the restoration of 
molluscan shellfish and their habitat. Those who will
benefit from the conference include government officials, resource
managers, local residents and industry representatives from not only the
United States, but from other countries as well.<p>

The conference is set for Nov. 20-23, 1996, on Hilton Head Island, S.C.<p>

Often referred to as "the canary in the mine shaft," shellfish and the
waters they populate serve as excellent indicators of environmental health,
according to conference organizer Dorothy Leonard of the National Marine
Fisheries Service, a division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA).<p>

"There is a growing commitment to the restoration of degraded coastal
ecosystems throughout the world," Leonard said. "Political pressure by
shareholders in the future of the world's coastal areas has resulted in
renewed interest in preserving and enhancing coastal resources by all
levels of government."<p>

The conference program will feature invited and contributed oral and poster
presentations and workshops.<p>

Sessions will be organized around three general themes:
<ul>
<li>Shellfish Habitat Assessment and Restoration;
<li>Shellfish Stock Enhancement, Management and Restoration;
<li>Shellfish/Habitat Remediation through Watershed Management and Pollution
Abatement.
</ul>

Abstracts are being accepted for consideration by the Conference Program
Committee from anyone with experience in shellfish management, research or
restoration through June 30.<p>

<H3>Hard Clam Aquaculture</H3>



<H1>Clam Farm Set To Meet 10% Of World Demand</H1>

</CENTER>

Faced simultaneously  with increased consumer demand and declining clam populations over the past three decades, folks who enjoy prime seafood now have plenty of reasons to be "happy as a James Island clam!"

<P>

International Mariculture Resources, Inc., has invested more than $6 million over the past four years to develop Atlantic Little-Neck ClamFarm on James Island, S.C., a few miles southeast of Charleston. 

<P>

Research and extension efforts funded by the South Carolina Sea Grant Consortium and the favorable investment climate created in South Carolina through a statewide strategic marketing plan contributed to the company's decision to invest there.

<P>

Opening its doors in August 1991, the 30,300-square-foot facility can spawn up to 400 million clam larvae a week. With potential production of 100 million marketable clams each year, Atlantic Farms is positioned to meet more than 10 percent of the world demand for hard clams.

<P>

<H2>Perfect Fit for Aquaculture</H2>



With growing consumer desire for seafood exceeding domestic supply, aquaculture has been gaining national attention. 

<P>

This certainly is true in South Carolina, where the potential for future aquaculture development is greatly enhanced due to the suitability of the climate, 

physiography and other features of the region.

<P>

To make the most of this potential, South Carolina Sea Grant has been committed to developing the hard-clam aquaculture industry since the consortium's creation in 1980. Between 1980 and 1982, Sea Grant's support focused on identifying the clams' biological requirements in a cultured environment. This research determined that biologically the hard clam was an excellent candidate for aquaculture in South Carolina.

<P>

The research focus shifted during 1982-85 to improving the hatchery and nursery phases of hard clam aquaculture. This work produced a technology for the hard clam nursery that saved significant time and labor costs, while at the same time improved the growth and survival of juvenile clams. 

<P>

<H2>National Adaptations</H2>



Many shellfish-culture operations around the United States adopted this technology in the mid-1980s, including Bluepoints Co. (Sayville, N.Y.), Bristol Shellfish (Round Pond, Maine), Shinnecock Tribal Hatchery Project (South Hampton, N.Y.), Marine Bioservices (Bristol, Maine), Aquaculture Research Corp. (Dennis, Mass.), and Coast Oyster Co. (Quilcene, Wash.)

<P>

From 1985 to 1992, Sea Grant has undertaken a large-scale, long-term clam genetics research program to develop and improve hard clam aquaculture broodstocks.

<P>

In addition to supporting the research aspect of this growing industry through the past decade, South Carolina Sea Grant played a pivotal management and policy role in drafting "The Strategic Plan for Aquaculture in South Carolina." 

<P>

Prepared for the South Carolina Joint Legislative Committee on Aquaculture in 1988-89, this strategic plan has helped create a conducive atmosphere in South Carolina for all aquaculture industries, including hard clam.

<H1>Scientists Look To Nature For New Technologies</H1>

</CENTER>

In the multimillion-dollar race to invent new materials that are kinder to our environment, South Carolina scientists are learning a few things from the oyster.

<P>

Over the past eight years, the South Carolina Sea Grant Consortium has supported research to explore how proteins -- polypeptides, to be exact -- can be used to provide environmentally friendly alternatives in a variety of commercial applications. 

<P>

By studying how the Eastern oyster builds its shell, Sea Grant researcher A.P. "Hap" Wheeler is developing new materials that could replace many non-biodegradable substances currently used by industries and consumers. The Journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science calls the process "biomimetic," a mimicking of biology.

<P>

"Technology is looking to biology for instruction," says Wheeler, a biology professor at Clemson University. 

<P>

<H2>New Biodegradable Products</H2>



Wheeler studies how oysters grow their shells to the appropriate shape using proteins that limit mineral growth. These proteins prevent crusty build-up in the wrong places. An understanding of this natural process could lend itself to various technologies. 

<P>

For example, industries use thousands of non-biodegradable chemicals to reduce crystal growth in pipes, heat exchangers and boilers. These new materials, however, both reduce crystal growth and naturally decompose.

<P>

Another recent Wheeler discovery is a class of oyster molecules with super-absorption properties, soaking up 80 or more times their weight in water. This discovery could result in the replacement of non-biodegradable super-absorbents in disposable diapers and sanitary napkins. 

Another application for the new materials could be as a detergent additive. The most effective detergents include dispersants which prevent soil and minerals from settling back onto the laundry or dishes during the wash cycle. 

<P>

Unfortunately, today's best chemical dispersants are non-biodegradable. Hundreds of millions of pounds of these chemicals are released into the environment each year, piling up in the water column, sludge or soil.

<P>

Wheeler's research has generated six patents, two books, 14 publications and two book chapters. 

<P>

<H2>Private Sector Investments</H2>



In addition, an independent firm, Donlar Corp., was created as a result of this research to begin large-scale synthesis and to market simple peptides. To date, Donlar Corp. has invested more than $2 million in the technology and filed for several patents. So far, five patents have been granted. 

<P>

Through a research and licensing agreement, Donlar Corp. has augmented Sea Grant's support of this effort by contributing $70,000 in research funds to Clemson. In addition, Proctor and Gamble Co. provided a $20,000 gift in 1992-93 to augment Sea Grant funds for the study of the biodegradability of synthetic polymers.

<P>

Another start-up company, Biotechtronix, has been formed based on the instrument-ation developed to conduct this Sea Grant-supported research and has filed a patent for this technology.

<! Slug: 08-15-96: Shipwreck! LaSalle's Boat Found>

<center><h2>Shipwreck!</h2></center>


  On a typical hot June day in Texas last year a not-so-typical group of
people anchored their boat in the shallow water of Matagorda Bay and dove
into history ... literally.<p>
  On the silty bottom of the bay these divers, including archaeologists
from the Texas Historical Commission and archaeology students from across
the country, found the remains of La Belle, the personal vessel of the
French explorer Rene Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle. La Belle had been
waiting silently on the bay floor since she ran aground and sank in a storm
in 1686, leaving La Salle's fledgling Texas colony cut off from France, and
help.<p>
  Hailed as one of the most important archaeological finds ever in this
hemisphere, La Belle is but one of about 2,000 shipwrecks that dot the
Texas coast.<p>
  The summer issue of "Texas Shores" magazine takes a 
look at historic Texas shipwrecks in general and the
La Belle project in particular. The magazine chronicles La Salle's life and
impact on Texas and what finding La Belle means to the archaeological
community and, ultimately, to the people of Texas.<p>
  "Texas Shores" also explores the fact and lore surrounding shipwrecks
from the 1554 Spanish silver fleet that sunk near the Mansfield Cut on
Padre Island to the U-166, a German submarine known to have sunk in the
Gulf of Mexico during World War II and rumored to have gone to her final
rest off the Texas coast.<p>
  Anyone interested in history, or just high adventure, will enjoy the
summer issue of "Texas Shores."<p>

SLUG: 08-02-96 What To Do In The Midst of A Hurricane!>


<center><h2>What To Do In The Midst Of A Hurricane!</h2></center>

  A hurricane has been spotted in the Gulf of Mexico. Will it hit your
town? What can you do if it does? How can you prepare your home and your
family for the destruction of the storm before it hits? And, what can you
do after it hits?<p>
  These and other questions are answered in the Texas Sea Grant Program's
newest bilingual publication, Hurricane!, available August 5.<p>
  This 32 page book, along with 9 illustrations, details what a hurricane
is, and also provides step-by-step instructions for hurricane preparation
and evacuation plans, a tracking chart, and suggestions for recovery after
the storm.<p>
  Hurricane! provides a glossary of terms where, for example, you can learn
the difference between a hurricane watch and a hurricane warning.<p>
  Ever wonder why there has never been a hurricane named Xavier or Quincy?
Hurricane! answers this question, too, and provides the lists of names to
be used through the year 2000.<p>
  By reading Hurricane! you'll learn what storm surge is and how it can
sometimes be more damaging than the storm itself. Discover, too, how
tornadoes and hurricanes are related.<p>
  Written in English and Spanish, Hurricane! will make an excellent
addition to any classroom or home, whether you live inland or at the
water's edge.<p>
  For more information on other bilingual publications or to request a copy
of Hurricane!, contact the Texas Sea Grant Program at 1716 Briarcrest,
Suite 603, Bryan, Texas 77802 or call (409)862-3767. Single copies are
free; call for the price of bulk orders or classroom sets.

<! SLUG: 07-29-96  Give It Two Fins Up For Texas Seafood Industry>



<center><h2>Give It Two Fins Up: A
Review Of Texas Seafood Industry</h2></center>

  Hungry for a little Texas seafood?<p>
  So are millions of other people in Texas and around the country and the
world, making Texas one of the largest seafood producers in the United
States.<p>
  In the latest Marine Advisory publication from the Texas Sea Grant
Program, the Texas Marine Advisory Service and the Texas Agricultural
Extension Service, Seafood Marketing Specialist Michael Haby analyzes Texas
contributions to the domestic seafood industry.<p>
  While not catching more seafood than other states - Texas doesn't even
rank in the top 10 in average amount of pounds landed every year - Texas'
crop is among the most valuable. Texas ranks fourth in the average of catch
among the states and the ports of Port Arthur, Galveston, Freeport, Aransas
Pass-Rockport and Brownsville-Port Isabel are traditionally among the top
30 most valuable ports annually.<p>
  Brownsville-Port Isabel is considered the most valuable port south and of
New Bedford, Mass. and Kodiak and Dutch Harbor, Alaska.<p>
  Shrimp is the bread and butter of Texas commercial fishermen. One quarter
of all domestic shrimp landings and 33 cents out of every dollar's worth of
shrimp landed in the United States came off a boat fishing in Texas'
waters.<p>
  The Advisory was originally designed to provide an objective analysis of
the seafood industry for decision makers within the industry, the
businesses serving the commercial fisheries and the policy makers  at the
local state and federal levels.<p>
  The document is available from marine agents along the coast and from the
Texas Sea Grant Program's Marine Information Service. The Marine
Information Service can be reached at (409) 862-3767.<p>
  The Marine Advisory Service is a cooperative effort of the Texas A&M Sea
Grant College Program, the Texas Agricultural Extension Service and
commissioner's courts in participating counties.

<! SLUG: 07-19-96  Gulf Shrimp Season Off To Slow Start>


<font size=-1>July 19, 1996</font>
 
<center><h2>Gulf Shrimp Season Off To Slow Start</h2></center>

  Like their cotton- and wheat-growing brethren on the land, shrimp
fishermen along the Texas Gulf may experience a lean 1996 harvest.<p>
  While lack of rain plays some part in the shortfall, experts place more
blame on late cold fronts for the dimmer prospects.<p>
  The Texas offshore shrimp season opened at 30 minutes
after sunset, July 15.<p>
  "Low tides and cool temperatures in March and April impacted things,"
said Gary Graham, fisheries specialist with the Texas Marine Advisory
Service.<p>
  The Galveston-based Southeast Fisheries Science Center of the National
Marine Fisheries Service is predicting this year's brown shrimp catch to be
between 500,000 to 2 million pounds lighter than the 1960-1994 historical
average.<p>
  Juvenile shrimp usually make their way into the bays from February
through early April, after the water temperature reaches more than 60
degrees. The marshes in the bays provide "nurseries" for the young shrimp
to grow. But late cold fronts dropped water temperatures in Texas bays too
low, hindering shrimp growth, Graham explained. And the north winds blew
water out of the bays, which meant lower water levels in the marshes. All
this led to a shorter growing season and smaller shrimp.<p>
  Tony Reisinger, marine agent for Cameron County, which contains the
fishing ports of Port Isabel and Brownsville, said first day catches were
not good.<p>
  "They were bringing 5 to 9 boxes," he said. "They usually do more than 10."<p>
  Each box contains 100 pounds of shrimp.<p>
  Nancy Webb, marine agent for Matagorda County, which contains the fishing
port of Palacios, said reports from the first two nights of shrimping
indicated a very slow start to the 1996 season.<p>
  One shrimping fleet reported 700 to 1,200 pounds per boat on the first
night, compared to about 2,000 for the first night last year, Webb said.
The second night was even weaker with between 400 and 500 pounds per boat.<p>
  Graham said the biggest catch he has heard of by any one boat on the
first night was 10 boxes.<p>
  "They usually average 15 to 20 and 20 to 30 isn't unheard of," he said.
"I know of one guy who caught 76 boxes on opening night."<p>
  Adding to the shrimpers' woes is a weak market for the type of shrimp
they are catching.<p>
  Louisiana and Florida reported good crops of shrimp. This usually doesn't
hurt Texas, because Texas shrimp are traditionally larger - and therefore
more valuable. But because of a shorter growing season, Texas shrimpers are
catching smaller shrimp. With the market already loaded with the small
shrimp, prices are down.<p>
  Webb reported that a Palacios fish house was getting $3 for 26-35 count
shrimp (meaning it takes an average of 26 to 35 shrimp to make up a pound).
The same size was bringing $3.35 at this time last year, she said.<p>
  The price of large, 10-12 count shrimp is up, however. Where they brought
$8.50 last year, they now are worth $9, Webb said. But that size shrimp are
few are far between, she said.<p>
  But Graham is not ready to write off the entire season. Shrimpers usually
net 60 percent of their yearly catch in July and August, he said, and then
things start dropping off.<p>
  "My thinking is that the season will just be later than usual," he said.
  A shrimper will start out averaging up to 15 boxes, Graham said, then
dropping to about 10 boxes after about five days, then to five boxes after
a couple of weeks and to below 3 after about a month.<p>
  Graham believes that the shrimp will continue coming out of the bays in
steady numbers and that shrimpers will see steady production of three to
four boxes through December and January.<p>
  The Southeast Fisheries Science Center predicts shrimp catch based on two
models.<p>
  The environmental model uses temperature, rainfall and tidal water height
to predict shrimp production. This year's model predicts that the Texas
Gulf brown shrimp harvest will be about 26.5 million pounds, compared to
the historical average of 27 million.<p>
  The Galveston Bay Bait Index, historically more reliable than the
environmental index, predicts a harvest of 25.1 million pounds of brown
shrimp. This index comes from monitoring the Galveston Bay bait shrimp
fishery from late April through early June.<p>
  But the forecast also says that warmer water temperatures in April and
May may mean increased recruitment (when a shrimp grows to catchable size,
it is "recruited" into a fishery), growth and survival of shrimp after the
monitoring period.<p>
  The Marine Advisory Service is a cooperative effort of the Texas A&M Sea
Grant College Program, the Texas Agricultural Extension Service and
commissioner's courts in participating counties.<p>

<center><h2>How To Deal With Stressed Fish? Read On</h2></center>

  These hot, dry times can be stressful ... especially if you're a fish.<p>
  The warm weather and drought conditions can cause stress on fish in
ponds, and can result in a fish kill.<p>
  A farm pond management workshop, sponsored by Texas Sea Grant's Marine
Advisory Service and the Texas Agricultural Extension Service, will be held
July 25 in Brazoria County to offer advice on keeping those fish healthy.<p>
  Dr. Jim Davis, professor and extension fisheries specialist with Texas
A&M and TAES, David Daniels with the Natural Resource Conservation Service,
environmental biologist H.M. Garner and Brett Rowley, general manager and
fisheries biologist with Great Lakes, Inc. will be on hand to discuss:<p>

<ul>
<li>Pond construction and watershed management;
<li>Evaluation of pond balance;
<li>Weed control;
<li>Fertilization; and
<li>Enhancement strategies.
</ul>
  A demonstration will take place at Steve Veselka's pond on Brazoria
County Road 171, from 5-6:15 p.m.<p>
  An expanded discussion will take place from 7-9 p.m. at the Brazoria
County Extension Auditorium in Angleton, also on CR 171.<p>

<! SLUG: 07-15-96 Dolphin Strandings On Record Pace For Texas 
Coast>



<center><h2>Dolphin Strandings On Record Pace For Texas Coast</h2></center>

  A virus that caused a record number of deaths in dolphins in 1994 is
believed to be causing problems again along the upper Texas coast.<p>
  As of July 1, 183 dolphins have washed up on Texas shores this year, said
Ann Bull, State Operations Coordinator of the Texas Marine Mammal Stranding
Network. That compares to 116 for all of 1995.<p>
  "The speculation is that the morbillivirus is the culprit," Bull said in
a telephone interview from the Network's Galveston office. "That was the
cause in the 1994 kill-off and these dolphins appear to be in the same
condition."<p>
  A record number of dolphins - 297 - washed up on Texas shores in 1994,
with most of them bloated and badly decomposed. The dolphins coming ashore
now are in a similar condition. Bull said 150 dolphins wash ashore in a
"normal" year. Not all the dolphins washing ashore have the virus, Bull
said, but the virus is believed to be contributing to the elevated number.<p>
  Lung tissue samples are being sent to Washington, D.C., Bull said, to
determine the cause of death. A few dolphins, found before they were badly
decomposed, had full necropsies at the University of Texas Medical Branch
in Galveston. The local tests indicated that the dolphins were infected by
the morbillivirus.<p>
  Most of the dolphins have washed ashore between the Bolivar Peninsula and
Freeport, she said, and have been washing ashore on a "regular basis" since
late December.<p>
  Only one dolphin with the virus has washed ashore alive, Bull said. The
female spotted dolphin eventually was euthanized because of parasites in
her brain.<p>
  The virus affects the animals immune systems, Bull said. The stronger
ones can survive it, she said, but the weak ones fall victim to diseases.<p>
  "The dolphins are probably coming ashore here because of the currents,"
she said. "We think that the dolphins are actually dying off of the
Louisiana coast, but that's just a theory."<p>
  Another oddity is that the virus was not found at all in the Gulf until
1994, she said. And the virus has recently made an appearance in California
coast, where it was previously unknown.<p>

<h3>Important clarification of previous press release</h3>

  Sea Grant would like to clarify a July 15 press release regarding dolphin
strandings in 1996.<p>
  While it is true that numbers for stranded dolphins are up in Texas, the
majority of the sea mammals washed on shore in the first quarter of 1996,
said Ann Bull, State Operations Coordinator of the Texas Marine Mammal
Stranding Network.<p>
  The total on July 1 was 183, but more than half - 104 - washed ashore in
January, February or March of this year.<p>
  Historically, most dolphin strandings occur in the first three months of
the year. The downward trend usually continues until the end of the year,
when strandings begin to increase again.

Slug: 07-15-96 Egging On The Turtles at Padre Island 
National Seashore>

 
<center><h2>Egging On The Turtles at Padre
Island National Seashore</h2></center>

  By July 8, the Padre Island National Seashore was incubating 505 Kemp's
ridley turtle eggs in its effort to protect and establish an second nesting
colony for the endangered species. And 58 had already been released into
the Gulf.<p>
  The eggs came from six nests found along the Texas coast, said Donna
Shaver of the National Biological Service. After the nesting, biologists
retrieved the eggs and sent them to Padre Island National Seashore for a
48- to 50-day incubation period.<p>
  Two of the mothers found nesting along the National Seashore were
"headstart" ridleys, meaning they were released at the Seashore after being
incubated. One mother was from the 1983 year-class Shaver said, with the
other being incubated in 1986. The turtles were identified by the "living
tags" they were marked with prior to their release.<p>
  Both headstart turtles returned to the general area of their release,
Shaver said, which is the point of the program.<p>
  The primary Kemp's ridley turtle nesting area is about 150 miles south of
Brownsville, near Ranch Nuevo, Mexico. By establishing the Padre Island
National Seashore as a second nesting area, Shaver said, the hope is the
species will survive should there be a disruption near their Mexican home.<p>
  Eggs were transferred to the National Seashore for incubation and release
from 1978 until 1988. Researchers theorize that the turtles will return to
the area where they were first incubated and waded into the ocean. This
year's two headstart turtles may be proving the theory to be true.<p>
  All six turtle nests have been found by visitors to the beach. Shaver
encourages anyone seeing a turtle nesting or turtle tracks on North Padre
Island to contact her immediately at (512) 949-8173. If a nesting turtle is
found on South Padre Island, contact Don Hockaday at The University of
Texas-PanAmerican Coastal Studies Laboratory, (210) 761-2644.<p>
  Kemp's ridley turtles begin nesting in April and continue through early
August. The turtles nest between the hours of 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.<p>

<! SLUG: 07-15-95: Sargent Citizens Plant Seeds of Hope>


<center><h2>Sargent Citizens Plant Seeds of Hope</center></h2>

  The coastline at Sargent has been steadily eroding for years. Many ideas
have been proposed to stop the erosion, but nothing was actually tried as
blocks of cottages and beach houses became part of the Gulf floor.<p>
  Only when the Gulf threatened the Intracoastal Waterway, which every year
carries millions of dollars in barge traffic, did people outside of
Matagorda County begin to take notice.<p>
  The Army Corps of Engineers is building a granite revetment wall to keep
the Gulf from breaching the Intracoastal Waterway. But the Gulf will
probably take the strip of shore remaining on the outside of the wall.
 Unless Nancy Webb and the Sargent Beach Volunteer Demonstration Planting
Task Force, spearheaded by Theresa McManus, can stop it.<p>
  "Some people think this can't be done," said Webb, the Texas Marine
Advisory Service marine agent for Matagorda County. "My attitude is that we
won't know anything unless we try."<p>
  Webb has spent most of the past five years using cordgrasses to create
marshes in Galveston Bay. She will now attempt to put some of that
knowledge to work in Sargent.<p>
  Webb started her work in marsh creation while a volunteer with the
Galveston Bay Foundation. The volunteer position turned into a paid one,
allowing her to further her education. Webb put her master's degree - which
emphasized restoration, conservation and management of natural resources -
to work in a job with the USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service.
That job included leading members of the AmeriCorps Conservation Program -
President Clinton's stateside Peace Corps - in a marsh creation project in
Galveston Bay. That project has already won one national award of merit and
is up for another.<p>
  Volunteers in Sargent will harvest two native species of cordgrasses,
July 20 - marshhay cordgrass (Spartina patens) and Gulf or big cordgrass
(Spartina spartinae). Unlike smooth cordgrasses, the two species are
adapted to the clay soil found just above the high tide mark on Sargent
Beach.<p>
  Under the guidance of Webb, who first developed the concept while working
with Galveston Bay Foundation, the plants will be placed in pots and taken
home by volunteers for "nurturing."<p>
  Come October 19, volunteers will head to the beach again, this time to
plant the now mature plants along the beach, but above the high tide line.<p>
  Hopefully, the plants will spread roots and hold what is left of Sargent
Beach in place. Maybe what little sand that comes Sargent's way will be
trapped in the grasses and the seeds of a new, improved Sargent Beach will
have been sown.<p>
  Sargent is located southeast of Bay City on FM 457.<p>
  The Marine Advisory Service is a cooperative effort of the Texas A&M Sea
Grant College Program, the Texas Agricultural Extension Service and
commissioner's courts in participating counties.<p>

SLUG:   0-14-96  RIVER RUN'96 COMING SOON>

<center><h2>River Run '96 Coming Soon</h2></center>
 
  Tired of the lack of rain drying up your summer fun?<p>
  Make a run for the river.<p>
  More specifically make a run to the 1996 River Run, sponsored by the
Texas Marine Advisory Service and Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority.<p>
  The River Run is a four-day trip along the Guadalupe, from Canyon Dam to
Matagorda Island and back to Seguin, designed for high school students and
teachers of all grades. The trip emphasizes hands-on experiences and
first-hand observations of the river and the Guadalupe watershed.<p>
  "This is an opportune time to study the river and uses of water in the
watershed during a drought" said Brazoria County Marine Agent Rich Tillman,
who will lead the trip.<p>
  River Run participants will learn much about the Guadalupe River system,
including water quality, groundwater protection, wastewater treatment,
water laws and policies, wildlife and fisheries, flood control and
freshwater inflows for bays and estuaries.<p>
  The trip will be July 16-19 and costs $50 for each participant.
Participants must provide their own transportation to and from Seguin.
Students and teachers will be paired in teams and teaming of a student and
teacher from the same school is encouraged.<p>
  This will be the third year for the River Run.<p>
  Call Tillman at (409) 849-5711, ext. 1564, or Sue Brush at the
Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority, (210) 379-5822, for more information.

SLUG: 06-12-96 NEW MARINE AGENT NAMED FOR MATAGORDA COUNTY>

<center><h2>New Marine Agent Named For Matagorda County</h2></center>

<font size=+1>C<font>OLLEG STATION, TX: Nancy Webb has become the newest agent 
in the Texas Marine Advisory Service.<p>

Webb officially began work June 1 in Matagorda County, where she follows
Willie Younger, who has become the Advisory Service's marine education
specialist.<p>
  Webb, who grew up on Galveston Bay, in LaPorte, has a BA in biology from
the University of Houston-Clear Lake and a MA in Fisheries Science from
Texas A&M. Her emphasis during her masters studies was in the restoration,
conservation and management of natural resources of the Texas coast.<p>
  Before joining the Advisory Service, Webb worked with the United States
Department of Agriculture as a biologist with the Natural Resources
Conservation Service. While in that job she coordinated the planting of a
220-acre marsh in the Galveston Bay area.<p>
  Before working with the USDA, Webb worked at the Galveston Bay
Foundation, developing and coordinating conservation and education
programs, including the Galveston Bay Ambassador program and cordgrass
plantings.<p>
  She also has taught science at the junior high, high school and junior
college levels in the Galveston Bay area.<p>
  Her main focus will be helping people recognize the value and potential
of the coastal waters of Texas. "Many people don't realize what they have
in their back yard - commercial fisheries, recreational uses, the
industries the waterway supports - I want to let people know what a
valuable resource they have."<p>
  The Marine Advisory Service is a cooperative effort of the Texas A&M Sea
Grant College Program, the Texas Agricultural Extension Service and
commissioner's courts in participating counties.<p>
  Marine agents serve the coastal counties of Texas, providing information
and doing research on all marine issues - from profitable and ecological
fishing to safe recreation and from beach restoration to quality seafood
processing.<p>

<center><h2>Catfish Kill Continues on Gulf Coast</h2></center>

  For the third time in three years, something is killing saltwater catfish
in the Gulf of Mexico.<p>
  The first episode occurred in May 1994, with the kill confined to the
Sabine Pass area. While other species fish were found dead at that time,
Dave Buzan, a Kills and Spills team leader with the Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department, said the catfish made up almost all of the kill. Buzan
said he believes that the deaths of the other species of fish were
unrelated to the catfish kill.<p>
  Between October and November of 1995, catfish were dying between Sabine
Pass and Matagorda Bay in Texas. The same species were dying from October
to December in the Tampa Bay, Fla. area.<p>
  And since the first week of May, fish have been dying from San Antonio
Bay in Texas, all along the Gulf coast to Crystal River, north of Tampa
Bay. Fish are washing up on beaches in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama,
as well as Texas and Florida.<p>
  Add to that the reports earlier this year of catfish dying in Brazil and
in the Central American country of Belize.<p>
  This year's kill includes millions of fish, Buzan said. Ninety-five
percent of the dead fish are hardhead catfish, he said, with most of the
rest being gafftop catfish. There are also a few reports of blue catfish,
normally a freshwater fish, but which can tolerate some salinity, dying
near the mouth of the Lavaca River.<p>
  "Externally, they look very similar," said Dr. Jan Landsberg, a research
administrator at the Florida Marine Research Institute of the Florida
Department of Environmental Protection, about this year's catfish kill and
the 1995 incident. Fish are being found with bloody lips, bloody fins and
other signs of hemorrhaging. The fish are displaying signs of
disorientation shortly before dying, she said.<p>
  The culprit doesn't appear to be the result of pollution or any other
man-made cause. However tissue samples from last year's dead fish contained
an amoeba-like organism that isn't normally found in catfish. Research is
now ongoing on to determine if the same amoeba are being found in this
year's dead fish.<p>
  "Biologists have found amoeba in the fish during the last kill," Buzan
said. "We don't know how they are affecting the fish, other than they are
infecting and damaging internal organs."<p>
  Landsberg said that if amoeba are found in this year's dead fish, than
it's likely the two events are connected. If there are no amoeba, then the
search for the real killer will continue.<p>
  Finding amoebas in fish is uncommon, Landsberg said, and there are no
clues so far as to what is triggering this phenomenon.<p>
  Both Buzan and Landsberg are stumped as to what could be causing the fish
kill in such a widespread area. They are especially puzzled as to what
could have caused two kills, at roughly the same time, in places as far
apart as Sabine Pass and Tampa Bay.<p>
  "There's an explanation," Buzan said, "but, I don't think anybody knows
what it is."<p>
  Since the fish have no value as a commercial fish and little value as a
sport fish, most people just aren't concerned with the kill. Two stories
illustrate this point vividly.<p>
  "We had a lady who called us about a dead red drum," Buzan said. "We were
asking if she noticed anything else that seemed unusual. She thought for a
minute and said 'You mean like all those dead catfish?'"
Landsberg had a similar story about the reaction from Floridians.
"Somebody said 'When you find out what's killing them, dump some in my side
of the bay,'" she said.<p>
  Even if a few people are eating catfish, there is no health concern
associated with the kill, except for some nasty puncture wounds to the feet
of beach-goers.<p>
"Fish have lots of diseases that people don't catch when they eat them,"
Buzan said. But he also cautioned that any fish that can be caught with
bare hands is probably a sick fish and shouldn't be eaten.<p>
  Even if the catfish are the Rodney Dangerfields of the Gulf coast - they
get no respect - the search for the cause of the kill will continue.<p>
  "These fish are vital component of the ecosystem of the Gulf," Landsberg
explained.<p>

<center><h2>With Seafood Are We Safe At The Plate?</h2></center>

  Raw oysters.<p>

  Are they pelagic ambrosia or death on the halfshell?<p>

  Scary stories circulating the past few years about killer bacteria in
oysters have some seafood lovers switching to other meats despite the fact
that the bacteria causes only a dozen or so deaths per year nationwide.<p>

  The bacteria may also be one reason why consumption of all seafood has
decreased a bit in recent years. What few people realize is that seafood by
its nature is generally safe and statistics show seafood causes fewer
food-borne illnesses each year than any other kind of meat.<p>

  The Spring 1996 edition of "Texas Shores" takes a look at the history and
future of seafood safety, including an examination of the federally
mandated Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points program that will
cover all seafood importers and processors by December 1997.<p>

  "Texas Shores" finds out what people in the seafood industry think about
the new rules and how those rules might affect the financially strapped
seafood industry here.<p>

  "Texas Shores" also looks at current seafood safety programs at both the
state and federal levels, how those programs will change and what it means
to your pocketbooks.<p>

  "Texas Shores" is must reading for people who make seafood their
livelihood or just a lively meal.<p>

  "Texas Shores" is published quarterly by the Sea Grant College Program at
Texas A&M University in an effort to promote a better understanding of the
Texas marine environment. Subscriptions to "Texas Shores" are free to Texas
residents and cost $7.50 annually for subscribers outside the state.<p>

<center><h2>Younger Named Marine Education Specialist</h2></center>

Matagorda County's short-term loss should be the long-term gain for the
entire state of Texas.<p>

On May 1 Willie Younger ceased to be the marine agent for Matagorda
County and became the marine education specialist for the Texas Marine Advisory 
Service. As education specialist, Younger will be based at the Texas State 
Marine Education Center, located on Matagorda Bay, in Palacios.<p>

The center, which already is a collaboration between Matagorda County
Navigation District No. 1, Wharton County Junior College, Texas State Technical 
College (TSTC)  and the Palacios Independent School District, now adds the 
resources of The Texas A&M University System, through Texas Sea Grant, the 
Marine Advisory Service and the Texas Agricultural Extension Service.<p>

"Our involvement is to add the resources of Texas A&M," said Mike
Hightower, deputy director of Texas Sea Grant. "The Marine Education Center will
become the focal point for our marine education efforts. As marine education 
curricula develops at the center, we will be able to transmit that information 
statewide."<p>

Sea Grant has always been involved with marine education, but in recent
years it has not had a specialist to provide a focus and coordination for 
educational programs, Hightower said. While other marine education programs and 
activities will continue elsewhere, Hightower said, the center will act as a 
focal point, directing education programs throughout the state.<p>

"I want to emphasize that our efforts through Willie will compliment and
enhance current programs at the center and will not compete or conflict with 
ongoing programming," he said.  "This joint venture in marine education would 
not have been possible if not for the vision and cooperation of the 
commissioners of the Navigation District," Hightower said.<p>

The Marine Education Center was originally a joint project of the
navigation district and the Palacios school system. The navigation district 
owned bay-front property that was part of  the former Camp Hulen, a National 
Guard Training base, and the school district wanted to start a marine education 
program for the school children of Palacios and the surrounding area, as well as
for occasional groups from around Texas and even outside the state. As time 
passed, Wharton County Junior College and TSTC joined the mix, offering classes 
in aquaculture, occupational health and safety and diesel mechanics, as well as 
core curriculum classes such as English and government.<p>

Younger's "academic home" will be in Texas A&M's Department of Agricultural 
Education, where Dr. Glen Shinn is department head.  "Ag education is about the 
improvement of human performance through education and training," Shinn said, 
explaining how marine education fits in the Agricultural Education Department. 
"While focusing on the agricultural disciplines, we have a broader definition 
than Webster. When we say 'agriculture,' we mean all food and environmental 
systems."<p>

Shinn said his department, which will help Younger in educational planning and 
assessment, is eager to work with Younger. "This is an important education 
activity," he said. "We are pleased he will be part of our department. I think 
this will be beneficial to our department and to Willie Younger."<p>

Also pleased with the new arrangement is Dr. Chester Fehlis, executive associate
director of the Texas Agricultural Extension Service. "This appointment 
reinforces the Texas Agricultural Extension Service's commitment to education," 
Fehlis said. "It allows for an emphasis on marine education that we have not 
been able to adequately support without a specialist in this area."<p>

His agency is excited at the prospects for this collaboration between Sea
Grant and the Extension Service. "This will affect people throughout the state, 
not just in coastal areas," he said.<p>

With the involvement of A&M, the Palacios center, which the Texas Legislature 
designated as the Texas State Marine Education Center in 1995, will broaden its 
scope. "What we want to do is provide hands-on, field-related marine education,"
said Younger, "and to extend that programming throughout the state."<p>

Younger sees the marine education center as the "centerpiece" of marine
education in Texas. "There are three and a half million school children in 
Texas," he said. "They're hard to reach, but we can reach the educators, who 
instill knowledge, decision-making skills and values in these young people."
Younger will be developing programs that will enable students in areas of
the state far removed from the Gulf to learn about the marine environment, 
without having to be on the Gulf.<p>

Younger estimates that the marine center can educate up to 20,000 students each 
year without degrading the campus' coastal environment, which serves as a 
natural classroom and field laboratory. Students in this context means children 
in grades K-12, teachers, 4-H leaders, other youth group leaders or people just 
wanting to learn about marine life. <p>

While that many people will definitely have an impact on the economy of 
Palacios, Matagorda County Navigation District No. 1 Chairman Thomas Holsworth, 
sees that as secondary. "There are automatic economic benefits to be gained from
education programs conducted at the center, but that's not our concern," 
Holsworth said. "That's a welcomed downstream byproduct for the area, but what 
we really want to do is educate the people of Texas about what's going on along 
the coast. "There are people who live on the coast who don't know what's going 
on in the bays and the Gulf," he said. "There are people making a living from 
the Gulf who don't know what's going on. They also need to be schooled on what's
happening to their livelihood."<p>

Because of these gains, the partnership between Sea Grant, the Extension
Service and the Navigation District has also been eagerly embraced by the City 
of Palacios, Matagorda County and the Matagorda County Economic Development 
Corp., as a way to enhance and strengthen the economic, environmental and 
educational assets of the area. Each entity contributed their support to see 
that the State Marine Education Center came about.<p>

"Sea Grant is dedicated to the conservation and wise utilization of marine 
resources," said Robert R. Stickney, director of the Texas Sea Grant program. 
"Educating the public at all levels, from pre-school through senior citizens, 
about the marine environment and how we can utilize and manage it in ways that 
will ensure the long-term health and beauty, is one of the most important things
that Sea Grant does.<p>

"I am delighted that Sea Grant is becoming a partner at the Marine Education 
Center," Stickney continued. "We can certainly expect to touch the lives of 
resident Texans and visitors to our state as our program develops. This one is a
winner for all concerned."<p>

Sea Grant assists state and local governments, industry and the public in
the intelligent use of the marine and coastal environment and its resources 
through a program of problem-oriented basic research, marine education, marine 
advisory services and information outreach.<p>

The Marine Advisory Service is a cooperative effort of Sea Grant, the
Texas Agricultural Extension Service and participating county commissioners 
courts.<p>

<center><h2>Tillman to Helm as Brazoria Marine Agent</h2></center>

   Richard E. (Rich) Tillman becomes the Texas Marine Advisory Service's
marine agent for Brazoria County on May 1 (1996), following confirmation by 
Commissioner's Court on Monday.<p>
   Tillman, who has been the marine agent for Aransas and San Patricio
counties since February 1983, replaces Charles Moss, who retired in 
January.<p>
   The Marine Advisory Service is a cooperative effort of the Texas A&M Sea
Grant College Program, the Texas Agricultural Extension Service and 
commissioner's courts in participating counties.<p>
   Tillman holds bachelor's and master's degrees from Texas A&M in food
technology. He served in the U.S. Army from 1972 to 79, retiring from 
active duty as a captain and a company commander. He remains in the U.S. 
Army Reserve at the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.<p>
   After completing his master's at Texas A&M in 1980, Tillman worked with
the Texas Agricultural Extension Service as a seafood technician until his 
appointment as marine agent in Aransas and San Patricio counties.
The appointment is a return home for Tillman's wife, Cookie, the daughter 
of the late shrimp boat Captain Jimmy McMurrey, who grew up in West 
Columbia.<p>
   "We had an excellent experience with Mr. Moss," said Brazoria County
Judge John Willy. "We were concerned that we keep that sort of valuable 
assistance. With the experience and credentials Mr. Tillman brings, we feel 
we will still have the top marine extension service on the coast."<p>
   Brazoria County is looking for someone to provide advice on marine
issues, he said, including shrimp and fishing fleets and bays and 
estuaries.<p>
   "We need someone with familiarity on these subjects to bring the
different interests together, for the best interest of Brazoria County," 
Judge Willy said.<p>
   Moss called Tillman "an excellent choice."<p>
   "I didn't have anything to do with it, but I certainly would have
recommended Rich," said Moss, who retired Jan. 31 of this year.<p>
   Moss predicted that Tillman would enjoy Brazoria County, where he would
be met with "the highest caliber folks. They're really first-class 
volunteers."<p>
   Tillman said that taking the job in Brazoria County meant filling Moss's
large shoes.<p>
   "I hope to continue some of (Moss's) fine programs and start a few of my
own," Tillman said, "such as the River Run and water resource education on 
the Brazos River."<p>
   Tillman said he was leaving with mixed emotions. He has lived in Aransas
Pass longer than any other location in his life and started his family, 
with wife Cooky and children Jeannie and Jimmy, while there.<p>
   "This is a great opportunity," he said, "but I'm leaving some close friends."
Marine agents serve the coastal counties of Texas, providing information 
and doing research on all marine issues - from profitable and ecological 
fishing to safe recreation and from beach restoration to quality seafood 
processing.<p>
   Sea Grant assists state and local governments, industry and the public
in the intelligent use of the marine and coastal environment and its

<center><h2>New Netting Saves Feul, Increases Shrimp Catch</h2></center>

        Shrimp boats trawling the Gulf of Mexico consume more fuel than any 
other commercial fishing vessels in the United States, a fact that the Texas 
Governor's Energy Office (GEO) and the shrimp industry are doing something 
about.<p>
        Annual fuel consumption in the Gulf is at least 60,000 gallons per 
vessel.  An estimated 4,000 vessels use a combined total of about 240 million 
gallons of diesel fuel each year.<p>
        But getting to the shrimp isn't what costs- it's trying to catch them.  
More than 70 percent of the diesel fuel pumped into shrimp boats is used 
dragging nets along the sea floor.  About 80 percent of the overall pull on the 
winching gear is distributed on the nets, making weight and strength two major 
factors in shrimp-net design.<p>

<h3>Challenge Issued</h3>
        In 1989, the Texas GEO issued a request for proposals to demonstrate 
energy efficiency technologies.  The Texas A&M Sea Grant Program responded and 
received a grant of $69,155 in July 1990 to demonstrate the use of 
lighter-weight, less water-resistant nets that could be towed through the water 
with less drag while providing greater horizontal spread to increase the catch.
<p>
        Another $64,840 was contributed by the university and local industry 
sources.  The Marine Advisory Service (MAS), a cooperative effort of Texas Sea 
Grant, the Texas Agriculture Extension Service and participating county 
commissioners courts, donated the labor and expertise of fisheries specialists 
and marine economists.<p>
        The project's aim was to determine if smaller-sized high-tech fibers the
same strength as nylon could be used effectively in trawl nets.  Four types of 
fibers were used for the study- two sizes of SPECTRA fibers and two sizes of 
KEVLAR fibers.  Trawls constructed from these materials were compared to 
identical nets made of traditional nylon.  Webbing specifications were 
established with assistance from the National Marine 
Fisheries Service (NMFS).<p>
         Initial engineering tests were conducted aboard a research vessel to 
determine efficiency parameters such as reduced drag, engine speed and trawl 
configurations.  Once this phase was completed, the high-tech nets were put to 
use aboard fishing boats at sea.<p>
        KEVLAR fibers proved to be unsatisfactory during commercial sea trials,
but nets made of SPECTRA achieved fuel savings of 10 to 20 percent per vessel 
primarily because of reduced drag on the boats' engines.  The five to 14 percent
drag reduction also allowed the nets to fan out, which increased productivity by
an average of 16 percent.<p>

<h3>Industry Embraces Findings</h3>
        "Because this new technology was demonstrated directly to the industry, 
its acceptance was much quicker than it would have been had the demonstrations 
been strictly academic," according to Marvin Barr, industrial program manager 
for the State Energy Conservation Office (formerly GEO).<p>
        "Before the project was even completed, 10 Texas shrimp vessels had 
already converted to the new nets.  The fuel savings and the increase in catch -
boosting each vessel's annual income by about $32,000- makes for a payback 
period of 15 to 27 days' fishing time, depending on the size of SPECTRA used."
<p>
        Barr estimated that if only half the vessels operating in the Gulf of 
Mexico shrimp fishery used the high-tech nets, diesel fuel consumption would be 
cut by 12 million to 24 million gallons annually.<p>
        The successful project gained national recognition by earning the 1992 
Innovative Energy Award from the U.S. Department of Energy.  In 1993, Sea Grant 
MAS Specialists Gary Graham and Dewayne Hollin were honored with Energy 
Efficiency Commendations from Texas Governor Ann Richards.<p>
        Graham, a marine fisheries specialist, described the use of SPECTRA, an
ultra-high molecular-weight polyethylene fiber, as the most significant 
development in trawl technology since the 1950s, when nylon nets replaced 
cotton.  Not only do SPECTRA nets save fuel and wear on engines, they increase 
catch and offer longer fishing days.<p>
        SPECTRA-made nets have been used on a limited basis by North Pacific 
fishing vessels since 1985, but this is the first time the new technology has 
been applied in the Gulf of Mexico.<p>
        Although the high-tech fibers cost approximately 10 times more per pound
than nylon netting, the price-tag shock is absorbed by getting two to three 
times more material in a pound of SPECTRA.<p>

<H3>Salmon Aquaculture</H3>



<H1>Selective Breeding Triples Salmon Growth </H1>

</CENTER>

The development of good farm stock traditionally has been a lengthy, hit-or-miss process. The chickens in your freezer, for example, are the product of nearly 3,000 years of domestication.  

<P>

With the help of the Washington Sea Grant Program, salmon farmers hope to duplicate the same process -- transforming a wild animal to a tamed food source -- in just a few decades. Through selective breeding, Sea Grant researchers and private aquaculturists have been able to triple the growth rates of native coho salmon.  

<P>

This new coho breed now helps support a domestic industry worth at least $5 million at the wholesale level. The breeding blue-print itself may serve as a model for marine aquaculture worldwide.

<P>

Research began in 1977 as a collaborative effort between Sea Grant researchers at the University of Washington and Domsea Farms, Inc., of Manchester, Wash. Domsea supplied fish, manpower and rearing facilities; Sea Grant provided the breeding expertise (research personnel headed by William Hershberger of the UW School of Fisheries) and a crucial intangible: commitment.  Hershberger received 10 years of Sea Grant funding, enough to cover five breeding cycles. 

<P>

Domsea wanted to develop its own stock because the supply and quality of eggs available from hatcheries varied greatly according to the size of wild returns.  For example, eggs from a particular river might be abundant one year but impossible to purchase the next. In addition, wild stocks often fare poorly in captivity.

<P>

<H2>Primary Supplier</H2>



Sea Grant's primary goal was to create and maintain domesticated broodstock capable of rapid growth and good survival in intensive culture conditions.  Toward this end, researchers tracked and bred as many as 120 coho families to develop two primary coho lines. 

<P>

Results from the 10-year program exceeded expectations. A 1977-78 vintage yearling weighed no more than 300 grams (0.6 lb.); in 1990, yearlings tipped the scale at anywhere from 650 to 900 grams (or 1.45 to 2 lb.) -- an increase of 116 to 200 percent. 

<P>

The weight of mature, two-year-olds increased just as dramatically, from an average of about 850 grams (1.9 lb.) to a whopping 3,000 grams (6.7 lb.) -- a 250 percent rise.

<P>

Domsea, now called Domsea Broodstock, Inc., has sold 5 million to 8 million domesticated coho eggs annually to aquaculturists in Japan, Chile, Europe and the United States. The Washington-based company is the primary egg supplier for domestic coho farmers, who in 1993 produced about 2 million pounds of fish (worth $2 to $3 per pound wholesale.)  

<P>

The Sea Grant/Domsea stock development program has produced much more than a new breed of fish. Internationally, it is a prototype for marine breeding; locally, it serves as a model for the future of the West Coast aquaculture industry.  

<P>

Given strict shoreline and environmental regulations, aquaculturists in the Pacific Northwest find it difficult to compete with large salmon farms in Canada, South America and Europe.  However, it is possible to develop high-tech brood stock in a relatively small facility. 

<P>

"That's where we feel we can compete," says Per Heggelund of Domsea. According to Heggelund, the program proves that Washington aquaculturists can use "standard breeding techniques on aquatic species and turn them into domesticated, genetically superior livestock."

<H3>Ecosystem Restoration</H3>



<H1>Green Bay Study Offers National Model</H1>

</CENTER>

The Green Bay PCB Mass Balance Study is the first complete input-output study ever conducted on what happens to a toxic chemical in an aquatic ecosystem. Completed in 1993, this landmark national study gives resource managers a much-needed model for assessing the sources, movements and ultimate fate of toxic industrial and agricultural chemicals in U.S. waters.

<P>

Though focused specifically on PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) in Green Bay, Lake Michigan, this model will help decision makers identify the most cost-effective strategies for also cleaning up lead, dieldrin, cadmium and similar toxic chemicals in Great Lakes and coastal estuaries. Most important, the study validated mass balance modeling as an accurate and useful tool for that purpose.

<P>

Funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), this five-year, $12 million study would not have been possible if not for the encyclopedic information base on the bay, the extensive knowledge about PCBs in the Great Lakes, and the scientific expertise on both topics developed largely through Wisconsin Sea Grant-sponsored research over the past 25 years.

<P>

<H2>Essential Information</H2>



Covering 1,640 square miles, Green Bay is the largest freshwater estuary in the world. In size and characteristics, it is similar to the Delaware Bay estuary. Like bays and estuaries everywhere, Green Bay's water quality and fisheries declined with intensive agricultural, industrial and urban development of its watershed. 

<P>

Its main tributary, the Fox River, is one of the most heavily industrialized rivers in the United States. By the late 1960s, the severe pollution of Fox River-Green Bay estuary was a major concern, but very little scientific knowledge and few resources were available to address the problem.

<P>

The National Sea Grant College Program came along at a key time. Among the first Sea Grant research programs on the Great Lakes was a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary study of Green Bay launched in 1968 by the University of Wisconsin Sea Grant Program. 

<P>

Its primary goal was to provide objective scientific information on the basic physical, chemical, biological and socioeconomic causes of the bay's problems so that policy makers and the public could make accurate, informed decisions on solving those problems.

<P>

With the discovery of DDT and PCBs in Great Lakes fish in the late 1960s, Wisconsin Sea Grant in the early 1970s launched its hall-mark Water Quality & Microcontaminants research program. Focused on the questions of the sources, persistence and effects of nutrients and toxic contaminants in the lakes, this work has been critical to the development of analytical methods, data and expertise on the sources and behavior of PCBs in Great Lakes water, sediments and fish, and their health effects on people who eat these fish. 

<P>

In the late 1980s, growing national concern about PCBs and other persistent toxic chemicals in the environment led the U.S. EPA to propose one of the largest contaminant studies ever attempted. The goal of the study was to create a detailed model of the fate of PCBs in aquatic ecosystems. The question of where to attempt this study was paramount: The analytical burden would be enormous, and choice of site was critically important.

<P>

<H2>Over $480 Million Saved</H2>



The EPA chose Green Bay as the site for this unprecedented national study for several reasons -- but the deciding factor was the wealth of available expertise and scientific data created by Wisconsin Sea Grant. Launched in 1988, the Green Bay Mass Balance Study ultimately involved researchers from a dozen universities nationwide, six federal agencies, and the Wisconsin and Michigan departments of natural resources. Wisconsin Sea Grant scientists and former Sea Grant-supported students were among the study's lead investigators.

<P>

The results are still being compiled by the EPA, but the study established beyond doubt that most of the PCBs entering Green Bay today come from contaminated Fox River sediments. 

<P>

Of the eight management scenarios examined, the study showed that -- except for cleaning up one highly contaminated stretch of the river at Little Lake Butte des Morts -- the most effective strategy for eliminating PCBs from Green Bay over the next 25 years was simply to let them become buried in bottom sediments.

<P>

The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources estimates that cleaning up just that one stretch of the Fox River will cost $4 million to $17 million. Previous plans to remove all PCB-contaminated sediments from the river, by comparison, were projected to cost more than $500 million and, worse, may have retarded the bay's recovery, according to the study.

<P>

Thanks in large part to the long-term Sea Grant investment in PCB and Green Bay research, Wisconsin will save hundreds of millions of dollars cleaning up the bay -- and the nation has a highly successful model for developing rational and cost-effective strategies for cleaning up its contaminated estuaries and bays, which ultimately may save the United States billions of dollars and permit sustained development of these valuable coastal areas as well.

<H3>Environmental Quality</H3>



<H1>Pollution Permit Trading Buys<BR>

Better Environment</H1>

</CENTER>

This fall, when the state attempts to clean up southeastern Wisconsin's air, some of the smoggiest in the nation, Milwaukee industries will have a new incentive to buy and sell air pollution permits. 

<P>

At present, industries emitting more smog-causing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) than their permits allow can buy other industries' surplus allowances. Changes in the Milwaukee VOC market, mandated by the state, will require buyers to purchase 1.3 times more emissions credits than they will use. 

<P>

"Because of this new requirement, the more trading that goes on in Milwaukee, the cleaner the air should get," said UW-Madison civil and environmental engineer Erhard Joeres. "The Milwaukee VOCs market should drive innovation in pollution control technology because sellers can reinvest profits in pollution reduction, which should free up permits." 

<P>

This "new" concept of using market forces to clean up the  environment has its roots in a 1982 Wisconsin Sea Grant-supported national conference, "Regulatory Reform, Transferable Permits and Enhancement of Environmental Quality," involving more than 40 university economists and engi neers, industry officials, environmentalists, and state and federal government  regulators.

<P>

The conference proceedings, Buying a Better Environment: Cost-Effective Regulation through Permit Trading, jointly published by Wisconsin Sea Grant and the Journal of Land Economics in 1983, was the first comprehensive book on the concept of using market forces to control and reduce pollution of the nation's air and water. 

<P>

<H2>Environment As Property</H2>



Sea Grant was instrumental in getting national approval for market-based pollution control. An innovative multidisciplinary study led by Joeres and UW-Madison economist Martin David in the late 1970s pioneered how economic markets could control air and water pollution. Joeres and David proposed that once the capacity of the environment to assimilate wastes was recognized and legally defined, it "naturally becomes a property right, and consequently social welfare can best be achieved through creating markets in these rights."

<P>

This Sea Grant study helped set up a pilot "transferable discharge permit" (TDP) market for Wisconsin's Lower Fox River, one of the most heavily industrialized and once one of the most polluted rivers in the nation. The project's endorsement by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources helped push the incorporation of pollution permit trading into national legislation. 

<P>

Since the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act, utilities and firms nationwide have been able to trade in air pollution emissions under the rationale that creating emissions markets will spur pollution reduction technology.

<P>

In 1992, Wisconsin Power & Light Co. in Madison became the nation's first utility to market emissions allowances, selling 10,000 tons of acid rain-causing sulfur dioxide (SO2) credits to the Tennessee Valley Authority and between 15,000 and 25,000 tons to the Duquesne Power & Light Co. of Pittsburgh. Since then, other utilities in Wisconsin, New York, Indiana and Ohio also have experimented with trading air emissions permits. In 1994, smog-choked Los Angeles adopted its Regional Clean Air Incentives Market ("Reclaim"), under which L.A. firms can buy or sell emissions rights for VOCs and nitrogen oxide.

<P>



<H2>Buy a Better Environment</H2>



Critics say that clean air and water are not commodities to be sold like pork futures. But others see the ability to buy and trade emissions as an opportunity to fight pollution and, in some cases, benefit worthy causes. 

<P>

Two such trades have occurred in Wisconsin. In early 1994, a group of UW-Madison Energy Analysis and Policy Program students purchased and retired 10 tons SO2 credits at $225 a ton from the Wisconsin Electric Power Co. In another industry-to-consumer trade, Wissconsin Public Service Commission employees, acting on their own, purchased two tons worth of SO2 credits from Wisconsin Power & Light Co.

<P>

And in yet another trading twist, a Connecticut utility recently retired 7 percent of its SO2  allowances by donating them to the American Lung Association and taking a tax deduction.

<P>

Pollution markets can succeed where traditional controls fail. Laws that force polluters to reduce emissions to certain levels give industry no incentive to do any more than what's required. 

<P>

"Markets in pollutions emissions link pollution control to the maintenance of an active and healthy business climate," Joeres said. "The seed that Sea Grant planted has kept us in the forefront of innovative pollution control technology and has contributed to the improvement of our environment and our economy."

<H3>Fish Bioenergetics</H3>



<H1>New Model Advances Scientific Management</H1>

</CENTER>

Until the late 1970s, researchers studying fish physiology had to rely on difficult and labor-intensive empirical strategies like examining the stomach contents and observing the feeding habits of fish. However, direct measurements of fish energy consumption often were impossible to gather in the field.

<P>

With Sea Grant support, University of Wisconsin-Madison researcher James Kitchell and his students sought to simplify such research by building a computer model of fish bioenergetics. Bioenergetics is the science of how organisms collect and spend energy.

<P>

Their computerized fish bioenergetics model used more easily gathered laboratory information and field data. The model provided researchers with a powerful new tool to help assess important basic data about growth rates, food consumption and other vital processes of fish.

<P>

Today, the success of the Wisconsin Sea Grant model of fish bioenergetics is evident in the fact that researchers and fisheries managers throughout the nation and abroad now use the model as a research and management tool.

<P>

The UW Sea Grant Communications Office produced and widely marketed the model, and Wisconsin Sea Grant Advisory Services agents have trained U.S., Canadian and European fisheries managers to use the model.

<P>

"The fact that many organizations around the country are willing to spend money and sponsor workshops on this model to educate their employees indicates its success," said Wisconsin Sea Grant Advisory Services field agent Clifford Kraft, who has conducted workshops around the United States on the bioenergetics model. "We've even got people on the West Coast using this approach to study Pacific salmon."

<P>

<H2>Proven on Lake Michigan</H2>



In 1981, the original model successfully was applied to help sustain Lake Michigan's forage fish base, which supports a billion-dollar salmon and trout sport fishery. 

<P>

The model predicted that forage fish populations, particularly the exotic alewife, would decline if fishery managers continued to increase salmonid stocking rates. The model's prediction proved correct -- by 1985, Lake Michigan's once over-abundant alewife population had declined an alarming 86 percent. Thus forewarned, fishery managers were able to reduce stocking pressure in time to avoid a complete collapse of this valuable world-class fishery. 

<P>

As a result, the Great Lakes Sea Grant Network and state and federal fisheries managers developed a coordinated two-year regional study of the diets of predator fish, which provided the first simultaneously collected database for predator-prey systems in each of the Great Lakes. 

<P>

Since then, the state, federal and provincial fishery agencies responsible for stocking policy in Lakes Michigan, Ontario and Superior have employed bioenergetics models to help guide management policy.

<P>

<H2>Diverse Applications</H2>



The model's applicability has since grown beyond the Great Lakes salmonid fishery. Fish bioenergetics can be used to estimate growth and food consumption for many cold-, cool- and warm-water fish species. It can be applied to stream, river, lake or marine environments to address a broad range of environmental variables that affect fish growth and food consumption.

<P>

The model helps fisheries managers and fish farmers make important decisions about stocking and harvesting rates based on estimates of predator demand on prey fish populations, the rate at which prey fish are consumed, and prey consumption patterns over time. Fish biologists use the models to evaluate the effects of different environmental factors or prey abundances on individual fish growth rates and to calculate total production by whole populations of fish. Even educators are using the models to teach students about the factors that affect fish survival and to experiment with fish growth and food consumption outcomes under various environmental or physiological conditions.

<P>

The current fish bioenergetics model, upgraded in 1992, includes parameters for dozens of species of fish and several species of invertebrates. One of the more important new applications of the model is a Sea Grant-supported project to use bioenergetics to predict the population growth patterns of the zebra mussel, a rapidly spreading freshwater mollusc best known for its abiltiy to clog municipal and industrial water intakes. Other Sea Grant researchers are working on new versions of the bioenergetic models that may help managers reduce the toxic contaminants in Great Lakes fishes.

<P>

<H2>Award-Winning Research</H2>



Papers based on Sea Grant-supported fish bioenergetics modeling by Kitchell and his students have received awards for "Most Significant Contribution" to the Journal of the American Fisheries Society. Analyses produced by the model -- now widely termed "the Wisconsin model" -- have won similar awards from the American Institute of Fishery Research Biology and from the American Fisheries Society.

<P>

Kitchell's former students are now applying their knowledge in positions with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, while Kitchell explores new uses for fish bioenergetics modeling with the next generation of students.

Since 1987, Wisconsin Sea Grant has helped sponsor more than 30 workshops on the fish bioenergetics model for fishery scientists from state and federal agencies, universities, utility companies and private consulting firms. More than 350 scientists have been trained at these workshops, and to date Wisconsin Sea Grant has distributed nearly 1,000 copies of the software and manual, which are also available through the National Sea Grant Depository.
