<A NAME=14>Grading of Quality Assurance Requirements: A
Manual</A>
<BR>
<I>Technical Reports Series No. 328</I>
</B>
<P>
The items and services of a nuclear power plant differ in their
relative importance to safety, reliability and the economics of
plant performance. The corresponding quality assurance programme
must ensure that the significant items and services have more
stringent control and verification measures. The present manual
provides guidance and illustrative examples for applying a method
by which graded quality assurance requirements may be determined
and adapted to the items and services of a nuclear power plant in
conformance with the requirements of the IAEA Nuclear Safety
Standards (NUSS) Code and Safety Guides. The manual replaces the
previous publication IAEA-TECDOC-303 on the same subject.
<P>

This manual was developed to serve as guidance on non-conformance
and corrective actions which have been identified as the major
problems in the implementation of an effective quality assurance
programme. The scope of this manual, while fully addressing the
requirements in the governing NUSS programme documents, also
covers corrective action processes which would more generally
assist users in developing good practices for improved
performance in all areas of safety, reliability and economics,
and it offers a practical model and illustrative examples of the
means by which effective measures and actions can be implemented.
<P>

May 1991. The objective of the symposium was to provide a
comprehensive assessment of the environmental and health factors
as well as the economic factors involved in supplying electricity
services, and to suggest a framework within which these issues
should be taken into account in making future plans and decisions
on electricity production and use. The potential role of
different ways of meeting electricity service requirements was
also analysed, taking into consideration both demand side and
supply options in the light of their comparative economic,
environmental and health related impacts.

Risks and Benefits of Energy Systems
<BR>
<I>Proceedings Series</I>
</B>
<P>
Proceedings of a symposium organized in co-operation with UNEP
and WHO, J&uuml;lich, Germany, 9-13 April 1984. The role of
energy in the economy and in society, the risks and impacts of
energy production, cost-effective measures to reduce risks and
national energy strategies in response to global constraints were
discussed. Decisions on energy systems have to be based on an
assessment of many different aspects regarding their risks and
benefits. Many case studies were presented and it was shown that
it is of the utmost importance to list all the assumptions made
and to discuss the uncertainties and limitations of the analysis.
Comparison of risks of energy systems lead to a definite rank
ordering per unit of energy produced, but risks are only one
aspect in defining an appropriate energy mix. In order to allow
for efficient risk management it is important to apply
cost-effectiveness techniques to various options for reducing
risks.

environmentally benign technologies. The safe and reliable
operation of existing nuclear power plants, the demonstration of
convincing solutions to the storage and disposal of radioactive
waste, a predictable licensing process and supportive government
policies are essential prerequisites to achieving a wider public
acceptance of nuclear power, which presently is the most
important factor deciding its future application.

Nuclear Power Project Management: A Guidebook
<BR>
<I>Technical Reports Series No. 279</I>

<P> 
This guidebook provides specific advice and guidance to project
management for the construction of nuclear power plants. While
operating performance of nuclear power plants has been improving
in
recent years and has generally been comparable to or better than
that of fossil fired plants in the same size ranges, performance
during construction has been variable. Although additional
licensing requirements, public intervention and funding problems
have been blamed for most of the delays and cost increases, there
is growing recognition that lack of proper project management has
been a major factor.

result of: (a) the setting of more ambitious plant targets
providing greater margins in accident situations; (b) access to
predictive operating data, indicative of the future performance
of
plants; and (c) the careful assessment, or review, of past
operating experience to promptly correct the root causes of any
adverse trends. The purpose of the symposium was to provide a

</B>
<P>
Proceedings of a symposium jointly organized with OECD/NEA,
Munich,
Germany, 9-13 July 1990. The purpose was to review developments
and
to discuss directions for future efforts. One important aspect of
nuclear safety in recent years has been the very high rate of
development and subsequent introduction of computer technology.
The
data acquired by computer systems have to be presented to the
operator in a structured form with prioritization capabilities.
Further developments of operator support systems may considerably
influence the interface between human control and automation. To
deal with fast transients, automation and real time simulation
have
to be used. For other abnormal and accident situations, human
flexibility may be preferred. Full use must be made of all plant
resources, with system state and success path monitoring being of
special interest in accident situations. The symposium discussed
all aspects of balancing problems, operating, maintenance and
testing, including all levels from information processing to full
automation.

Proceedings of a meeting held in Vienna, 26-29 September 1983.
Advances and refinements continue to be made in the technology of
uranium extraction. These seek to improve uranium recovery, to
reduce costs, to produce uranium concentrates of higher quality
and to improve the nature of the tailings for their long term
disposal. At the same time, effort is being directed to improving
the economics of the recovery of uranium from phosphoric acid,
which currently is only marginally competitive, and to develop
processes for the recovery of uranium from non-conventional
resources such as coal and natural waters, including seawater.

In 1979, the IAEA and OECD/NEA jointly issued a questionnaire
dealing with all aspects of water pool storage. This report
summarizes the information received from storage pool operators.
Forecasts predict that by the year 2000 more than 150 000 tonnes
of
heavy metal from spent LWR fuel will have been accumulated.
Although very positive experience with wet storage has been
gained
over the past 40 years, making wet storage a proven technology,
it
appears desirable to summarize all available data for the benefit
of designers, storage pool operators, licensing agencies and the
general public. Such data will be essential for assessing the

<P>
For high level and alpha bearing radioactive wastes, the disposal
concept most generally agreed upon is the emplacement of the
conditioned waste in deep underground respositories in stable
geological formations. The report reflects the general consensus
that long lived radioactive wastes can be isolated safely from
man's environment in such repositories located in deep,
geological formations. One of the most important tasks in the
development of underground disposal systems is the plugging of
boreholes and the sealing of shafts excavated for either
exploratory or operational purposes. Several countries have
outlined proposals and identified geological formations for
detailed examination as potential host media for waste
repositories.

Treatment of Low and Intermediate Level Solid Radioactive Wastes 

<BR>
<I>Technical Reports Series No. 223</I>
</B></A>
<P>
The question of the treatment of low and intermediate level
wastes has assumed particular importance, mainly because of the
increase of management costs, especially those connected with
transport, storage and disposal, and also because of the
tightening of regulatory requirements. Thus, volume reduction,
which can improve both the economics of management and the
environmental characteristics of waste, has become one of the key
issues, in particular for low and intermediate level wastes from
nuclear power plants. Consequently, advanced or high efficiency
volume reduction techniques are undergoing rapid development.
Also, more research is being directed towards waste management
planning, plant design and operation, and the integration of
individual methods into appropriate waste management systems.

The purpose of this series of annually published journals is to
publish original contributions and review articles containing
high quality data on the atomic and plasma-material interaction
processes of interest to thermonuclear fusion research. The
scientific scope of the journals includes the topics of
elementary atomic collision processes in fusion plasmas,
involving photons, electrons, ions, atoms and molecules, the
collision processes of plasma particles with surfaces of fusion
relevant materials, and thermophysical material response
phenomena related to the plasma-material interactions. The review
articles provide comprehensive critical analyses and sets of
recommended data for a broader class of interaction processes or
thermophysical response phenomena. The series represents a medium
for direct exchange of expert assessed or generated atomic and

development of a controlled thermonuclear fusion reactor on a
toxaemic basis. During Phase Two A, Part II, the representatives
from Euratom, Japan, the USA and the USSR held five sessions in
Vienna in 1984 and 1985. Phase Two A, Part II solved certain
critical issues essential to the feasibility and improvement of
the INTOR concept, and the physics and engineering data bases
have also been re-evaluated. On the basis of new information from
critical issues studies and data base assessment and as a result
of additional design scoping studies carried out by the
participants,                
the INTOR design concept was slightly modified; it is, in part,  

             
based on extrapolations of the available data which could be
substantiated by the current generation of large tokamaks before
the

This cumulative index should serve as a tool to rapidly retrieve
Nuclear Fusion articles that deal with specific topics in fusion
research and covers the first 31 years (1960-1990) of the
journal. The chronological index lists titles and authors of all
published Nuclear Fusion articles in order of publication. The
subject index groups the articles under broad categories (such
as Heating, or Confinement and Transport) which are subdivided
into more specific categories (ICH, Transport phenomena, etc.).
A further subdivision distinguishes between type of experiment
(toxaemic, mirror, etc.) and character of the article
(experimental, theoretical, etc.). The author index is a complete
list of all authors in alphabetical order, with reference to
volume and page number.

findings in Iraq by the Action Team established under United
Nations Security Council resolutions, South Africa's decision to
join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons
(NPT), details of the IAEA-Argentina-Brazil-ABACC Quadripartite
Safeguards Agreement, and measures following the break-up of
the former USSR into newly independent States. Special
emphasis was given to the verification of a State's declaration
as well as detection of undeclared activities. In addition to
covering recent developments, the symposium considered
fundamental changes stemming from converging relationships
between nuclear arms reductions and the civil use of plutonium,
unattended computer based verification systems and other
safeguards concepts for the future, and the review and extension
of the NPT in 1995.

Measurement methods are described in terms of operating
experience with working equipment. There is a discussion on
verification with the emphasis on working verification equipment
or on authentication of newly developed and highly automated
non-destructive analysis equipment. Near-real-time material
accountancy is reviewed. Matters relating to material accountancy
rather than containment and surveillance are given prominence.
Topics such as quantitative destructive or non-destructive
measurement methods, the statistics of MUF analysis, and
safeguards approaches based on material accountancy are
emphasized.

The first publication covering this subject was published in 1970
(Legal Series No. 7 -- the basic book), written by Mr. Paul C.
Szasz, who, together with Mr. Reinhard H. Rainer, is also
co-author of the present book. As the Agency's work has expanded,
the emphasis of its programme components shifted and
administrative practices changed, an update of the study became
necessary to ensure its continued value as a comprehensive
reference tool and documentation of the main legal and
administrative developments. This updated edition retains the
original structure of the basic book as far as possible to allow
consultation of both books seriatim.

<I>Technical Reports Series No. 288</I></B> 
<P>
In revising the Definition of high level radioactive waste
unsuitable for dumping at sea, calculations of water
concentrations in and near a dump site have been made and used to
estimate doses to 'typical' marine species living at or near the
sea floor at a depth of 4000 m. These calculations show that
there are radionuclides that can give rise to significant doses
to these typical species and that future revisions of the
Definitions and Recommendations under the Convention on the
Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other
Matters will have to consider impacts on the marine ecosystem in
setting limits for dumping. 
<P>
<I>Contents:</I> 1. Introduction; 2. Nature of the deep sea
ecosystem; 3. Naturally occurring and fallout radionuclides in
the marine environment; 4. Effects of radiation on aquatic

estimate of the background dose rate in the deep sea;            

6. Derivation of dose rates to organisms based on the IAEA       

Definition of high level radioactive waste unsuitable for        

dumping at sea; 7. Dose rates arising from actual sea

Releases of waste gases and liquids into the environment from
facilities using radioactive materials are controlled so that
people living in the vicinity are adequately protected from
exposure to ionizing radiations. It is implicitly assumed that
protecting humans will also protect the environment in which they
live. Although this assumption has never been formally defended,
neither has it been seriously challenged. This report examines
the validity of the assumption for the case of radioactive
releases to the terrestrial and freshwater environments and also
for solid waste disposal underground.

<P>
Proceedings of a symposium, Vienna, 8-12 May 1995. This was the
first major IAEA meeting for more than a decade dealing
specifically with the transfer of radionuclides in the
environment. Its purpose was to review the information that has
become available in recent years, notably as a result of the
Chernobyl accident but also gained from studies of the discharges
from civil and military nuclear facilities in the early nuclear
age.  This information has been used for improving the
reliability of environmental model predictions, and the main
results of the IAEA/CEC programme on Validation of Environmental
Model Predictions (VAMP) were presented. In addition, progress in
the IAEA programme on the International Arctic Seas Assessment
Project (IASAP) was summarized.

This is the tenth and latest volume in the present series. It is
mainly concerned with the concentration of the environmental
isotopes (tritium, deuterium and oxygen-18) in monthly samples of
precipitation taken by a global network of 169 stations in the
period 1988-1991. Selected meteorological data, such as the
amount of precipitation, mean water vapour pressure and surface
air temperature, are also presented. Data before 1988 which were
unavailable at the time of the earlier issues have also been
included in the latter part of this volume as late reports. The
great majority of the data comes from the IAEA/WMO               
Isotopes-in-Precipitation Network, which was set up by the IAEA
in co-operation with WMO and seven national laboratories. The
collection of the precipitation samples is carried out by the
meteorological services in 45 countries and territories. Analyses
of the network samples are made in co-operating laboratories, a
full list of which is given at the end of this publication.

<I>Proceedings Series</I></B>
<P>
Proceedings of a symposium held in Vienna, 19-23 April 1993.
Natural isotopes are among the most powerful tools for
investigating past and current environmental changes. In
particular, stable isotopes have proved to be very useful proxy
indicators of climate related parameters such as surface air
temperature, relative humidity of the atmosphere and amount of
precipitation, whereas radioactive isotopes are widely used as a
dating tool. The release of radionuclides during the nuclear bomb
tests permitted studies of the dynamics of transport and mixing
processes in the atmosphere. It also allowed a global tracer
experiment on the hydrological and carbon cycles, which
substantially contributed to better understanding of these two
vital compartments of the global ecosystem. A wide spectrum of
themes was discussed at the symposium, covering both the
'present' and the 'past' of the global atmosphere/hydrosphere
system. Case studies as well as methodological aspects of various
isotope techniques applied in both areas of research were
presented.

age, origin and mode of flow of groundwater bodies, and
investigations of rock-water interactions and palaeoclimatic
research, to their spectacular role, although not yet fully
proved, as early indicators of earthquakes and volcanic
eruptions. The purpose of the meeting was twofold: to review the
current status of techniques using isotopes of noble gases in the
general field of environmental studies, with emphasis placed on
investigations of the atmosphere and the hydros phere, and to
provide guidelines for further developments and research needed

Proceedings of a symposium jointly organized by the IAEA and FAO
in co-operation with the Gesellschaft f&uuml;r Strahlen- und
Umweltforschung and held in Neuherberg, 24-27 November 1987. An
FAO/IAEA/GSF research co-ordination meeting was held immediately
after and in conjunction with the symposium. Pesticides are an
integral part of modern agriculture and also in most developing
countries. Increasing amounts of active ingredients are being
consumed, particularly in the intensively cropped regions of
South East Asia. Inherent contamination of the environment
follows if rules and regulations are not strictly adhered to. The
search for safer, less persistent and more specific pesticides
and examination of the fate of applied pesticides in various
regions of the world were the main themes of the symposium.
Special emphasis was placed on the use of nuclear techniques,    

especially on labelled compounds in research.

<B>Principles for Limiting Releases of Radioactive Effluents into
the Environment<BR>
<I>Safety Series No. 77</I></B> 
<P>
This publication is a complete revision of Safety Series No. 45,
Principles for Establishing Limits for the Release of Radioactive
Materials into the Environment (1978), and its Annex (1982). It
is concerned with the subject of limiting releases of radioactive
effluents during normal, controlled operations of nuclear
installations. It does not deal with releases during accidents
where it is only possible to limit exposures by intervention. In
practice, a choice must be made between releasing radioactive
materials directly from an installation, storing them, treating
and disposing of them by some means, or a combination of these
methods.

Sediment K<SUB>d</SUB>s and Concentration Factors for
Radionuclides in the Marine Environment</B>
<BR>
<I>Technical Reports Series No. 247</I></B> 
<P>
In 1983 new models to calculate dumping rate limits of
radionuclides into the deep sea were adapted. These models
required
parameters involving sediment/water interactions. One such
parameter, the sediment/water distribution coefficient (referred
to as K<SUB>d</SUB> in the deep-ocean environment and coastal
sediment       
         concentration factor in coastal environments), had only
been                measured for a few nuclides. A new approach
for calculation                      of these coefficients has
been developed, using stable element                  
geochemical data. In addition, concentration factor data for     

              marine biological material have been reviewed and
updated and emphasis placed on field derived data. Additional
data on coefficients for elements not occurring naturally are
also provided.

Environmental Studies<BR>
<I>Proceedings Series</I></B>
<P>
Proceedings of a symposium jointly organized with the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Vienna, 1-5
October 1990. The objective of the symposium was to evaluate
progress in the use of stable isotopes to examine various aspects
of soil fertility and plant nutrition and some environmental
problems, the potential and limitations of existing methods, and
possibilities for further development. The meeting focused on the
site level rather than the landscape level and, more
specifically, on soil-plant relations, although landscape
environmental aspects were also examined. The underlying theme
was an assessment of current and possible future approaches to
two problems of concern: how to increase or sustain productivity
with minimum inputs, and how to limit environmental damage due to
inappropriate land management and to industry.

<B>The Oceanographic and Radiological Basls for the Definition of
High Level Wastes Unsuitable for Dumping at Sea<BR>
<I>Safety Series No. 66</I></B> 
<P>
In 1980 the International Atomic Energy Agency requested the
IMO/FAO/UNESCO/WMO/WHO/IAEA/UN/UNEP Joint Group of Experts on the
Scientific Aspects of Marine Pollution (GESAMP) to initiate a
study to provide advice on the most suitable oceanographic models
which would apply to sea dumping of not only radioactive but also
other harzad wastes. At the same time the IAEA undertook to
incorporate the latest information in the field of radiological
protection and the latest data on concentration factors in order
to update the radiological basis. The GESAMP Working Group
completed its work and the report of the group was accepted at
the 13th session of GESAMP in March 1983. An Advisory Group on
the Radiological Basis met in October 1982. This guide is based
on the results of the Advisory Group meeting, the GESAMP Report,
two Consultants meetings held in 1983 and a Technical Committee
meeting held in December 1983. It details the assumptions
underlying model selection, analytical solutions to the models
and the radiological basis used.

<B>The Radiological Impact of Radionuclides Dispersed on a
Regional and Global Scale: Methods for Assessment and their
Application<BR>
<I>Technical Reports Series No. 250</I></B>
<P>
This report reviews the environmental models currently available
for the assessment of the radiological impact of the
radionuclides that are of recognized significance on a regional
and global scale, i.e. tritium, carbon-14, krypton-85 and
iodine-129. The models are used in illustrative calculations to
demonstrate the relative importance of pathways to man, the
relative contributions to dose on a regional and on a global
scale, and the temporal distribution of dose following
environmental release. The report also contains an estimate of
the magnitude of the future exposure of the world's population
from releases of radionuclides that become globally dispersed on
the basis of an assumed future world power programme.  
<P>
<I>Contents:</I> Introduction; Radiological concepts and
quantities; Models for the assessment of radionuclides released
to the atmosphere; Assessment models for releases to the aquatic
environment; Future exposure from the global circulation of
released nuclides; Summary and conclusions; References; Appendix
A: An illustrative procedure for the estimation of the regional
collective dose from discharges of radionuclides to the
atmosphere.

TOMOGRAPHY IN NUCLEAR MEDICINE
<BR>
<I>Proceedings Series</I>
</B>
<P>
Proceedings of a symposium organized in co-operation with WHO,
Vienna, 21-25 August 1995.  The present status and future prospects
of nuclear medicine tomography were the main topics of discussion. 
The purpose of the Symposium was to share experience and information
on new developments and clinical applications of two promising
tomographic techniques: SPECT (single photon emission computed
tomography) and PET (positron emission tomography). SPECT is
currently being used universally in clinical practice, while PET,
orignally developed as a technique for research, has gradually moved
from the research laboratory to the clinical environment.  The
significant differences in nuclear medicine capabilities, especially
in tomography, between developed and developing countries were given
particular attention at a panel discussion.

<B>NUCLEAR SAFETY REVIEW 1996
<BR>
Part D of the IAEA Yearbook 1996</B>
<P>
The report features a number of prominent issues, focusing on their implications for radiation, waste and nuclear safety. There are discussions on a global nuclear safety culture, reactor pressure vessel annealing, regulatory aspects of safety related software, effects of low dose radiation, implementing radiation safety standards and the consequences of the Chernobyl accident. Articles focusing on radioactive waste safety deal with such issues as controls on the discharge of radioactive material and the handling of radioactive issues from past activities.

<B>SELECTED SAFETY ASPECTS OF WWER-440 MODEL 213 NUCLEAR POWER
PLANTS
<BR>
<I>Final Report of the IAEA Project on Evaluation of Safety Aspects
for WWER-440 Model 213 Nuclear Power Plants - Reference Plant: 
Bohunice NPP V2 (Slovakia)</I>
</B>
<P>
In 1991, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) of the former 
Czechoslovakia requested that an evaluation of the safety
aspects of the WWER-440 model 213 nuclear power plant be
undertaken under the auspices of the IAEA. The request for this
study was a logical progression from the activities related to
the accident analysis of WWER type reactors that had originated
under the IAEA Technical Co-operation Regional Programme in 1985
and were carried out until 1990 with the participation of
Bulgaria, the former Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and the
former USSR.  The prime objective of the Project was to co-
ordinate and integrate assistance given to national
organizations in studying selected aspects of safety for the
same type of reactors. Consequently, the study integrated these
results. This report provides a comprehensive review of the
conduct and the final results of the Project. It summarizes both
the detailed material published earlier in IAEA-TECDOCs Nos 742,
803, 810, 811 and 848 and other material. It will be useful to
everyone working in the field of WWER safety, and in particular
to experts planning, executing or reviewing studies related to
WWER safety.

Proceedings of an international conference, jointly sponsored by the European Commission, IAEA, WHO, and held in co-operation with UNDHA, UNESCO, UNEP, UNSCEAR, FAO and OECD/NEA, Vienna, 8-12 April 1996.  Two major objectives were to reach agreement on established scientific facts and to clarify their interpretation in order to promote comprehension of the consequences of the Chernobyl accident and to help dispel misapprehensions.  Background papers were prepared by teams of scientists from around the world who collaborated to ascertain and present the current state of knowledge on the health and environmental consequences of the accident.  Nuclear safety aspects and the accident's social and economic impact were also considered, as well as the conclusions drawn at related conferences and in other national and international projects.  The conference was attended by more than 800 experts in the field of radiation protection and nuclear safety, including medical, environmental and engineering specialists. The conference did much to achieve a broad consensus on the accident's consequences and to consolidate a common understanding of their nature and magnitude.  In particular, the results of the conference will assist those countries most affected by the consequences in developing well informed and balanced policies for their alleviation.  The proceedings contain a summary of the conference results and the texts of oral presentations and discussions, while an IAEA technical document (TECDOC) will reproduce material from 181 poster presentations as well as the List of Participants.

<B>THE RADIOLOGICAL ACCIDENT AT THE IRRADIATION FACILITY IN
NESVIZH</B>
<P>
On 26 October 1991, a fatal radiological accident occurred at an
industrial sterilization facility in Nesvizh, Belarus.  Following a
jam in the internal product transport system, the operator entered
the irradiation chamber to clear the fault. In doing so, he bypassed
a number of safety features, leaving the controls in a position such
that exposure was imminent.  It was estimated that he received a
whole body dose of 11 Gy, with localized areas of up to 20 Gy. 
Despite intensive medical treatment, he died 113 days later.  The
significant feature of this case was related to the medical
management.  In its post-accident review, the IAEA also brought to
light other circumstances of the accident.  The present report
documents the causes and consequences of the accident and defines the
lessons learned with a view to assisting those people with
responsibility for the safety of such facilities and those medical
authorities who might be involved in the management of a radiation
event.

<B>LESSONS LEARNED FROM ACCIDENTS IN INDUSTRIAL IRRADIATION
FACILITIES</B>
<P>
The purpose of this publication is to present the results of a review
of accidents in industrial radiography which have either been
reported to regulatory authorities or to professional associations,
or been published in scientific journals.  Use of ionizing radiation
in medicine, industry and research for technical development
continues to increase throughout the world.  Although this industry
has a good safety record, there is a potential for accidents with
serious consequences to human health because of the high dose rates
produced by these sources.  Five fatal accidents  occurred between
1975 and 1994. Such accidents have prompted the present review,
carried out by a team of manufacturers, regulatory authorities and
operating organizations.  Having closely looked at the circumstances
of each accident, the apparent deficiencies in design, safety and
regulatory systems, and personnel performance, the team made a number
of recommendations. The findings of extensive research pertaining to
the lessons that can be learned from irradiation accidents are
presented.

The Thesaurus gives the controlled vocabulary to be used by
INIS members to index the literature they report to INIS. 
This authority ensures consistent subject indexing.  Revision
35 contains 19743 accepted terms (descriptors) and 6228
forbidden terms (non-descriptors).  The terms are listed
alphabetically, and with each entry a 'word block' containing
all the terms associated with that particular entry is
displayed.  A revision of the Thesaurus is issued once a year; 
cumulative updates are normally issued monthly.

Declaration</TITLE>

<CENTER>
<B>ANNEX  II</B>
<H3>Annotated Outline of Proposed Expanded Declaration</H3>
</CENTER>
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(A) The two central components of a strengthened safeguards system are
increased
access to information and increased physical access.  The vehicle whereby States party
to
comprehensive safeguards agreements will provide increased information on their
nuclear
activities is the Expanded Declaration.<A HREF="#note_1"><SUP>1/</SUP></A>  This Annotated Outline of the Expanded
Declaration serves as guidance for States on the information to be included in their
Expanded Declarations.
<P>
<DD>(B) In order to show the scope of information to be provided by States, the
Annotated Outline of the Expanded Declaration includes not only the information to be
submitted under the complementary legal authority granted by the additional protocol
but
also the information to be provided under the existing legal authority of comprehensive
safeguards agreements, including the measures in GOV/2807 approved by the Board of
Governors on 15 June 1995.  The items of information to be submitted under
complementary legal authority are indicated in the left margin as  <B>Part 2</B> . 
The
information to be submitted under existing legal authority is indicated as  <B>Part
1</B> .  These later entries are included only for the information of States and do not
in
any way define or alter the information requirements of comprehensive safeguards
agreements.
<P>
<DD>
(C) The Expanded Declaration includes three categories of information: information on
the
State s System of Accounting and Control (SSAC), on present nuclear activities of the
State and on planned nuclear activities of the State.  All of the information concerning
SSACs and most of the information related to safeguarded facilities and other locations
containing nuclear material (LOFs) are Part 1 measures and are being requested under
existing legal authority.  The remaining information in the Expanded Declaration is for
provision under complementary legal authority and involves information related to
present
and planned nuclear activities.
<P>
<DD>(D) The requested information will provide the Agency with a fuller and clearer
understanding of all nuclear activities in a State and will serve three important
purposes. 
First, because of its scope and comprehensiveness, the information in the Expanded
Declaration will contribute to confidence that no undeclared nuclear activities are
being
concealed within the declared programme or rely on or make use of elements of the
declared programme.  Second, by committing itself to a declaration about its nuclear
and
nuclear-related activities, the State will provide a considerably improved data base on
its
nuclear activities against which information obtained from other sources (e.g.,
procurement
activities or environmental sampling) can be compared for consistency and follow-up. 
The
more accurate and comprehensive the information, the less frequent inconsistencies
and
questions will arise.  Third, the requested information will provide a basis for the
efficient
planning and conduct of Agency activities relevant to providing assurance about the
absence of undeclared nuclear activities at declared locations as well as to
safeguarding
declared nuclear material.
<P>
<DD>(E) The approach taken in developing the Expanded Declaration was to be
comprehensive so that no relevant information is out of bounds while ensuring that
States
are not burdened by excessive or irrelevant requests.  Further, States are not asked to
provide information which may not be within their reach.  For such situations, the
requested information is limited by an expression such as  where available  and, to
enable
the Agency to properly assess the information, calls for any limitations known to the
State
on its completeness to be identified.
<P>
<DD>(F) The information to be provided in Expanded Declarations is of greater scope
than currently provided to the Agency, and some elements of the information could be
considered by the State to be commercially or technically sensitive.  The Agency will
give
special attention to the protection of all information contained in Expanded
Declarations. 
The obligation of the Agency to protect information obtained in the course of
safeguards
in accordance with paragraph 5 of INFCIRC/153 will apply to all information acquired
under complementary legal authority.  The procedures and practices of the Agency for
meeting this obligation will continue to be subject to review to ensure their
appropriateness
and effectiveness.
<P>
<DD>(G) The information called for in the Expanded Declaration is intended to provide
increased transparency and a data base sufficient for achieving credible assurance of
the
absence of undeclared nuclear activities.  This information is far from including all
details
of a State s nuclear activities, but it represents a reasonable balance between the
benefits
of additional information and the practicalities and costs of regularly providing and
using
more information.  The additional information that will come from the Agency s
safeguards activities, including evaluation, and from the clarifications and explanations
provided by States in response to specific Agency requests will be an essential
contribution
to transparency.
<P>
<DD>(H) This Annotated Outline states the specific elements of information to be
provided to the Agency by States in their Expanded Declarations together with
explanations, definitions and benefits to the Agency of the information.  The
explanations,
definitions and benefits are presented in italics.  Terms defined in comprehensive
safeguards agreements, unless otherwise noted, have the same meaning here as in the
agreements and are not further defined here.
<P>
<DD>(I) Many of the information elements are temporal in nature, and almost all are
subject to change.  Accordingly, the updating of information on an annual basis is
foreseen.  Some elements, such as 2.c.(iv) on additional operational information, would
be
updated more often in accordance with agreed arrangements with the State.
<P>
<DD>(J) The Agency understands that at some locations identified under information
elements 2.c.(iii), (v), (vi), and (viii) a State may wish arrangements for managed
Agency
access due to safety, proprietary or other concerns.  Areas at such locations where the
State foresees a need for managed access should be identified in the Expanded
Declaration
to the extent practical.  The specific information and areas to be protected through
managed access would be provided by the State when the Agency gives notice of the
need
to access such a location.  The State's proposal for how access is to be managed would
be
evaluated by the Agency in light of specific Agency objectives.  The arrangements
should
not preclude the Agency from conducting the activities necessary to determine the
absence
of undeclared nuclear activities at the location and otherwise resolve any inconsistency
or
question.
<P>
<DD>(K) The information in Expanded Declarations will be processed and evaluated by
the Agency together with all other information available to the Agency.  This may
result in
the identification of inconsistencies in the information and in questions regarding the
information.  In such an event, the process would be similar to the well established
process
for resolving discrepancies and anomalies arising in safeguarding declared nuclear
material,
including consultations.  As is often the case for discrepancies and anomalies arising
from
safeguards on declared nuclear material, the consultative process may resolve the
matter. 
However, when inconsistencies or questions arise, the Agency must have the
opportunity
to confirm the explanation or other response of the State.  Access for this and other
purposes is provided for in the protocol, but systematic verification of the information
contained in Expanded Declarations is not.

          non-connected parts, and is not limited to facilities involved in nuclear power
          generation.  It includes installations for which a decision to construct has been

<P>
          <I>This is element 2.c. (iii) of the Expanded Declaration.  It covers nuclear
          R&D activities of the State, which do not currently involve the presence or use
          of nuclear material, that are specifically related to any process development
          aspect of the named components of the nuclear fuel cycle and have the
          capability to generate nuclear material.  For example, applied research related
          to process development aspects of enrichment (uranium or plutonium) or
          reprocessing would be reported where it is clear that the intended end-use is
          a nuclear application (design features related to radiation protection or
          criticality control and components  manufactured from materials resistant to
          UF6 are examples of where it is clear that the intended end-use is a nuclear
          application).  Theoretical or basic scientific research and R&D on medical or
          agricultural applications, health and environmental effects and improved
          maintenance are not included.  The R&D to be reported involving accelerators
          is limited to accelerators capable of producing a continuous neutron source
          sufficient for annual production of gram quantities of fissile isotopes.
<P>
          In addition, the State is asked to provide information on any nuclear R&D
          specifically related to enrichment, reprocessing of nuclear fuel and treatment
          of waste containing nuclear material that may exist even though it is not
          owned, funded or authorized by the State.
<P>
          This element, in conjunction with element 2.c.(ii) in Part 1 (nuclear R&D at

          and the treatment of waste containing nuclear material.  This information,
          together with information on the State's activities to develop other parts of the

          specific operational activities at nuclear facilities and LOFs additional to that
          required under paragraph 64(b) of INFCIRC/153 would be provided, subject
          to agreement by the State.  Depending on the nature of a facility or LOF, it
          may include, by way of example, more frequent and earlier information on
          nuclear material transfers and inventories, empty casks transfers, crane
          movement records, reactor fuel production, isotope production programmes
          and maintenance activities.  Each such additional items of information may be

<P>
          Such information, when provided in advance, on planned spent fuel cask

<DD>(v)   Information (description, contents and use) on each of the buildings on the
sites
          on which are located nuclear facilities or LOFs, including maps of sites.</DL>
</DL>
<P>
          <I>The terms site, site perimeter and site layout are used in the Agency s
          Design Information Questionnaire (DIQ) and have the same meanings here as
          in the DIQ.  They refer to the spatial location of a structure or structures that
          are part of, or support part of, the State s nuclear fuel cycle activities.  The
          site layout, i.e., a site plan showing in sufficient detail the location, premises
          and perimeter of the facility, buildings, railways, roads, rivers, etc., and the
          geographic location for nuclear facilities are included in the information
          presently routinely provided and defined by the State when the Agency DIQ is
          prepared.  For a LOF these terms have analogous meanings for its geographic
          location.  The site must include all installations co-located with a nuclear
          facility(ies) or LOF(s) associated with the provision or use of services, such
          as hot cells, waste and decontamination facilities, training centers, electrical
          substations, water treatment, shielded cask storage, marshalling yards,
          mechanical workshops,  general stores and buildings associated with the
          equipment and non-nuclear material identified in element 2.c.(vi) of the
          Expanded Declaration.
<P>
          In most cases this is straightforward, and the site is normally the area defined
          by an external perimeter fence.  As a rule, it should bear a close relationship
          to that area, taking into account terrain features and man-made boundaries. 
          It should normally be, or run close to, the surrounding security barrier if one
          exists.  The size and complexity of sites will vary considerably.  Some will be
          quite large and include more than one nuclear facility together with a full
          complement of support and related services.  Other sites may consist of only
          a single building, or even a single room in a building, and have no co-located
          services.
<P>
          A primary objective of strengthened safeguards is to assure that undeclared
          nuclear material and activities are not co-located with nuclear facilities and
          LOFs in order to utilize the infrastructure of manpower, technology, equipment
          and services that is in place to support declared operations.  That is the
          reason for this element of the Expanded Declaration and the associated access
          provisions.  The Agency would consult with the State should the Agency have
          information that suggests that installations outside of the site, as defined by the
          State, may be engaged in activities that are functionally related to the nuclear
          activities or the associated infrastructure on the site. In such cases the Agency
          would request the identity and a description of activities outside of the
          declared site relevant to resolution of the matter.
<P>
          The DIQ provides for the required information on all buildings and locations
          where nuclear material is or is expected to be.  The information requested here
          pertains to the other buildings on the site.  During visits for design information
          verification and inspections, the Agency may confirm the nature of other
          buildings shown on the site layout, their declared use and the absence of
          undeclared nuclear and nuclear-related activities there.
<P>
          In some cases, depending on the configuration of the nuclear facility or LOF,
          some information under this element can be required under existing authority,
          for example, for the purpose of ad hoc inspections where the presence of
          nuclear material has been indicated.  However, without prejudice to existing

          specific activity, e.g., a tank farm for high level waste liquors, containing
          nuclear material on which safeguards have not been terminated would be
          treated as a nuclear facility and not reported here. The Board would be asked
          to approve any changes to this list resulting from technological developments
          or experience with the physical model of the nuclear fuel cycle from which the

<P>
          The physical model is a major component of the Agency s improved analysis

          source material acquisition to the production of weapons useable nuclear
          material and then beyond the fuel cycle to weaponization.  A brief outline of
          the improved analysis was provided to the Board in GOV/INF/759.  The
          Technical Background Documentation on  Programme 93+2  which was
          made available to Member States in March 1995 provides a more detailed
          description, including an example for the physical model for gaseous diffusion

<DD>(viii)    Information on inventories, imports and exports of material containing
uranium  or thorium which has not yet reached the stage of the nuclear fuel cycle
described in paragraph 34(c) of INFCIRC/153; information on nuclear
material exempted from safeguards pursuant to paragraph 37 of INFCIRC/153;
               information on nuclear material that has been exempted from safeguards
               pursuant to paragraph 36(b) of INFCIRC/153 but which is not yet in
end-use
               form and, in the event that the information is not complete, with indications
of
               the limitations on its completeness; and information on any planned
changes
               in location or further processing of waste containing nuclear material
               (excepting waste released to the environment) on which safeguards have
been
               terminated pursuant to paragraph 11 of INFCIRC/153.</DL>
</DL>
<P>
          <I>This element does not include requirements for measurement, batch and
          source data, the taking of physical inventories, inventory change reporting or
          the closing of material balances.  Moreover, the activities involving this
          material under the protocol are far short of the activities for safeguarding
          nuclear material under existing legal authority.  Hence, this element does not
          constitute a change in the starting point of safeguards.  Where quantities are
          not measured, other estimates would be provided.
<P>
          The required information for material which has not yet reached the stage of
          the nuclear fuel cycle described in paragraph 34(c) of INFCIRC/153 is the
          quantity, chemical composition, location and, if known, intended use for
          inventories, whether in nuclear or non-nuclear use, and for imports for non-
          nuclear use.  For inventories the quantities may be approximate.  For exports
          (or intended exports) of such material for non-nuclear use the required
          information is the quantity, chemical composition and destination.  The
          required information for nuclear material exempted for non-nuclear use under
          paragraph 36(b) is the quantity, use and location with an indication of the
          limitations on the completeness of the information.  The reporting requirements
          for these materials are annual and are limited to those locations with
          inventories and individual imports and exports involving quantities exceeding
          those identified in paragraph 37 of INFCIRC/153.
<P>
          The required information for nuclear material exempted from safeguards for
          nuclear use pursuant to paragraph 37 of INFCIRC/153 is the quantity, use and
          location  All material so exempted and all planned location changes and
          further processing of nuclear material on which safeguards were terminated
          should be reported.
<P>
          The quantity reporting unit would be tonnes for material which has not yet
          reached the stage of the nuclear fuel cycle described in paragraph 34(c) of
          INFCIRC/153 and, for other material included in this element, the units
          specified in paragraph 101 of INFCIRC/153.  The exemption of uranium for
          shielding radioactive sources can be made under the provision of paragraph
          36(b) for non-nuclear use, in which case the reporting called for here would
          be limited to available information.  In all cases, when nuclear material
          exempted for non-nuclear uses is in its end-use form, there is no requirement
          to continue reporting on it.
<P>
          The reporting of the further processing, e.g., for purposes of recovery of
          nuclear material, of waste (other than waste released to the environment) on
          which safeguards have been terminated and of other aspects of this element
          may be required under existing authority but, without prejudice to existing
          authority, is being requested under complementary legal authority.
<P>
          The requested information, along with element 2.c.(vii), would provide a more
          complete picture of all of the State s nuclear material useable for nuclear
          purposes and a basis for confirmation by the Agency of the consistency
          between the State s declared nuclear programme and its holdings of nuclear
          material.</I></TD>

          time, for the Secretariat to propose to the Board a limited number of such
          items whose reporting would be beneficial as well as practical and for the
          Board to include such items as it deems appropriate.
<P>
          The information requested here will contribute substantially to the
          transparency of a State s nuclear activities and to the Agency s understanding
          of these activities.  It is an important part of the data base to be used by the

          programme within the State.  The information requested here relates to long-
          term plans for further development of the fuel cycle within the State and to
          how that development is supported through current and planned activities. 
The
          information will be useful to the Agency in its own long-term planning and
will
          provide the basis for increased assurance that the declared present nuclear
          programme and nuclear fuel cycle related R&D are generally consistent with
          the declared plans for future development of the fuel cycle.  Any limitations on
          the scope of the information reported, including the planning horizon (e.g., 5
          years, 10 years, etc.)  should also be reported.
<P>
          As is the case of element 2.c.(iii), Agency safeguards would benefit from

<B>In Mohammedia, Morocco</B>, an iridium-192 source being used to radiograph welds at a construction site is inadvertently misplaced. A passing labourer picks up the tiny metal cylinder and takes it home. Within a few months, he and seven relatives are dead from radiation poisoning.
<P>
<B>In Goiania, Brazil</B>, a rotating head from a discarded cancer therapy unit is stolen from a  storage facility and sold to a scrap metal dealer.  The dealer breaks up the heavy shielding, and bits of the radioactive source, which glow in the dark, are taken by friends to various parts of the city. Within two weeks, 249 people are contaminated, four people die and more than 100,00 people must be screened.
<P>
<B>Along the US-Mexico</B> border, a heavy metal head from a radiotherapy machine is mistakenly melted down to make chair supports for a US fast food chain. The supports are trucked into the US, but the radioactivity triggers sensitive alarms at a nuclear research station as the vehicle passes the facility. Unknown numbers of hamburger lovers barely escape low-level radiation exposure. 
<P>
Most countries with nuclear power plants and other advanced nuclear facilities have independent regulatory authorities backed by strict law enforcement, well-trained personnel and assured budgets. But as the incidents above illustrate, many developing nations still lack the radiation and waste safety infrastructures to properly manage  the sources they currently use.
<P>
Indeed, despite fielding over 100 field missions and assisting almost 700 priority national projects since 1984, it became clear to IAEA officials by the early 1990s that safety systems in many developing countries had to be dramatically strengthened to meet  the requirements derived from the Basic Safety Standards (BSS).
<P>
Two technical cooperation Model Projects (MP) launched in 1994 aim to upgrade radiation protection and waste management infrastructures on a regional basis, with5 to 6 countries targeted each year. But "Country Safety Profiles" subsequently assembled by the IAEA revealed that over 50 countries were in need of immediate assistance. Thus, the IAEA decided to accelerate implementation of these two projects toward a target date of the year 2000 and to set up four regional centres to manage infrastructure upgrading. 
<P>
The most pressing needs of some 53 countries in four regional groupings have already been determined on the basis of BSS requirements and information gathering, including earlier missions by Radiation Protection Advisory Teams (RAPAT), the Waste Management Advisory Programme (WAMAP) and special expert teams. An action plan has been developed together with each participating country, setting out the key steps that must be taken. To date 28 countries have officially agreed to their action plan. To accelerate the upgrading process, time limited objectives and decentralized management have been established. Four regional field co-ordinators (RFC) have been appointed to manage offices recently opened in Addis Ababa, Beirut, Bratislava and San Jose.
<P>
Needs and infrastructure requirements differ dramatically from country to country and also between regions. Africa includes a number of countries that have no designated authority to keep records of where sources are.  Many of the Asian project countries have not used many radiation sources in the past but are moving in this direction quickly. By contrast, once-extensive programmes in some Eastern European countries have been stopped, but the sources have remained and records are not properly maintained.
<P>
The project's first aim is to inventory what sources are being used, for which applications, and where, as well as where and how no-longer-used sources are stored.  A computer database is being developed based on questionnaires sent to the countries about sources they know they have, and to manufacturers and suppliers on what they have provided in the past. The two-track findings - country records plus supplier information - should provide a comprehensive picture for national regulators, many of them only recently established. 
<P>
Many countries simply have not known what they have because they lacked the mechanisms to keep proper inventories. As regulatory structures are built up, the records will provide a base to monitor, control, ensure safe licensed use and finally to store radioactive sources securely. The initial focus is on larger (more active) sources used for medical purposes such as cancer treatment and in industry (sterilization, food irradiation, radiography).
<P>
Establishing laws, regulations and other means of control over sources are only part of the process. In liaison with the technical staff in the IAEA's Nuclear Safety Department, the RFC's will work with the governments to set up infrastructures to keep good records, monitor radiation for workers and emissions that affect the public, and assure the quality of radiation used in medicine. The project will also help procure essential equipment, provide the training to utilize them and monitor the safe transport of sources and disposal and waste handling.
<P>
The new approach establishes the first global thematic plan involving country assessments and action plans in Technical Co-operation (TC). It also recognizes the value of developing self-reliance and common experience through technical co-operation among countries developing similar control systems. Thus national organizations and experts with experience gained via earlier IAEA training are recruited to provide technical support services to other countries developing safety infrastructures in the region. The Slovak Republic, for example, which developed a full-scope nuclear regulatory authority almost from scratch within a few years, is now helping Ukraine restructure its struggling system.
<P>
Besides the country-level information, a second international database is being developed on accidents and near accidents with sources. Three recent studies concentrated on "lessons learned" from mishaps in radiography, radiotherapy and at  industrial irradiation facilities. They will help regulators and workers in participating countries as they analyze the causes of more than 100 accidents.
<P>
The overall goal is to help countries attain the infrastructure and expertise to avoid the kind of disasters described earlier.  By the time the project ends at the turn of the century, those countries that fully co-operate will have everything in place to safely manage the use of ionizing radiation for whatever purposes they choose.

One man's trash is another man's treasure. The dictum is being borne out beside the river Danube, some 150 kilometres south of the Hungarian capital Budapest. A mock nuclear reactor, made-up of never used parts of abandoned installations, is nearing completion at Paks, the site where four real reactor units now produce half of the country's total electricity. By the end of  1996 the dummy will have all  the key components - pressure vessel, steam generator, circulation pumps, piping and other such internals - in place, identical with those of the working units. But it will never produce power.
<P>
The parts were manufactured for reactors of the same type (WWER 440/213 designed in the Soviet Union) to be built in East Germany and Poland. Both undertakings were cancelled, by unified Germany and post- Communist Poland, leaving the components worth no more than scrap metal. The IAEA bought them at giveaway prices as part of a technical co-operation Model Project to strengthen operational safety at Paks. The imitation unit will be a Maintenance Training Centre (MTC), the first of its kind anywhere for water cooled and water moderated energy reactors (WWER), to be used for training and retraining of plant operators.
<P>
Paks has an operational safety record on par with the best in the world, but management is conscious that it needs to have systematic safety procedures of the highest international standard. The Model Project has three main objectives, which were developed by the Hungarian Atomic Energy Commission that oversees the Paks power plant: to set up the MTC; to upgrade overall safety culture practices in the plant and all organizations dealing with nuclear power in Hungary; and to introduce a systematic approach to training of plant personnel.
<P>
The MTC is particularly important because the WWER was not designed for regular safety inspections and maintenance, as is normally required worldwide. In fact parts of the core area cannot be reached by humans and, in earlier Agency projects, remote control devices were developed to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. But the safety standards to which Hungary aspires demand regular inspections as well. With its full-size core area the MTC can provide the hands-on feel and experience to enable maintenance workers to work quickly and efficiently. Hungary, moreover, views it as a regional centre, not only for itself but also for the seven other countries (which include Finland and Russia) with operating 440/230, 440/213 or 1000 type WWERs. Also important, many of the maintenance personnel at Paks will be retiring soon. Recruits can now get MTC training and some on-the-job experience to take their places in due time.
"Safety culture" is a recent and somewhat recondite concept. The essence of it is that everybody involved in nuclear activities --from gatekeepers to top managers at a plant, for example --should be part of a "culture" which has safety as its paramount goal. It calls for a questioning ethos, for reporting anything out of the expected so that it can be assessed for its safety significance and for preempting events that could threaten safety.
<P>
Industry people are now talking of a "global" safety culture, though it is not something that can be set up by edict. The Model Project aims to implant it ecumenically via workshops and seminars, bringing together Hungarian and international specialists to discuss Paks' shortcomings identified by Agency missions and other issues pertinent to safety culture. The idea is that the way of thinking will be absorbed and take hold.
<P>
The third component, systematic approach to training (SAT), is new for Soviet-built reactor operating staff. Different types of safety missions led by the IAEA have identified training as the most important element to be improved. The project is helping to upgrade all the written material, audio visual and computerized aids, as well as equipment - not only for Paks but for all the institutes that provide training prior to that provided in the plant itself. Experts will be sent in to review, modify and advise on the modifications done by the Hungarians, and the Agency will test and evaluate the systems designed to examine trainees during and after courses.
<P>
Hungary is investing some US $8 million in the Model Project due to be completed in 1997, several times the IAEA technical co-operation input. The payoff is measured in safety assurance as well assured power supply. There have been no safety threatening events in the four Paks units (started up in 1982, '84, '86 and '87 respectively) but there have been holdups; notably problems which extended refuelling outage periods, the most recent this September. With Paks providing 50% of electricity to the national grid, avoiding such delays is important to the economy and public welfare.

At the Munich Summit of 1992, the G-7 declared three priorities for the revitalization of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Paramount among them is the need to strengthen their nuclear regulatory bodies. An IAEA regional project was subsequently established for this purpose. 
<P>
During the last two years, national programmes in Armenia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Kazakstan, Lithuania, Romania, Russian Federation, Slovakia, Slovenia and Ukraine have been developing regulatory bodies with the independence and fundamental powers backed by laws and regulations to license, inspect, order modifications and even shut down plants on safety grounds.
<P>
Special attention has been devoted to co-ordinating non-IAEA related bilateral and multilateral projects as well, and the project's success has led to its extension as a new technical co-operation project through 1998. The extension, especially requested by the recipients, has also attracted substantial special contributions, notably by the United States  ($200,000) and the United Kingdom ($280,000) for 1997 alone, and as yet unspecified commitments by Finland and Germany.
<P>
Although organizational structures and regulatory processes vary from country to country (depending on existing constitutional, legal and administrative systems) this Model Project aims to tackle broad issues common to them by conducting regional workshops and training courses. In the process, national needs to be addressed separately are also identified. So far there have been 10 courses on specific themes, including regulatory control of nuclear power plants and on the general approach to nuclear safety principles and fundamentals, with 180 participants from the 12 countries receiving 250 person-weeks of training. 
<P>
There have also been workshops on information for the public,  safety culture, and commissioning/licensing. Two others scheduled for late 1996  on commissioning/recommissioning and on decommissioning nuclear power reactors are of special importance to the region. Many of the older reactors are nearing the end of design lifetimes, yet possible recommissioning and decommissioning have received little considered in their design and construction. A decade after Chernobyl -  a period engrossed with intense assessment of the causes and consequences of the accident - the region's safety infrastructure is building toward internationally accepted standards through coordinated efforts by the international community to provide the required technical training and exchange of information.

The Convention on Nuclear Safety - the first international legal instrument on the safety of nuclear power plants worldwide - entered into force, 24 October 1996. The Convention commits States Parties to ensure the safety of land-based civil nuclear power plants. This includes a legislative and regulatory framework; general safety considerations such as quality assurance, assessment, and verification of safety; human factors; radiation protection; emergency preparedness; and specific obligations on the safety of nuclear installations; siting; design; and construction; and operation. Among its requirements, the Convention obliges Parties to submit reports at periodic review meetings. These reports will focus on the measures each State has taken to implement obligations under the Convention.
<P>
So far twenty-nine States have consented to be bound by the Convention on Nuclear Safety. They are Bangladesh, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Croatia, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Hungary, Ireland, Japan, Republic of Korea, Latvia, Lebanon, Lithuania, Mali, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway,  Poland, Romania, Russian Federation, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the United Kingdom. The Convention has been signed by 65 States.
<P>
"The Convention marks a major step forward in strengthening international co-operation in the safety field," said IAEA Director General Hans Blix.

Natural sources of radiation occur everywhere on Earth. Our atmosphere protects us from cosmic sources of radiation such as the sun and other energy sources in the universe. In fact, the protective layer of ozone is so thin that radiation doses from cosmic rays increase with altitude as we jet for business or vacation. Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that comes from decaying uranium which is common in the earth's crust. It is emitted from rocks or soil and usually disperses into the atmosphere, except when it encounters a building where it can concentrate. This "ionizing" radiation can cause human health problems and often requires monitoring and remediation. Since atomic energy was "discovered" some 75 years ago, nuclear technologies are applied to a spectrum of activities from processing toothpaste to producing energy.
<P>
Living with radiation is part of life on earth, and the IAEA is one of the key organizations with global responsibility for protecting and controlling radiation exposure from natural and man made sources. The Agency, in particular the Nuclear Safety Department, has helped establish international standards to ensure safety of all types of radiation sources: industrial, medical, agricultural, environmental, and others. It also supports training activities and national infrastructure development to ensure that governments have the legal framework, experience, human resources, and tools to protect, control and exploit nuclear energy. IAEA Technical Co-operation helps to ensure that the diversity of technologies employing  nuclear energy do so in a safe, effective and sustainable manner. This edition of <B><I>INSIDE TC</I></B> explains some of the activities that assist in meeting this challenge.

<HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=center SIZE=2>The remarkable rise in stature of the Slovak Nuclear Regulatory Authority (SNRA) is one the most reassuring developments in Eastern Europe's nuclear power scene. Set up only in January 1993, shortly after the amicable dissolution of the federation of Czechoslovakia, SNRA personnel are now serving as experts in IAEA programmes to advance regulatory capacity in neighboring countries.
<P>
Many countries in Eastern Europe were not recognized for having independent regulatory bodies, amply staffed and financed, backed by laws and regulations that gave them authority to shut down power plants on safety grounds. In the case of Czechoslovakia, separation left Slovakia in a dire situation. Only six site inspectors of the former federation remained in the new republic, while it inherited responsibility for four operating power reactors, four more under construction, a research reactor (severely damaged in a 1977 accident) to be dismantled, as well as for fuel cycle, spent fuel and radioactive waste treatment facilities.
<P>
Slovakia did have some nuclear engineers and scientists and technical staff from nuclear power plants. Together with personnel from non-nuclear regulatory bodies, research institutes and various ministries, SNRA built staff strength to 50 by the end of 1993. But they lacked nuclear regulatory experience, and SNRA had to create, virtually from scratch, a new organization aimed at matching international best practice. An IAEA technical co-operation Model Project, begun in January 1994 provided assistance via foreign experts, training fellowships abroad and some equipment to rapidly meet this goal.
<P>
A team of senior regulators, organized by the European Union with IAEA participation, identified areas for improvement. The IAEA then recruited western experts to visit Slovakia to analyze, discuss and advise SNRA on emergency preparedness, radioactive waste control, quality assurance, site inspection, periodic safety assessment and training.
<P>
Nearly 30 Slovak regulators have been awarded fellowships (typically for two weeks, some for several months) with mature regulatory bodies in Europe and North America to see how things are done in those countries, take experience back and, where appropriate, absorb them into SNRA procedures. "The Slovak regulators' rapid advance is largely due to their own determination and drive," an IAEA technical officer says. SNRA is now a strong body with good practices, able to recruit and retain staff.
<P>
SNRA Chairman Jozef Misak acknowledges the Authority's  new found stature in the country. What was once a solitary office in a ministry is now an independent legally constituted authority directly under the Prime Minister. It has more than 70 staff and an assured and adequate budget. Parliament has recognized it as equivalent to an international organization, and it has control powers over all nuclear activities and installations in the country.  Arguably the crowning recognition has been the request for SNRA to assist the regulatory bodies of Armenia and Ukraine via IAEA projects. The Agency is convinced that both countries would gain much from the Slovak experience, particularly in handling the considerable amount of foreign assistance that is available. Advice they are likely to hear from SNRA is, "Don't take too much assistance at once, don't have experts coming in every fortnight, because you get overburdened with help". Slovakia got wise to that early in their programme. They were getting flooded, so they backed off, rescheduled and made the pace manageable.
<P>
Both Armenia and Ukraine are handicapped by language problems that the Slovaks did not have. Russian-speaking SNRA consultants could overcome that barrier, and already some have joined IAEA teams to the two countries. A team of SNRA experts produced a workplan for Ukraine under an IAEA technical co-operation contract. There have also been two-way visits between Armenia and Slovakia. In short, SNRA activities are helping to realize a major objective of IAEA technical co-operation - the promotion of technical co-operation among developing countries (TCDC).

Since January 1993, just under 130 confirmed events involving illicit trafficking of nuclear materials and other radioactive sources have been recorded in the IAEA database. Most of these incidents have been innocuous. A number have involved plutonium and highly enriched uranium, generally in relatively small amounts, but two cases involved substantial amounts. Do these indicate that there is a lot of loose material for weapons out there waiting for a buyer? Are the small amounts just the tip of a fissile iceberg? Is the contraband, capable of killing or injuring people?
<P>
The IAEA launched a programme to address illicit trafficking of nuclear material and other radioactive sources in 1994.  In this programme, the IAEA plays a small but vital part in the extensive number of bilateral and multilateral activities which are aimed at stopping the illicit trafficking.  This programme is focused on four activities where technical co-operation plays an important role. <I>To prevent:</I> by helping countries to strengthen their basic nuclear laws and infrastructures, to upgrade their accounting, control and security of nuclear material and radioactive sources, as well as improve their control of the import/export of strategic goods and materials. <I>To respond:</I> by helping countries to detect and react to illegal cross-border movements of radioactive materials and analyze confiscated material; and by providing authoritative and timely information on trafficking incidents reported to the Agency's trafficking database. <I>To train:</I> by developing and providing training opportunities for both State regulatory and facility personnel; and to enhance the <I>exchange of information</I> via international and inter-agency meetings and conferences.
<P>
Recognizing that the most important defense against smuggling may be better intelligence, the IAEA is encouraging closer co-operation and co-ordination between the scientific community,  law enforcement organizations and  transporters by helping to create a network of communication with such organizations as Interpol, Europol, Euratom, International Air Transport Association, International Road Transport Union, World Customs Organization the Universal Postal Union and other organizations concerned with this potentially dangerous new situation.

<HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=center SIZE=2>Strawberries grown in a field straddling the Belgium/France border help to illustrate the chaos, in terms of protecting people from contamination, that followed the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986. Fruit from one side of a farm went to market while that of the other was buried; both obeying official edict in the two countries. There were many inconsistencies of that sort ten years ago. The <I>International Basic Safety Standards (BSS) for Protection Against Ionizing Radiation and for the Safety of Radiation Sources</I>, is the joint product of six international bodies: the Food and Agriculture Organization; IAEA; International Labour Organization; World Health Organization;  Pan American Health Organization and the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. All six sponsor organizations have now adopted the BSS and applied them in all their activities. Since the adoption of the new BSS, all countries now have clear guidelines on how to act in virtually every circumstance.
<P>
The standards prescribe safety requirements which, if followed, make accidents much less probable. And beyond guidance on preventing accidents, they also clarify in great detail what to do if an accident does occur in any of a full range of nuclear activities.  Non-accident situations are also included, such as high levels of naturally occurring radon gas in a house. Radon is produced by the decay of uranium in the earth's crust and is both widespread and harmlessly dispersed into the atmosphere. But it can cause health problems when it accumulates inside buildings.  The BSS explain when and how to intervene and at what radon level to evacuate a household.
<P>
Precise guidance and strong regulations are recommended for medical practices. A big problem area, particularly though not exclusively in developing countries, is the rapidly increasing use of medical sources for diagnosis and treatment. There have been many accidents in clinics, and even more occasions when they have been carelessly used or mis-used. One example is in cancer treatment, where the prescribed radiation dose has to be very precise to be useful on the one hand but not cause unnecessary injury to the patient on the other. The BSS cover all typical examinations as well as for nuclear medicine. Even the levels of residual radioactivity in patients, at the time they are discharged from the hospital after radiotherapy, are provided.
<P>
A key group of standards spotlight activities related to security and detection. Among these applications is the quite common radiological examination for legal or health insurance purposes. Another practice is radiological examination for theft detection: people working with gold or diamonds who may swallow the odd stone. The BSS do not "ban" these applications, but suggest that justification is essential for certain conditions.
<P>
The Basic Safety Standards devote an entire chapter to occupational exposures from sources in industry. Industrial products that could cause radiation exposure shall not be supplied to members of the public. Suppliers must ensure that products for industrial use - that could cause exposure in normal use, misuse, accident or loss - satisfy a long list of conditions. Additionally, industrial sources should be properly labelled and accompanied by clear and appropriate information on installation, use, maintenance, servicing, repair and recommended disposal procedures.

<TR>
<TD>
<SMALL>In 1995 the Board of Governors accepted the Director
General's plan to implement at any early date under existing
legal authority measures aimed at strengthening the present
system. These measures include:
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Broader access to information</B>
<DD>- through the provision by States of: an expanded declaration
on
the State or regional system of accounting and control of nuclear
material (SSAC); information on present nuclear activities; and
information on planned nuclear activities;
<DD>- through the taking of environmental samples; and
<DD>- through the improved analysis of information.
<P>
<DT><B>Greater physical access</B>
<DD>- through greater use of unannounced routine inspections.
<P>
<DT><B>Optimization of the present system</B>
<DD>- through the introduction of new safeguards measurement and
surveillance systems; and
<DD>- though increased co-operation with States and SSACs.
</DL>
<P>
In December 1995, the Board of Governors held an initial review
of the Secretariat's discussion paper on measures which would
require additional legal authority to implement.  The discussion
paper represents another step in the consultative process
designed to foster consensus on the required strengthening
measures.</SMALL>

REASSESSMENT OF A FORMER NUCLEAR WEAPON TEST SITE</B></TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD><SMALL>As a consequence of the nuclear weapons tests in the
1940s and 1950s, the inhabitants of the Bikini atoll (now part of
the Republic of the Marshall Islands) were evacuated. In the
early 1970s, US scientists advised the Bikinians that they could
return to the atoll without risk. A few years later, however, the
islanders had to be removed from Bikini again. The intake of
radioactive substances via the main diet -  coconut - had been
underestimated. 
<P>
Since then, several in-depth studies of the radiological
situation on and around the former test sites have been made. The
US Government sponsored long term studies, and the Marshall
Islands themselves financed a completely independent survey. Both
undertakings showed that the affected islands would, by now, be
safe to live on, providing the islanders did not rely exclusively
on local food. 
<P>
But some scepticism remained and the Marshall Islands, after
becoming a Member State of the Agency in 1994, asked for
international assistance in reviewing the situation. After
considerable preparatory work, an Advisory Group, set up by the
Agency and involving experts from Australia, France, Japan, New
Zealand, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, the USA and
WHO, together with a delegation from the people of Bikini, met in
Vienna in December. 
<P>
The panel concluded that the available data on the radiological
situation on the Bikini atoll were correct -  the different
studies, carried out independently of each other, had come to
essentially the same results. To further assure the Bikinians, it
was agreed that there will be additional radioactive
contamination tests of various local foods, carried out at the
Agency's laboratories at Seibersdorf. 
<P>
The Advisory Group concluded that the safe return to Bikini would
require measures to reduce the existing radioactivity in local
crops to meet the strict international safety standards. It was
the unanimous opinion of the experts that caesium remained the
only risk factor to the Bikinians. International standards in
this regard could be readily achieved by two main strategies: the
removal and replacement of contaminated soil; or the effective
chemical decontamination of the nutrients taken up by the plants
by fertilizing the soil with potassium which would be absorbed by
the plant roots and effectively block the residual radioactive
caesium.
<P>
The decision about a return to Bikini will ultimately have to be
made by the Marshall Islanders themselves. However, it is clear
that remedial measures are available and that after remedial
treatment the atoll could be re-occupied without
restriction.</SMALL>

ELECTRICITY, HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT:
COMPARATIVE ASSESSMENT IN SUPPORT OF DECISION MAKING</B>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD><SMALL>As a follow-up to the Agency s 1991 symposium in
Helsinki on <I>Electricity and the Environment</I>, an
international symposium on <I>Electricity, Health and the
Environment</I> was organized in Vienna in October by the Agency
and nine other international organizations<SUP>1</SUP>. The main
objective was to exchange information and enhance co-operation
between interested parties in the field of electricity demand
analysis and supply planning, aiming towards implementing
sustainable policies in the power sector, taking into account
economic, social, health and environmental factors. Topics
covered included data acquisition, the development of computer
models for the analysis and assessment of different energy
systems, the risks associated with emissions of CO<SUB>2</SUB>
and other greenhouse gases, the health effects of chemical
releases, the subjective perceptions of risk, and the inclusion
of external costs.
<P>
The symposium concluded that:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>- Much progress has been made since the Helsinki meeting
as a result of the fact that more data and better computer tools,
including those developed within the DECADES project, have become
available. What is needed now is to promote the use of these
tools in comparative assessment studies. This is being done
through technical co-operation projects.
<P>
<DD>- Nuclear power can, and already does, play an important
role in reducing CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions and other pollutants
from the electricity sector. Results were presented showing that
the health impacts from nuclear power plants are far lower than
those from coal fired plants. 
<P>
<DD>- Significant uncertainties still exist in a number of
areas, for example the risks associated with CO<SUB>2</SUB>
emissions and the effects of these emissions on the average
temperature, and the risks of small releases of chemical
substances. However, it was concluded that if greenhouse effects
are included in the overall assessment, hydro power and nuclear
power are the only currently available large scale energy sources
that have relatively low external costs.
<P>
<DD>- Positive messages about nuclear power are not getting
through to decision makers and the public, or at least are not
leading to a more supportive climate for nuclear power. It was
therefore recommended that efforts be made to present the results
from comparative assessment studies in a more transparent manner
so they can be used more readily in decision making processes and
communicated to the media and the public. It was suggested that
the DECADES project could provide a useful framework for
achieving greater international consistency in the approaches
used for comparative assessment and for reducing uncertainties in
the key data needed for such studies.

TAPPING GROUNDWATER RESOURCES IN THE CARACAS VALLEY</B>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD><SMALL>
The city of Caracas relies on treated surface water derived from
a number of reservoirs for its water supply. Increased demand as
a result of rapid growth in the city s population (now exceeding
5 million inhabitants), the poor condition of the water
distribution system and adverse climatic conditions have led to a
serious deficit in the drinking water supply. Additionally, water
losses from the distribution system have led to a rise in the
water level, making it necessary to pump groundwater to prevent
flooding of the underground transportation system. Exploitation
of the Caracas aquifer has long been considered as the best
approach to reducing the water deficit (currently 260 000
m<SUP>3</SUP> per day) and avoiding engineering problems in the
underground transport system and geotechnical problems in the
basements of many buildings.
<P>
In 1994, the Agency launched a special technical co-operation
project to provide key information on the potential and
properties of the Caracas aquifer as an additional source of
water. During the past year, hydrological, geophysical, chemical
and isotopic data were collected to characterize and identify the
sources of recharge to the aquifer, to study the dynamics of the
groundwater, and to evaluate the vulnerability to pollution of
different sectors of this aquifer located in an urban
environment. The information indicated the existence of two
groundwater subsystems: the shallow part of the aquifer,
characterized by groundwater with fast circulation and highly
vulnerable to pollution, and the deep part (below 50 m) with
older groundwater, better protected from pollution and with good
quality water for drinking purposes.
<P>
On the basis of the information obtained through this study, the
location and design of new wells was proposed. Fifty new wells
will be drilled during 1996 and it is expected that they will
contribute to reducing the present water restrictions (up to 12
hours a day in some districts), providing more than 112 000
m<SUP>3</SUP> per day (around 43% of the existing water deficit).
These wells, together with other measures to reduce wastage and
leakage to groundwater, will improve the availability of water to
the population, especially in some outlying areas of the city
where water is still distributed by trucks. Monitoring of the
quality of the water pumped from the Caracas aquifer will be
carried out by a laboratory being upgraded with Agency
assistance.</SMALL></TD>

French Test Condemned
<P>
Exasperated disgust was Acting Prime Minister Don McKinnon's
reaction to the news of this morning's nuclear test in French
Polynesia. 
<P>
"It is utterly disappointing and extremely frustrating that
France in the face of so much international opposition should
persist with these tests.  We deplore this latest blast.
<P>
"It sends precisely the wrong signal to a world weary of the
arms race and of the spread of nuclear weapons.

"France has announced its intention to sign on to the Treaty
of Rarotonga banning testing in our region and we welcome that
unreservedly.
<P>
"But they are now negating the effect of that decision by
persisting with this test series.
<P>
"I call again on President Chirac to rethink his commitment to
this test series and to put and end to it right now.
<P>
"He must be aware of the harm being done to France's standing
in the world.  This has been clearly signalled at a number of
meetings including the Auckland CHOGM, the South Pacific
Forum, and most recently at the United Nations General
Assembly," Mr McKinnon said.
<P>
Mr McKinnon stressed New Zealand would continue to express its
opposition to France's policy
<P>
"It is instructive that so may of France's closest neighbours
have reacted with equal vigour and disgust to the tests.  This
was very much in evidence at the recent UN vote on nuclear
testing.
<P>
"I have delivered a short and sharp message to Ambassador Le
Blanc.  France is being left in absolutely no doubt about the
strength of New Zealand feelings at its actions", Mr McKinnon
concluded.
<P>
Today's test, at Mururoa, was around 15 kt and is the fourth
in the current series.

<LI>On 5 January 1996, the Director General received a
communication dated 4 January 1996 from the Permanent Mission
of Australia transmitting a Statement of 28 December 1995 by
the Acting Prime Minister of Australia on "The Fifth French
Nuclear Test".

<H3>Statement by the Acting Prime Minister, the Hon Kim Beazley
MP
<P>
The Fifth French Nuclear Test
</H3>
</CENTER>
<P>
I strongly condemn the latest French nuclear test at Mururoa
Atoll which sends the worst possible message for the new year
to the people of the South Pacific.
<P>
The fifth test is a reckless action by the French Government
which ignores the wishes of the people of the region and
demonstrates an arrogant disregard for the recent resolution
adopted at the United Nations calling for an immediate end to
nuclear testing.
<P>
It also places unnecessary strain on negotiations for a
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
<P>
Conducting five tests in less than four months is completely
contrary to the undertaking the French Government gave at the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review and Extension
Conference in May of this year to exercise 'utmost restraint'
in nuclear testing.
<P>
This situation reinforces the need to consider practical
measures for eliminating nuclear weapons.
<P>
The Canberra Commission on the elimination of nuclear weapons
will begin its deliberations in Canberra from 23 to 25 January
1996 to advance this goal.
<P>
This will be the first in a series of meetings by the
Commission to promote fresh thinking on steps necessary for a
nuclear weapon-free world.
<P>
I call on the French Government to make a fresh start to 1996
by immediately ending its nuclear weapons tests.
<P>
This would be an important contribution to the final round of
negotiations for a CTBT and would help restore France's
tarnished international credentials.

communication of 25 January 1996 from the Resident Representative
of New Zealand transmitting a Statement by the Prime Minister
of New Zealand concerning the "Fifth French Nuclear Test" in the

Text of Press Statement by the Prime Minister of New Zealand
Concerning the Fifth French Nuclear Test in the South Pacific
</H3>
</CENTER>
<P>
"France is its own worst enemy," the Prime Minister said today
following news of the fifth French nuclear test in the South
Pacific.
<P>
"France has defied world opinion, through continued testing. Its
reputation in the Pacific is at an all time low" said the Prime
Minister. "When the tests are over France will have to rebuild
its credentials in the region. It has a long way to go."
<P>
The Prime Minister confirmed that the French Ambassador in
Wellington will once again be called in to receive a strong
protest. "We will remind France that the United Nations General
Assembly, in a formal Resolution, has just deplored continued
testing, and called for its immediate end. France's actions are
unacceptable. This latest test flies in the face of world public
opinion which is moving, ever more firmly, towards the view that
nuclear weapons should be eliminated."
<P>
"I hope this fifth test will be the last" the Prime Minister
said. "If France is to rebuild its standing in this part of the
world, it must start by announcing the end of its misguided
testing programme. I, and all New Zealanders, now call on
President Chirac to take that decision, without further
delay."

<LI>The text of the exchange of Notes, dated 6 July 1995 and 29
September 1995 respectively, between the IAEA and the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs of Austria regarding Section 4(b) of the
Headquarters Agreement which allows the IAEA "to establish and
operate such additional radio and other telecommunications
facilities as may be specified by supplemental agreement ...." is
reproduced in this document for the information of all Members of

<P>
<LI>This further supplemental agreement entered into force on 29

</OL>
<P>
<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1>
<P>
The Secretariat of the International Atomic Energy Agency
presents its compliments to the Federal Ministry of Foreign
Affairs of the Republic of Austria and has the honour to refer to
Section 4(b) of the Agreement between the Republic of Austria and
the International Atomic Energy Agency regarding the Headquarters
of the International Atomic Energy Agency, dated 11 December
1957. Section 4(b) of the Headquarters Agreement provides that
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"The IAEA may establish and operate such additional radio and
other telecommunication facilities as may be specified by
supplemental agreement between the IAEA and the appropriate
Austrian authorities."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The Secretariat desires to demonstrate at the Austria Centre
Vienna, in conjunction with its General Conference, a very small
aperture terminal (VSAT) satellite system.  The terminal will be
operated during the week prior to the General Conference
beginning 11 September 1995 for testing purposes and during the
General Conference from 18 to 23 September for the demonstration.
<P>
The Secretariat also desires to conduct a longer-term
demonstration of an international verification concept, based on
a VSAT network.  The VSAT system which is the same system used
for the aforementioned Conference demonstration, will be
relocated to a position at the Headquarters Area and will be
operated from October 1995 until January 1996.
<P>
The Agency will ensure that:
<P>
<OL TYPE=a>
<LI>The equipment is used only for the purpose indicated in this
Note, taking all appropriate steps to prevent misuse of the
equipment, in particular by third parties;
<P>
<LI>The appropriate Austrian authorities are notified of any
change in the design of or manner of operating the equipment;
<P>
<LI>The personnel responsible for operating the equipment receive
no communications other than those intended for it;
<P>
<LI>The equipment is not used to link up with other
telecommunication facilities; and
<P>
<LI>The equipment does not disturb other telecommunication
facilities in their operation;
<P>
<LI>The operation of the equipment will be stopped for compelling
reasons at the request of the Austrian authorities.
</OL>
<P>
The Agency would be grateful if the competent Austrian
Authorities could agree to the establishment and operation of the
equipment referred to above and has the honour to propose that
this proposal, together with the Ministry's note of reply, shall
constitute a supplemental agreement pursuant to Section 4(b) of
the Headquarters Agreement.  The Agency has the honour to propose
further that this supplemental agreement shall have effect as of
the date of the Ministry's note of reply.
<P>
The Secretariat of the International Atomic Energy Agency avails
itself of this opportunity to renew to the Federal Ministry of
Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Austria the assurances of its
highest consideration.

<LI>On 7 February 1996, the Director General received a
communication of 6 February 1996 from the Resident
Representative of Australia transmitting Statements made by
the Prime Minister of Australia on 28 January 1996 about the
sixth nuclear test by France at Fangataufa and on 30 January
1996 about the subsequent announcement of France's commitment
to sign the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty and a

<P>
<H3>The Sixth French Nuclear Test</H3>
<P>
Statement by the Prime Minister of Australia, the Hon P J
Keating MP
<P>
The French Government is to be strongly condemned for this
latest test at Fangataufa and for conducting it during
negotiations for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which are
entering the final critical stages in Geneva.
<P>
Such an irresponsible action sends the worst possible signal
to nations that aspire to possess nuclear weapons, and damages
efforts to advance nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation.
<P>
Australia will continue to press France to end its testing
program immediately and respond to the legitimate demands of
South Pacific nations as expressed in the declaration of the
meeting of South Pacific Environment Ministers, which
Australia initiated and hosted, on 17 August 1995.
<P>
This declaration called for an immediate end to testing of
nuclear weapons in the South Pacific and the closing of
associated facilities, except those required for future
environmental monitoring; for France to accept full and
exclusive responsibility for any adverse impacts from French
testing on the South Pacific environment and people; and to
provide access by the international community to all French
scientific data and to the testing sites themselves to enable
an independent and comprehensive assessment of the effects of
testing.  If, as the French Government claims, it seeks to
retain a role in the South Pacific then it must respond
positively to the demands of the nations which it would call
neighbours and friends.
<P>
I call on the French Government to announce immediately the
cessation of its testing program, in line with statements by
President Chirac; to sign without delay the Protocols of the
South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty; and to put all of its
energy towards the successful conclusion of the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty this year.

<H3>Statement by the Prime Minister of Australia, 
the Hon P J Keating MP</H3>
<P>
The Prime Minister, Mr Paul Keating, has welcomed President
Chirac's renewed commitment to sign the South Pacific Nuclear
Free Zone Treaty and a genuinely comprehensive test ban treaty
(CTBT) in 1996.
<P>
"The announcement by the French government that it has
concluded its nuclear testing program in the South Pacific
brings to an end a program which should never have started, "
Mr Keating said.
<P>
"Those six tests put at grave risk the cause of international
disarmament and nuclear nonproliferation, flew in the face of
France's international obligations and posed unacceptable
risks to the people of the South Pacific."
<P>
Mr Keating said that, like the other members of the South
Pacific Forum, Australia wanted France to close its testing
facilities, retaining only those required for environmental
monitoring.
<P>
"Australia also wants France to provide access for the
international community to all data and sites so an independent
and comprehensive assessment of the effects of its testing can
be made."
<P>
"Beyond the immediate and urgent need to conclude a CTBT this
year, Australia now looks for a new commitment form France and
the other nuclear weapon states to meet their obligations
under Article VI of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty for
genuine steps towards complete nuclear disarmament," he said.

"This sixth test must surely be the last," the Prime Minster,
Rt Hon J B Bolger, said today.  He was commenting on the news
that France had conducted a sixth nuclear test.
<P>
"France's insistence on continued testing has been
outrageous,"  the Prime Minster said.  "The overwhelming
opposition to their testing programme can only be strengthened
by the latest reports of radiation leakages at Mururoa as a
result of earlier tests."
<P>
"France's commitment to a CTBT and to sign the South Pacific
Nuclear Free Zone are welcome and as evidence of good faith I
invite President Chirac to move immediately on both issues."
<P>
The Prime Minister said the French Ambassador would yet again
be called in to receive the Government's strong protest and be
told that it is our firm expectation that this test will be
the last.  The message would also be delivered in Paris.
<P>
"The aim of the world must be to stop nuclear testing for ever
and as a step in that direction, France must close its testing
sites in the Pacific for all time."

<H3>End of French Nuclear Testing Welcomed</H3>
</CENTER>
<P>
"New Zealand's work for nuclear disarmament will continue",
Prime Minster, Rt Hon J B Bolger, said today following news
that the French had concluded nuclear tests in the Pacific.
<P>
"Like many New Zealanders, I have mixed feelings over the
French announcement.  The end of testing is welcome, but
France should never have resumed testing in our region in the
first place."
<P>
"France's testing in the Pacific, in defiance of world
opinion, has cast a shadow over its relations with the region. 
France will have to work hard to regain lost ground."
<P>
"Now that testing is finished, my government stands ready to
commence the resumption of normal relations with France.  We
want to see France play a positive role in our region, as it
does in international affairs generally.  But the restoration
of France's standing in the Pacific will necessarily be a
gradual process."
<P>
"France's early signature of the South Pacific Nuclear Free
Zone Treaty will be an important first step towards
normalising relations", the Prime Minister said.  "Along with
other Pacific countries, we also await confirmation of the
permanent closure of France's nuclear test sites in the
Pacific."
<P>
"Uncertainties remain over the long term impact of testing
programme on the fragile marine environment of Mururoa and
Fangataufa atolls", Mr Bolger said.  "I hope that the
forthcoming scientific study, though the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) will be able to provide answers to the
many questions we have in this area."  The participation in the
IAEA exercise of Professor Alan Poletti, Head of Physics at
Auckland University, and the National Radiation Laboratory in
Christchurch, means New Zealand will be directly involved in
the study, and the assessment of its results."
<P>
"Welcome as it is, the end of French testing only highlights
the tasks that lie ahead for disarmament"  the Prime Minister
continued.  "We once again urge China to put an immediate stop
to its nuclear weapons testing programmes."
<P>
New Zealand will also continue to urge the nuclear powers to
commit themselves to the elimination of nuclear weapons.
<P>
"We want the nuclear powers to put their arsenals on the table
to negotiate their eventual elimination, " the Prime Minister
said.  "As a first step, the Prime Minister concluded, "New
Zealand will continue to work towards the conclusion this year
of a comprehensive test ban treaty to bring a permanent end to
nuclear test explosions."

</CENTER>
<P> 
<DL>
<OL>        
<DT><B><I>OBJECTIVE</I></B>
<P>
<LI>With the objective of averting the proliferation of nuclear
weapons, suppliers have had under consideration procedures in
relation to the transfer of certain equipment,  material, and
related technology that could make a major contribution to a
"nuclear explosive activity" or an "unsafeguarded nuclear
fuel-cycle activity." In this connection, suppliers have agreed
on the following principles, common definitions, and an export
control list of equipment, material, and related technology. The
Guidelines are not designed to impede international cooperation
as long as such cooperation will not contribute to a nuclear
explosive activity or an unsafeguarded nuclear fuel-cycle
activity. Suppliers intend to implement the Guidelines in
accordance with national legislation and relevant international
commitments.
<P>
<DT><B><I>BASIC PRINCIPLE</I></B>
<P>         
<LI>Suppliers should not authorize transfers of equipment,

<DL>
<DD>-- for use in a non-nuclear-weapon state in a nuclear
explosive activity or an unsafeguarded nuclear fuel cycle
activity, or
<P>         
<DD>-- in general, when there is an unacceptable risk of
diversion to such an activity, or when the transfers are contrary
to the objective of averting the proliferation of nuclear
weapons.
</DL>
<P>
<DT><B><I>EXPLANATION OF TERMS</I></B>
<P>         
<LI> (a) "Nuclear explosive activity" includes research on or

the relevant facility or installation, existing or future, when
it contains any source or special fissionable material; or of any
heavy water production plant where there is no obligation to
accept IAEA safeguards on any nuclear material produced by or
used in connection with any heavy water produced therefrom; or
where any such obligation is not met.
</DL>
<P>
<DT><B><I>ESTABLISHMENT OF EXPORT LICENSING PROCEDURES</I></B>
<P>         
<LI>Suppliers should establish export licensing procedures for
the transfer of equipment, material, and related technology
identified in the Annex. These procedures should include
enforcement measures for violations. In considering whether to

application of other conditions for transfer that it may consider
necessary in addition to those provided for in paragraph 5 of the
Guidelines.
<P>         
<LI>In furtherance of the effective implementation of the
Guidelines, suppliers should, as necessary and appropriate,
exchange relevant information and consult with other states
adhering to the Guidelines.
<P>         
<LI>In the interest of international peace and security, the
adherence of all states to the Guidelines would be welcome.

</DL>
<P> 
<DL>        
<DT>Description clarification:
<P>         
<DD>The detonators of concern all utilize a small electrical
conductor (bridge, bridge wire, or foil) that explosively
vaporizes when a fast, high-current electrical pulse is passed
through it. In nonslapper types, the exploding conductor starts a
chemical detonation in a contacting high-explosive material such
as PETN (pentaerythritoltetranitrate). In slapper detonators, the
explosive vaporization of the electrical conductor drives a
"flyer" or "slapper" across a gap, and the impact of the slapper
on an explosive starts a chemical detonation. The slapper in some
designs is driven by magnetic force. The term "exploding foil"
detonator may refer to either an EB or a slapper-type detonator.
Also, the word "initiator" is sometimes used in place of the word
"detonator".

are

<OL>
<LI>The operator of a nuclear installation shall be liable for
nuclear damage upon proof that such damage has been caused by a
nuclear incident -
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(a)  in his nuclear installation; or
<P>
<DD>(b)  involving nuclear material coming from or originating in
his nuclear installation, and occurring - 
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(i)  before liability with regard to nuclear incidents

been unloaded from the means of transport by which it has arrived
in the territory of that non-Contracting State;
</DL>
<P>
<DD>(c)  involving nuclear material sent to his nuclear
installation, and occurring -
<P>
<dL>
<DD>(i)  after liability with regard to nuclear incidents
involving the nuclear material has been assumed by him, pursuant
to the express terms of a contract in writing, from the operator
of another nuclear installation;
<P>
<DD>(ii) in the absence of such express terms, after he has taken
charge of the nuclear material; or
<P>
<DD>(iii)     after he has taken charge of the nuclear material
from a person operating a nuclear reactor with which a means of
transport is equipped for use as a source of power, whether for
propulsion thereof or for any other purpose; but
<P>
<DD>(iv) where the nuclear material has, with the written consent
of the operator, been sent from a person within the territory of
a non-Contracting State, only after it has been loaded on the
means of transport by which it is to be carried from the
territory of that State;
</DL>
</DL>
<P>
provided that, if nuclear damage is caused by a nuclear incident
occurring in a nuclear installation and involving nuclear
material stored therein incidentally to the carriage of such
material, the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph
shall not apply where another operator or person is solely liable
pursuant to the provisions of sub-paragraph (b) or (c) of
this paragraph.
<P>
<LI>The Installation State may provide by legislation that, in
accordance with such terms as may be specified therein, a carrier
of nuclear material or a person handling radioactive waste may,
at his request and with the consent of the operator concerned, be
designated or recognized as operator in the place of that
operator in respect of such nuclear material or radioactive waste
respectively.  In this case such carrier or such person shall be
considered, for all the purposes of this Convention, as an
operator of a nuclear installation situated within the territory
of that State.

<P>
<LI>   (a)  Where nuclear damage engages the liability of more
than one operator, the operators involved shall, in so far as the
damage attributable to each operator is not reasonably separable,
be jointly and severally liable.
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(b)  Where a nuclear incident occurs in the course of
carriage of nuclear material, either in one and the same means of
transport, or, in the case of storage incidental to the carriage,
in one and the same nuclear installation, and causes nuclear
damage which engages the liability of more than one operator, the
total liability shall not exceed the highest amount applicable
with respect to any one of them pursuant to Article V.
<P>
<DD>(c)  In neither of the cases referred to in sub-paragraphs
(a) and (b) of this paragraph shall the liability of any one
operator exceed the amount applicable with respect to him
pursuant to Article V.

where several nuclear installations of one and the same operator
are involved in one nuclear incident, such operator shall be
liable in respect of each nuclear installation involved up to the
amount applicable with respect to him pursuant to Article V.
<P>
<LI>Except as otherwise provided in this Convention, no person
other than the operator shall be liable for nuclear damage. 
This, however, shall not affect the application of any
international convention in the field of transport in force or
open for signature, ratification or accession at the date on
which this Convention is opened for signature.
<P>
<LI>No person shall be liable for any loss or damage which is not
nuclear damage pursuant to sub-paragraph (k) of paragraph 1 of
Article I but which could have been included as such pursuant to
sub-paragraph (k) (ii) of that paragraph.
<P>
<LI>Direct action shall lie against the person furnishing
financial security pursuant to Article VII, if the law of the
competent court so provides.

<B>ARTICLE III</B>
</CENTER>
<P>

The operator liable in accordance with this Convention shall
provide the carrier with a certificate issued by or on behalf of
the insurer or other financial guarantor furnishing the financial
security required pursuant to Article VII.  The certificate shall
state the name and address of that operator and the amount, type
and duration of the security, and these statements may not be
disputed by the person by whom or on whose behalf the certificate
was issued.  The certificate shall also indicate the nuclear
material in respect of which the security applies and shall
include a statement by the competent public authority of the
Installation State that the person named is an operator within
the meaning of this Convention.
<P>
<CENTER>
<B>ARTICLE IV</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The liability of the operator for nuclear damage under this
Convention shall be absolute.
<P>
<LI>If the operator proves that the nuclear damage resulted
wholly or partly either from the gross negligence of the person
suffering the damage or from an act or omission of such person
done with intent to cause damage, the competent court may, if its
law so provides, relieve the operator wholly or partly from his
obligation to pay compensation in respect of the damage suffered
by such person.
<P>
<LI>(a)  No liability under this Convention shall attach to an
operator for nuclear damage caused by a nuclear incident directly
due to an act of armed conflict, hostilities, civil war or
insurrection.
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(b)  Except in so far as the law of the Installation State
may provide to the contrary, the operator shall not be liable for
nuclear damage caused by a nuclear incident directly due to a
grave natural disaster of an exceptional character.
</DL>
<P>
<LI>Whenever both nuclear damage and damage other than nuclear
damage have been caused by a nuclear incident or jointly by a
nuclear incident and one or more other occurrences, such other
damage shall, to the extent that it is not reasonably separable
from the nuclear damage, be deemed, for the purposes of this
Convention, to be nuclear damage caused by that nuclear incident.

Where,  however, damage is caused jointly by a nuclear incident
covered by this Convention and by an emission of ionizing
radiation not covered by it, nothing in this Convention shall
limit or otherwise affect the liability, either as regards
any person suffering nuclear damage or by way of recourse or
contribution, of any person who may be held liable in connection
with that emission of ionizing radiation.
<P>
<LI>The operator shall not be liable under this Convention for
nuclear damage - 
<P>
<DL>

<DD>(a)  to the nuclear installation itself or to any property on
the site of that installation which is used or to be used in
connection with that installation; or
<P>
<DD>(b)  to the means of transport upon which the nuclear
material involved was at the time of the nuclear incident.
</DL>
<P>
<LI>Any Installation State may provide by legislation that
sub-paragraph (b) of paragraph 5 of this Article shall not apply,
provided that in no case shall the liability of the operator
in respect of nuclear damage, other than nuclear damage to the
means of transport, be reduced to less than US $5 million for any
one nuclear incident.
<P>
<LI>Nothing in this Convention shall affect -
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(a)  the liability of any individual for nuclear damage for
which the operator, by virtue of paragraph 3 or 5 of this
Article, is not liable under this Convention and which that
individual caused by an act or omission done with intent to cause
damage; or
<P>
<DD>(b)  the liability outside this Convention of the operator
for nuclear damage for which, by virtue of sub-paragraph (b) of
paragraph 5 of this Article, he is not liable under this
Convention.

Installation State to not less than US $5 million for any one
nuclear incident.
<P>
<LI>Any limits of liability which may be established pursuant to
this Article shall not include any interest or costs awarded by a
court in actions for compensation of nuclear damage.
<P>
<LI>The United States dollar referred to in this Convention is a
unit of account equivalent to the value of the United States
dollar in terms of gold on 29 April 1963, that is to say US

<LI>Rights of compensation under this Convention shall be
extinguished if an action is not brought within ten years from
the date of the nuclear incident.  If, however, under the law
of the Installation State the liability of the operator is
covered by insurance or other financial security or by State
funds for a period longer than ten years, the law of the
competent court may provide that rights of compensation against
the operator shall only be extinguished after a period which may
be longer than ten years, but shall not be longer than the period
for which his liability is so covered under the law of the
Installation State.  Such extension of the extinction period
shall in no case affect rights of compensation under this
Convention of any person who has brought an action for loss of
life or personal injury against the operator before the expiry of
the aforesaid period of ten years.
<P>
<LI>Where nuclear damage is caused by a nuclear incident
involving nuclear material which at the time of the nuclear
incident was stolen, lost, jettisoned or abandoned, the period
established pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article shall be
computed from the date of that nuclear incident, but the period
shall in no case exceed a period of twenty years from the
date of the theft, loss, jettison or abandonment.
<P>
<LI>The law of the competent court may establish a period of
extinction or prescription of not less than three years from the
date on which the person suffering nuclear damage had
knowledge or should have had knowledge of the damage and of the
operator liable for the damage, provided that the period 
established pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article
shall not be exceeded.
<P>
<LI>Unless the law of the competent court otherwise provides, any
person who claims to have suffered nuclear damage and who has
brought an action for compensation within the period applicable
pursuant to this Article may amend his claim to take into account
any aggravation of the damage, even after the expiry of that
period, provided that final judgment has not been entered.
<P>
<LI>Where jurisdiction is to be determined pursuant to
sub-paragraph (b) of paragraph 3 of Article XI and a request has
been made within the period applicable pursuant to this
Article to any one of the Contracting Parties empowered so to
determine, but the time remaining after such determination is
less than six months, the period within which an action
may be brought shall be six months, reckoned from the date of
such determination.

<P>
<OL>
<LI>The operator shall be required to maintain insurance or other
financial security covering his liability for nuclear damage in
such amount, of such type and in such terms as
the Installation State shall specify.  The Installation State
shall ensure the payment of claims for compensation for nuclear
damage which have been established against the operator by
providing the necessary funds to the extent that the yield of
insurance or other financial security is inadequate to satisfy
such claims, but not in excess of the limit, if any, established
pursuant to Article V.
<P>
<LI>Nothing in paragraph 1 of this Article shall require a
Contracting Party or any of its constituent sub-divisions, such
as States or Republics, to maintain insurance or other financial
security to cover their liability as operators.
<P>
<LI>The funds provided by insurance, by other financial security
or by the Installation State pursuant to paragraph 1 of this
Article shall be exclusively available for compensation
due under this Convention.
<P>
<LI>No insurer or other financial guarantor shall suspend or
cancel the insurance or other financial security provided
pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article without giving notice in
writing of at least two months to the competent public authority
or, in so far as such insurance or other financial security
relates to the carriage of nuclear material, during the
period of the carriage in question.

by virtue of such systems against the operator liable shall be
determined, subject to the provisions of this Convention, by the
law of the Contracting Party in which such systems have been
established, or by the regulations of the intergovernmental
organization which has established such systems.

<LI>   (a)  If a person who is a national of a Contracting Party,
other than the operator, has paid compensation for nuclear damage
under an international convention or under the law of a
non-Contracting State, such person shall, up to the amount which
he has paid, acquire by subrogation the rights under this   
Convention of the person so compensated.  No rights shall be so
acquired by any person to the extent that the operator has a
right of recourse against such person under this Convention.

                  from the Permanent Mission of Ukraine</H3>
</CENTER>
<P>


     The Permanent Mission of Ukraine to the International
Organizations in Vienna presents its
compliments to the Director General of the International Atomic
Energy Agency and has the honour
to provide information on its Government's nuclear export
policies and practices.
<P>
     The Government of Ukraine has decided that, when considering
the transfer of nuclear
material, equipment and related technology, including
nuclear-related dual-use equipment, material
and related technology, it will act in accordance with the
provisions of INFCIRC/254/Rev.2/Part
1 and INFCIRC/254/Rev.2/Part 2.
<P>
     In reaching this decision, the Government of the Ukraine is
fully aware of the need to
contribute to economic development while avoiding contributing in
any way to dangers of a
proliferation of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive
devices, and of the need to remove non-
proliferation assurances from the field of commercial
competition.
<P>
     The Government of Ukraine hopes that other Governments may
also decide to base their
own export policies regarding the transfer of nuclear material,
equipment and related technology,
including nuclear-related dual-use equipment, material and
related technology, upon these
documents.
<P>
     The Government of the Ukraine requests that the Director
General of the International
Atomic Energy Agency should circulate the text of this letter to
all Member States for their
information and as a demonstration of support by the Government
of Ukraine for the Agency's non-
proliferation objectives and safeguards activities.
<P>
     The Permanent Mission of Ukraine to the international
organizations in Vienna avails itself
of this opportunity to renew to the Director General of the
International Atomic Energy Agency
the assurances of its highest consideration.

Dear Sir,
<P>
     On behalf of the Arab States Members of the Agency and
members of the Board, I wish
to express the concern felt by the Arab Governments and peoples
at the news and reports
concerning the potential danger of leakage of nuclear radiation
at the Israeli Dimona reactor and
the hazards of storage and burial of atomic waste in the area of
the reactor, for they feel that
the continued existence of the nuclear reactor without any real
knowledge about the extent of its
safety and also the nuclear waste burial sites in the area pose a
threat to security, life and the
environment.
<P>
<OL>
     The following are among the factors that increase the
intensity of this concern:
<P>
<LI>Persistence of news and reports, including reports from
Israeli sources, about radiation
leakage at the reactor and the nuclear waste burial sites in the
area of the reactor;
<P>
<LI>The reactor is old and has reached the end of its assumed
lifetime;
<P>
<LI>The region is subject to earthquakes and earth tremors;
<P>
<LI>Monitoring of radiation leakage into groundwater across the
borders will require a long
time before such leakage is deleted in the neighbouring States,
making it technically difficult to
determine, on the basis of measurements performed outside
Israel's borders, that there was no
accident which might have devastating consequences in the future.

<BR>
His Excellency Dr. H. Blix
<BR>
Director General
<BR>
IAEA, Vienna
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The continuation of Israeli nuclear activities outside
international control does not provide the
least assurance about the nuclear safety of these activities, and
there is no doubt that any
nuclear accident in Israel will have transboundary effects and
give rise to hazards beyond its
borders.  For this reason, it is necessary that there should be
at least a minimum of
transparency in the Israeli nuclear activities and that Israel
should become a party to the Treaty
on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to a safeguards
agreement with the Agency.
<P>
It is therefore requested that necessary steps be taken on your
part to inform the Agency's
Member States of the extent of the concern felt by the Arab
region as a result of these
activities.  The Agency is also requested to make contacts with a
view to carrying out the
necessary technical studies to measure the radiation level at the
site of the Dimona reactor and
in its neighbourhood and at the nuclear waste burial sites in the
area in an endeavour to prevent
the potential hazards of nuclear radiation leakage, and to submit
a report thereon to the Board.
<P>
In this connection, I should like to point out that the potential
danger from any nuclear accident
would extend beyond the region.  The Chernobyl accident and its
consequences certainly
continue to be a source of concern to the world and illustrate
the real importance of nuclear
safety.
<P>
In view of the urgency and importance of this matter, we hope
that necessary steps will be
taken without delay, and at the same time we request you to
circulate this letter to the Member
States of the Agency as an official document.
<P>
With kind regards,

Text of the Director General's Reply to the Communication from the Resident Representative
of Saudi Arabia to the International Atomic Energy Agency</B>
</CENTER>
<P>         
Excellency,
<P>
I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated 24 April 1996
concerning the Israeli Dimona Reactor. As requested, your letter has been
circulated for the information of Member States (INFCIRC/507, 8 May 1996).
<P>
As you are aware, the IAEA has been endeavouring to establish internationally
binding legal norms in the field of nuclear safety. The Nuclear Safety Convention
relevant to nuclear power reactors has recently been concluded and it is hoped that it will
enter into force sometime this year. A Convention on the Safe Management of Radioactive
Waste is under active preparation by an international technic a] and legal group of experts
from the Agency's Member States. At present the Agency's role is limited to providing
advisory services, facilitating exchange of information and developing safety standards.
These standards, which are recommendatory in nature, are not, however, legally binding
upon the Member States. It follows that, unless requested and authorized by a Member State,
the Agency has no legal authority to make radiological measurements within a State or
intervene, even in cases of nuclear accidents except with regard to an Agency project.
<P>         
The Agency has been entrusted with certain responsibilities under the Convention
on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident. Under the terms of that Convention,
Parties to the Convention are obliged to inform the IAEA and potentially affected States,
either directly or through the Agency, of a possible or actual transboundary radioactive
release that could be of radiological safety significance. No such notification has been
received from Israel, as Party to the Early Notification Convention, relating to the Dimona
Research Reactor.
<P>

<P>
In view of media reports brought to our attention on a leak from the reactor, the
Agency on 4 April 1996 approached the competent authorities in Israel to ask them
to comment on these reports. As a consequence of that enquiry, the Israeli Atomic
Energy Commission informed the Agency on 12 April 1996 that "The Ministry of the
Environment [of Israel] monitors the air, water and ground outside the perimeter of the
Nuclear Research Centre Negev (NRCN) and to this day no radioactive leakage endangering
the population has been detected. NRCN monitoring inside its perimeter ensures the same
results" and that "the radioactive waste at the NRCN does not endanger the population, the
environment and water sources. All the waste is stored safely according to the strictest
international criteria and is constantly monitored. No contamination was ever detected".
<P>         
Please accept, Sir, the assurances of my highest consideration.

Moscow, 19-20 April 1996</H3>
</CENTER>
<P>
As requested by the Resident Representatives to the International Atomic Energy
Agency of France and the Russian Federation, the two States - Co-Chairmen of the summit
meeting held in Moscow from 19-20 April 1996, the text of the Moscow Nuclear Safety and
Security Summit Declaration is being circulated:
<P>
<CENTER>
<H3>Moscow Nuclear Safety and Security Summit Declaration 
<BR>
(Moscow, 20 April 1996)
</H3>
</CENTER>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The end of the cold war and the political and economic reforms in Russia have opened
a new era in our relationship and have provided the international community with real
possibilities for cooperation in the fields of nuclear safety and security.  The Moscow meeting
is an important step in the realization of these objectives. We are determined, at this summit
and beyond, to work together to ensure the safety of nuclear power and to promote greater
security for nuclear materials.
<P>
<LI>We are committed to give an absolute priority to safety in the use of nuclear energy. As
we approach the tenth anniversary of the Chernobyl accident, it is our shared objective that
such a catastrophe cannot reoccur.
<P>
We are ready to cooperate among ourselves so that the use of nuclear energy is conducted
all over the world consistently with fundamental principles of nuclear safety.  Further, we are
committed to measures which will enable nuclear power, already a significant contributor to
electricity supply in those countries choosing to exploit it, to continue in the next century to
play an important role in meeting future world energy demand consistent with the goal of
sustainable development agreed at the Rio Conference in 1992.
<P>
We recognize the importance of openness and transparency to obtain public trust which is
a key factor for the use of nuclear energy.
<P>
<LI>The security of all nuclear material is an essential part of the responsible and peaceful
use of nuclear energy.  In particular, the safe management of fissile material, including
material resulting from the dismantling of nuclear weapons, is imperative, not least as a
safeguard against any risk of illicit trafficking in nuclear materials.
<P>
<LI>In the spirit of the decisions adopted during the New-York Conference of May 1995 on
review and extension of the Non Proliferation Treaty (NPT), including the Decision on
principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, we will increase our
cooperation in the field of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament i.a. by promoting
universal adherence to the NPT, working vigorously to strengthen the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards system and through effective and responsible export
control measures.  We are issuing a separate text on a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban
Treaty (CTBT).  We renew our commitment to the immediate commencement and early
conclusion of negotiations on a non-discriminatory and universally applicable convention
banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive
devices.
<P>
<B>Nuclear Safety</B>
<P>
<LI>Recognizing that the prime responsibility for nuclear safety rests with national 
governments,   it is of the first importance to continue to enhance international collaborative
efforts to promote a    high level of nuclear safety worldwide.
<P>
<B>Safety of Civilian Nuclear Reactors</B>
<P>
<LI>Nuclear safety has to prevail over all other considerations.  We reaffirm our commitment
to the highest internationally recognized safety level for the siting, design, construction,
operation and regulation of nuclear power installations.
<P>
<LI>The promotion of an effective nuclear safety culture in each country with nuclear
installations is essential to that end.
<P>
<LI>Sustainable nuclear safety also requires a supportive economic and legal environment
whereby both operators and national regulatory bodies can fully assume their independent
responsibilities.
<P>
<LI>Nuclear safety can also be enhanced by greater international transparency in nuclear
power activities, in particular by means of peer reviews, and this should lead to existing
reactors which do not meet current safety requirements being brought to an acceptable level
of safety or ceasing operation.
<P>
<LI>The adoption of the Convention on Nuclear Safety, which reaffirms these fundamental,
safety principles is a major accomplishment in this field.  We urge all countries to sign this
Convention and to complete internal procedures to join so that the Convention can be brought
into force expeditiously certainly before the end of 1996.
<P>
<LI>National efforts have been made in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the
Newly Independent States to improve nuclear safety levels, often in cooperation with
multilateral and bilateral programmes.  In this regard, we acknowledge these important efforts
to upgrade reactor safety and improve safety culture, but note that further substantial progress
is still required.  We reaffirm our commitment to cooperate fully for this purpose.
<P>
<B><I>Nuclear Liability</I></B>
<P>
<LI>An effective nuclear liability regime must assure adequate compensation to victims of,
and for damage caused by, nuclear accidents.  In addition, to secure the degree of private
sector involvement needed to undertake vital safety improvements, the regime should at the
same time protect industrial suppliers from unwarranted legal action.
<P>
<LI>The essential principles in this area are the exclusive and strict liability of the operator
of the nuclear installations and ensuring needed financial security for adequate compensation.
<P>
<LI>It is essential that countries with nuclear installations that have not yet done so establish
an effective regime for liability for nuclear damage corresponding to these principles.
<P>
<LI>It is important to work together on enhancing the international regime of liability for
nuclear damage with a view to ensuring that it will attract wide adherence and accommodate
any state which may wish to become a party.  We encourage the experts to make further
progress to this end.  In this connection, the reinforcement of regional cooperation is
welcomed. 
<P>
<B><I>Energy Sector Strategies in transition countries</I></B>
<P>
<LI>Efficient market-oriented strategies for energy sector reform are essential to promote
nuclear safety.  This will generate adequate resources for investment in safety upgrades and
maintenance, and encourage energy conservation.  All countries in transition should pursue
such market-oriented reforms and investment strategies based upon least cost planning, giving
due regard to nuclear safety and environmental criteria, and to energy efficiency and
conservation.
 <P>
<LI>The International Financial Institutions have played a leading role in developing market-
oriented energy sector reforms and investment plans.  Their continued involvement and
support is critical to ensure further progress.
<P>
<B>Nuclear waste Management</B>
<P>
<B><I>International Convention</I></B>
<P>
<LI>National authorities must ensure radioactive waste is managed safely and that provisions
are made for its proper handling, storage and ultimate disposal.  These are essential elements
for any nuclear energy programme.
<P>
<LI>The development of the Convention on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management,
based on these principles, is of paramount importance.  We call on all countries generating
nuclear waste with nuclear installations to participate actively in the preparation of this
Convention under the auspices of the I.A.E.A. and to encourage its effective finalization and
prompt adoption.
<P>
<B><I>Ocean Dumping</I></B>
<P>
<LI>We commit ourselves to ban dumping at sea of radioactive waste and encourage all
states to adhere at an earliest possible date to the 1993 amendment of the London Convention.
<P>
<B>Nuclear Material Security</B>
<P>
<B>Programme for Preventing and Combatting illicit Trafficking in Nuclear Material.</B>
<P>
<LI>Illicit trafficking of nuclear material is a public safety and non-proliferation concern. 
We recognized the importance of this issue at our meetings in Naples and Halifax.  As risks
continue to exist, we have agreed on, and released, a programme for preventing and
combatting illicit trafficking in nuclear material to ensure increased cooperation among our
governments in all aspects of prevention, detection, exchange of information, investigation
and prosecution in cases of illicit nuclear trafficking.

<P>
We call on other governments to join us in implementing this programme.
<P>
<B>Nuclear Material Accounting and Control and Physical Protection.</B>
<P>
<LI>We reaffirm the fundamental responsibility of nations to ensure the security of all
nuclear materials in their possession and the need to ensure that they are subject to effective
systems of nuclear material accounting & control and physical protection.  These systems
should include regulations, licensing and inspections.  We express our support for the
I.A.E.A. safeguards regime, which plays a critical role in providing assurance against the
diversion of nuclear material going undetected.  We underline the need for the urgent
strengthening of I.A.E.A. capabilities to detect undeclared nuclear activities.  We note that
these measures are also conducive to preventing illicit trafficking of nuclear material.
<P>
<LI>We recognize the importance of continually improving systems and technologies for
controlling and protecting nuclear materials.  We urge nations to cooperate bilaterally,
multilaterally and through the I.A.E.A. to ensure that the national systems for controlling
nuclear materials remain effective.  We are encouraged by the wide array of cooperative
projects underway in this field under bilateral and multilateral auspices and pledge to sustain
and increase these efforts.
<P>
<LI>We urge ratification by all states of the Convention on the Physical Protection of
Nuclear Material and encourage the application of the I.A.E.A. recommendations on the
Physical Protection of Nuclear Material.
<P>
<LI>We pledge our support for efforts to ensure that all sensitive nuclear material (separated
plutonium and highly enriched uranium) designated as not intended for use for meeting
defence requirements is safely stored, protected and placed under I.A.E.A. safeguards (in the
Nuclear Weapon States, under the relevant voluntary offer I.A.E.A.-safeguards agreements) as
soon as it is practicable to do so.
<P>
<B>Safe and effective Management of weapons fissile material designated as no longer 
required for defence purposes.</B>
<P>
<LI>Major steps have been taken in recent years towards nuclear disarmament. This has
created substantial stocks of fissile material designated as no longer required for defence
purposes.  It is vital, as mentioned above, that these stockpiles are safely managed and
eventually transformed into spent fuel or other forms equally unusable for nuclear weapons
and disposed of safely and permanently.
<P>
<LI>The primary responsibility for the safe management of weapons fissile material rests
with the nuclear weapons states themselves, but other states and international organizations
are welcome to assist where desired.
<P>
<LI>We welcome the steps that the United States and the Russian Federation have taken to
blend highly-enriched uranium (HEU) from dismantled nuclear weapons to low-enriched
uranium (LEU) for peaceful non-explosive purposes, and the cooperation programs of Canada,
France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and other
states with the Russian Federation for the safe storage, the peaceful uses of fissile material
released by the dismantlement of nuclear weapons, and their safe and secure transportation for
that purpose; we encourage other efforts along these lines.
<P>
<LI>We are determined to identify appropriate strategies for the management of fissile
material designated as no longer required for defence purposes.  Options include safe and
secure long-term storage, vitrification or other methods of permanent disposal, and conversion
into mixed-oxide fuel (MOX) for use in nuclear reactors.  We have agreed to share relevant
experience and expertise to elaborate and implement these strategies.  We welcome plans to
conduct small-scale technology demonstrations related to these options, including the
possibility of establishing pilot projects and plants.  We shall convene an international
meeting of experts in order to examine available options and identify possible development of
international cooperation in the implementation of these national strategies, bearing in mind
technical, economic, non-proliferation, environmental and other relevant considerations.  The
meeting will take place in France by the end of 1996.
<P>
<LI>We recognize the importance of ensuring transparency in the management of highly
enriched uranium and plutonium designated as no longer required for defence purposes.

<P>
The Permanent Mission of the Russian Federation to the International Organizations in
Vienna presents its compliments to the Director General of the International Atomic Energy
Agency and has the honour to refer to the letter of the Permanent Mission of the USSR to the
International Organizations in Vienna dated 11 January 1978 in which the Government of the
USSR stated its resolve to act in accordance with the principles for nuclear exports originally
published in the form of document INFCIRC/254, and to the letter from the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation dated 26 December 1991, in which it was stated
that the "membership of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in the IAEA and all its
organs, as well as that country's participation in all conventions, agreements and other
international legal documents concluded within the framework or under aegis of the Agency,
are to be continued by the Russian Federation".
<P>
The development of nuclear technology has brought about the need for further clarification
and amendment of certain sections of the Trigger List contained in Annex A and Annex B to
the Guidelines currently published as document INFCIRC/254/Rev.1/Part 1, as follows:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>-Section 5 of Annex B to document INFCIRC/254/Rev.1/Part 1 relating to equipment
especially designed or prepared for the separation of isotopes of uranium has been clarified
and amended;
<P>
<DD>-Annex A and Annex B of document INFCIRC/254/Rev.1/Part 1 have been amended to
include a new note on facilities for uranium conversion and equipment especially designed or
prepared therefor;
<P>
<DD>-Item 1.7 concerning primary coolant pumps has been added to Section 1 of Annex B
to
document INFCIRC/254/Rev.1/Part 1.
</DL>
<P>
The Government of the Russian Federation has decided that the fundamental principles for
safeguards and export controls of the Guidelines for Nuclear Transfers set out in document
INFCIRC/254/Rev.1/Part 1, as amended, should apply to technology directly associated with
any of the items identified in Annex A and Annex B of the Guidelines.
<P>
The Government of the Russian Federation has decided to adopt a general principle that the
object of the controls of the items or related technology on the Trigger List should not be
defeated by the transfer of component parts and that it will take such actions as it can to
achieve
this aim and will continue to seek a workable definition for component parts, which could be
used by all suppliers.
<P>
The Government of the Russian Federation has clarified the definition of nuclear grade
graphite under item 2.2 of Section 2 of Annex B of document INFCIRC/254/Rev.1/Part 1/
Mod.2.
<P>
The Government of the Russian Federation has adopted an additional guideline to require
government to government assurances for any relevant original transfers in order to ensure the
consent rights on the retransfer of Trigger List items and technology as defined under
paragraph 10(b) of the Guidelines for Nuclear Transfers (INFCIRC/254/Rev.1/Part 1/
Mod.3).
<P>
Accordingly, the following amendments were made to the text of the Guidelines and
Annexes:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>-The Guidelines were revised with amendments to paragraphs 1,2,4(a), 4(d), 10(a),
10(b), 11 and 16, and a new paragraph 10(c);
<P>
<DD>-Annex A of the Guidelines includes a new general note, technology controls and
definitions; amendments to Section 2 of PART A; deletion of paragraphs (1) and (4) of PART
B; and the renumbering of subsequent paragraphs of the document;
<P>
<DD>-Annex B of the Guidelines includes amendments to item 2.2 of Section 2.
</DL>
<P>
In the interest of clarity, the full text of the revised Guidelines together with Annexes A and
B is attached.
<P>
The Government of the Russian Federation has decided to act in accordance with the
Guidelines for Nuclear Transfers so revised.
<P>
In reaching this decision, the Government of the Russian Federation is fully aware of the need
to contribute to economic development while avoiding contributing in any way to the dangers
of a proliferation of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, and of the need to
remove non-proliferation assurances from the field of commercial competition.
<P>
The Government of the Russian Federation would be grateful if the Director General would
circulate the text of this note and its attachment to all Member States of the IAEA.
<P>
The Permanent Mission of the Russian Federation to the International Organizations in
Vienna avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the Director General of the International

nuclear transfers for peaceful purposes to any non-nuclear-weapon State and, in the case of
controls on retransfer, to transfers to any State.  In this connection, suppliers have defined an
export trigger list. 
<P>
<B>Prohibition on nuclear explosives</B>
<P>
<LI>Suppliers should authorize transfer of items or related technology identified in the trigger
list only upon formal governmental assurances from recipients explicitly excluding uses which
would result in any nuclear explosive
device.
<P>
<B>Physical protection</B>
<P>
<LI> (a)  All nuclear materials and facilities identified by the agreed trigger list should be
placed under effective physical protection to prevent unauthorized use and handling.  The
levels of physical protection to be ensured in relation to the type of materials, equipment and
facilities, have been agreed by the suppliers, taking account of international recommendations.
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(b)   The implementation of measures of physical protection in the recipient country is
the responsibility of the Government of that country. However, in order to implement the
terms agreed upon amongst suppliers, the levels of physical protection on which these
measures have to be based should be the subject of an agreement between supplier and
recipient.
<P>
<DD>(c)   In each case special arrangements should be made for a clear definition of
responsibilities for the transport of trigger list items.
</DL>
<P>
<B>Safeguards</B>
<P>
<LI> (a)  Suppliers should transfer trigger list items or related technology to a
non-nuclear-weapon State only when the receiving State has brought into force an agreement
with the IAEA requiring the application of safeguards on all source and special fissionable
material in its current and future peaceful activities.
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(b)   Transfers covered by paragraph 4 (a) to a non-nuclear-weapon State without such
a safeguards agreement should be authorized only in exceptional cases when they are deemed
essential for the safe operation of existing facilities and if safeguards are applied to those
facilities. Suppliers should inform and, if appropriate, consult in the event that they intend to
authorize or to deny such transfers.
<P>
<DD>(c)   The policy referred to in paragraph 4 (a) and 4 (b) does not apply to agreements
or contracts drawn up on or prior to April 3, 1992. In case of countries that have adhered or
will adhere to INFCIRC/254/Rev. 1/Part 1 later than April 3, 1992, the policy only applies to
agreements (to be) drawn up after their date of adherence.
<P>
<DD>(d)   Under agreements to which the policy referred to in paragraph 4 (a) does not
apply (see paragraphs 4 (b) and (c)) suppliers should transfer trigger list items or related
technology only when covered by IAEA safeguards with duration and coverage provisions in
conformity with IAEA doc. GOV/1621. However, suppliers undertake to strive for the earliest
possible implementation of the policy referred to in paragraph 4 (a) under such agreements.
<P>
<DD>(e)   Suppliers reserve the right to apply additional conditions of supply as a matter of
national policy.
</DL>
<P>
<LI>Suppliers will jointly reconsider their common safeguards requirements, whenever
appropriate.
<P>
<B>Safeguards triggered by the transfer of certain technology</B>
<P>
<LI> (a)  The requirements of paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 above should also apply to facilities for
reprocessing, enrichment, or heavy-water production, utilizing technology directly transferred
by the supplier or derived from transferred facilities, or major critical components thereof.
<P>
<DL>
<DD> (b)  The transfer of such facilities, or major critical components thereof, or related
technology, should require an undertaking (1) that IAEA safeguards apply to any facilities of
the same type (i.e. if the design, construction or operating processes are based on the same or
similar physical or chemical processes, as defined in the trigger list) constructed during an
agreed period in the recipient country and (2) that there should at all times be in effect a
safeguards agreement permitting the IAEA to apply Agency safeguards with respect to such
facilities identified by the recipient, or by the supplier in consultation with the recipient, as
using transferred technology.
</DL>
<P>
<B>Special controls on sensitive exports</B>
<P>
<LI>Suppliers should exercise restraint in the transfer of sensitive facilities, technology and
weapons-usable materials. If enrichment or reprocessing facilities, equipment or technology
are to be transferred, suppliers should encourage recipients to accept, as an alternative to
national plants, supplier involvement and/or other appropriate multinational participation in
resulting facilities. Suppliers should also promote international (including IAEA) activities
concerned with multinational regional fuel cycle centres.
<P>
<B>Special controls on export of enrichment facilities, equipment and technology</B>
<P>
<LI>For a transfer of an enrichment facility, or technology therefor, the recipient nation
should agree that neither the transferred facility, nor any facility based on such technology,
will be designed or operated for the production of greater than 20% enriched uranium without
the consent of the supplier nation, of which the IAEA should be advised.
<P>
<B>Controls on supplied or derived weapons-usable material</B>
<P>
<LI>Suppliers recognize the importance, in order to advance the objectives of these
guidelines and to provide opportunities further to reduce the risks of proliferation, of
including in agreements on supply of nuclear materials or of facilities which produce
weapons-usable material, provisions calling for mutual agreement between the supplier and
the recipient on arrangements for reprocessing, storage, alteration, use, transfer or retransfer of
any weapons-usable material involved. Suppliers should endeavour to include such provisions
whenever appropriate and practicable.
<P>
<B>Controls on retransfer</B>
<P>
<LI> (a)  Suppliers should transfer trigger list items or related technology, including
technology defined under paragraph 6, only upon the recipient's assurance that in the case of:
<P>
<DL>
<DL>
<DD>(1)   retransfer of such items or related technology,
<P>
or
<P>
<DD>(2)   transfer of trigger list items derived from facilities originally transferred by the
supplier, or with the help of equipment or technology originally transferred by the supplier; 
<P>
the recipient of the retransfer or transfer will have provided the same assurances as those
required by the supplier for the original transfer.
</DL>
<P>
<DD>(b)   In addition the supplier's consent should be required for: (1) any retransfer of
trigger list items or related technology and any transfer referred to under paragraph 10 (a) (2)
from any State which does not require full scope safeguards, in accordance with paragraph 4
(a) of these Guidelines, as a condition of supply; (2) any retransfer of the facilities, major
critical components, or technology described in paragraph 6; (3) any transfer of facilities or
major critical components derived from those items; (4) any retransfer of heavy water or
weapons-usable material.
<P>
<DD>  (c)  To ensure the consent right as defined under paragraph 10(b), government to
government assurances will be required for any relevant original transfer.
</DL>
<P>
<B>Non-proliferation Principle</B>
<P>
<LI>Notwithstanding other provisions of these Guidelines, suppliers should authorize
transfer of items or related technology identified in the trigger list only when they are
satisfied that the transfers would not contribute to the proliferation of nuclear weapons or
other nuclear explosive devices.
<P>
<CENTER>
<B>SUPPORTING ACTIVITIES</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B>
Physical security
</B>
<P>
<LI>Suppliers should promote international co-operation on the exchange of physical security
information, protection of nuclear materials in transit, and recovery of stolen nuclear materials
and equipment.
<P>
<B>Support for effective IAEA safeguards</B>
<P>
<LI>Suppliers should make special efforts in support of effective implementation of
IAEA safeguards. Suppliers should also support the Agency's efforts to assist Member States
in the improvement of their national systems of accounting and control of nuclear material
and to increase the technical effectiveness of safeguards.
<P>
Similarly, they should make every effort to support the IAEA in increasing further the
adequacy of safeguards in the light of technical developments and the rapidly growing
number of nuclear facilities, and to support appropriate initiatives aimed at improving the
effectiveness of IAEA safeguards.
<P>
<B>Sensitive plant design features</B>
<P>
<LI>Suppliers should encourage the designers and makers of sensitive equipment to
construct it in such a way as to facilitate the application of safeguards.
<P>
<B>Consultations</B>
<P>
<LI>   (a)  Suppliers should maintain contact and consult through regular channels on
matters connected with the implementation of these Guidelines.
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(b)   Suppliers should consult, as each deems appropriate, with other Governments
concerned on
specific sensitive cases, to ensure that any transfer does not contribute to risks of conflict or
instability.
<P>
<DD>(c)   In the event that one or more suppliers believe that there has been a violation of
supplier/recipient understandings resulting from these Guidelines, particularly in the case of
an explosion of a nuclear device, or illegal termination or violation of IAEA safeguards by a
recipient, suppliers should consult promptly through diplomatic channels in order to determine
and assess the reality and extent of the alleged violation.
<P>
<DD>Pending the early outcome of such consultations, suppliers will not act in a manner that
could prejudice any measure that may be adopted by other suppliers concerning their current
contacts with that recipient.
<P>
<DD>Upon the findings of such consultations, the suppliers, bearing in mind Article XII of
the IAEA Statute, should agree on an appropriate response and possible action which could
include the termination of nuclear transfers to that recipient.
</DL>
<P>
<LI>In considering transfers, each supplier should exercise prudence having regard to all
the circumstances of each case, including any risk that technology transfers or subsequent
retransfers might result in unsafeguarded nuclear materials.
<P>
<LI>Unanimous consent is required for any changes in these Guidelines, including any
which might result from the reconsideration mentioned in paragraph 5.

The Government of the Russian Federation has decided to act in accordance with the
Guidelines
so revised.
<P>
In reaching this decision, the Government of the Russian Federation is fully aware of the need
to contribute to economic development while avoiding contributing in any way to the dangers
of
a proliferation of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, and of the need to
remove
non-proliferation assurances from the field of commercial competition.
<P>
The Government of the Russian Federation would be grateful if the Director General would
circulate the text of this note and its attachment to all Member States of the IAEA.
<P>
The Permanent Mission of the Russian Federation to the International Organizations in

<P>         
It has been 10 years since the accident at the Chernobyl NPP happened biggest
technology--related accident of the 20th century which has affected vast territories and
millions of people.
<P>         
This accident has caused an alarm of the whole world community.
The worldwide character of its aftermath has forced the world to
have a new look on the problem of national and global safety.
<P>         
The Chernobyl accident has become a national tragedy for Belarus,
the Ukraine and Russia. The catastrophe has resulted in a
large-scale contamination of the environment. It has caused
social and psychological tensions and has become the most
powerful destructive factor as for sustainable development of the
affected regions.
<P>
Participants of the Conference express their concern about the
worsening state of health of the affected people as a result of
impact of a number of factors, including economic, psychological
and social ones.
<P>         
An obvious consequence of the Chernobyl accident is a significant
increase in incidence of thyroid cancer in children and
adolescents. Among the groups of increased risk are liquidators
of 1986-1987, the evacuated population and children and
adolescents living in the contaminated territories.
<P>         
The consequences of the Chemobyl accident can not be eliminated
in a few years. In one way or another, they will be experienced
by many generations to come.
<P>         
International bilateral and multilateral co-operation, mutual
exchange of gained experience and information on alleviation of
the consequences of the Chernobyl accident is of great
significance.
<P>
Collaborative work of scientists from EU countries, Belarus, Russia and the Ukraine under the
quadripartite "Agreement for International Collaboration on the Consequences of the
Chernobyl Accident" has been an integral part of the established interaction. The
obtained results have made a considerable contribution to studies of radio ecological, medical
and biological, social and economic issues resulted from the large-scale contamination. An
important step has been made towards setting up a system of nuclear and radiation safety of
Europe. There is no such a thing as a guarantee against an accidents like the Chernobyl one.
The mankind must have in hand knowledge and expertise required for minimizing negative
effects of such accident, should they occur
<P>         
The participants of the Conference are convinced thee the
attention to the post-Chernobyl situation should not be reduced
They urge to expand mutually beneficial scientific and technical
collaboration in this area. Application of the collaboration
results and analysis of the lessons learnt in mitigation of the
accident will make it possible to make a considerable step
forward increased radiation safety of the European countries.
<P>         
The Conference concludes that in the near future efforts should be focused on the
following problems of priority
<P>
<DL>
<DD>     
--rehabilitation of the contaminated territories;
<P>         
<DD>-- monitoring of health status and development of optimum methods
for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of diseases for
liquidators and other affected population groups;
<P>         
<DD>-- development of early diagnostics and therapeutic methods for
thyroid and other cancers:
<P>         
<DD>-- development of a system to minimize social--psychological
consequences of the accident;
<P>         
<DD>-- development of methods and computerized decision--making support
systems to protect population in case of a radiation accident
</DL>
<P>         
The experience of dealing with the nuclear disaster gained over the latest decade must belong
to the whole mankind. Setting up reliable safeguards of radiation safety would benefit each
inhabitant of the Earth

<P>         
On April 26, 1986 the largest accident on the 4 unit of the Chernobyl NPP
took place in the USSR. The accident of such a type was considered to be practically
impossible and is referred to as beyond-design. As a result of the accident the
reactor was destructed and during two weeks about 2 EBq of radionuclides were
released in the environment. The fire in the reactor core led to dispersion of
radioactive materials on vast territories of Belarus, Russia and Ukraine as well as
some countries of Europe.
<P>         
The composition of the radioactive releases included different radionuclides
of iodine, caesium and strontium. This determined exposure of the population to        
short-lived radionuclides, first of all to isotopes of radioiodine and subsequent
exposure due to long-lived radionuclides.
<P>         
Neither the Soviet Union, nor other countries of the world were ready to
eliminate the accident of such a magnitude.
<P>         
Non-uniform character of the radionuclides release from the destroyed
reactor, the complex path of the contaminated air, atmospheric precipitation during
that period, difference in terrain-geochemical and micro climatic conditions on the
territories, exposed to radioactive contamination, have resulted in formation of the
extremely patchy contamination of the territory of Belarus, Ukraine and Russia with a
various radionuclides ratio.
<P>
As of 01.01.95 the total area of these three states, contaminated by
radiocaesium exceeding 37 kBq/m<SUP>2</SUP> (1 Ci/km<SUP>2</SUP> ) makes about
145 thousands km<SUP>2</SUP>, on which more than 7 mln. of people lived.
<P>         
At the initial stage of the accident isotopes with short and medium half-lives
were prevailing in fall outs, of them belong to <SUP>131</SUP>I being of the highest
radiobiological significance.
<P>         
Given the sevirity of the accident, a lot of people were involved in its
liquidation - primarily non-professionals (about 800 000 people). From April 27 to
mid-August 1986 116 000 residents were evacuated, which has turned out to be a
justified and effective counter-measure. From 1990 to 1995 due to the formed
radiation conditions, and because of social-psychological factors and political
conditions, 52 500 people in Ukraine, 106 500 people in Belarus, about 47 500
people in Russia were aditionally resettled.
<P>         
Of the total number of the liquidators 237 people were taken to hospital under
the assumption of overexposure. Of them 134 had diagnosis of acute radiation
syndrome (ARS). 56 people got radiation burns, two of them, in addition had thermal
skin injuries. 28 patients died soon as a result of the exposure, two others were lost
due to initial explosions and fires. One died of prospective coronary thrombosis.
<P>
For the period from 1987 to 1990 five patients died and from 1992 to
01.03.96 nine more people died with the confirmed diagnosis ARS.
<P>         
The health of other involved in elimination of the Chernobyl accident
consequences was steadily worsening for 9 years after the accident. The proportion
of healthy people decreased from 78% in 1988 to 20% in 1995.
<P>         
The main contribution to these negative indicators was made by non-tumour
pathology (disorders of the nervous, cardio-vascular, respiratory, digestive, urine and
osteo-muscular systems). Higher levels of morbidity are detected in the liquidators,
of 1986-1987 first of all.
<P>         
A trend for the increase in cases of leukaemia, limphomas and thyroid
cancers has been seen in the liquidators of 1986 only.
<P>         
Total mortality in the cohort of liquidators of 1986-1987 does not exceed that
of the reference group of the population.
<P>         
Serious concern is caused by the significant growth of complete or partial
disability rate among the liquidators of the Chernobyl accident, especially in the
group of the 1986 liquidators.
<P>         
According to the data of the specialized medical records of the evacuated
population and population inhabiting the contaminated territories in comparison with
the referent healthy indices decreased significantly. The share of healthy people
among the evacuated decreased from 59% to 21%; among the population of the
controlled territories from 52% to 24%; among the children born from the exposed
parents from 81% up to 32%. A particular concern is children, born from the
liquidators of 1986.
<P>         
The significant growth of thyroid cancer morbidity is observed in children and
adolescents of Belarus, Ukraine and Russia. Total number of those who became ill,
aged at the time of the accident from 0 to 18 years, amounts to 1000 in three
specified countries. The performed radiation-epidemiological studies show that the
overwhelming number of the identified types of thyroid cancer is due to radiation
effect of the Chernobyl catastrophe.
<P>         
Results, received so far, have shown, that in all three countries the excess of
morbidity of solid cancers and leukosis is not yet registered among the population,
dwelling in the contaminated territories.
<P>         
Any accidental factors, which can influence health indices of the population
during the acute period were mainly including radiation exposure. They, however,
were later added by effects associated with the accident. In this complicated
situation reliable predictions and epidemiological survey it was impossible to make
became especially important.
<P>         
The information base of research relies on the existing system of registration
of desease and the death causes as well as on specially created all-union and then        
national Registers of three countries. Besides in each of the three countries
specialized epidemiological projects are being carried out with regard to the radiation
induced diseases. It is important to note compatibility of information bases, in
principle enabling one to analyze accumulated data of three countries to be analysed
as a file.
<P>
The depth and the magnitude of social-psychological consequences of the
Chernobyl accident were most graphic. The accident has transformed the mentality
of the population on the three affected countries involved, has changed a system of
social and cultural values, has affected life of large groups of people. The accident
has caused high distress, psychological discomfort and had other implications with
particular features in various groups. Stress tends to be transformed into psycho-
somatic illnesses, which will determine a further decrease in life quality and a health
state, including that in generations to come.
<P>         
About 4300 km<SUP>2</SUP> of the most contaminated areas in the Ukraine, Belarus and
Russia is separated as an alienation zone. Acute radio biological effects occurred in
a close vicinity of the wrecked reactor. They resulted in death of woods on the area
of 30 km<SUP>2</SUP> and in varying radiation damage to plants and animals as well as in
degradation of biocenosis. A permanent danger of contaminating rivers Dnieper and
Pripyat to levels above sanitary norms is posed by the presence of highly
contaminated sites including more than 800 radioactive waste repositories, the
"Shelter" installation, pool-cooler etc. in the alienation zone. That demands
measures to rectify a radioecological situation.
<P>         
One of the consequences of the accidents determining its catastrophic
character is contamination of extensive agricaltural lands with long-lived
radionuclides. In Belarus, Russia and Ukraine the arable lands with the Cs-137
contamination density of more than 37 KBq/m<SUP>2</SUP>   make 94 000
km<SUP>2</SUP>. The environmental conditions of the contaminated areas have led to
intense incorporation of the radionuclides in the biological chains. The major radiation factor
on the contaminated areas is internal exposure associated with consumption of local
foodstuffs .
<P>         
In the three countries countermeasures have been carried out on extensive
areas which has allowed contamination of the produce to be reduced by a factor of
2-5.
<P>         
Though the concentration of radiocesium in produce on the contaminated
areas in most cases does not exceed the levels recommended as threshould by
WHO and FAO it is still 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher that on the other territories
of CIS and Europe.
<P>         
Particularly high concentrations of Cs-137 ( up to 100 Kbq/kg and more) are
observed in mushrooms and berries which have been traditionally consumed by the
local population.
<P>         
Concern is caused by production of food on private farms where milk
contaminaton is as high or even higher the standards in 10-20% cases. Solution
of these problems calls for long-term works on rehabilitation of the areas.
<P>
In the countries of Europe (Sweden, UK and others ) where the
environmental conditions are similar to those in Polesye high contamination of
mushrooms and berries, meat of wild animals and lake fish has been reported.
<P>         
The accident has led to huge losses in economy.
<P>         
Direct losses alone including the costs of basic and working assets, facilities
of social infrastructure, dwellings and natural resourses taken out of use have
added up to dosens of billions of US dollars.
<P>
 Indirect losses, lost profits and costs related to elimination of the
consequences were also very significant.
<P>         
The Chernobyl disaster had a major destructive effect on development of the
affected areas and caused growth in socio-psycological tensions.
<P>
The accident has revealed imperfections in provision of nuclear and radiation
safety. In the Soviet Union there was no comprehensive legislation on nuclear power
and the organizations running nuclear facilities were not independent of the
authorities involved in regulating nuclear and radiation safety and inspection of
nuclear facilities operation .
<P>         
Many conclusions have been drawn: in the affected CIS countries special
authorities responsible for control of nuclear and radiation safety and inspection of
nuclear facilities operation have been set up which are independent of the
organizations running these facilities. A variety of measures have been
implemented to improve the structure of nuclear plants, enhance nuclear, radiation
and fire safety. This has made it possible to increase the reliability and safety of
nuclear facilities in general .
<P>         
At present there are a number of complicated problems calling for long-term efforts.
<P>         
A problem of medical care for the liquidators and exposed population will not
lose its actuality in many years to come. In the first instance one should distinguish
effects related to the damage to thyroid gland.
<P>         
Radiation and hygienic conditions in many regions of Belarus, Russia and the
Ukraine demand measures aimed at radiation medical and social protection for the
population and rehabilitation of territories to be continued.
<P>         
It is necessary to keep on scientific research programmes in key areas that
are important for overcoming the consequences of the Chernobyl accident and
hereafter setting up a radiation safety system in Europe. The natural
decontamination of the contaminated territories proceeds slowly with speed close to
or considerably smaller than that of caesium-137 radioactive decay. Radiation
conditions formed in 10 years after the accident will be preserved long time. It set
forth a necessity of long-term radio ecological and radiation-hygienic monitoring
health of the population and environment.
<P>         
The implementation of counter-measures in agriculture is still needed on a
significant part of the contaminated territories. Under the current economic situation
a decrease in scales of work on agricultural regions' rehabilitation is observed in CIS
countries. That has been already displayed in a tendency of increasing food
products contamination and more intensive use of contaminated products of half-natural
ecosystems.

Health of Belarus, Russia and Ukraine</I>
<P>
One of the most serious radiation accidents in the history of the nuclear industry occurred
on 26 April 1986 at the Chernobyl NPP.  Almost five million people were living in areas
where the radionuclide contamination exceeded 37 kBq/m<SUP>2</SUP>, and 278 000 were
living in areas where it exceeded 555 kBq/m<SUP>2</SUP>.  About 800 000 people
(liquidators) took part in emergency and recovery operations in the accident zone.
<P>
Among the medical consequences of the Chernobyl accident, the greatest concern is aroused
by the steady growth in the incidence of thyroid cancer among children living in the
monitored areas of Belarus, Russia and Ukraine.
<P>
Analysis of the data accumulated in the three Republics points to unfavourable trends as
regards various classes of diseases in the populations living in contaminated areas and among
the liquidators.
<P>
The incidence of haemoblastosis, which has a close etiological connection with radiation,
has remained virtually unchanged since the accident.
<P>
The accident cost the lives and damaged the health of Chernobyl NPP workers and created
a potential threat to the health of many other people - for example, those who participated in
recovery operations after the accident and people living in areas contaminated by
radionuclides.  Besides all the consequences due to radiation, these people have also suffered
from stress and shock, which has had a negative impact on their physical and psychological
state of health. 
<P>
Many countries and international organizations (the EEC, the UN, WHO, the IAEA,
UNESCO, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, the Council of Europe,
etc.) have helped Belarus, Russia and Ukraine to mitigate the consequences of the Chernobyl
accident.
<P>
Minimizing the medical consequences of the Chernobyl accident is an extremely complex,
long-term task.  It would help if there were a further expansion of activities under national
programmes directed towards international collaboration within the framework of EC projects.
<P>
It is necessary to further intensify the co-operation of the EC and Belarus, Russia, Ukraine
and other interested countries in assessing and minimizing the medical consequences of the
Chernobyl accident on the basis of a uniform scientific methodology.
<P>
The most promising lines of future work are:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Further careful monitoring of the health of the unprecedentedly large number of people
who have been exposed to low radiation doses;
<P>
<LI>Expansion and intensification of the epidemiological studies of thyroid cancer          
(especially in children) and other neoplasms and of genetic disorders - diagnosis, treatment
and rehabilitation;
<P>
<LI>Epidemiological cohort and case-control studies of the 1986-87 liquidators in order to
determine the incidence of leukaemia and solid malignant tumours;
<P>
<LI>Analysis of morbidity, mortality and invalidity associated with somatic, nervous and      
psychological diseases in the exposed population and among the liquidators - isolation of the
influence of non-radiation factors;
<P>
<LI>Development of biological dosimetry methods, including retrospective dose assessment.
</OL>
<P>
It is extremely important to investigate the molecular, cellular and biological characteristics
of radiation-induced thyroid cancer.

<B><I>Concluding address of I.A. Kenik, Belarus Minister for Emergency Situations and for
Protection of the Population from the Consequences of the Chernobyl Accident</I></B>
<P>
Distinguished participants, ladies and gentlemen,
<P>
We are today completing the work undertaken by us jointly within the framework of the
First International Conference of the European Union, Belarus, the Russian Federation and
Ukraine on the Consequences of the Chernobyl Accident.
<P>
During the past five days, at plenary and topical sessions, important and interesting scientific
reports have been presented, there have been fruitful and constructive discussions, exhibitions
have been organized and press conferences have been held.
<P>
The importance of this conference cannot be overemphasized.  It touched on the most
diverse aspects of the problems associated with the Chernobyl accident.
<P>
I believe that the main achievement of this conference was a thorough and objective analysis
of the situation which has undoubtedly been useful for Western countries and will be useful
to the affected Republics as they formulate scientifically well-founded proposals for further
minimizing the consequences of the accident.
<P>
During this conference, every participant had the opportunity of holding additional meetings
and discussions with colleagues from Belarus, Russia and Ukraine, and the intensification of
contacts at the personal level is a good stimulus of fruitful international scientific
collaboration.
<P>
The strengthening of mutual understanding among States in many respects depends not only
on the results of the interaction of politicians with politicians but also on those of meetings of
politicians with scientists and the representatives of public societies and social movements and
on contacts with ordinary citizens.  Thus, the significance of our common endeavours here
goes beyond the bounds of scientific collaboration.  These endeavours are especially
important in the context of strengthening the co-operation of our three countries - Belarus,
Russia and Ukraine - on one hand with European international institutions on the other, and
particularly with the European Union and the Council of Europe.
<P>
One of the serious problems caused by the Chernobyl accident is "Chernobyl stress" - a
complex psychological phenomenon giving rise to psychological tensions in society.  The
holding of a conference like this one, however, has a positive effect in reducing such tensions.
I believe that the extensive discussions of medical problems which took place during this
conference served not only the interests of scientific truth.  It is to be hoped that they will
lead to the formulation of specific recommendations whose implementation will result in
timely and effective medical assistance designed to safeguard and improve the health of those
who were involved in the Chernobyl accident.
<P>
In my view, the results of this conference - its final documents - constitute above all official
recognition by the international scientific community of the true scale of the Chernobyl
accident.
<P>
In addition, the final documents adopted by the conference point to the future and offer a
firm basis for the development of international "Chernobyl" co-operation.
<P>
I am confident that the agreed position of the scientists of Belarus, Russia, Ukraine and the
European Commission which was expressed during this conference will be duly noted by the
international scientific community.  The results of this conference and the opinion of those
participating in it should, I believe, be taken into account at the international conference <A
HREF="/worldatom/thisweek/preview/chernobyl/">"One decade after Chernobyl:  Summing
up the consequences of the accident"</A> which is to take place in Vienna from 8 to 12
April.
<P>
History would have it that the world associates the Republic of Belarus, a newly independent
State, with the word "Chernobyl".  It is a tragedy for Belarus, Russia and Ukraine.  We feel
the concern that the subject of this conference is arousing in the international community.  It
manifests itself in extensive international co-operation with prominent organizations like the
European Union, the United Nations and various of its agencies, the International Federation
of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and a number of other organizations represented at
this conference.  At the same time, I would emphasize once more that for Belarus, Russia and
Ukraine "Chernobyl" is not just a subject for scientific research - it is a reality in which
millions of our people are living and working.  That is why we are so interested in the
consequences of a radiation accident on such a scale being reliably assessed and predicted. 
That is why we welcome the efforts of the international scientific community and are grateful
to all of you who have participated in this conference.
<P>
I hope that, with the help of the European Commission, our collaboration in dealing with
the most acute and most alarming problems resulting from the Chernobyl accident will
continue.  I hope that we shall all participate in the second such conference.
<P>
I should like to thank the European Parliament and all the other international bodies for their
active participation in the work of this conference.  I should also like to express my sincere
gratitude to the immediate conference organizers Mr. Jaak Sinnaeve and Ms. Anna Karaoglou
and through them to the entire European Commission.  In addition, a heartfelt "thank you"
should go to my fellow Ministers Sergei Kuzhugetovich Shoigu of Russia and Vladimir
Ivanovich Kholosha of Ukraine.
<P>
To all of you I wish good health and further scientific successes.  Also, I wish you the most
important things that scientists can expect from their work - the joy of discovery and the
gratitude of those in need of their findings.
<P>
Once more - thank you.  We shall always be pleased to see you again in our hospitable
country.

shall be no more intensive than is necessary and sufficient to maintain continuity of
knowledge of the flow and inventory of nuclear material, and the maximum routine inspection
effort in respect of such facilities shall be determined as follows:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(a) for reactors and sealed storage installations the maximum total of routine inspection
per year shall be determined by allowing one sixth of a man-year of inspection for
each such facility;
<P>
<DD>(b) for facilities, other than reactors or sealed storage installations, involving plutonium
or uranium enriched to more than 5%, the maximum total of' routine inspection per
year shall be determined by allowing for each such facility 30 x E man-days of
inspection per year. where E is the inventory or annual throughput of nuclear
material, whichever is greater, expressed in effective kilograms. The maximum
established for any such facility shall not, however, be less than 1.5 man-years of
inspection; and
<P>
<DD> (c) for facilities not covered by paragraphs (a) or (b), the maximum total of routine
inspection per year shall be determined by allowing for each such facility one third
of a man-year of inspection plus 0.4 x E man-days of inspection per year, where E
is the inventory or annual throughput of nuclear material, whichever is greater,
expressed in effective kilograms.

<LI>On 10 June 1996, the Director General received a communication of 9 June
1996 from the Resident Representative of China transmitting the Statement of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China made on 8 June 1996.

<B>Statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China</B>
</CENTER>
<P>         
China conducted a nuclear test on 8 June 1996.
<P>         
China stands for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, and is
in favor of reaching a comprehensive nuclear test ban in the process towards this objective.
As early as in October 1993, the Chinese Government publicly announced that China stands
for the conclusion of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty no later than 1996. Since then, the
Chinese delegation has taken an active part in the CTBT negotiations in Geneva. China will
continue to work with other countries for the conclusion, within this year, of a fair,
reasonable and verifiable treaty with universal adherence and unlimited duration.
<P>         
The limited amount of nuclear weapons China possesses is solely for the purpose
of self-defence and does not constitute a threat to any country. China has unilaterally
and solemnly undertaken not to be the first to use nuclear weapons at any time and
under any circumstances. It has also committed itself not to use or threaten to use nuclear
weapons against non-nuclear weapon states or nuclear weapon free zones. At the same time,
China strongly calls on other nuclear weapon states for a positive response to China's
initiative by immediately concluding, through negotiations, a treaty on mutual non-first use of
nuclear weapons, and reaching an agreement on the unconditional non-use or non-threat of
use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon states or nuclear weapon-free zones.
<P>         
In the world today, there still exist huge nuclear arsenals and the threat of a
nuclear war caused by the first use of nuclear weapons. Against such a background, for the
purpose of safeguarding the supreme interests of the state and nation, China cannot but
conduct the necessary and the minimum number of nuclear tests. We have all along exercised
utmost restraint in conducting nuclear tests, and the number of tests we have conducted is
extremely limited.
<P>         
Together with the governments and peoples of other countries in the world, the
Chinese Government and people will work unremittingly and do their utmost for
the realization of the lofty goal of a nuclear weapon-free world at an early date and for
the maintenance of lasting peace and universal security.
<P>         
Based on the afore-mentioned position, the Chinese Government hereby announces
that before September this year, China will conduct another nuclear test to ensure
the safety of its nuclear weapons. After that, China will exercise a moratorium on nuclear
testing.

<B>TEXT OF THE STATEMENT OF THE PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
The process of removal of strategic nuclear weapons from the territory of Ukraine to the Russian
Federation with a view to subsequent destruction in the presence of observers from Ukraine was
completed on 1 June 1996.  Ukraine has thus demonstrated to the world its firm attachment to
the idea of global nuclear disarmament and its desire to bring mankind closer to the time when
all peoples of our planet will be able to live without the threat of nuclear annihilation.
<P>
At one time, in the "Cold War" period, the people of Ukraine had to finance the exhausting race
for nuclear armaments at the cost of their own well-being and economic development.  For this
reason, in declaring itself the owner of the nuclear weapons stationed in its territory which it had
inherited from the former USSR, Ukraine regarded these weapons not as something that afforded
it actual military strength but, first of all, as an asset which was to compensate it, at least in part,
for the damage it had suffered.  No nuclear threat to mankind ever emanated from independent
Ukraine.
<P>
This is what guided the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine when in July 1990, in its declaration on
State sovereignty, it announced that Ukraine would adhere to three non-nuclear principles - not
to station, not to produce and not to obtain nuclear weapons.
<P>
This decision was reflected in all subsequent documents and practical steps of Ukraine in the
area of nuclear disarmament, and thus the removal of the last nuclear weapon from the territory
of Ukraine is its logical culmination and also the convincing proof of the consistency and
predictability of our policy.
<P>
This historic event marks the timely and full compliance by our State with its obligations in
accordance with the Trilateral Statement by the Presidents of Ukraine, the USA and Russia of 14
January 1994, and is Ukraine's important contribution to the disarmament process.  However, this
process cannot be unilateral, it must be supported and supplemented in the political and practical
spheres by other countries, above all the nuclear countries.  The total elimination of nuclear
weapons stationed in the territory of Ukraine offers a unique opportunity for realizing the idea of
a nuclear-free Central and Eastern Europe - from the Black Sea to the Baltic.  The establishment
of such a zone will help to create a climate of confidence between the countries in the region
and greatly reduce the threat of new lines of separation appearing on the European continent.
<P>
The help which is being provided to us with the elimination of strategic nuclear weapons is
highly appreciated in Ukraine.  In fulfilling the international obligations assumed in this area,
Ukraine is encountering a large number of problems which it does not have the ability to resolve
all by itself.  Therefore, having voluntarily given up the third largest nuclear potential in the
world, we are entitled to hope that assistance will continue to be provided to Ukraine even after
it has finally complied with the provisions of the Trilateral Statement by the Presidents of
Ukraine, the USA and Russia of 14 January 1994.  We are counting on long-term collaboration
in this area in the interest of the whole of mankind.
<P>
Having experienced the disastrous consequences of the accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power
Plant, the people of Ukraine are well aware of the real threat of a catastrophe that nuclear
weapons pose to mankind.  Ukraine is convinced that it has made the right decision by choosing
a nuclear-free status, and calls upon other States, first and foremost the nuclear States, to follow
the same path and to do everything possible so that nuclear weapons are eliminated from the
face of our planet as quickly as possible and for ever.

<B>NUCLEAR WEAPON TEST BY CHINA</B>

<P>
Statement by the Hon. John Howard, Prime Minister of Australia
<P>
Australia condemns the latest est of a nuclear weapon by China.  Given the strength of world
reaction against the French testing programme, it displays a particular insensitivity for China to
have gone ahead with this test.
<P>
China alone continues to test nuclear weapons.  Its action is contrary to the expectation of the
international community, as underlined at last year's Review conference on the Treaty on the
Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), to see concrete progress towards the elimination
of nuclear weapons.  It is particularly regrettable that China continues to test when the
negotiations for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) are at a critical juncture.
<P>
I urge China to end immediately its nuclear weapons testing program and affirm its
unconditional support for a CTBT.  These measures would be a significant boost to international
efforts to curb the spread and use of weapons of mass destruction.

<P>
MEDIA RELEASE ISSUED BY THE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF
AUSTRALIA, MR ALEXANDER DOWNER
<BR>
<BR>
<BR> 
I CONDEMN THE NUCLEAR TEST CONDUCTED TODAY BY CHINA.
<P>
WITH THE CONCLUSION OF FRANCE'S NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC,
CHINA STANDS ALONE AS THE ONLY NUCLEAR WEAPON STATE TO PERSIST,
AGAINST THE EXPRESS WILL OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, WITH A
NUCLEAR WEAPON TESTING PROGRAM.  CHINA'S TEST COMES AT A TIME WHEN
NEGOTIATIONS TO CONCLUDE A COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN TREATY (CTBT) ARE
ENTERING THEIR FINAL STAGE.  THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS CALLED
FOR THE TREATY TO BE CONCLUDED AND OPENED FOR SIGNATURE BY THIS
YEARS' UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY IN SEPTEMBER.  THE TIMING OF
THE LATEST TEST BY CHINA IS THEREFORE PARTICULARLY REGRETTABLE.
<P>
AUSTRALIA'S OPPOSITION TO ALL NUCLEAR TESTING IS LONG-STANDING AND
FIRM.  OUR RESPONSE TO TODAY'S TEST CAN LEAVE CHINA IN NO DOUBT ABOUT
THE STRENGTH OF FEELING ON THE PART OF THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT,
AND THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY, AGAINST CONTINUED NUCLEAR TESTING. 
OUR MESSAGE IS CLEAR:  CHINA SHOULD HEED THE STRENGTH AND
LEGITIMACY OF INTERNATIONAL FEELING ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE AND
DESIST IMMEDIATELY FROM ALL FURTHER TESTING.  CHINA SHOULD ACT NOW
TO JOIN THE OTHER NUCLEAR WEAPON STATES IN DESISTING FROM TESTING
PENDING ENTRY INTO FORCE OF A CTBT.
<P>
IT IS CLEAR THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WANTS TO SEE A MOVE AWAY
FORM THE NOW OUT-DATED WAR LOGIC OF NUCLEAR CONFRONTATION AND TO
WIND BACK THE THREAT POSED BY THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT AND
PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS.  CONTINUED NUCLEAR TESTING HAS NO
PLACE IN TODAY'S WORLD.

NEW ZEALAND CALLS ON CHINA TO STOP NUCLEAR TESTS
<P>
"China's actions in proceeding with yet another nuclear test will be 
condemned by all New Zealanders," said the Prime Minister, Rt Hon J B 
Bolger today. Mr. Bolger was responding to the announcement that China had 
conducted a nuclear test at its Lop Nor test site yesterday.
<P>
"It is all the more disappointing because it comes after France has announced 
an end to all testing and because it takes place as the negotiations in Geneva 
on a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty reach a crucial final phase."
<P>
"While the Chinese Government has committed itself to the conclusion of the 
Treaty, it has also said it will not stop testing until the Treaty is concluded. 
However we will urge China in the strongest terms to conduct no further 
tests."
<P>
Mr Bolger said the international community is waiting for China to confirm
its support for a test ban treaty that bans all nuclear explosions. "China must 
also accept the need for the new test ban organisation to be able to investigate
quickly and effectively all evidence of breaches of the Treaty. We are all
looking to China to show that it is prepared to make the necessary
concessions to allow the test ban negotiations to be concluded successfully by 
the end of this month."
<P>
The Prime Minister said Foreign Minister Don McKinnon would be
conveying New Zealand's serious concerns to the Chinese Ambassador when
he calls him in to receive our protest tomorrow. New Zealand's Ambassador 
in Beijing has also been instructed to make representations at the highest 
possible level.
<P>
"Both will urge China to lend its full support to the conclusion of the test ban
negotiations by the end of June, and in the meantime to cease testing its
nuclear weapons," Mr Bolger said.

<B>Appeal to States Members of the United Nations on the  tenth anniversary of the accident at the
Chinaberry nuclear power plant<A HREF="#note_a"><SUP>*/</SUP></A></B>
</CENTER>
<P>
Ten years separate us from the early-morning hours of 26 April 1986 when
two powerful explosions in rapid succession destroyed the Unit 4 reactor of the
Chernobyl nuclear power plant, exposing the burning core and releasing
50 million curies of radioactive isotopes into the environment.
<P>
The scale of the accident, its impact on health and on the ecological
situation transcended the boundaries of the zone around Chernobyl, indeed, the
boundaries of Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine, the three countries
which received the largest share of the fallout, becoming a global problem of
concern to the entire world.
<P>
Even a decade later, however, this accident is much more than the worst
technological disaster in the history of nuclear power generation; it is also a
grave and continuing humanitarian tragedy.
<P>
By displacing hundreds of thousands of people, it severely damaged the
socio-psychological fibre of the most seriously affected States.  Radioactive
contamination, health risks, both physical and mental, continue to affect vast
populations in these three countries.
<P>
That tragic event 10 years ago continues to this day to have a devastating
effect on the social and economic life in Belarus, the Russian Federation and
Ukraine, obliging them to grapple with the most acute of its consequences.
Chernobyl, however, represents a long-term problem of unprecedented complexity,
which can only be tackled successfully through the combined efforts of the
entire international community.
<P>
The International Conference, "One Decade after Chernobyl:  Summing Up the
Consequences of the Accident", held recently at Vienna, fully attested to this
 fact.  Indeed, it brought together nuclear scientists, doctors, political
leaders of Member States, organisations of the United Nations system, the
European Commission and airways for a thorough and detailed assessment of the
situation 10 years later, and of the level and adequacy of the assistance
provided and research undertaken.  The results of the Conference clearly point
to the need for intensifying assistance to vast segments of the populations of
the affected States, as well as to the need for further research into what is
still very much an evolving science.
<P>
Recognising the universal importance of the Chernobyl disaster, the General
Assembly at its fiftieth session declared 26 April 1996 to be the International
Day Commemorating the Tenth Anniversary of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant
Accident.  In its resolution 50/134 the General Assembly invites Member States
to conduct appropriate activities to commemorate this tragic event and to
enhance public awareness of the consequences of such disasters for health and
the environment throughout the world.
<P>
The United Nations today remains profoundly concerned by the continuing
impact of this disaster on the lives and health of large numbers of people,
particularly children.  I cannot stress enough that Chernobyl is still a major
humanitarian tragedy, and that with the passage of time, the suffering has not
abated.
<P>
In any realistic forecast of the challenges facing the United Nations, we
must accept that Chernobyl and its consequences will remain on the international
agenda.  The occasion of the tenth anniversary of the accident provides us with
a special opportunity to express a renewed commitment to help those who are
asking for our assistance.  It is also a chance to reinforce our common effort
to respond to this continuing humanitarian and technological disaster.
<P>
As the Secretary-General of the United Nations, I am therefore taking this
opportunity to appeal to Member States to continue and to intensify their
assistance to Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine, so that a tangible
difference can be made in the lives of those still suffering at the hands of the
"invisible enemy".

<DD> -          
having regard to its resolution of 8 April 1987 on the consequences of the Chernobyl
accident and on the outline communication from the Commission of the European
Communities to the Council on the consequences of the Chernobyl accident and the
communication from the Commission of the European Communities to the Council
on Community action to be taken in response to the Chernobyl accidentm<A

<P>
<DD>- having regard to its resolution of 8 April 1987 on the reaction of the Community to
Chernobyl<A HREF="#note_d"><SUP>3/</SUP></A>,
<P>
<DD>-  having regard to its opinion of 15 December 1993 on the proposal for a Council
Decision amending Decision 77/270 (Euratom) to authorize the Commission to
contract Euratom borrowings in order to contribute to the financing required for
improving the degree of efficiency and safety of nuclear power stations in certain
non-Member countries<A HREF="#note_e"><SUP>4/</SUP></A>,
<P>
<DD>- having regard to its resolution of 15 December 1993 on nuclear safety in the countries
of Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)<A
HREF="#note_f"><SUP>5/</SUP></A>,
<P>
<DD>A. whereas, ten years after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, which caused thousands of
deaths by radioactive contamination and which is still having tragic consequences for
the health of millions of people - particularly as a result of the increase in the
incidence of cancer and leukemia - and for the state of the environment, the risks
of a fresh accident remain, both on the Chernobyl site itself and in all other nuclear
power stations,
<P>
<DD>B. whereas a serious incident occurred in reactor 1 at the Chernobyl nuclear power
station on 27 November 1995,
<P>         
<DD>C. greatly concerned by the report by 'Alliance', a consortium responsible for carrying
out, within the framework of the TACIS programme, a feasibility study on
stabilisation of the sarcophagus of block 4 in Chernobyl, whose conclusions
concerning the risk of collapse of this sarcophagus are particularly alarming; noting
that' the costs for the construction of a new sarcophagus are estimated at US $ 1.6
billion over a period of 10 Years.
<P>
<DD>D. aware that the Chernobyl nuclear power plant contributes about 7 % to the electricity
supply of Ukraine,
<P>         
<DD>E. pointing out that the Ukrainian Government admits that Ukraine is one of the most
energy-intensive countries in the world, using at least 3 times the amount of energy
per unit of GNP as the European Union.
<P>         
<DD>F. drawing attention to the fact that over the last few years electricity consumption in
these countries has fallen by an amount which significantly exceeds nuclear power
generation,
<P>         
<DD>G. referring to the International Conference now taking place in Vienna,
<P>
<DD>H. noting that the G7, Russia and Ukraine will discuss nuclear safety at a special summit
in Moscow in April 1996,
<P>         
<DD>I. acknowledging that the European Union has an important role to play in helping the
countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union in their efforts
to improve the safety and efficiency of their energy systems,
<P>         
<DD>J. recalling the Memorandum of Understanding in which the G7 promised to help
finance a solution to the Chernobyl problem,
<P>         
<DD>1. Emphasizes that 10 years after the Chernobyl disaster, no nuclear power station,
either RBMK or VVER 440-230, has yet been shut down, in spite of the opinion of
Western experts, and that the working conditions of these installations, far from
improving, have in fact deteriorated, since they have become more decrepit and are
controlled by personnel lacking training;
<P>         
<DD>2. Calls on the authorities of the countries which are still operating high-risk power
stations to decommission them as quickly as possible and to focus, on the one hand,
on improving the safety of more recent types of nuclear power station, and, on the
other, on developing programmes to save energy and improve energy efficiency,
<P>
<DD>3. Stresses the need to make available as much financial and technical aid as possible to
assist Ukraine in making the destroyed reactor block safe and to contribute to the
cleaning up of the contaminated areas, also in Russia and Belarus;
<P>         
<DD>4. Requests the Commission to develop a genuine strategy, in the framework of the
PHARE and TACIS programmes, in order to promote energy saving programmes and
sustainable energy resources, notably by more efficient utilization of energy and the
recourse to less expensive and less dangerous sources of energy;
<P>         
<DD>5. Calls on the Ukrainian Government to comply with the Memorandum of
Understanding that it signed with the G7 in Ottawa, which provides for the closure
of Chernobyl by the year 2000;
<P>         
<DD>6. Calls for least-cost studies to be made a precondition for the granting of aid;
<P>         
<DD>7. Calls on the Commission to continue the Chernobyl project, which provides medical
aid to Ukraine, Belarus and Russia, and requests that aid to victims of the disaster be
reinforced, as well as support for NGOs participating in this aid;
<P>         
<DD>8. Calls on the Commission to submit to it an assessment of the impact of the Chernobyl
disaster on public health, the environment and agriculture in the countries of the
European Union;
<P>
<DD>9. Requests the Commission to inform, as a priority, Parliament's competent committees
of the results of the study carried out within the framework of ECHO, the preparation
for nuclear disasters in the countries of Eastern Europe and the action it intends to
take following these conclusions, not only in regard to these countries, but also in
regard to the European Union which would also be affected by another nuclear
disaster:
<P>
<DD>10. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Commission, the Council, the
governments of the Member States, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the
G7, the CIS and the IAEA.

<B>TEXT OF PRESS RELEASE OF THE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF AUSTRALIA</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
China has today announced that it has conducted a nuclear test and declared that it will observe a moratorium on testing from tomorrow.
<P>
The Australian Government has consistently opposed nuclear testing by any state and this latest test is no exception.  I have called in the Chinese Ambassador this afternoon and made this point to him.  I also made clear in Jakarta last week to Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen that Australia was strongly opposed to any further Chinese tests.
<P>
Nonetheless I warmly welcome the Chinese announcement that it will observe a  moratorium on nuclear testing tomorrow.  For the first time ever, this will mean that all five nuclear weapon states will be observing testing moratoria.  This is an historic development.
<P>
I urge the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva to conclude a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty promptly.  This Treaty will mark a definitive end to all nuclear testing.
<P>
The Conference on Disarmament resumes in Geneva later tonight to consider a draft Treaty text prepared by the Chair of the negotiations.  I call on China, and all other members of the Conference on Disarmament, to support the Chair's text so that the Treaty can be referred to the UN General Assembly and opened for signature in September as called for by the international community.

<B>TEXT OF STATEMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA<A HREF="#note_1"><SUP>*/</SUP></A></B>
</CENTER>
<P>
On 29 July 1996, China successfully conducted a nuclear test. The Government of the People's Republic of China hereby solemnly declares that it will start a moratorium on nuclear testing effective from 30 July 1996. Such an important decision by China is not only a response to the appeal of the vast number of non-nuclear weapon states, but also a concrete action to promote nuclear disarmament.
<P>
Over the past three decades and more since its first nuclear test on 16 October 1964, China has established a capable and effective nuclear self-defense force. In a pioneering spirit of self-reliance, sustaining hardships and personal sacrifices, a large number of Chinese workers, Scientific and technical personnel, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, as well as all the staff working on the front of national defense have made strenuous efforts under extremely difficult conditions in the research, manufacture and development of China's nuclear weapons. Their indelible historical feats have greatly boosted the morale of the Chinese people and enhanced China's capability to safeguard peace. The Chinese Government and people wish to extend cordial greetings and pay high respect to them.
<P>
Adhering to its independent foreign policy of peace, China has always stood for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. Historical circumstances compelled China to develop nuclear weapons. For more than a century, the Chinese nation experienced untold sufferings and scourges of war inflicted upon by foreign aggressors. After the founding of new China, it was still subjected to the threat of war, including that of nuclear weapons. In order to survive and develop, China was left with no other alternative. Our development of a limited nuclear capability is not aimed at threatening other people, but is solely for self-defense with a view to maintaining independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, and ensuring a peaceful life of the people. Moreover, our development of nuclear weapons is to safeguard world peace, counter nuclear blackmail and nuclear threat, prevent nuclear war and ultimately destroy all nuclear weapons.
<P>
Since the very first day when China came into possession of nuclear weapons, China has solemnly declared that at no time and under no circumstances will it be the first to use nuclear weapons. China has also undertaken unconditionally not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon states or nuclear weapon-free zones. China is the only nuclear weapon-state in the world that has made and abided by such commitments. China has never deployed nuclear weapons outside its border, nor has it ever used or threatened to use nuclear weapons against other countries.
<P>
China is a peace-loving country and an important force for the maintenance of world peace and stability. China is in favor of reaching a comprehensive ban on nuclear weapon test explosions in the process towards the objective of complete nuclear disarmament. China has taken an active part in the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) negotiations in Geneva, and is striving for the conclusion, within this year and on consensus basis, of a fair, reasonable and verifiable CTBT with universal adherence and unlimited duration. China is ready to work with other members of the international community to this end.
<P>
Halting nuclear tests is an important step towards nuclear disarmament. In order to remove once and for all the threat of nuclear war hanging over mankind and achieve lasting peace and universal security throughout the world, the Chinese Government hereby appeals to all the countries, nuclear weapon states in particular, for the following:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Major nuclear weapon states should abandon their policy of nuclear deterrence. States with huge nuclear arsenals should continue to drastically reduce their nuclear stockpiles.
<P>
<LI>All nuclear weapon states should undertake not to be the first to use nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstances, commit themselves unconditionally not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon states or nuclear-weapon-free zones, and conclude, at an early date, international legal instruments to such effect.
<P>
<LI> States with nuclear weapons deployed outside their borders should withdraw all these weapons home. All nuclear weapon states should pledged their support to the establishment of nuclear weapon-free zones, respect their status as such and undertake corresponding obligations.
<P>
<LI>No country should develop and deploy space weapon systems or missile defense systems undermining strategic security and stability.
<P>
<LI>An international convention on the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons should be concluded through negotiations with the participation of all states.
</OL>
<P>
To realize the goal of a nuclear weapon-free world and ensure the enjoyment of peace, security, stability and prosperity by all countries is the strong aspiration of all people. We sincerely hope that there should never be a nuclear war. We are convinced that with the concerted efforts of all peace-loving countries and people around the world, nuclear war is preventable. If mankind can produce nuclear weapons in the 20th century, it can very well destroy such weapons in the 21st century. The Chinese Government and people are ready to join the governments and people around the world for the realization of this lofty goal.

<B>29 July 1996
<BR>
Press Release</B>
<P>
<CENTER>PRIME MINISTER CONDEMNS CHINESE NUCLEAR TEST</CENTER>
<P>
"New Zealand condemns this latest Chinese test" the Prime Minister, Rt Hon Jim Bolger said today. He was reacting to reports of an official Chinese announcement of a Chinese test at its site in Lop Nor.
<P>
"This test is particularly disappointing" the Prime Minister said. He observed that the Conference on Disarmament resumes work, this evening, on the draft text of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. "To test on the eve of these key negotiations resuming could not be more unfortunate" the Prime Minister observed.
<P>
"Although we welcome China's earlier undertaking that it will henceforth observe a moratorium on testing, China must go further" the Prime Minister continued. "China should respect the will of the international community and cease testing for all time". It can do so by joining with other countries to promptly conclude the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty" said the Prime Minister.
<P>
"New Zealand will lodge firm protests with the Chinese Government" the Prime Minister announced. Rt Hon Don McKinnon will call in the Chinese Ambassador to deliver New Zealand's protest and New Zealand's Ambassador in Beijing will tonight be instructed to register New Zealand's concerns at a senior level in Beijing.
<P>
Only last week Foreign Ministers in the Asean Regional Forum, including New Zealand's Don McKinnon, looked forward to an Asia-Pacific free of nuclear testing. "In condemning China's latest test, we hope it will also be the last such explosion in any region for all time" the Prime Minister concluded.

Mesdames, Sir,
<P>
I have the honour to refer to your letter of 29 August 1996 regarding certain references to "Yugoslavia. and "the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)" in the Annual Report for 1995 in connection with Agency membership and participation in international treaties. I wish to note the following.
<P>
With respect to participation of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) in the Agency, you will recall that on 24 September 1992 the IAEA General Conference adopted resolution GC(XXXVI)/RES/576 on this matter. This resolution is in line with the similar resolution adopted on 22 September 1992 by the United Nations General Assembly, i.e. A/RES/4711 which governs the position of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) in the United Nations.
<P>
The operative part of resolution 576 provides that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) "cannot continue automatically the membership of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the IAEA" and that it "should apply for membership in the Agency". The only practical consequence the resolution draws is that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) "shall not take any further part in the work of the Board and the General Conference".
<P>
The resolution does not terminate or suspend Yugoslavia's membership in the Agency. This interpretation is consistent with the interpretation and implementation by the United Nations of the above-mentioned General Assembly resolution. In a letter to the Director General dated 29 September 1992, the United Nations Legal Counsel gave the following interpretation of that resolution:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
".. the only practical consequence that the resolution draws is that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) shall not participate in the work of the General Assembly, its subsidiary organs nor conferences and meetings convened by it. ... The resolution neither terminates nor suspends Yugoslavia's membership in the Organization. ...The resolution does not take away the right of Yugoslavia to participate in the work of organs other than Assembly bodies ..."
</BLOCKQUOTE>

As regards participation by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) in international treaties, neither the United Nations General Assembly resolution 47/1 nor the IAEA General Conference resolution 576 addresses this question. On 29 April 1992, the IAEA Director General received a Note, N 331/92 dated 27 April 1992, from the Permanent Mission of "the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Federal Republic of Yugoslavia)" stating, inter alia, that "the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia shall continue to fulfil all the rights conferred to and obligations assumed by the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in international relations, including ... participation in treaties ratified or acceded to by Yugoslavia..
<P>
On 26 January 1993, by means of a depositary notification, the Director General brought the content of the above-mentioned statement to the attention of Member States and Parties to the international treaties for which he is depositary. The statement was also communicated to the United Nations which, by a letter dated 3 August 1994, informed the IAEA Secretariat that it was registered with the United Nations.
<P>
In the absence of a decision by a competent organ representative of the international community as a whole or by a competent treaty organ with regard to a particular treaty, the Director General as the depositary for certain treaties, cannot do otherwise than to maintain references to Yugoslavia in the status lists for those treaties. This is, of course, without prejudice to succession rights of other successor States in respect of the treaties registered with the IAEA. In fact, acts of succession which they have notified to the IAEA Director General have been duly registered.
<P>
The IAEA approach is consistent with that of the United Nations Secretary-General. The United Nations publication "Summary of Practice of the Secretary-General as Depositary of Multilateral Treaties. (ST/LEG/8), issued in 1994, states that resolution A/RESl47/1 is without effect on the capacity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) to participate in treaties deposited with the Secretary-General subject to any decision taken by a competent organ representing the international community of States as a whole or by a competent treaty organ with regard to a particular treaty or convention. Further, the United Nations publication "Multilateral Treaties Deposited with the Secretary-General. (ST/LEG/SER.E/14) for 1996 refers to "Yugoslavia" in the status lists of a number of treaties. For example, "Yugoslavia" is shown as having ratified the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations on 1 April 1963; the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties on 27 August 1970; and the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on 5 May 1986. Furthermore, subsequent to the adoption of the above-mentioned resolution of the UN General Assembly "Yugoslavia" is shown as having signed and ratified, on 23 December 1993, the Protocol of 1993 Extending the International Agreement on Olive Oil and Table Olives, 1986, and as having signed on 8 December 1994 the Agreement to Establish the South Centre.
<P>
There are other comparable examples in other organizations which can be cited. For example, a recent publication of the World Intellectual Property Organization (ref.: 423(E) dated 1 January 1996) regarding the status of the treaties administered by it contains references to "Yugoslavia" as party to several treaties both before and after the adoption of United Nations General Assembly resolution A/RESl47/1.

<P>
I should like specifically to address now the data given on page 68 of the Annual Report for 1995. I should point out that the data in the Annual Report for 1995 about the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) not given in any any capacity, because, as you know, the Director General of the IAEA is not depositary for that Treaty. Thus, the data in the table concerning the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) simply reflects information about the NPT as relevant to the application of the safeguards agreement in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). In the absence of information to the contrary from the depositaries of the NPT, the IAEA Secretariat has used the latest information available to it in this regard.
<P>
Accept, Mesdames, Sir, the assurances of my highest consideration.

Director General, Excellency,
<P>
We have the honour to refer to your letter of 17 September 1996, regarding certain references to "Yugoslavia" and "the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)" in connection with Agency membership and participation in international treaties.
<BR>
We wish to note the 
following.
<P>
With regard to the status of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) in the IAEA our Governments would like to express their disagreement with the interpretation contained in your letter that "... the only practical consequence the resolution draws is that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) shall not take any further part in the work of the Board and the General Conference ..." (i.e. IAEA GC(XXXVI)/RES/576).
<P>
It has been the consistent position of our Governments that the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has ceased to exist and that no State represents its continuation. This position is fully consistent with relevant United Nations Security Council and General Assembly resolutions as well as with the opinions of the Arbitration Commission of the International Conference on the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
H.E. Dr. Hans Blix
<BR>
Director General
<BR>
International Atomic Energy  Agency
<BR>
VIENNA
<P>
In Security Council resolution 777(1992) of 19 September 1992, the Council considered that "the State formerly known as the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has ceased to exist", that ''the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) cannot continue automatically the membership of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the United Nations" and it recommended to the General Assembly that "it decide that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)  should apply for membership in the United Nations". In General Assembly resolution 47/1 of 22 September 1992, the Assembly responded to the Security Council's recommendation and decided "that Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) should apply for membership in the United Nations". We would like to recall also the Security Council resolution 1022(1995) of 22 November 1995 in which the Council confirmed with regard to the State formerly known as the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia "that that State had ceased to exist".
<P>
In fact, five successor States have emerged from the dissolution of the SFRY,  each with equal rights and duties in respect of international law dealing with the succession of States. Thus, it is incumbent upon Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) to apply for membership of the United Nations if it wishes to join this World Organisation in the same manner as the other four successor States have done.
<P>
Therefore, the only consistent legal interpretation of those resolutions is that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is not a member of United Nations. The same interpretation should mutatis mutandis apply to the IAEA.
<P>
Our Governments would like to express their disagreement also with the reference in your letter that "... the Director General as the depository for certain treaties, cannot do otherwise than to maintain references to Yugoslavia in the status lists for those treaties ...". As far as this question is concerned similar arguments as those mentioned above might be put forward. Let us just inform you that there are examples of depositories who have applied the above mentioned resolutions to treaties to which former SFRY was a party by deleting references to Yugoslavia (Council of Europe, Hague Conference on Private International Law, etc.).
<P ALIGN=RIGHT>
./. 
</P>
<P>
In this connection we would like to reiterate that our Governments do not object the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia participation in those treaties as one of the successor states that has officiary notified its succession, but not on a basis of claim the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to be a sole State continuing the international personality of the former SRFY.
<P>
In this regard we would like to call your attention to the fact that in your letter there is no clear distinction made between the former SFRY and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia with regard to participation in treaties which is a reason for our concern. Our Governments firmly believe that it is an obligation of depositories to make precise references to states party to treaties to which they have assumed the depository function and accordingly expects from depositories to make an appropriate distinction between the ratification of a treaty by former SFRY which ceased to exist and possible participation of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as one of the successor states of former SFRY.
<P>
We would like to request your kind assistance in bringing the content of this letter to the attention of all Members of the IAEA, bearing also in mind the official document of the fortieth regular session of the IAEA General Conference, GC(40)/INF/10 of 16 September 1996.
<P>
Please accept, Excellency, the assurances of our highest consideration.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
On the 27th November 1996, a historic event took place on Belarusian soil, in the small town of Yatsuki, the last inter-continental ballistic missile left the frontiers of the Republic of Belarus, leaving an area of 207,600 square km in the centre of Europe nuclear free.
<P>
Following the break-up of the USSR, a young state - the Republic of Belarus - was the first in the world to give up voluntarily, as a sign of good will, the possession of nuclear weapons and announced a nuclear-free policy.
<P>
In April 1992, Belarus announced the completion of the withdrawal to Russia of all the tactical nuclear warheads deployed on Belarusian territory in compliance with the Treaty on the Liquidation of Medium- and Long-Range Missiles signed by the USSR and the USA.
<P>
On 4th February 1993, the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Belarus ratified the Treaty on the Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Armaments of 31 July 1991 and the related Lisbon Protocol of 25 May 1992, and also took a decision that Belarus sign up to the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in the capacity of a signatory country not owning such weapons.
<P>
On 2nd-3rd December, a meeting of heads of state and government of the OSCE member countries is held in Lisbon to decide on the issue of building a new Europe. Four years ago, by signing the protocol on joining the Treaty on Strategic Nuclear Weapons in Lisbon, Belarus demonstrated to the world community the peace-loving nature of its foreign policy and its aspiration to make a weighty contribution to the matter of strengthening European and global security. The withdrawal of nuclear weapons from the territory of Belarus is clear proof of its course towards reducing the nuclear threat, which it undertook four years ago.
<P>
On 24th September 1996, Belarus was one of the first countries to sign the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, in accordance with which its signatory countries undertake not to carry out any nuclear test explosions.
<P>
The withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Belarusian territory marks a new stage in the history of our country. We are gratefull to all the states and international organisations which directly or indirectly helped and are helping us to implement the Treaty on Strategic Offensive Weapons.
<P>
We are convinced that the guarantees of security given to Belarus at the OSCE  summit in Budapest in 1994 by the heads of state and government of the USA, Russia and Great Britian, should become, after the withdrawal of nuclear weapons, one of the guarantors of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our country.
<P>
We are convinced that the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from the territory of the Republic of Belarus creates a sound platform for the implementation of the initiative on creating a nuclear-free space in the centre of Europe which was put forward by the President of Belarus on 3rd June 1996.
<P>
The successful implementation of the idea of creating a nuclear-free zone in the centre of Europe could become one of the most effective paths to reducing tension in Europe and in international relations as a whole, easing anxiety in connection with the planned NATO expansion and the announcements by certain countries in eastern Europe of their willingness to accommodate NATO nuclear weapons on their territories. The idea of creating a nuclear-free zone is an important step on the path to strengthening the international regime of nuclear non-proliferation; it does not contradict present-day military and political realities in Europe and does not encroach upon anybody's national interests.
<P>
After the withdrawal of the last Russian nuclear missiles from tile territory of Belarus a nuclear-free zone in central and eastern Europe has <I>de facto</I> been created. In our view, this can and should be legally secured.
<P>
The Republic of Belarus expects that its position on issues of nuclear disarmament will be properly evaluated and supported by the international community.

Abuses of Privilege

abuse of a privilege or immunity has occurred shall be settled by
a procedure in accordance with section 34.  If it is found that
such an abuse has occurred, the State party to this Agreement
affected by such abuse has the right, after notification to the

diplomatic procedure applicable to diplomatic envoys accredited
to that country;
<P>
<DD>(b) In the case of an official to whom section 20 is not
applicable, no order to leave the country shall be issued by the
territorial authorities other than with the approval of the
Foreign Minister of the country in question, and such approval
shall be given only after consultation with the Director General
of the Agency; and, if expulsion proceedings are taken against an

General and other officials of a rank not lower than head of
division of the Agency, travelling on United Nations
laissez-passer on the business of the Agency, shall be granted
the same
facilities for travel as are accorded to officials of comparable
rank in diplomatic missions.

<P>
Settlement of Disputes
</CENTER>

parties to have recourse to another mode of settlement, all
differences arising out of the interpretation or application of
the present Agreement shall be referred to the International
Court of Justice, in accordance with the Statute of the Court.

reason of the location in the territory of that State of the
Agency's Headquarters or regional offices, or of officials,
experts, materials, equipment or facilities in connexion with
Agency projects or activities, including the application of
safeguards to an Agency project or other arrangement.  This
Agreement shall not be deemed to prevent the conclusion between
the Agency and any State party thereto of supplemental agreements
adjusting the provisions of this Agreement or extending or
curtailing the privileges and immunities thereby granted.
<P>
<I>Section 37.</I>  This Agreement shall not itself operate so as
to abrogate, or derogate from, any provisions of the Statute of
the Agency or any rights or obligations which the Agency may
otherwise have, acquire or assume.
<P>
<CENTER>
ARTICLE XII

Member of the Agency, or until a revised agreement has been
approved by the Board of Governors and that Member has become a
party to this revised agreement, provided that if a Member files
a notification of denunciation with the Director General this
Agreement shall cease to be in force with respect to such Member
one year after the receipt of such notification by the Director
General.
<P>
<I>Section 40.</I>  At the request of one-third of the States
parties to this Agreement, the Board of Governors of the Agency

inter alia:
<BLOCKQUOTE>         
'In so far as the Government, for important administrative
considerations, may be unable to grant the IAEA exemption from
indirect taxes which constitute part of the cost of goods
purchased by or services rendered to the IAEA, the Government

<P>
CONSIDERING that the International Atomic Energy Agency
(hereinafter called "the IAEA") and the Republic of Austria have
agreed in Section 3 of the Agreement between the International
Atomic  Energy Agency and the Republic of Austria of 11 December
1957 regarding the Headquarters of the International Atomic
Energy Agency (hereinafter called "the Headquarters
Agreement") <I>(INFCIRC/15)</I> that the headquarters seat shall
be defined in supplemental agreements,
<P>         
BEARING IN MIND that ln accordance with Section 5 of the
Headquarters Agreement the IAEA may establish and operate
research and other technical facilities subject to appropriate
safeguards which, in the case of facilities which might create
hazards to health or safety or interfere with property, shall be
agreed with the appropriate Austrian authorities,
<P>         
BEING AWARE that in accordance with Section 6 of the Headquarters
Agreement the appropriate Austrian authorities shall, at the
request of the IAEA, make arrangements, on such term  and in such
manner as may be agreed upon by supplemental agreement, for the
acquisition or use by the IAEA of appropriate premises  for  such
purposes and for the inclusion of such premises in the
headquarters seat,
<P>         
REALIZING that according to Section 8(c) of the Headquarters
Agreement the particular status  of the headquarters seat shall
not prevent the application of the fire protection or sanitary
regulations of the appropriate Austrian authorities,
<P>         
RECOGNIZING the IAEA's duty under Section 11 of the Headquarters
Agreement to take all reasonable step  to ensure that the
amenities of the land in the vicinity of the headquarters seat
are not prejudiced by any use made of the land or buildings in
the headquarters seat,
<P>         
The IAEA and the Republic of Austria (hereinafter called the
Parties) have agreed as follows:
<P>
<CENTER>
Article I
</CENTER>
<P> 
<DL>
<DD>(1) The Laboratories operated by the IAEA at Seibersdorf
(hereinafter called "the Laboratories") are considered part of
the headquarters seat within the meaning of Section 1(f) and
Section 3 of the Headquarters Agreement.
<P>
<DD>(2) In accordance with Section 3 of the Headquarters
Agreement the Laboratories shall be defined in technical
agreements to be concluded under Article II paragraph 2 of the
present agreement.

<CENTER>
Article II
</CENTER>
<P>
<DL>
<DD>(1) The IAEA undertakes, as provided for in Section 5 of the
Headquarters Agreement, to operate the Laboratories in accordance
with appropriate safeguards.
<P>         
<DD>(2) To the extent provided for in Section 5 of the
Headquarters Agreement the competent Austrian authorities and the
IAEA shall agree on these safeguards and accordingly conclude
appropriate technical agreements based on the relevant Austrian
legislation and corresponding international standards.
<P>         
<DD>(3) The technical agreements referred to in paragraph 2 above
shall be amended at the request of either Party, in order to
adapt them to changes in the relevant Austrian legislation and
corresponding international standards and to take account of new
scientific developments and the experience gained during the
operation of the Laboratories.
<P>         
<DD>(4) The operation of the Laboratories shall be conducted in
such a manner that handled amounts of radioactive material and
waste of such material will be kept to the minimum possible, with
regard to radioactivity and radiotoxicity, taking into account
the objectives of the Laboratories. Should accumulation of waste
containing nuclear material occur which, from the point of view
of either quality or quantity might be considered a matter of
concern, consultations shall be entered into at any time at the
request of either Party with a view to agreeing upon appropriate
measures to be taken.
</DL>
<P>
<CENTER>
Article III
</CENTER>
<P>
In addition to regular inspections which are carried out by the
IAEA in accordance with its own rules and procedures and in which
Austrian experts may participate, joint inspection tours shall be
conducted by representatives of the competent Austrian
authorities and officials of the IAEA at the request of either
Party with a view to ensuring that the relevant safeguards are
duly implemented. Both sides may be accompanied by experts.
<P>
<CENTER>

<DL>
<DD>(1) In case of incidents which may involve radiation danger
to persons or property, the IAEA shall inform the competent
Austrian authorities without delay and, if necessary, request
assistance from them in order to bring the situation under
control. Such assistance shall be given immediately. The IAEA
shall render all necessary assistance to the Austrian authorities
in the exercise of their functions under this paragraph.
<P>
<DD>(2) If the IAEA is unable to bring under control an incident
requiring immediate action for the protection of persons or
property from grave and imminent danger, the representatives of
the Austrian authorities may enter the Laboratories to take the
necessary measures. In that case, appropriate consultations of
the Austrian authorities with the IAEA will take place as soon as
possible.

decision of an Austrian court is not reimbursed by the insurer to
the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Austria shall be
entitled to claim indemnification directly from the IAEA.
<P>

AGENCY SAFEGUARDS RELATING TO LARGE REACTOR FACILITIES
</CENTER>
<P>
<DL>
<OL>
<DT>A.  Introduction
<P>
<LI>The safeguards provisions set forth in document INFCIRC/26
(hereinafter referred to as the "principal safeguards
document"), except those in sections V.B and C thereof and as
otherwise specified herein, will also apply to reactors of 100
or more thermal megawatts and to the source and special
fissionable material used or produced in them.  The following
additional provisions relate to reactor facilities of 100 or
more thermal megawatts and also to other reactor facilities to
which the table in paragraph 65 of the principal safeguards
document does not extend (together hereinafter referred to as
"large reactor facilities").
<P>
<DT>B.  Attachment to special fissionable materials produced in
large reactor facilities
<P>
<LI>The provisions for the attachment of safeguards contained
in the principal safeguards document and in paragraph 3 below
will relate to all generations of special fissionable material
derived from special fissionable material produced in a large
reactor facility, notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary in that document.  The procedures of application will
be in accordance with the safeguards procedures in effect at
the time of such application.
<P>
<LI>With respect to a large reactor facility to which Agency
safeguards are not attached, Agency safeguards will be
attached at least to such fraction of the special fissionable
material produced in the reactor as is equal to the ratio of
the fissionable isotopes <I>("fissionable isotopes" means the
isotopes uranium-233, uranium-235 and plutonium-239)</I> within
the nuclear material to which
Agency safeguards are attached to all fissionable isotopes in
the reactor.  If this ratio is greater than 0.3, safeguards
will be attached to all such material produced in the reactor. 
The ratio will be calculated on the basis of estimated average
values for the period specified in the appropriate agreement.
<I>(This paragraph constitutes an interpretation of paragraph 35
of the principal safeguards document).</I>
<P>
<DT>C.  Procedures to supplement those in section V.A of the
principal safeguards document
<P>
<DD>(a)  Routine reports
<P>
<LI>The required frequency of routine reports for a large
reactor facility shall not exceed twelve a year.
<P>
<LI>If requested, the State shall make available to the Agency
progress reports on the construction of a large reactor
facility, starting when construction has reached an advanced
stage as specified in the appropriate agreement.  These
reports shall provide such information on the current
condition of the facility as is relevant to the application of
safeguards, and a forecast of the further work planned for the
following four-month period.  Not more than four such reports
shall be required annually.
<P>
<DD>(b)  Frequency of routine inspections
<P>
<LI>The maximum frequency of routine inspections during and
after the construction of a large reactor facility shall be as
shown in or as obtained by extrapolation from the table in
paragraph 65 of the principal safeguards document.  If such
extrapolation indicates a frequency in excess of twelve per
year, the Agency's inspectors shall have access to the
facility at all times.  In determining the inspection
requirements for a particular facility, due account shall be
taken of paragraphs 63 and 64, and of the considerations in
subparagraphs (a) to (d) of paragraph 65, of the principal
safeguards document.

I.  GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS
<P>
A.  THE PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT
</CENTER>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Pursuant to Article II of its Statute the Agency has the
task of seeking "to accelerate and enlarge the contribution of
atomic energy to peace, health and prosperity throughout the
world".  Inasmuch as the technology of nuclear energy for
peaceful purposes is closely coupled with that for the
production of materials for nuclear weapons, the same Article
of the Statute provides that the Agency "shall ensure, so far
as it is able, that assistance provided by it or at its
request or under its supervision or control is not used in
such a way as to further any military purpose".
<P>
<LI>The principal purpose of the present document is to
establish a system of controls to enable the Agency to comply
with this statutory obligation with respect to the activities
of Member States in the field of the peaceful uses of nuclear
energy, as provided in the Statute.  The authority to
establish such a system is provided by Article III.A.5. of the
Statute, which authorizes the Agency to "establish and
administer safeguards designed to ensure that special
fissionable and other materials, services, equipment,
facilities, and information made available by the Agency or
at its request or under its supervision or control are not
used in such a way as to further any military purpose".  This
Article further authorizes the Agency to "apply safeguards, at
the request of the parties, to any bilateral or multilateral
arrangement, or at the request of a State, to any of that
State's activities in the field of atomic energy".  Article
XII.A sets forth the rights and responsibilities that the
Agency is to have, to the extent relevant, with respect to any
project or arrangement which it is to safeguard.
<P>
<LI>The principles set forth in this document and the
procedures for which it provides are established for the
information of Member States, to enable them to determine in
advance the circumstances and manner in which the Agency would
administer safeguards, and for the guidance of the organs of
the Agency itself, to enable the Board and the Director
General to determine readily what provisions should be
included in agreements relating to safeguards and how to
interpret such provisions.
<P>
<LI>Provisions of this document that are relevant to a
particular project, arrangement or activity in the field of
nuclear energy will only become legally binding upon the entry
into force of a <I>safeguards agreement<A
HREF="#note_a">*</A></I> and to the extent that they are
incorporated therein.  Such incorporation may be made by
reference.
<P>
<LI>Appropriate provisions of this document may also be
incorporated in bilateral or multilateral arrangements between
Member States, including all those that provide for the
transfer to the Agency of responsibility for administering
safeguards.  The Agency will not assume such responsibility
unless the principles of the safeguards and the procedures to
be used are essentially consistent with those set forth in
this document.
<P>
<LI>Agreements incorporating provisions from the earlier
version of the Agency's safeguards system (set forth in documents
<A HREF="inf26.html">INFCIRC/26</A> and <A
HREF="inf26a1.html">Add.1</A>) will continue to be
administered in accordance with such provisions, unless all
States parties thereto request the Agency to substitute the
provisions of the present document.
<P>
<LI>Provisions relating to types of <I>principal nuclear
facilities</I>, other than <I>reactors</I>, which may produce,
process or use safeguarded <I>nuclear material</I> will be
developed as necessary.
<P>
<LI>The principles and procedures set forth in this document
shall be subject to periodic review in the light of the
further experience gained by the Agency as well as of
technological developments.
<P>

Director General may authorize to have such information by
reason of their official duties in connection with safeguards,
any commercial or industrial secret or any other confidential
information coming to his knowledge by reason of the
implementation of safeguards by the Agency.
<P>
<LI>The Agency shall not publish or communicate to any State,
organization or person any information obtained by it in
connection with the implementation of safeguards, except that:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>
(a)  Specific information relating to such implementation in a
State may be given to the Board and to such Agency staff
members as require such knowledge by reason of their official
duties in connection with safeguards, but only to the extent
necessary for the Agency to fulfil its safeguards
responsibilities;
<P>
<DD>(b)  Summarized lists of items being safeguarded by the
Agency may be published upon decision of the Board; and

<CENTER>
<B>Principles of implementation</B>

</CENTER>
<P>
<LI>The Agency shall implement safeguards in a State if:
<P>
<DL>
<DD>
(a)  The Agency has concluded with the State a <I>project
agreement</I> under which materials, services, equipment,
facilities or information are supplied, and such agreement
provides for the application of safeguards; or
<P>
<DD>(b)  The State is a party to a bilateral or multilateral
arrangement under which materials, services, equipment,
facilities or information are supplied or otherwise
transferred, and:
<DL>
<DD>
(i)  All the parties to the arrangement have requested the
Agency to administer safeguards; and
<DD>(ii)  The Agency has concluded the necessary <I>safeguards
agreement</I> with the State; or
</DL>
<P>
<DD>
(c)  The Agency has been requested by the State to safeguard
certain nuclear activities under the latter's jurisdiction,
and the Agency has concluded the necessary <I>safeguards
agreement</I> with the State.
</DL>
<P>
<LI>In the light of Article XII.A.5 of the Statute, it is
desirable that <I>safeguards agreements</I> should provide for
the continuation of safeguards, subject to the provisions of this
document, with respect to produced special fissionable
material and to any materials substituted therefor.
<P>
<LI>The principal factors to be considered by the Board in
determining the relevance of particular provisions of this
document to various types of materials and facilities shall be
the form, scope and amount of the assistance supplied, the
character of each individual project and the degree to which
such assistance could further any military purposes.  The
related <I>safeguards agreement</I> shall take account of all
pertinent circumstances at the time of its conclusion.
<P>
<LI>In the event of any non-compliance by a State with a
<I>safeguards agreement</I>, the Agency may take the measures set
forth in Articles XII.A.7 and XII.C of the Statute.

the time at which the <I>nuclear material</I> reaches its
destination.
The Agreement should provide that the States concerned shall make
suitable arrangements to determine the point at which the
transfer of responsibility will take place. No State shall be
deemed to have such responsibility for <I>nuclear material</I>

chemical composition, the physical form, and the quantity of the
material and/or the type and capacity of the equipment or
facility involved, the date of shipment, the date of receipt, the

equipment or facilities described in Section 10(a), 10(b)(i) or
10(d). Upon receipt by the Agency of the notification, such
produced material shall be listed in Category I of the Inventory,
provided that any material so produced shall be deemed to be
listed and therefore shall be subject to safeguards by the Agency
from the time it is produced. The Agency may verify the
calculations of the amounts of such materials; appropriate
adjustment in the Inventory shall be made by agreement of the
Parties; pending final agreement of the Parties, the Agency's
calculations shall govern.
<P>         
Section 13. The Government of Sweden shall notify the Agency, by
means of its reports pursuant to the Safeguards Document, of any
nuclear materials required to be listed in Category I of its
Inventory pursuant to Section 10(a)(iv). Upon receipt by the

in Category I of the Inventory, provided that any material so
processed or used shall be deemed to be listed and therefore
shall be subject to safeguards by the Agency from the time it is
processed or used.
<P>         
Section 14. The two Governments shall jointly notify the Agency
of the transfer to the United States of America of any materials,
equipment or facilities listed in the Inventory for the

Section 15. The two Governments shall jointly notify the Agency
of any intended transfer of materials, equipment or facilities
listed in Category I of the Inventory to a recipient which is not
under the jurisdiction of either of the two Governments. Such
materials, equipment or facilities may be transferred and shall
thereupon be deleted from the Inventory, provided that the Agency
may satisfy itself that such materials, equipment or facilities
have been transferred out of the jurisdiction of the Government
of Sweden or the Government of the United States of America, as
the case may be.
<P>         
Section 16. Whenever either Government intends to transfer
material or equipment, listed in Category I of its Inventory, to
a facility within its jurisdiction which the Agency has not
previously accepted for listing in that Government' s Inventory,
any notification that will be required pursuant to Section
9(c) shall be made to the Agency before such transfer is
effected. The Government may make the transfer to that facility
only after the Agency has accepted that notification.
<P>         
Section 17. The notifications provided for in Sections 15 and 16
shall be sent to the Agency sufficiently in advance so as to
enable the Agency to make any arrangements required by these
Sections before the transfer is effected. The Agency shall take
any necessary action promptly. The contents of these
notifications shall conform, as far as appropriate, to the
requirements of Section 11.
<P>

Section 19. The Agency shall terminate safeguards under this
Agreement with respect to those items deleted from an Inventory
as provided in Sections 14(b) and 15. Nuclear material other than
that covered by the preceding sentence shall be deleted from
the Inventory and Agency safeguards thereon shall be terminated
as provided in paragraph 26 and 27 of the Safeguards Document.
<P>
