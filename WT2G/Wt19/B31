<center><h2>Direct Lending Clunker is Already Running out of Gas</h2></center>
<p>
<p>
<center>By <br><a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">Michael Fumento</a>
</center><hr>
<p>
<p> 
Picture a car salesman screaming at you from the television.  "My plan 
will save you billions, BILLIONS, in tax dollars by taking student 
loans away from the banks and cutting out the middleman's profits! But 
there's more! Students will save money, too, because I'm offering them 
lo-lo E-Z payments! I must be crazy to offer such a deal!  That's why 
they call me Crazy Billy!"
<p>
That, if you pardon a wee bit of rhetorical flourish, was President 
Bill Clinton of two years ago. And his pitch worked, as Congress 
enacted his student loan direct lending program.
<p>
And as is so often the case, the vehicle that on the lot looked so 
pretty has turned out to be little more than a bucket of bolts.
<p>
The timing on the direct loan scheme couldn't have been more ironic. 
At a time when former Soviet republics were privatizing everything in 
sight, our government was nationalizing a major industry. Still, two 
government studies, one by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), and 
the other by the General Accounting Office, did calculate that direct 
lending could save money, about $4 billion over the next four years.  
The Clinton Administration made things look sweeter by arbitrarily 
doubling that to $8 billion.  What's a measly $4 billion among 
friends, right?
<p>
A pilot direct-loan program was already in the works, but in the 
atmosphere of arrogance that characterized those early Clinton months, 
the Administration decided there was no need to wait.
<p>
Now even government agencies are saying that this act of reinventing 
government is closer to reinventing the Edsel.
<p>
A new CBO study has actually reversed that agency's position and 
concluded that the best way for government to save money with direct 
lending is to scrap it.  This could save taxpayers $1.5 billion over 
the next seven years.
<p>
The reason for CBO's about face is that its original report compared 
the administrative costs of only a year of the direct lending scheme 
with the full administrative costs of the guaranteed student loan 
system.  When Congress directed the CBO to compare both programs on an 
equal footing, it became clear the result was a jump in government 
spending.
<p>
A new Congressional Research Service report also concludes that the 
Administration was not calculating fully the cost of taking over the 
administration of the program.
<p>
Also a fraud is the part of Crazy Billy's plan which was to help 
students, the E-Z payment part. All it actually does is to stretch out 
payments, the oldest trick in the car salesman's repertoire.  
Currently, students are given 10 years to repay, while under direct 
lending it's 25.  Sure, payments are lower.  But at the end of the 25-
year period a student borrowing the maximum amount allowed, $88,000, 
would end up paying back $167,723 in interest and principle instead of 
$128,400 under the existing plan.
<p>
Moreover you would also have students paying off  their college loans 
even as their own children were going off to college. Instead of a 
chicken in every pot, Clinton's promise is two generations of student 
loans in every family.
<p>
But there's one huge difference between Crazy Billy and other used car 
salesmen.  No one forces you to buy from a used car lot.
<p>
Crazy Billy says he won't force anyone to buy his plan, either.   
Repeatedly he's stated that direct government lending will be a matter 
of choice for schools.  As late as April of this year he spoke of 
making "the student loan program available to all the schools on a 
voluntary basis . . . "
<p>
Yet Clinton's current budget proposal indicates that all colleges and 
universities will be in the program by 1997-98.  Education Secretary 
William Riley has affirmed in a letter to Tennessee Democratic 
Representative Bart Gordon, a direct lending opponent, that under the 
presidents's plan, by the 1997-98 school year "all schools would be 
required to participate."
<p>
So much for "voluntary."
<p>
The obvious reason for this conscription is the same as for any--that 
volunteerism isn't working.  While the law allows up to 40% of loan 
volume by 1995-96, recent reports from the GAO and the Advisory 
Committee on Student Financial Assistance state that direct lending 
participation will actually be around 30%.  Far from flocking to join 
the program, institutions have been scrambling to get out.  Earlier 
this year the GAO stated that 104 institutions have abandoned their 
Crazy Billy direct lending vehicle by the side of the road. 
<p>
Yet while legitimate four- and two-year institutions have been 
steering clear of the government program, it has become a haven for 
hundreds of high-default trade schools with questionable credentials.  
Almost half the direct loans are to students of trade schools, with a 
third of all loans going to students of barber or beauty academies.  
The default rate for student loans from trade schools averages 30%, 
compared with only 7% for four-year colleges.  For all his trouble in 
taking over the student loan program, Uncle Sam is going to get stuck 
holding a lot of useless notes.
<p>
A recent poll sponsored by direct lending opponents indicates that 
almost three-fourths of the public believes that the pre-Clinton 
system of private industry making loans which the government 
guarantees is better than the Clinton program. Congress should tell 
Crazy Billy that taxpayers aren't the tire-kicking yahoos he thinks we 
are and that we want direct lending sent to the junk yard.

<title>Why Not ID?</title>
</head><center>
<h2>Why Not ID?</h2></center>
<p>
<p>
<hr>
 NEW YORK, JULY 25
<p>
Thirty years ago the philosopher/strategist James Burnham included a 
chapter in his book Suicide of the West in which he undertook to list 
the stands in public policy that distinguish the American conservative 
from the American liberal. For instance? Capital punishment: most 
conservatives are in favor of it, most liberals against. Gun control, 
the other way around. Many of the dividing points had to do with 
aspects of foreign policy during the Cold War, no longer relevant. If 
Mr. Burnham were alive and writing today no doubt he'd have included 
in his list strategic anti-missile defense. There is a Grand Canyon 
that divides conservative and liberal opinion on that subject.
<p>
We paleos (for "paleolithic conservatives": i.e., those of us who were 
conservative beginning way back in past geological eras) were weaned 
in a kind of anti-cyber, anti-computer tradition. Mr. Burnham listened 
with instinctive approval to a classmate who initiated the idea of a 
chain-letter from one friend to two friends to four friends to sixteen 
friends urging a quiet mutiny against numerical identification. The 
idea was always to misplace one digit in anything that requires 
absolutely accurate disclosure. A kind of quiet sabotage of the 
computer age, was the dream. If enough people wrote 123465 where 
123456 was the correct code, then the mighty house of Mainframe would 
come tumbling down.
<p>
It is in fidelity to that tradition that so many conservatives oppose 
any move toward an identification number. Professor Thomas Sowell of 
the Hoover Institution has written that "nothing polarizes the 
political Left and Right like the idea of a national identity card." 
The Nazis and the Communists and indeed the South Africans required an 
ID. Isn't that reason enough for free governments to shrink at the 
thought of it?
<p>
Not in my view. In the past three weeks I have three times been asked 
to give my Social Security number. Why? Presumably because no two 
people have the same Social Security number. When we were in the army 
and desired to get free postage, we were required to write our serial 
number on the envelope. When we travel abroad we are required to hand 
over our passports, each one individually numbered. In many situations 
the requirement is to show your driver's license, preferably in states 
in which your picture also appears on that license.
<p>
What then is the reason for such heated opposition to an 
identification number, as has been proposed by various congressmen 
anxious to do something about illegal immigration? The idea, as we 
understand it, is to develop an ID which can't be violated by the 
owner or duplicated by a black marketeer. Presumably what then happens 
is that the young man who asks for a job in a restaurant or at a 
construction firm is asked (under obligation of law) to show his ID. 
If he can't come up with it, he is deemed to be illegal, and doesn't 
get hired.
<p>
What's wrong with that? "Control is the name of the game for 
liberals," Professor Sowell writes, "even when they call it 
'compassion.' A national identity card would not only permit even 
greater government snooping into people's private lives, the 
information gathered would almost inevitably lead to more laws forcing 
more people to do more things the way the politicians want them done. 
It is a down payment on totalitarianism." Mr. Sowell sees a tunnel 
ahead, and the light at the end of it is the complete submission by 
the individual to the government.
<p>
We should concede this, namely that in totalitarian societies an ID is 
absolutely essential. The contrapositive, however, is not justified -- 
that every society that has an ID will become a totalitarian society. 
As noted, already there is an ID of sorts, done by Social Security. As 
a weapon against illegal immigration it is not reliable because it is 
very easy to get a Social Security card. But if a) it is a legitimate 
goal to regulate immigration, then b) the means to do this effectively 
should be there, and c) it would not appear to make sense to deny the 
government instruments that are not inherently cruel or indecent. To 
authorize an ID that merely proves you are who you say you are is not 
the same thing as to authorize a government enema or truth serum.
<p>
On such matters one thinks of George Gilder, the American conservative 
bard of the computer, whose threnodies remind us how much we owe to 
the computer, not least that it enables us, without further ado, to 
establish that we are Americans, entitled to the rights guaranteed us 
under the Constitution.

<hr>
<h2>Have You Ever Had Terminal Blah Time?</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
<P>
We confront, from our pillars of light, every problem that plagues or 
threatens to plague mankind, of every variety. Columnists have written 
on how best to avoid a war or how best to become involved in a war or 
how best to make a Floating Island. With less than a few keystrokes, 
the opinion makers can redesign the Cathedral of Chartres, advising 
where all the mistakes were made, and how they might be avoided. 
Scientific contentions having to do with the best mineral for 
preserving human teeth can become causes celcbres and contestants will 
stand their ground with all their weapons oiled, well poised to 
discredit a silly argument from the other side. But what happens when 
you are sick? 
<P>
A bizarre question, because incapacitating illnesses don't . . . seem 
to happen. We are all familiar with the law that the charismatic 
leader must appear to be immune to the abrasions that hinder mere men 
and women. Sensing this, though the idea was not yet explicated, FDR 
took pains to disguise his infirmity. Fidel Castro, we learned soon 
after his ascendancy in Cuba, simply cancelled all public engagements 
when feeling ill. In such a society as he rules over, it is easier to 
do this than it would be, say, in America, where arbitrary action is 
accepted only when caused by nature. You can cancel a game in the 
World Series because a hurricane got in the way, but not because Joe 
DiMaggio didn't feel well. In 1985 in Washington the weather was so 
cold that the whole inaugural parade was put off. That meant the 
President could not take his oath of office in the usual place, so he 
took it instead in the rotunda of the House of Representatives. And 
everyone knew that it was actually a re-enactment, because the 
constitutional date for taking the office had come the day before, but 
they don't like doing these things on a Sunday.
<P>
But what if one were really sick? A gentleman sent down two weeks ago 
for execution pleaded a postponement on the grounds that he was 
suffering from a terrible head cold and could not take in his own 
execution and that surely this was one of the designs of death-
sentence architects. Suppose that the Queen of England were to be 
crowned on Tuesday and that morning she announced to the Court that 
she simply was not up to it, that sitting up there on the throne for 
two or three hours would constitute a torture she'd find unbearable. 
What then?
<P>
What if she faced the same hideous plight as the columnist stricken 
with some combination of cold, sinus, nose-clog, throat-tightening 
even after two days of antibiotics, when time comes for him to produce 
. . . a column? 
<P>
There are ways to go that dramatize your immobility. Wanda Landowska 
slightly messed up one fugue from a sonata and then closed her 
harpsichord, permanently. Toscanini reacted similarly to a lapse of 
memory. Franz Liszt decided he would no longer perform before large 
audiences and ostentatiously pulled down the piano cover after he was 
through. The statesman of high office is less prone to apocalyptic 
departures from public life, though Charles de Gaulle did that 
exactly. 
<P>
What irks the quotidian analyst is the triviality of the challenge. I 
am not John McCain, whom one would have understood if he had ended any 
attempt at communication after five years in the Vietnamese prison 
camps. It is just, in the great scheme of things, one spark plug that 
won't ignite, not even after submitting it to the one-hundredth 
homeopathic distraction. 
<P>
So that, burrow as you might in these lines in search of an apercu 
worth pocketing, forgive me; my cupboard is bare. <p>

<title>Buckley: Has the WTO Threatened Us? -- 1/23/96</title>

<h2>
Has the WTO Threatened Us?
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
buckley
.html">
William F. Buckley Jr.
</a>

<P>
Well, it happened: the World Trade Organization ruled against an 
existing law, and people are up in arms. Candidates Dole and Buchanan 
have suggested that this is on the order of the British navy moving in 
to restore the crown as sovereign in U.S. affairs.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Here is the quarrel. Brazil and Venezuela, in recent months, attempted 
to bring into the United States what we might as well call "dirty 
oil," meaning that it is oil that contains a higher density of 
pollutants than is permitted by the Clean Air Act. So, we denied that 
oil access to the American market. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A suit was filed with the WTO by Brazil and Venezuela, which asserted, 
correctly, that the same quality of oil turned down at our frontier 
was in fact being pumped, sold, and burned within the United States. 
This is, plain and simple, discriminatory, and of course the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade exists in order to protest 
discriminatory practices.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Now the United States has several defenses, none of them conclusive -- 
they are an attenuation of the violation rather than an excuse for it. 
It happens that the load of oil being permitted to market 
notwithstanding its high pollution content was something on the order 
of an exception. The franchise was given with a view to saving a 
considerable deposit of oil, on the understanding that the 
international standard would be invoked beginning in 1998. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Now if one engages in a treaty of this kind there has to be an arbiter 
somewhere. The disarmament treaties of the Twenties and Thirties 
failed for many reasons, but one of them was that there was no 
effective tribunal to call attention to the violations of Germany, 
Italy, and Japan. For that reason, a court was set up, armed with the 
power to make a finding (subject to appeal) and to levy either a fine, 
if the situation was not rectifiable, or else compensation (to the 
wounded nation or industry). The court, having ruled against the 
United States, has not come through with a specified penalty, and in 
any event, this being the very first ruling the WTO has come through 
with, there is abounding procedural confusion. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One source of the confusion is the motives and political interests of 
the people involved, directly and indirectly. Mickey Kantor is of 
course our trade representative. He is having a hell of a time. On the 
one hand, he very much wants to defend the environmental code approved 
by President Clinton, which means, No dirty oil. On the other hand, he 
desperately wishes to be outside the line of fire directed against 
those who tolerate an extra-national body telling the United States 
what to do. To date, Mr. Kantor has said that in fact the court is 
factually correct; that the court has no right, really, to rule on 
U.S. environmental laws; and that the United States will appeal -- 
probably. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Now the long perspective on the question is that the GATT treaty was a 
dozen years in formation, under the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton 
Administrations, with the Congress as a prime mover. Our motives were 
simple: most trade discrimination in the world is against U.S. 
producers. We have, we thought, and thought correctly, more to gain 
than to lose by endorsing a court that could actually hand down 
rulings of the kind that free up trade. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Bob Dole and Pat Buchanan are talking about the hideous nature of an 
extra-national authority, and Mr. Buchanan even said that when he 
became President, the first thing he would do is repeal the GATT 
treaty. But the U.S. position is made difficult by the simple fact 
that a) we promoted and passed the GATT agreement (while avoiding the 
treaty requirement to come in with two-thirds of the Senate vote), 
endorsing b) a fact-finding body (the court) that would look into 
complaints and c) dispose of sanctions in the event a signatory was 
found guilty of discriminatory practices.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
We now have several alternatives. We can resign from GATT, which would 
be a long-term invitation to restricted trading; or we can pay the 
fine or compensation on the Brazilian and Venezuelan oil; or we can 
modify the Clean Air Act to exempt the privileged producer of the 
dirty oil. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What we can't do is argue that somebody took away our lollipop. We are 
a grown-up nation, and if we pulled a fast one at the expense of a law 
we ourselves promoted and ratified, then we should take the 
punishment. If ever the WTO engages in systematic anti-U.S. rulings, 
why it becomes simple. We pull out. But not before that happens.

<i>12/7/95</i><hr><h2>Ignored Report Says EPA Wrong on Passive Smoking </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><i>Michael Fumento</i> </a>
</center><hr>

<P>

With a man who had torched three buildings  running around Boulder, 
Colorado city police were following smoke trails.  They caught their 
man, and he now faces a fine of $1,000 or 90 days in jail.  No, the 
perpetrator wasn't the arsonist (who was caught that same day); he was 
the owner of a bar  and a violator of Boulder's new anti-smoking law, 
one of the most draconian in the country.
<P>
The Boulder law goes way beyond mandating separate areas for smokers.  
Essentially it demands that smokers be kept away from non-smokers in 
hermetically-sealed rooms, as if they were the germ featured in the 
1971 movie The Andromeda Strain.  But a new report by the 
Congressional Research Service (CRS) finds that the basis for it, as 
well as all the other anti-smoking laws which have swept the country 
since December of 1992, is scientifically bankrupt.
<P>
This refutes a much-publicized 1992 study, conducted by the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which claimed as many as 3,000 
Americans die each year of lung cancer from somebody else's cigarette 
smoke. The EPA based its findings on a combined study (called a meta-
analysis) of 11 separate studies, which between them found 119 lung 
cancers among non-smoking spouses of smokers where 100 would be 
expected. Epidemiologists call this a "risk ratio" of 1.19. 
<P>
At the time, many people including myself criticized the EPA report, 
saying that such a small apparently increased risk (so tiny, in fact, 
that the medical community has rejected much larger ratios as being 
conclusive on other potential carcinogens) that the tiniest problem 
could throw the whole thing off.
<P>
We also questioned the EPA's use of a 90% confidence interval, meaning 
that there was a 10% possibility the results had been arrived at by 
chance.  The gold standard in epidemiology has always been a 95% 
confidence interval, leaving only a 5% possibility of a result 
occurring by chance.  Curiously, the Agency rejected that, in what 
appeared to be a rigging of the results. It was like moving the goal 
post to the three yard line because the football had fallen two yards 
short of a touchdown.
<P>
The new CRS report, which you're hearing about probably for the first 
time here because with the sole exception of the Washington Times (and 
an editorial in Investor's Business Daily) the media decided you 
didn't need to know about it, says we were right and the EPA was 
wrong.
<P>
 That report was produced in response to a proposed Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration ruling that would ban smoking in 
federal workplaces.  It found no basis for such a ban.
<P>
Instead, it said the EPA's meta-analysis showed that, "Even when 
overall risk is considered, it is a very small risk and is not 
statistically significant at the 95% level."
<P>
The CRS also analyzed four other recent passive smoking studies.  Of 
them, only one--by Dr. Elizabeth Fontham--showed a significant 
increased risk.  Two others showed no higher risk and a third showed 
only a slight, statistically insignificant risk.
<P>
As is, that's something of a wash.  But even the Fontham study may not 
actually show an increased risk, said the CRS.  This is because of 
something called "smoker misclassification."  Surveys show that some 
people who claim to be nonsmokers are actually current or former 
smokers.  The EPA has recognized this phenomenon and has built in a 
small safety margin to account for it in the Fontham study.  But 
evidence indicates this safety factor was probably too small, and CRS 
says "a small adjustment could render the overall Fontham  results 
statistically insignificant at the 95% level."
<P>
So the only truly significant positive study would have been rendered 
insignificant.
<P>
Moreover, the CRS noted that the other three studies didn't allow for 
unidentified smokers. Had they done so, the lack of evidence for 
smoking's hazards to innocent bystanders would have been even more 
obvious.   
<P>
The ultimate purpose of the campaign that culminated in the EPA report 
was never to protect non-smokers but to harass and intimidate smokers 
themselves into quitting.  Now it could be said that smokers were in 
effect not just hurting themselves but murdering non-smokers.  So what 
if it's not true?  The end--getting active smokers to quit--justifies 
the means.  Right?
<P>
Such paternalism is obnoxious.  Anybody with two brain cells to rub 
together knows that smoking is harmful and can be fatal. More than a 
hundred years before the famous 1964 surgeon general's report, 
cigarettes were known as "coffin nails." Smokers may be irrational, 
but irrationality within limits is protected in our society.
<P>
Meanwhile, where does such paternalism end?  One of the arresting 
officers in Boulder, a female, was quite corpulent.  (Trendy towns 
like Boulder are willing to overlook beefy cops if it means beefing up 
the number of female officers on the force.) Obesity is considered to 
cause 300,000 premature deaths a year, 100 times the EPA estimate for 
lung cancers caused by passive smoking.  Perhaps that officer should 
arrest the next waiter who puts a plate of Fettuccine Alfredo before 
her.  "Boy, you in a heap  o trouble for heapin' that pasta so high!"
<P>
Perhaps I shouldn't give them any ideas.

<i>NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 28</i>
<hr>
<h2>The Hot Plotters</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
<P>
The search for a greater choice of presidential candidates can't reach 
more desperate lengths than the situation reported over the weekend, 
namely that a Hot Plot has been hatching by means of telephone 
conference calls. Of the seven players who participated in these 
calls, reported to have lasted two hours each, three are relatively 
unknown, the others being Bill Bradley, Gary Hart, Paul Tsongas, and 
Lowell Weicker.
<P>
Time magazine reports that in their last telephone conference, it 
couldn't be settled which of the plotters should enter his name in the 
formal contest. About Senator Bradley there is this problem, namely 
that he would put his audience to sleep if he recited King Harry's 
speech to his soldiers at Agincourt. Mr. Bradley was recently in 
California testing the waters. He found them uniformly cold, if that 
is the right word for waters that react not at all to the finger stuck 
in them seeking Delphic encouragement. 
<P>
Gary Hart, of course, has troubles that date back to his hubristic 
outing on the yacht Monkey Business, the design of which caper has to 
have been to prove that the American voters don't care any more about 
adultery than they are supposed to care about abortion. To be sure, 
Senator Hart, unlike most of the others on the party line last Sunday, 
is a charismatic political campaigner. But when the opportunity came 
up earlier in the year to run for the Senate from his home state, 
Colorado, he decided to pass it up. If you can't count on your home 
state for senator, it doesn't make much sense to go for 26 states.
<P>
Paul Tsongas is an attractive former senator who fired off a Roman 
candle or two during the Democratic primaries in 1992 by calling for a 
reduced federal deficit. He ran into the usual problem, which is that 
most voters are a) in favor of a balanced budget, and b) in favor of 
everything that causes the budget to be unbalanced. In any event, Mr. 
Tsongas has medical problems which are said to have caused him to rule 
himself out as the candidate of the Hot Plotters.
<P>
Lowell Weicker did succeed when he ran as an independent for governor 
of Connecticut, soon after his defeat for re-election as senator at 
the hands of Joseph Lieberman. Governor Weicker's reign calls to mind 
the blurb written by Evelyn Waugh for his friend Nancy Mitford's 
novel. "In 1945," Mr. Waugh wrote, "Miss Mitford voted the socialist 
ticket. Having done her best to make England uninhabitable, she went 
to France to live." It was Mr. Weicker who instituted the income tax 
in Connecticut, which has served no purpose other than to make the 
state less genial than it once was to middle-class residents and to 
corporations, many of which have fled. There is this additional 
problem, which is that Mr. Weicker is the most obnoxious moralist 
since Savonarola, suggesting that any deviation from whatever was his 
most recent political epiphany marks the dissenter as a cretin. 
<P>
So where do we go from here? As regards Bradley - Hart - Tsongas - 
Weicker, the answer is: absolutely nowhere. What their putative 
coalition is meant to say is that there is (their word) a "huge" 
hunger for the kind of politics they represent. How does one reduce 
this agenda into idiomatic political language? Well, the easiest way 
to put it is that they are anti-Newt.
<P>
The Speaker has been having a rough time of it in recent days, and 
some of it is his fault. It isn't a fault you'd score against a 
philosopher, who happily comes up with reticulate bearings to help to 
understand any phenomenon. Years ago, wondering about some political 
quandary, I asked a distinguished historian to trace the cause of the 
problem and he replied unhesitantly, "William of Occam." He meant by 
this the introduction of relativist thought engendered by the denial 
of universals in the fourteenth century.
<P>
Okay, but of course Mr. Gingrich is supposed to speak in an idiomatic 
mode, and when someone calls to his attention a quite awful specimen 
of human depravity, it is not wise, let alone prudent, for him to cite 
federal welfare as the progenitive cause, even if, in a seminar, a 
professor might persuasively track depravity back to welfare, back to 
original sin. But of course the trouble with an etiological search so 
comprehensively concerned to identify the prime cause of human 
misbehavior is that it could finger Newt Gingrich as suffering from 
the sin of intellectual pride.
<P>
But the surviving point has got to be that the courage and the stamina 
of the Speaker have given the voters a vision of something truly 
distinctive from such an awful stew as one gets from the Hot Plotters, 
who don't even have an interesting idiosyncrasy to call attention to 
them.

<title>Fumento: Global Warming Hotheads Use Anything -- 2/6/96</title>

<h2>
Global Warming Hotheads Use Anything to Justify Their Theory 
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Michael Fumento
</a>

<P>  
What if the media told you that declining prices across the board were 
a sign that inflation was again rearing its ugly head?  What if they 
told you that sharp drops in murder and assault rates nationally 
indicated that crime was on the upswing?  Wouldn't you be in the least 
bit suspicious, even if you didn't come from Missouri, the "show-me 
state"? 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That's the sense you may have gotten lately in reading articles in the 
national media about how this incredible bun-freezing winter we've 
been having is evidence of global warming.  When we have an especially 
hot summer, they say it's global warming.  Now that records for cold 
temperatures are snapping like so many icicles and the northeast has 
just dug out of its worst blizzard in decades, we're told that's proof 
of global warming, too.  Ever heard of the expression, "Heads I win; 
tails you lose?" 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But there it was, the cover of the January 22 Newsweek: "Blizzards, 
Floods & Hurricanes:  Blame Global Warming." There also was the New 
York Times front-page article by William K. Stevens: "Blame Global 
Warming for the Blizzard," and a nationally syndicated article by 
environmentalist Jessica Matthews which ran under such titles as 
"Brrr, Global Warming Brings Our Blizzard." 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not surprisingly, these writers have established careers as global 
warming doomsayers.  Stevens harps on it so incessantly as to 
practically put to shame the Roman Senator Cato who insisted upon 
ending every speech with "Carthage must be destroyed." 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sure, sometimes counter-intuitive things happen. That's why somebody 
invented the term "paradox."  But, doomsayers, the idea of warming 
causing freezing cold pushes that just too far. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"There's a silliness about [attributing blizzards to global warming] 
that's just overwhelming," says MIT climatologist Richard Lindzen. 
"Were global warming to occur," he notes, "you would have reduced 
temperature variance."  That's because extreme cold comes from wind 
blowing down from the north. If the north and south poles warm the 
most, as global warming climate models predict, the north would be far 
less likely to produce the kind of icy blasts it has sent to us these 
past few weeks. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Lindzen adds, "The truth of the matter is the poles haven't warmed 
and the storms we're having now produce very cold weather because the 
climate has not behaved the way the models have said they should." 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;University of Virginia climatologist Pat Michaels agrees that extremes 
in temperature would actually decrease if the world grew warmer, from 
night to day and month to month.  "The season to season extremes are 
decreasing," says Michaels. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then how to explain this terrible cold weather if it's not caused by 
warming?  Hmm, that's a toughy. Could it be that when it comes to the 
weather, the abnormal is often the norm? To borrow from one of the 
more vulgar expressions of the day: Bad Weather Happens. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But to global warming enthusiasts, any and all aberrations are proof 
that the sky is falling.  Thus, last year's high number of dangerous 
hurricanes was again cited as proof of the warming effect. It made an 
encore on Newsweek's January 22 cover.  

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet according to a paper by eight prominent researchers in the 
November 1994 Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, coastal 
inhabitants can rest easy. They wrote, "year to year variations" in 
weather "are so great that they must effectively  swamp' any quite 
modest effect" of  global warming on hurricane frequency. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Global warming enthusiasts desperately grasp at anything to prove 
their  case.  In early January the Climatic Research Unit at the 
University of East Anglia made headlines, including the New York 
Times, with a preliminary report saying 1995 was the hottest year on 
record.  But their data was actually for only 11 months. Rather than 
risk December's temperatures spoiling everything they jumped the gun 
and sent out their press releases. Their fears where fulfilled when 
December's average temperature came in at the lowest in 17 years 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It was a pretty ordinary year," said NASA scientist John Christy, who 
has been analyzing satellite data on temperature since 1979. And James 
Hansen of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, who pretty much 
started the whole global warming scare, admits his study of land 
areas--where the effects of global warming would be most severe--
revealed 1995 was about 0.02 degrees centigrade cooler than 1990. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In short, the theory of global warming continues to be just that--an 
unproven theory. And even were it valid, the theory cannot explain 
blizzards and cold snaps. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And where does this weather unfit for man or polar bear leave global 
warming skeptics? Just as they have always claimed that an 
exceptionally hot summer doesn't prove global warming, they cannot now 
claim that an exceptionally cold winter disproves it.  And they 
haven't. I've yet to any global warming skeptic make such a claim. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Global warming doomsayers have had similar opportunities for honesty. 
Instead, the likes of Stevens and Matthews went for sensational 
headlines.  To them, any well-publicized weather story is an 
opportunity to promote their pet theory.  

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No, the theory of global warming hasn't been disproved. But clearly 
some of its more fervent enthusiasts need to step back, look at the 
evidence, and chill out.

<html><head><title>Fumento:  Cancer Charge Against Milk Udderly Ridiculous -- 2/1/96 </title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>

<i>February 1, 1996</i>
<h2>Cancer Charge Against Milk Udderly Ridiculous</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">Michael Fumento </a>

<P>  
Six years ago there was panic in the streets over a chemical sprayed  
on apples called Alar.  Parents threw out their apple sauce and poured  
apple juice down the sinks.  One poor mother went so far as to call  
the state police to have them pull over her child's school bus and  
remove the apple from his lunch pail.  If Dr. Samuel Epstein had his  
way, it would be deja vu all over again, but this time with milk. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dr. Epstein, a professor of environmental medicine at the University  
of Illinois School of Public Health in Chicago has created a stir in  
the nation's media, if not yet its grocery stores.  He claims, in the  
January International Journal of Health Services, that much of the  
milk sold today contains a possible potent cancer-causing agent called  
recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone, or rBGH. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This hormone occurs naturally in cows but scientists can now clone it  
and give it to the animals in larger doses than they would normally  
produce, thereby increasing milk production about 10 to 15 percent.   
Perhaps five percent of all milk sold now is produced this way. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Epstein's claim--in a journal which is neither peer-reviewed nor  
widely read (I had never even heard of it before)--is that IGF-1, a  
hormone responsible for cell growth and division, is more abundant and  
potent in milk from rBGH-treated cows. The hormone may act "indirectly  
by sensitizing the breast to subsequent unrelated risk factors" such  
as radiation. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yes, and it may give you super powers and allow you to leap tall  
buildings with a single bound, but there's precious little evidence  
for either hypothesis. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Epstein's allegation uses no new evidence and indeed his charge isn't  
new.  He's been on the warpath against rBGH since at least 1989, when  
it was moving through the approval process. Cancer is just one several  
nasties he accuses it of causing, including increasing the chance of  
contaminating milk with pus from an infection of the udders called  
mastitis. Yuk! 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;During these six years of attempted sabotage, Epstein's claims have  
been repeatedly rebuffed by the best names in the business.  The  
Journal of the National Institutes of Health Research has reported  
that Epstein's "scientific evidence is slim" and is based on a single  
31-year-old paper by endocrinologist Peter Forsham.  Forsham, it said,  
"called Epstein's interpretation of his work `ridiculous.'" 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Agencies and respected organizations such as the American Cancer  
Society (ACS),  the American Medical Association (AMA), the FDA, the  
National Institutes of Health, the American Dietetic Association, and  
the World Health Organization have all put their stamps of approval on  
rBGH and strongly repudiated Epstein. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The bottom line in the scientific community, "An AMA spokesman  
recently reiterated, "that there is no evidence that there's any link  
to anything that could be hazardous to your health." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The ACS points out that, "Extensive testing and research [have] shown  
that [rBGH] is indistinguishable from natural bovine growth hormone  
and thus entails no health risks for consumers."  Not only that,  
rBGH actually can't do what Epstein claims. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His  theory assumes that the hormone can enter and remain viable in  
the digestive tract.  But as Dr. Michael J. MacDonald, a University of  
Wisconsin pediatric endocrinologist who studies the effects of  
hormones on children has pointed out, IGF-1 is produced not in the  
stomach but the liver, and if it entered the digestive system, stomach  
acids and enzymes would destroy it. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"If it got into milk it wouldn't be absorbed," he told a reporter.   
"It's a protein. It would be digested." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I'd drink it any time," he said of milk from rBGH-treated cows, "and  
if my children were infants, I'd feed it to them." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Epstein, you see, is one of the three horsemen of the cancer  
apocalypse.  (The other two are Devra Lee Davis, now with the Public  
Health Service, and Dr. David Rall, retired director of the National  
Institute of Environmental Health Sciences). There's an excellent  
chance that if you're hearing that we are suffering an epidemic of  
cancer from man-made causes, be it from petroleum products,  
pesticides, or now Bessie the Cow--you're hearing it from, or at least  
because of, them. 
 <BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He has testified before Congress that 70 to 90 percent of cancer cases  
result from man-made products.  In a just-released video critical of  
his positions, "Science Under Siege" produced by the Competitive  
Enterprise Institute and National Empowerment Television, Epstein  
tells the audience, "Escalating increasing [sic] cancer rates over  
recent decades is a result of exposure to avoidable carcinogens in  
air, water, and food and the workplace." 
 <BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Epstein regularly makes such preposterous statements, which I know  
because the media just as regularly repeat them. He is the fair-haired  
boy of  the apocalyptic environmental movement and of the media.  A  
search on the Nexis database of magazines, newspapers, and some TV  
news broadcasts pulled up 318 references to both Epstein and cancer. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This time, though, from what I could tell, the media weren't so  
credulous. Consistently they allowed somebody to refute Epstein's  
mooings. Let's hope next time reporters ignore this quack altogether  
and devote precious news print to real problems. This fair-haired boy  
has long since cried "wolf" too often to be taken seriously.

<h2>
Will the U.S. Repeat Peru's Deadly Chlorine Folly?
</h2>

<P>
FORT LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA You may have heard the term "red death."  It  
dates back to the middle ages, which is where most North Americans  
probably imagine it.  But it has a modern name: cholera.  And if you  
live in Peru or any of 14 other South American countries, it's very  
real and right now--thanks in part to bad advice from the U.S.  
Environmental Protection Agency.   
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Enrique Ghersi's voice shook with emotion as he described the  
situation to a gathering here of Latin American, British, and U.S.  
policymakers at the Atlas Foundation Workshop on Science, Technology  
and the Environment in Fort Lauderdale. Ten thousand Latin Americans  
have died, according to the Pan American Health Organization, and more  
than a million made sick.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Ghersi blames "U.S. imperialism." But this imperialism didn't come at  
the point of a bayonet as it has so many times in the past.  Rather it  
came from EPA pronouncements regarding the chlorination of drinking  
water.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Chlorine is the most effective killer of bacteria, including that  
which causes cholera,  in water supplies.  While other techniques such  
as ozonation or using ultra-violet light can kill bacteria at the  
point of contact, chlorine added to water keeps on killing all the way  
to the faucet.  New contaminants  after the water leaves the treatment  
facility are still eliminated.  About three-fourths of all U.S.  
drinking water is chlorinated, while most of the rest is treated with  
a combination of chlorine and ammonia.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"Chlorination and disinfection of the water supplies are the public  
health success stories of the century," says Carol Henry, director of  
the International Life Sciences Risk Science Institute.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But the broad class of chemicals known as chlorines have lately has  
been under an all-out assault by American environmentalists, who  
accuse them of everything from thinning the ozone layer to causing  
cancer to reducing sperm counts to shrinking alligators' penises.   
(Question: How do you measure an alligator's penis? Answer: Very  
carefully.)  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Greenpeace International, using the pithy if not overly imaginative  
slogan "Chlorine kills!" (meaning people, not germs), has demanded the  
elimination of all man-made chlorines in use.  This  while leaving  
alone those which occur naturally, such as sodium chloride, better  
known as table salt.  Such a drastic move, according to the consulting  
firm Charles River Associates, would cost the economy $91 billion a  
year.  Other critics say it would cost many American lives, pointing  
to Peru as an example.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
What happened in Peru is that their government took the  
environmentalists and the EPA more seriously than ours has so far.   
The EPA has to a great extent bought into the environmentalist anti- 
chlorinated chemical rhetoric, with Administrator Carol Browner  
calling for reducing, if not eliminating, use of chlorines.  The EPA  
has also made much of the fact that some studies have shown a   
slightly increased risk of cancer from drinking chlorinated water.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
We Norte-Americanos, who have become somewhat resistant to the  
"everything man-made causes cancer" cries of the environmentalists and  
the EPA, have taken thus far a sane attitude towards this.  Berkeley  
biologist Bruce Ames has noted that if there is any risk of cancer  
from chlorinated water at all, it is a thirtieth that of a serving of  
peanut butter.  But Peruvian bureaucrats bought the rhetoric wholesale  
and greatly reduced the chlorine pumped into the country's water  
supply.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
This set the stage for horror when, Pan American Health Organization  
officials suspect, a Chinese freighter released its cholera- 
contaminated bilge water into the harbor in Lima.  Eventually the  
bacteria made its way into open wells which hadn't been chlorinated at  
all and in other fresh water supplies in which chlorine levels had  
fallen too low to kill the germ.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
As is usual with epidemics, the rich have fared considerably better  
than the poor. Peru's rich can afford private water supplies and  
bottled water.  It is the poor, says Ghersi, who "have been sacrificed  
for the EPA and the environmentalists."    
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Undaunted by all this, the EPA is now taking action that may well  
endanger much of the U.S. water supply.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Citing the hypothetical cancer risks from chlorination, the agency in  
1994 proposed a rule that would require water systems across the  
country to eliminate the process known as pre-disinfection as a means  
of controlling "disinfection by-products."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
According to some officials, this unfunded mandate would cost local  
governments an additional $4 million a year and might force small  
water systems to abandon chlorination completely.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The proposed water regulation has some health officials absolutely  
boiling.  "Reducing chlorine levels in public water systems poses an  
immediate and significant threat to public health," says Douglas  
Kinard of the South Carolina Department of Public Health. "A  
conscientious health professional with experience in waterborne  
disease outbreaks should not support a rule which compromises public  
health."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Or, as Robert Forbes of the Florida Department of Health and  
Rehabilitative Services put it, "the reduction or elimination of  
chlorination of drinking water to reduce the risk of . . . disease, is  
analogous to reducing or eliminating air travel to protect people on  
the ground from being hit by falling aircraft parts!"  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Enrique Ghersi hopes that won't happen here as it has in his homeland.  
"We're ahead of the U.S.," Ghersi told me sarcastically.  "And have  
returned to the Middle Ages as a result."

<title>Newt Draws Fire</title>

<h2>Newt Draws Fire</h2>
<p>
<a href ="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></a>
</center><hr>
<p>
<p> 
 

<p>
<p>
It's interesting how many left feeling insecure when the subject of Newt Gingrich comes up. Dan Quayle, Spiro Agnew, Jesse Helms -- they can be handled with that equanimity that mainlines its way onto critics who are confident they are peering down on their targets. Newt Gingrich doesn't work for them in quite that way. For one thing he has a very advanced academic degree; for another, he is politically defter than most of his critics, and nothing generates hurt like yet one more primary victory by Tricky Dick. Gingrich stitched together a year ago the unthinkable, a proposed legislative agenda for a Republican Congress. The whole world laughed at such presumption and the next 
thing we knew, the House of Representatives became Republican. They stopped making certain kinds of jokes about FDR after 100 days, but in the case of Newt, the need to laugh begins to sound like the aristocracy in the Winter Palace, continuing to twit while the Revolution gathered outdoors. 
<p>
Consider Maureen Dowd of the New York Times. Her recent assault on Gingrich was ostensibly triggered by his confession that he was not schooled in foreign policy (he had blurted out that Taiwan should be recognized diplomatically). But Miss Dowd doesn't conceal the totality of her concern over the Speaker. She entitled her piece "The Loss of the Dodo"; led off by remarking that Newt was "sickeningly" cute; and ended by confessing her "distress" at the prospect of "the Speaker 
frolicking in the woods with a bunch of guys in sheets and dresses."
<p>
The "cute" business was a reaction to Mr. Gingrich's having told a visiting witness that she was welcome to "come see my dinosaur." The reference is to a facsimile skull kept in Mr. Gingrich's office, which wouldn't strike most people as "cute," so long as the addict stops short of dinosaur figures on his stationery or calls for a National Dinosaur Day.
<p>
As to the foreign-policy statement (Why don't we just recognize Taiwan?), in the same issue that carried Miss Dowd's column, the Times ran a major story about Taiwan and the loss of national identity by its people. Taiwan is large enough and important enough to warrant recognition, but we have here the problem of, "If you had some ham we could have a ham sandwich, if I had some bread" -- neither Taiwan nor China will affirm the obvious, which is that modern Taiwan is as much a zone of modern China as Algeria is a zone of France.
<p>
Then there is the frolicking in the woods. 
<p>
Miss Dowd noted that Mr. Gingrich would spend the weekend at the Bohemian Grove, "the exclusive men's club in northern California. . . The camp is a saturnalia of juvenilia, with a lot of old white rich 
guys running around naked and in sheets, costumed as Druids. They drink dawn-to-dusk gin fizzes, relieve themselves on redwoods, and put on theatricals where they dress up like women." 
<p>
Well yes, but if you are playing the part of a woman in a theatrical, what should you dress like? Miss Dowd might as well have written that she doesn't understand why the people in the Metropolitan Opera chorus go around clutching spears. 
<p>
About five years ago, CBS's Leslie Stahl did an interview with me about women joining the Century Association. A few minutes into the discussion she interrupted herself. "Would you be willing to talk 
about the Bohemian Club?"
<p>
Well, I said, it isn't something we're supposed to talk about. . . .
<p>
"Well," Miss Stahl pressed, "what about this business of going around naked?"
<p>
I lowered my voice. "In the years I've been going to the Bohemian Club," I whispered, "I have seen men naked only in the shower, and now I'll tell you something in confidence." Her eyes hungered for my 
revelation. The camera whirred. "The Admissions Committee of the Bohemian Grove does not like to admit to membership people who shower with their clothes on." Miss Stahl simply smiled, gamely. 
<p>
Did Maureen Dowd believe that men in the Grove go about naked? No, she did not. Two days before her story appeared she telephoned an old friend, an ex-member of the Club, who told her the naked business was sheer fantasy -- "It just doesn't happen." Perhaps Miss Dowd thought to be cute by perpetuating the legend, and in a way she succeeded, and I'd even go so far as to deny that she was at this point sickeningly cute. 
<p>
Saturnalia? Those in the Bohemian Grove who drink gin fizzes all day long (I know of two) drink gin fizzes from dawn to dusk wherever they are. A drunkard need not bother to travel to California in order to indulge his habit. But then Miss Dowd would rather spice up her column than report facts, 
proving only that the antagonism to Newt conquers all, even if it does not excuse all.

<h2>TIME TO MAKE AMERICORPS A CORPSE</h2><p>
By<br> <A href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">Michael Fumento</a>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
Back in 1993 it was called "the best of Bill Clinton" and something 
"no one can quarrel with" except possibly to argue that "the whole 
thing isn't big enough." But a just-released Government Accounting 
Office report indicates that it is nonetheless big enough to be a fine 
example of Clintonesque waste in a time when far worthier programs are 
facing the budget-cutter's axe.<p>
"It" was the Clinton administration's proposed national service 
program, later dubbed "AmeriCorps," under which a person would 
received a stipend and a $4,725 college educational voucher for 
providing civilian national service.<p>
As part of an allegedly austere budget, Clinton wanted to spend $7.4 
billion on AmeriCorps over five years.  Congress gave its approval but 
scaled the program back to $1.5 billion for a three-year program.<p>
Now the Republican-dominated House has voted to cut off funding for 
the program as of October 1, with the Senate set to consider that 
proposal shortly.<p>
 Some criticism of AmeriCorps is unfair, such as making fun of their 
tag as "volunteers" because they are paid. Our "all-volunteer Army" is 
paid, as are members of the Peace Corps and other programs generally 
considered volunteer. Clearly the AmeriCorps members are volunteers in 
that they weren't forced into the program, as would have been if a 
number of both conservative and liberal pundits had had their way.<p>
Further, while the average stipend plus benefits value per hour, at a 
bit less than $7.50, is well above minimum wage,  no youth is going to 
get rich working for AmeriCorps.<p>
Yet, as is so often the case when the government is involved, much of 
the money allotted to the program somehow seems to be slipping through 
the cracks and crevices.<p>
The GAO report found that AmeriCorps cost $26,654 per participant. 
While AmeriCorps claims its overhead is only 5% of its budget, the GAO 
report shows that over half the average expense per member goes to 
something other than pay and benefits.<p>
In a July, 1994 letter to AmeriCorps critic Charles Grassley (Rep.-
Iowa),  Eli J. Segal, head of the Corporation for National Service, 
the parent organization of AmeriCorps, said that "the federal share 
[of the cost of supporting an AmeriCorps participant] should not 
exceed $13,000 on average."  In fact, the federal share was $20,806.  <p>
The more the federal involvement, the higher the cost.  For non-
federal agencies receiving AmeriCorps grants, the funding average was 
$25,797 while for federal ones it was $31,017.<p>
While 15% of AmeriCorp's budget was to come from private 
contributions, so far less than 7% does--though Eli  insists that with 
time that figure will improve.<p>
In a country in which 80 million people claim to be doing at least 
some part-time volunteer work (though of course there is always a need 
for more), are 20,000 more volunteers a year at $26,654 a head really 
worth it?  According to many pundits and editorialists, they are.<p>
To read some accounts of AmeriCorps, one wonders how the country could 
have survived over two centuries without it. There they are, combating 
inner-city drug abuse and crime, cleaning up beaches, fighting global 
climate change. So heralded are they in the media that when Tennessee  
AmeriCorps members decided to work on Martin Luther King day it made 
the pages of the Memphis Commercial Appeal. Such incredible dedication 
obviously deserves recognition.<p>
Some of the projects have been of dubious value. The San Francisco 
Chronicle profiled one participant who earned her pay and benefits by 
providing AIDS education to deaf homosexuals.  Apparently 14 years 
after the AIDS epidemic began, deaf San Francisco homosexuals remain 
ignorant of how the disease is spread.<p>
Other projects are more dubious yet. In Denver, AmeriCorps members 
earned their pay by handing out leaflets attacking a city councilman.<p>
But political activism is not so much the problem as plain old waste. 
A federal report on the Orange County, California AmeriCorps branch 
revealed that while the program was supposed to provide service 
programs for more than 1500 people in Orange County, none of the 
programs in the four participating cities ever had more than 25 
participants, with most ranging from five to 15.  Other Orange County 
AmeriCorps projects, such as knitting a memorial quilt for survivors 
of the Oklahoma City bombing, have a real air of make-work about them. 
By the way, the quilt was never finished.<p>
But the Orange County program is just one bad apple out of a big 
national barrel right? Actually, the federal evaluation report stated, 
"Overall, this is a good AmeriCorps program."  One shudders to think 
what a bad program is like. <p>
Clinton likens AmeriCorps to such projects as President Franklin 
Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and President Kennedy's 
Peace Corps. Indeed, in his State of the Union address last January, 
Clinton accidentally referred to AmeriCorps as "the Peace Corps."<p>
But both these programs had clearly defined goals.  The CCC planted 
trees, fought forest fires, dug drainage ditches. The Peace Corps 
brought medical care, sanitation, and new agricultural techniques to 
underdeveloped parts of the world.<p>
AmeriCorps's charge, on the other hand, is an amorphous "Go out there 
and do some good!"  Such a vague, feel-good, approach, some might say, 
is a nice metaphor for the Clinton administration in general.<p>

<title>Are States' Constitutions Unconstitutional?</title>

<h2>Are States' Constitutions Unconstitutional?</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><i><b>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
During the recess from Washington, our legislators have an opportunity 
to reflect a little, and it would not be time lost if they gave 
thought to a prayer amendment. There are several reasons to do this. 
One, the restoration of traditional authority for local schools; a 
second, the elucidation of a constitutional disfigurement done over 
the last generation by the Supreme Court; a third, to rebuke the 
Supreme Court for its fanatical misinterpretation of the First 
Amendment. <p>
But the question suddenly arises, Is a constitutional amendment 
necessary? When questioned early in the year about what had gone into 
the Contract with America, Newt Gingrich admitted that thought had 
been given to the prayer amendment but that since it required a two-
thirds majority, this was a challenge better put off until other 
problems had been coped with. The failure of the Balanced Budget 
Amendment (although by a single vote in the Senate) reminded us of the 
difficulty of amassing a two-thirds majority. It is therefore 
especially bracing to consider alternative means of accomplishing the 
same end, devised by the constitutional historian Harry Jaffa of the 
Claremont Institute.<p>
He reasons as follows. Forty-seven of our fifty states explicitly 
invoke the name of God in their own Constitutions. They vary in 
phrasing, but they are nowhere sectarian. By this is meant that the 47 
states in question nowhere cite God using denominational language. The 
President's home state of Arkansas, for instance, launches its 
constitution by saying, "We the people of the State of Arkansas, 
grateful to Almighty God for our civil and religious liberty, and 
desiring to perpetuate its blessings . . ." In Maine, the people 
acknowledge "with grateful hearts the goodness of the Sovereign Ruler 
of the Universe," while from Colorado we have the relatively Spartan 
intelligence that the people, "with profound reverence for the Supreme 
Ruler of the Universe," nevertheless authorize the election of Pat 
Schroeder to Congress. <p>
Suppose that a joint resolution of the Congress, requiring only simple 
majorities in both houses, were to declare that children in public 
schools might lawfully recite voluntary prayers employing only such 
acknowledgment of divine power and goodness as is present in their own 
state constitution, or in the constitution of any other state? The 
Supreme Court could go beyond fuming and raging over the ensuing 
resumption of prayer in the public schools only by pronouncing the 
constitutions of 47 states to be unconstitutional. It is a reasonable 
guess that the Court would want to stop short of any such declaration. <p>
And bear in mind that the state constitutions have provisions 
equivalent to the "no establishment" and "free exercise" clauses of 
the First Amendment. California, for instance, ordains that "Free 
exercise and enjoyment of religion without discrimination or 
preference are guaranteed. . . . The legislature shall make no law 
respecting an establishment of religion." And we bear also in mind 
that every enabling act by the Congress for the admission of a state 
to the Union since the Civil War has had the following provision: "The 
Constitution of [the state being admitted] shall always be republican 
in form and shall not be repugnant to the Constitution of the United 
States and the principles of the Declaration of Independence." <p>
These are freighted words in two senses. As regards the religious-
freedom clauses, we are reminded historically that the 13 states 
admitted to the Union since the Civil War were scrutinized by 
Congress, which in ratifying their constitutions affirmed that they 
were admissible under the U.S. Constitution. More, the invocation of 
the Declaration of Independence, as an instrument to which the 
constitution of the aspiring state must not be "repugnant," 
strengthens the viability of the Declaration, which of course speaks 
of the rights with which we have been "endowed by [our] Creator." Such 
rights are "unalienable" because they are fixed eternally in "the laws 
of nature and of nature's God." It is always reassuring to know that 
some element more majestic than the God of legal positivism looks 
after and approves of our liberties. <p>
So then it is up to Speaker Gingrich.<p>

<title>Buckley: Misfire On Drug Policy -- 1/30/96</title>

<h2>
Misfire On Drug Policy
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

William F. Buckley Jr.
</a>

<P>
The bipartisan Council on Crime in America, whose most conspicuous 
spokesman is William Bennett, does fine work, but when it touches on 
the matter of drugs its analytical powers simply decompose, as though 
the writer were high on crack cocaine or the legal stuff.   
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Last week the Council exploded in opposition to the call for an 
approach to the legalization of drugs made by seven writers (myself 
included) in this journal. To the title of the symposium -- "The War 
on Drugs Is Lost" -- the Council replies that that is most certainly 
not so. To the end of proving this, it cites the reduction of drug use 
by non-addicts. It declined by 50 per cent between 1979 and 1992. The 
planted axiom of course is that that decline is owing to the war on 
drugs. But what is it that accounts for the decline in the number of 
users of tobacco during the same period, from 33.5 million to 26.5 
million? The use of tobacco is not illegal. But since 1979, and 
beginning even before that, the deleterious effect of cigarettes was 
so persuasively argued that even William Bennett gave up smoking.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A look at the formal side of the war on drugs is required. If 
something is illegal, then the law that makes it so is effective to 
the extent that it imprisons those who violate it, thereby 
hypothetically reducing the number of lawbreakers. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
That would seem obvious, but isn't to the distinguished members of the 
Council on Crime in America. In 1985, 811,000 arrests were made for 
drug offenses. In 1994, 1.35 million arrests were made for drug 
offenses. Does that mean that the war on drugs is effective? Well, no. 
An effective law diminishes, rather than increases, the number of 
violators who have to be arrested. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And then of course one asks, If 1.35 million drug users were arrested 
in 1994, how many drug users were not arrested? The Council informs us 
that there are more than 4 million casual users of cocaine (defined as 
people who use it less than once a week). How so? Why haven't they 
been arrested? And goes on to say that there are over 2.2 million 
heavy (at least weekly) users. That makes a total of 6.2 million who 
violate the law from once a week, to every two weeks or so. How 
effective is the war when such figures can be cited? Now take the big 
one. There are over 70 million Americans who have smoked marijuana, 
and about 10 million who continue to do so. Why aren't they in jail? 
Does the Council on Crime in America really wish that they were in 
jail?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It must have embarrassed the Council that the same week it sputtered 
forth on the great success of the war on drugs, The Economist cited 
another Council report on crime in America which gainsays its entire 
position on the drug war. We learn that only one criminal is jailed 
for every hundred violent crimes committed; that over one-half of 
America's convicted felons are not sentenced to prison (because, in 
part, the prisons are full); that the most violent criminals serve 
less than one-half their sentences, and the average murderer released 
in 1992 from a state prison had served only 5.9 years.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Economist cites the experience of a patrolman in Haughville, a 
scruffy area of Indianapolis. "He drives up and down in the evenings, 
past anoraked figures who stand outside liquor stores and turn their 
faces from him. He can guess what they are; few people apart from drug 
dealers stand around on nights like this, when the puddles in the 
potholes freeze hard. Besides, Patrolman Reichle knows most of them: 
he reckons he has arrested one in five of these young men." City 
prosecutors "do not even bring charges against drug dealers until they 
have been arrested several times. Those who do get charged and found 
guilty will not go to prison, unless they have other convictions. 
President Bill Clinton's call for a crackdown on drug dealers sounds 
pretty hollow in Haughville."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Such is overcrowding in state prisons in Indiana -- notwithstanding 
that the national increase in prison space is threefold since we 
decided to wage hard war on drugs -- that even a relatively new 
American prison might have merited describing by Charles Dickens. 
"Prisoners pass their days in narrow, ill-lit cages; there are no 
chairs or tables, so the men pace up and down like zoo animals or 
slouch upon the floor."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
So what has the war done? It has made a mockery of an anti-drug law 
that is simply ignored by millions; it has induced violent felonies in 
pursuit of drug profits; and it is self-evidently powerless to do 
anything about the recent increase in marijuana use by reckless 
adolescents. It is a pity that men and women of the moral and 
intellectual character of William Bennett treat drug legalization as 
the equivalent of moral acquiescence in drug abuse, when other reasons 
for repealing our stupid laws are so clearly articulated, primary 
among them to relieve non-drug users from the heavy load they bear in 
the phony and ineffective war. One forgets -- who won the Hundred 
Years War back then? Was it really necessary to take it on for one 
hundred years?

<i>12/28/95</i><hr><h2>EPA Hides Behind Myths of Love Canal</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><i>Michael Fumento</i> </a>

</center><hr>

<P>
It closes a chapter in what has been called "the nation's most 
notorious toxic dumping case." The Occidental Chemical Corporation has 
agreed to pay $129 million to cover the federal government's cleanup 
costs at Love Canal, New York. The problem is that the federal 
officials, who like all victors are the ones who write the history, 
have written a history that has little connection with reality.
<P>
Under the settlement, the EPA Superfund will receive $102 and the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency, which handled the relocation of 
Love Canal residents and initial cleanup, will receive $27 million. 
(Last year, Occidental agreed to pay New York $98 million toward the 
cleanup of the site. The state originally sought $630 million in 
damages.)
<P>
"Today we celebrate a transformation of an environmental disaster 
called Love Canal into a success story," Attorney General Janet Reno 
said at a press conference announcing the settlement. "It stands for 
the principle that when people make a mess, they should pay to clean 
it up." 
<P>
Hmm . . . Does that mean that Miss Reno is going to go to Waco, Texas 
and roll up her sleeves and start picking up debris?
<P>
Nobody questions that Occidental, or rather its predecessor, Hooker 
Chemicals & Plastics Corp., buried 22,000 tons of chemical waste in a 
half-dug canal from 1942 to 1953. Rarely mentioned, however is that 
Hooker tried desperately to convince the city of Niagara Falls (where 
Love Canal is located) not to build on the site.
<P>
As consumer advocate Eric Zuesse pointed out in a 1981 Reason magazine 
article, the city school board applied massive pressure to obtain the 
land despite Hooker's repeated warnings of potential health hazards.  
Finally Hooker gave in and sold the land for a symbolic dollar bill.  
It insisted, though, that the land was to be used for a school or 
parking lot or playground but was under no circumstances to be 
excavated.
<P>
Instead, the city decided to build a housing development on the site, 
digging into the protective clay covering and laying sewer lines 
through the waste.  Then it sold the plots to unsuspecting home 
buyers.
<P>
Hooker had no choice but to dump its toxic waste somewhere.  It was 
the city's choice to bring people to that somewhere. The bad guy 
wasn't the big faceless corporation, it was your friendly city 
government.
<P>
The second part of the Love Canal myth is that residents began 
suffering a health disaster in the late 1970s.  As I documented in my 
book Science Under Siege, nobody at Love Canal complained of any 
exceptional illnesses until a muckraking environmentalist reporter for 
the local paper began a series of articles telling the people that 
they were sitting on a toxic waste site.   Lo and behold, from then on 
every illness in the town was blamed on the ingredients brewing 
beneath the surface.  It even made national news when one family's dog 
began inexplicably vomiting.
<P>
The media descended upon the town and relayed to the outside world 
every sneeze, every cough, and every ache and pain experienced by Love 
Canal residents, making it clear that they could only be caused by 
toxic waste, which included the dreaded dioxin.
<P>
The EPA and the governor of New York swaggered around, condemning the 
chemical company and promising to make everything better, no matter 
the cost.  Ultimately tens of millions of dollars were spent 
evacuating the residents.
<P>
Only later did the truth begin to seep out. Study after study 
conducted by the federal government and the State of New York 
Department of Health found that Love Canal residents had no more 
illness than would be expected in any other area of similar size.  
Believe it or not, dogs who don't live on top of toxic waste dumps 
also vomit.
<P>
A New York Times editorial predicted correctly in 1981 when it said, 
"it may well turn out that the public suffered less from the chemicals 
there than from the hysteria generated by flimsy research 
irresponsibly handled."
<P>
Somehow, none of this was mentioned at the aforementioned press 
conference. Instead, EPA Administrator Carol Browner used the myths of 
Love Canal to blast congressional Republican efforts to cut back on 
enforcement of environmental laws. Love Canal led to the creation of 
the Superfund for the cleanup of environmental hazards.
<P>
In seeking to reduce environmental spending by $25 million, she said, 
"Congress is attempting to roll back the environmental health 
protections that Superfund brought to Love Canal." 
<P>
Since there was never any health threat at the Love Canal, obviously 
Superfund brought no protections there. In any case, it's too bad 
Browner didn't go farther to point out that Superfund, according to 
the Office of Technology Assessment, could soak up an amazing $500 
billion over the next few decades. While a few of these toxic waste 
<P>
sites may pose a real hazard to persons living nearby, most have posed 
no demonstrated threat as large even as making dogs upchuck.
<P>
Sometimes people fight back.  The citizens of Leadville, Colorado 
successfully fought the EPA's needless effort to scrape the lead out 
of Leadville's soil. (Anyone for "Ville" Colorado?). Like so much of 
what the EPA does, it was nothing but makework for a bloated and 
arrogant agency.

<title>Fumento: The (Literally) Unspeakable Evil at Dunblane  -- 3/25/96</title>

<h2>
The (Literally) Unspeakable Evil at Dunblane 
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">
Michael Fumento
</a>

<P>
A gunman bursts into the gymnasium of a small Scottish grade school.  
He begins firing, systematically hunting down nearly every child in 
the room.  Before he finishes and ends his own life with a blast to 
the brain, sixteen "wee ones" and their teacher lay dead in a huge, 
spreading pool of blood. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is an act of unmitigated evil.  Or is it?  Apparently it depends on 
whose newspapers you read. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I happened to be in Ireland at the time of the shooting, exposed to 
the coverage of the Irish and British press.  Every article I read, it 
seems, used the terms "monster," "pervert," and "evil" to describe the 
slayer, Thomas Hamilton.  There were some examples of this in the 
American media, as well. Time magazine's article included the words "a 
monster goes on the rampage" and Time essayist Lance Morrow focused on 
the element of evil.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But far more typical was this Associated Press line.  "A 43-year-old 
loner with an unsavory reputation massacred more than half of Dunblane 
Primary School's kindergarten class and its teacher on Wednesday, then 
shot himself dead."  Indeed, "loner" was the American media's chief 
descriptor of Hamilton. That's like summarizing George Washington as a 
man with a powedered wig or Abraham Lincoln as merely being tall. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As to his "unsavory reputation," what the paper means is that he 
papered his walls with photos of little boys in various states of 
undress.  It means he was kicked out of the Boy Scouts for having 
little boys disrobe in front of him.  The kids called him "Mr. 
Creepie."  How do you get from this that he merely had an "unsavory 
reputation"? 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The British media pulled no punches.  "Residents Say Scottish Killer 
Was Evil Pervert," ran the headline of the Reuters news service story 
out of Scotland.  "What has happened reminds us of the depths to which 
human evil can sink," concluded the London Evening Standard."  The 
London Daily Mirror referred to "evil Thomas Hamilton."    
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Why has the American media been so reticent about calling this man 
what he is? 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"At the foundation of all this is the Left's rejection of religion and 
fundamental to that is the question of whether human beings are 
capable of evil or not," says Rabbi Daniel Lapin, President of Toward 
Tradition and a radio talk show host in Seattle.  "The whole of 
western thought has always been based on the idea that there is evil 
of which people are [inherently] capable . . . " 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Left, he says, argues that since "no human beings capable of doing 
wrong things, evil must come from the institutions of society," 
usually but not always the church. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Certaintly had this happened in the United States, the media would 
have done what they've  always done with shootings: blamed the 
institution of lax gun laws.  But because it happened in a nation with 
some of the strictest gun laws, they were  left foundering. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yet,  the American media seem to  have trouble believing even some 
institutions can be evil.  These, after all, are the same people who 
to this day snort, chuckle, and guffaw when they refer to President 
Reagan's description of  the Soviet Union as an "evil empire."  As if 
there could possibly be a better term for a state that murdered tens 
of millions of people, kept hundreds of millions of others in bondage, 
and kept a nuclear arsenal trained on those whom it couldn't 
subjugate.  The British media, by contrast, treated and continues to 
treat Reagan's words with deference. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Robert Royal, vice-president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center in 
Washington, D.C., attributes the media's reticence to our having "made 
ourselves into such a therapeutic society that we don't like to think 
people have choices in right or wrong . . . .  If something goes wrong 
it's a sort of chemical malfunction, [and] people are not responsible 
for what they do." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Or a psychological malfunction, says the Rev. Robert Sirico, President 
of the Acton Institute for the Study of Religion and Liberty in Grand 
Rapids, Michigan.  The media "have to characterize in psychological 
terms, not moral ones.  Evil is just something we don't understand," 
he says. He adds that, "Morality is grounded in human free will," 
something else the media doesn't accept.  "If it turns out a child 
abuser was abused by his father, it exonerates him," he says.  "Since 
the media doesn't accept free will, it can't accept good or evil." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's "a very sophisticated amoral logic," he says.  But unlike true 
logic, it is ultimately incapable of explaining anything. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This is what happens if you remove the concepts of good and evil. 
Without the context of the Civil War and slavery, Abraham Lincoln 
truly was only a president who happened to be tall; without the 
Revolutionary War and the Continental Congress and its aftermath, 
George Washington was just a president with a wig. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Call Thomas Hamilton anything you want--43 years old, a loner, fat, 
bald, bespectacled.  But if you don't call him evil, you're omitting  
what set him apart from the world's other five billion people that 
day.   As Time's Lance Morrow put it in the title of his essay, "Only 
the Vocabulary of Evil Could Explain What Happened at Dunblane."

<title>Fumento: FDA Screwing Around With Device Approval - 5/30/96</title>
</head>

<h2>
             FDA SCREWING AROUND WITH DEVICE APPROVAL
    </h2>


<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">
Michael Fumento
</a>

<P>


Why is it that whenever the FDA quickly approves a drug or medical 
device, you always read about it in the first few pages of the 
newspaper, but when it delays approval of something that could prevent 
death and suffering, you usually only hear about it in the opinion 
pages--if at all? 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Case in point: this column.  Subject: The FDA's delay in approving 
something called a pedicle screw to treat serious spinal injuries, a 
delay that is encouraging terrifically expensive litigation against 
the screws' manufacturers and making doctors hesitant to use them. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Originally pedicle screws were only used to fasten leg and arm bones, 
and the FDA approved them for this purpose.  But orthopedic surgeons 
found they were excellent for also fusing bones of the spine which had 
broken or degenerated.  There are other ways of doing this, such as 
wires, rods, or hooks, but once physicians tried the screws, the other 
techniques pretty much fell by the wayside. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The FDA has never approved the screws for this express purpose.  
Nonetheless, FDA policy wisely allows a drug or device which has 
proven safe and effective for one thing to be used for another.  It's 
called "off-label" use.  Virtually everybody reading this column has 
probably received a drug or treatment that hadn't been approved for 
that specific purpose, yet doctors had decided it was a good thing to 
offer their patients. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
For example the class of drugs that includes Tagamet, Pepcid, and 
Zantac was originally  approved only for clinically-verified duodenal 
ulcers.  But long before the FDA approved their wider use, doctors 
found they were helpful for many types of stomach disorder and 
prescribed them as such.   
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
So it has been with pedicle screws used for spinal bone fusion.  Over 
300,000 times, doctors have used these on patients' back bones, in the 
belief that it was the best treatment.  But, of course, operations 
don't always accomplish their intended end; even the simplest.  I am 
now facing my third surgery to have a painful inflamed section of 
nerve removed from my foot.  Against all odds, the damned thing just 
keeps growing back--and believe me, being a freak of nature isn't all 
it's cracked up to be.   
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Just so, not all patients who have pedicle screws used on their back 
receive complete relief.  Sometimes it's the doctor's fault and 
sometimes that's just the way it is.  But in this litigation-happy 
country, nothing ever "just happens."  Somebody had to pay and pay 
dearly, and that's where the trial lawyers come in. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
About 7,000 patients who have received spinal treatment with pedicle 
screws have filed suits with an estimated total liability of $1 
billion.  Their lawyers' chief weapon: That the FDA has been steadily 
dragging its feet on the approval of the technique.  You can just hear 
the plaintiff's lawyer booming at the doctor on the witness stand: 
"You mean to tell us that you inserted these screws even though you 
knew for a fact that the FDA has not approved them for that purpose!" 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The best answer to that is: "Yeah, but so what?"  But you can see how 
an uninformed jury might feel otherwise.   
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
FDA approval of pedicle screws for use on the spine would "take the 
wind right out of the trial lawyers' sails," one industry insider told 
me. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Way back in 1994 an FDA panel of medical experts voted unanimously to 
ease regulations on the use of the screw.  And the 1995 FDA proposal 
itself says, "The data demonstrate that the use of pedicle screw-based 
instrumentation [on spinal degeneration and fractures] results in 
significantly higher rates when compared with treatment with no 
instrumentation or with currently available . . . devices." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Naturally, the trial lawyers are desperate to see the screws remain 
unapproved and have enlisted the lobbying and legal support of Sidney 
Wolfe's Public Citizen advocacy group, which often works hand-in-hand 
with plaintiffs' lawyers.  Yet not only is the FDA dragging its feet 
on granting approval (except for one extremely rare form of back 
surgery), one of its top officials has actually sabotaged the case for 
approval. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The sabotage arose out of something generally called the Cohort Study, 
a major evaluation published in the medical journal Spine which 
concluded that pedicle screws were at least as safe and more effective 
than previous methods of treatment.    
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
As such, the study is devastating to the trial lawyers' position, 
prompting their typical reaction of trying to intimidate and harass 
the doctors who worked on the study.  The FDA knows about this tactic 
and so flatly told the lawyers it would not release the names.  But 
FDA Deputy Associate Commissioner Mitch Zeller  nonetheless turned the 
names over to a group associated with the trial lawyers.  He says he 
did so accidentally, not having noticed that they were marked as 
confidential.     
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Rep. Joseph Barton (D-TX), claims Zeller isn't telling the truth and 
is demanding that the Justice Department investigate.  In the 
meantime, subpoenas issued to doctors who worked on the Cohort Study 
have risen nearly five-fold since their names were released. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
FDA Commissioner David Kessler has apologized for the release, but has 
rushed to his employee's side in saying it was inadvertent.  Barton is 
right; that's a question for Janet Reno, not David Kessler to answer.  
In the meantime, the way for the FDA to undo some of the damage is to 
give its approval to pedicle screws for spinal use.  Get a backbone, 
commissioner, and do what's right.

<i>12/13/95</i><hr><h2>The Long Suppressed Truth About AIDS</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><i>Michael Fumento</i> </a>
</center><hr>

<P>
You've heard it over and over in the media: AIDS is "an equal 
opportunity destroyer" that threatens all Americans "without 
discriminating."  Now a new study in Science magazine shows an 
epidemic both smaller than the government has claimed--and one that 
clearly does discriminate.
<P>
The media treated it as quite a revelation.  In fact, as we shall see, 
this same vital information was available seven years ago and was 
deliberately suppressed.
<P>
The Science study, by NCI statistician Phil Rosenberg, shows a 
tremendous disparity between infected groups. For example, while as of 
January 1993, only one in 2,000 American white females between the 
ages of 18 and 59 was living with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, one 
in 204 white males was.  For black females the rate is one in 135, 
while black males have the highest infection rate of all at one in 44. 
Hispanics fall somewhere between, with one in 294 females and one in 
69 males.
<P>
While Rosenberg's data don't look at risk factors, the explanation for 
the disparities is that male homosexuality and intravenous drug abuse 
(which is primarily male) continue to account for the vast majority of 
new infections.
<P>
Rosenberg's calculations also put to the lie the official government 
estimate of one million current infections.  He finds instead a range 
of 630,000 to 897,000 American living with the virus. 
<P>
To come up with these figures, Rosenberg used a technique called 
backcalculation.  It simply requires looking at the number of current 
AIDS cases and then calculates back from them to when the infections 
must have taken place.  From there it projects a trend line.
<P>
It's such a simple technique that you may be wondering why it took 
somebody so long to apply it to AIDS.  And the answer is that it 
didn't.  Joel Hay, then of the Hoover Institution and now the head of 
the Department of Pharmaceutical Economics at the University of 
California, Los Angeles, first applied backcalculation to the epidemic 
in 1988.  The figures he came up with, allowing for new infections in 
the years since,  are in the same ballpark as Rosenberg's figures.  
Hay's estimate was that there were as few as 500,000 infections at the 
time.
<P>
Hay's calculations were so appealingly simple and straightforward that 
I didn't hesitate to use them in my 1990 book, The Myth of 
Heterosexual AIDS.  But when Hay presented his data to the federal 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC) at the international 
AIDS conference in Stockholm in 1988, the agency wanted nothing to do 
with them. 
<P>
At that time the CDC's official estimate was 1 to 1.5 million 
infections, which the media regularly shortened to "as many as 1.5 
million."  Ignoring Hay, the CDC relied on calculations by other 
modelers which had so many variables that they were virtual Rube 
Goldberg devices on paper.
<P>
That may have been part of their attraction.  Bureaucrats loathe 
simplicity.  But clearly a factor in the  CDC's decision was that 
Hay's numbers were just too darned low.
<P>
"They said, well, if the numbers just end up less than we say they 
are, we'll just pat ourselves on the back and say we helped prevent a 
major epidemic," says Hay now. 
<P>
Ultimately, as AIDS cases stubbornly refused to come in anywhere near 
as fast as the CDC had projected, the agency was forced to lower and 
finally abandon its projection of future AIDS cases and to lower its 
infection estimate to a flat one million.
<P>
Then last year its officials told the House Energy and Commerce 
Subcommittee on Health it was considering lowering that figure even 
more to 800,000.  But homosexual committee member Gerry Studds (D-
Mass.) threw a tantrum, and the officials ran away, tails tucked 
firmly between legs.  So the official figure remains at one million.
<P>
As for the tremendous disparity between male and female infections, 
and between those of whites and blacks, all that too was known long 
ago.  I emphasized these disparities in my first AIDS article way back 
in 1987 in Commentary magazine, adding that, "Every dollar spent, 
every commercial made, every health warning released, that does not 
specify [the actual risk factors for contracting AIDS] is a lie, a 
waste of funds and energy, and a cruel diversion."
<P>
Why then, in every year since 1987 has the CDC insisted on using its 
hundreds of millions of dollars allotted for "education" to air TV 
campaigns aimed squarely at white, middle class heterosexuals?  Quite 
simply to "democratize" the disease.  Specialty diseases get small, 
specialty budgets.  Diseases portrayed as threatening every last 
American get nice fat budgets, explaining why AIDS gets more research 
and education money than heart disease even though heart disease kills 
about 20 times as many Americans.
<P>
The media has eagerly played along, fearing that a disease which has 
<P>
homosexuals as its primary victims won't get the kind of attention the 
media has decided for us this disease deserves.
<P>
And still the propaganda continues.  The week after the Science report 
came out, ABC broadcast an afterschool special "Positive: A Journey 
into AIDS," featuring two soap opera actors whose characters have 
AIDS.  One is male, one female and both are middle class whites.
<P>
The result of denying the true risk factors? The people least at risk 
live in needless terror. The people most at risk become complacent and 
more likely to die before their time.

<i>NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 21</i>
<hr>
<h2>McNamara's Final Surrender</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>

<P>
Robert McNamara has every right to publish a book advising the world 
that in his opinion we had been wrong, "terribly wrong," in engaging 
in war in Vietnam. But what more can be said about the liberties of 
Bob McNamara? He is free, if he is so impelled, to join the Communist 
Party; or to form one, if it no longer exists. What is creepy about 
his most recent exercise in self-mortification is the auspices under 
which it is being done. 
<P>
If you missed it, Mr. McNamara went to Vietnam, alongside a few other 
dignitaries whose names do not get into the papers, under the auspices 
of the Council on Foreign Relations. The announced purpose was to 
explore whether the war might have ended sooner, or indeed might have 
been averted altogether.
<P>
Now I am a member, however inert, of the Council on Foreign Relations, 
and I wonder why it should sponsor on a trip to Vietnam someone who 
has publicly abjured the reasoning of Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, 
Johnson, and Nixon, and the overwhelming majority of their advisors, 
on why the operation in Vietnam was justified. Inasmuch as Mr. 
McNamara received approximately 100 per cent of the publicity of the 
visiting delegation, the world has quite reasonably concluded that his 
oblation constitutes an official apology by the United States for 
acting as it did.
<P>
Well, the world is wrong; Mr. McNamara arrived with no such portfolio. 
When a few days ago Japan finally elected to apologize for Japanese 
conduct in Korea during and before the Second World War, the apology 
was tendered by the prime minister and represented official government 
opinion. McNamara's sole credential was as one representative of the 
Council on Foreign Relations. Several questions arise. The first is, 
What is the purpose in sending on a mission to investigate tensions 
with Vietnam an American who has publicly rejected, indeed scorned, 
the reason for such tensions? He wholly rejects the reasoning of the 
President who made him secretary of defense, the successor President 
who in 1964 was elected by a landslide in part because of his 
reaffirmation of the policy of containment, pronounced twenty years 
earlier by President Truman calling for resistance to Communist 
aggression whether in Greece, in Berlin, in Iran, in Guatemala, in 
Korea -- or in Vietnam.
<P>
It would have been interesting if our former secretary of defense, in 
his meeting with General Giap -- essentially Vietnam's secretary of 
defense -- had met as old football coaches might have done to exchange 
locker-room talk about what might have worked in this situation, what 
in that situation. But Mr. McNamara wasn't in Vietnam to say to Giap, 
"You proved the better soldier." He was there as the prominent 
American whose support of the war, advertised so proudly while in 
office, had mutated, after thirty tortuous years, into a profound 
rejection of all the premises of that war. If a Christian theologian 
decides, at age 78, that on second thought he doesn't really think 
Christ was the Redeemer, he isn't very useful as a delegate to a 
conference inquiring into the causes of impiety. And there is no 
evidence that Mr. McNamara ever thought to ask General Giap such 
questions as, Since I have retreated from my moral position about 
going to war, have you retreated from yours about treating the people 
of Vietnam like slaves?
<P>
In 1964, McNamara absolutely affirmed that the Vietnamese were 
responsible for a second assault on an American naval vessel on August 
4, 1964. He now declares that he is "overwhelmingly" convinced that no 
such assault actually occurred. And who does he ask to confirm his 
reversal? Why, the man who would have engineered the Tonkin Gulf 
attack. It happens that I am a student, however superficial, of the 
Tonkin Gulf episode, and I am convinced it never happened, but I am 
deeply convinced that the military and the Administration did 
genuinely believe it had happened. But the idea of going to Giap to 
ask for final judgment in the matter is the equivalent of going to 
Goering at Nuremberg and asking, Did you really slaughter six million 
Jews?
<P>
There is no effective way absolutely to teach people what manners are 
appropriate in what situations. I mean, there are several hundred 
thousand wives, fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, sons, daughters 
who lost their husband, offspring, sibling, father in Vietnam. And 
they are justly solaced by their conviction that the fight was made in 
pursuit of a most honorable cause, i.e., to spare the people of South 
Vietnam the miseries of living under such as General Giap and Ho Chi 
Minh, while continuing to maintain the animating strategic policy of 
the Cold War. We lost the battle in Vietnam, but won the war -- 
finally -- not least because the enemy had at least a temporary 
experience of American resolution in Southeast Asia.

<P>

     Mr. Chairman, it has been recognized for years now by nearly
everyone -- from the right, left, and center of the political spectrum -- that
the U.S. foreign aid program is critically flawed. In addition to having too
many goals and too little focus, U.S. development assistance programs have
done little to advance economic growth in the developing world. Far more
important than economic aid in determining whether a developing country
emerges from poverty is that country's own economic policies -- in short,
how free its economy is. This fundamental fact has been overlooked by the
designers of America's foreign aid program. It is time to begin looking at
it. Without question, this Congress has a unique opportunity to reform
foreign aid. This opportunity must be seized. The American people will
support a foreign aid program, but only one that serves American interests
and promotes international economic growth.
<P>
     We at The Heritage Foundation have examined the issue of foreign
aid closely. We have published The Index of Economic Freedom, a study
that measures the comparative economic freedom of 101 countries. The
Index scores countries on ten factors, including taxation levels, trade
barriers, regulations, and openness to foreign investment. The purpose of
this study is to introduce a new understanding of economic development.
Hitherto, most development economists and the U.S. foreign aid bureaucracy
believed that a laundry list of factors ranging from health, education, and
even population controls must be manipulated by governments for economic
development to occur. The Index takes a different approach. It is based on
the premise that economic freedom is the most important factor in economic
development -- or, as we prefer to call it, economic growth. As we
discovered in the Index, how free an economy was, and not the amount of
economic assistance it had received, was the most important and consistent
determining factor in a country's level of economic development and its rate
of economic growth. This being the case, we concluded that the purpose of
economic aid should be to promote economic freedom and to create the
economic growth that will someday make this aid unnecessary. 
<P>
     But The Index of Economic Freedom is more than a study of the
factors contributing to economic development. It also can be instrumental
in evaluating America's development assistance programs. The Index can be
a useful tool with which to decide whether particular countries deserve
development assistance and, if so, what kind of aid is best for them.
  <P>   The assumption behind the Index and indeed our entire approach to
reforming foreign aid is that U.S. foreign assistance programs should serve
three fundamental purposes: 
<P>
 To enhance U.S. national security. 
<P>
 To advance American national interests.
<P>
To promote economic growth around the world, which creates markets for
American goods and contributes to democratization and international
stability.
 <P>
While we believe that U.S. foreign assistance should be used under certain
circumstances for humanitarian purposes and to help friendly foreign
countries in an emergency, we also believe that U.S. foreign aid programs
should be understood primarily as an extension of U.S. foreign policy and
designed to advance its goals. 
<P>
     Thus, some forms of assistance to advance the process of
democratization, if they are effective and given to deserving countries,
would be compatible with the U.S. goal of promoting international stability.
But economic development assistance, which by and large has failed, should
be carefully scrutinized and curtailed. To the extent that current military and
security assistance programs serve the national interest, they, too, should be
continued. Economic support for Israel, Egypt, Russia, and the Newly
Independent States (NIS) of the former Soviet Union by and large should
be retained, although in the cases of Russia and the NIS, some cuts can be
made safely. However, so-called economic support funds for Israel and
Egypt should not be understood as a means to promote economic
development, for they surely do not serve this goal, but rather as a form of
security support assistance and as a political demonstration of U.S. support
for the Middle East peace process.
<P>
     With these assumptions in mind, we have prepared a list of
recommendations for your committee to consider as it reviews the foreign
aid program. I need not remind the members of the committee that the
balanced budget amendment, if it passes the whole Congress, will bring
every federal spending program under close scrutiny. Foreign assistance
programs should be no exception. With that reality in mind, I have
combined the total savings from all the recommendations made in this
testimony into two budgetary options which I hope you will consider. 
  <P>   OPTION A ($2.58 billion savings). This option represents the
minimum amount which should be cut from this year's foreign aid budget.
It includes:
<P>
Reducing bilateral economic development assistance programs by 50 percent
for a total fiscal 1996 savings of $1.8 billion.
<P>
Trimming aid to Russia and the NIS by $200 million.
<P>
Shrinking funding for multilateral development banks by 25 percent for a
total savings of $481 million. 
<P>
 Abolishing the Agency for International Development for a savings of $100
million in administrative costs.
<P>
     OPTION B ($5.67 billion savings). The new budget environment
may require that you consider more drastic reductions than outlined in
Option A. If this turns out to be the case, you can look to our Option B
menu of cuts. This option includes:
<P>
Eliminating nearly all economic development assistance for a total fiscal
1996 savings of $3.6 billion.
<P>
Ending all aid to Russia and the NIS for a savings of $839 million.
Cutting 50 percent of U.S. funding for the World Bank, the International
Monetary Fund, and other multilateral development banks for a savings of
$963 million.
<P>
Cutting economic support funds for all countries except Israel and Egypt by
50 percent for a savings of $167 million.
<P>
Abolishing the Agency for International Development for a savings of $100
million in administrative costs.
<P>
GIVING AID A FREE-MARKET FOCUS: PROPOSALS FOR
REFORMING FOREIGN AID 
<P>     The U.S. foreign aid program must be fundamentally overhauled. In
this new political environment of fiscal restraint, foreign aid must not only
take its fair share of budget reductions, but also be reshaped to give its
remaining programs new life, new meaning, and a new mission. With these
goals in mind, we recommend that:
<P>
Economic Development aid be made contingent upon a recipient country's
commitment to free markets as determined by The Index of Economic
Freedom.
<P>
     There is a stark contrast between the tremendous economic progress
made by such countries as Hong Kong and Singapore that have pursued
free-market development strategies and other poorer countries like Tanzania
and Ethiopia that have pursued a statist approach to economic development.
Indeed, it should come as no surprise that two of the greatest development
success stories of the last few decades, Hong Kong and Singapore, share the
highest Index of Economic Freedom score of 1.25. These are two
outstanding examples of countries that have elected to unleash the
entrepreneurial energies of their peoples by pursuing free-market economic
policies. The results have been spectacular. The per capita GDPs of Hong
Kong and Singapore have grown nearly eightfold since the mid-1960s. Over
the same period the per capita GDPs of Ethiopia, Chad, and Angola grew
hardly at all, primarily because their economies were unfree.
<P>
     No one can argue seriously that economic assistance from the
advanced industrial democracies is the principal reason for the economic
growth rates of Hong Kong, Singapore, or even other "Asian Tigers" like
Taiwan or South Korea. To be sure, some of these countries (like South
Korea) have received massive amounts of military aid, but no reputable
economist would contend that spending money on tanks and guns is an
economic development strategy. No, the reason the economies of these
countries have grown is that they have chosen market economies. 
<P>
     Economic development aid not only does little to advance economic
development, but even can be detrimental to the welfare of the countries
receiving it. Tanzania is a case in point. Once a cause clbre of Western
donors, by the early 1970s Tanzania had become one of the most heavily
aided countries in the developing world. The U.S. Agency for International
Development (AID) was heavily involved in Tanzania, providing financial
support and technical assistance for forced rural collectivization, one of
Tanzania's many disastrous socialist schemes. Today, Tanzania is the
world's second poorest country, worse off than it was at the time of its
independence. Foreign aid unquestionably contributed to the destruction of
Tanzania's economy. It encouraged and enabled governments to pursue
harmful statist economic policies that made economic growth next to
impossible to achieve.
 <P>
     Another case in point is Chile, only the outcome has been markedly
different. Over the last several years, Chile has had one of the fastest
growing economies in the world. It is now the leading "Latin Jaguar." Yet
foreign aid had nothing to do with Chile's development success. Indeed, the
seeds of this success were laid only after the government of General
Augusto Pinochet was cut off from virtually all foreign aid following its
1973 coup d'etat.
<P>
     Here is how this success story happened. In 1970, Chile was the
world's second largest per capita recipient of foreign aid. It was also
stagnating economically. In 1973, Salvador Allende's last year as president,
Chile's GDP shrank by 5.6 percent. Around 75 percent of Chile's GDP at
this time was controlled by the government. However, after Pinochet came
to power, most of Chile's foreign aid was cut off. Unable to rely on the
crutch of foreign aid, Pinochet embarked on a privatization and market
reform program that transformed Chile's economy. By 1990 government
control of the economy had dropped to 25 percent. Moreover, Chile's infant
mortality rate was reduced from 78 to 17 per 1,000 births between 1970 and
1991, and its life expectancy rate rose from 64 to 72 years between 1970
and 1990. These improvements occurred because of economic growth, not
because of foreign aid programs.
<P>
     The Index of Economic Freedom is designed to help identify
instances in which development aid is playing the type of destructive role
that it once played in Chile. By helping to determine which countries are
economically free, the Index can help policymakers decide which countries
deserve economic aid -- i.e., those that are making progress toward a free
market -- and which countries do not deserve it -- i.e., those that are unfree
and are not making progress toward a free market. Governments with unfree
economic policies -- those possessing very high taxes, protectionist trade
policies, hostile foreign investment climates, and burdensome economic
regulations, for example -- will only waste economic aid. In fact, economic
aid too frequently is a crutch upon which the governments become
dependent and which prevents them from making the economic reforms
necessary to create economic growth.
<P>
     The Index of Economic Freedom has been recognized by many
concerned with the future of the U.S. foreign aid program as the best means
of identifying those countries with a commitment to free-market-generated
economic growth. George M. Ferris, Jr., Chairman of the 1992 President's
Commission on the Management of AID Programs, urged AID to establish
an Index of Economic Freedom for the purpose of allocating development
aid among countries. Last year, minority members of this committee,
including a few of you here today, encouraged AID to develop and use an
Index of Economic Freedom as a tool for its development aid allocation
decisions. Unfortunately, AID has resisted doing so, despite the fact that it
has the requisite data readily available.
 <P>
     Instead of putting the Index at the heart of America's development
assistance program, AID allocates aid according to a hodgepodge of criteria
that are not nearly as important as economic freedom. Take, for example,
AID's criterion of democracy and lawful governance. To be sure, democracy
is important to economic growth and stability in the long run, but
democracy alone is no guarantee of economic development. Singapore is no
democracy, yet its free economy generates very high rates of economic
growth. By the same token, Russia is slowly developing democratic
institutions, yet its economy is mostly unfree and stagnating. 
<P>
     Economic freedom is far more important to economic development
than democracy. In fact, in most cases, economic freedom is the best
foundation upon which to build democracy. In the long run free economies
produce growth and a middle class that come to demand civil rights,
political representation, and protection for their property. In short, as has
been seen in Taiwan, South Korea, Chile, and many other countries,
economic liberalization creates pressures for political liberalization. Some
countries like Singapore lag behind, but not all countries march in lock-step
toward democracy. While the pace of change may differ, most countries that
are economically free tend over time to become politically free as well. It
is probably only a matter of time before Singapore follows the path of
Chile.
<P>
     Fortunately, Singapore and other authoritarian regimes that pursue
free-market policies do not need or receive U.S. economic aid. Thus, the
moral question of whether we should be aiding an undemocratic free-market
country does not often arise. However, this question could arise if an
undemocratic government making progress toward economic reform were
to ask for aid. They could ask us for assistance to help them in their
transition toward a free-market economy even though they are undemocratic.
We may be facing such a question with respect to Russia sooner than we
think.
<P>
     Should we give economic aid to a government that is abusing the
human rights of its people? The short answer is "No, unless it serves some
higher national interest." This has been a long-standing tradition in U.S.
foreign aid policy. It was practiced widely during the Cold War and, if
national security considerations warrant, should continue in the post-Cold
War era as well. However, there should be fewer instances in which national
security considerations call for dispensing economic assistance. While we
can justify giving economic aid to less-than-savory governments for national
security reasons, our development assistance strategy should not include
aiding countries that are egregiously abusing their citizens. While a case
could be made that supporting economic freedom would lead to political
freedom in the long run, in extreme cases we cannot wait until that day
comes. Unlike private trade, government aid is too direct a symbol of
official and moral support. Discretion will have to be exercised if a recipient
government becomes abusive of its people.
<P>
     Another flawed AID criterion is "need" as determined by social
indicators. If this criterion is applied, all poor countries are more or less
deserving of economic aid. In fact, the poorest countries would be the most
deserving. But what if the recipient country's own economic policies are
mainly responsible for its poverty? If all we are doing is putting a Band-Aid
on misery that it is self-inflicted, how can we say that we are making a
substantial difference?  And if our aid is being used by corrupt governments
to perpetuate the very economic policies that are causing the poverty, how
can we continue in good conscience to dispense aid that amounts to little
more than a subsidy of economic misery? Looked at this way, we are not
satisfying the needs of poor people, but acting as accomplices to
governments that are keeping them poor.
<P>
     To be sure, one can find a U.S.-supported health or education
program abroad that has "done some good" for some people in the
developing world. Just as first aid relieves the pain and suffering of a sick
patient, economic aid can relieve in a limited way the pain and suffering of
people who are economically victimized by their own governments. But
economic first aid is not a development strategy. It is does not produce
economic growth. Free economies not only produce economic growth, but
also produce the wealth needed to improve health and education standards
for the greatest number of people. A free economy does far more to educate
people and raise health standards than U.S. economic assistance. In short,
it does more to meet the "needs" of the people. 
<P>
     Far from being too "narrow" a criterion for dispensing economic aid,
as AID Administrator Brian Atwood charges, the Index of Economic
Freedom encompasses the broadest possible number of factors that
determine economic development. The best way to address social "needs,"
clean up the environment, raise health standards, stabilize population growth,
and promote democratization is to produce economic growth. And the best
way to produce economic growth is to advance economic freedom. This is
a development strategy that is no less sophisticated for its simplicity of
purpose. In fact, it is far more sophisticated than the ahistorical analysis that
passes for economic development theory.
<P>
     Progress toward establishing free markets should be the sole
determinant in allocating development aid among countries. This is the
approach of Senator Mitch McConnell's foreign aid reform proposal
unveiled this past December. The McConnell proposal would condition
development aid on the adoption of free-market policies by recipient
governments as determined, in fact, by many of the factors of the Index of
Economic Freedom. Vice President Al Gore's 1993 "Reinventing
Government" report notes that "AID does not have a single, clearly defined
and articulated strategic mission." A free-market focus is what the U.S.
development aid program desperately needs.
<P>
Cut development aid spending.
 <P>    The conclusions of the Index of Economic Freedom suggest that U.S.
economic development assistance programs should be cut. Even if a case
could be made that all economic assistance were needed to promote
economic development around the world -- a case that cannot be made
seriously -- the new budget environment would argue in favor of reductions
in U.S. development assistance programs. I recommend to you the two
following budgetary options. Our analysis is based on the figures from last
year's foreign operations budget.
 <P>
     OPTION A ($1.8 billion savings). We assume that development aid
should be given under the right conditions -- i.e., directed at countries
moving toward free markets and used by them to assist them in the
transition. Under these conditions, development aid can make a difference,
although not a very large one. If used wisely, primarily to promote private
enterprise, it can encourage an environment in which a free market can
grow. With this assumption in mind, we have prepared a recommendation
that cuts most bilateral assistance programs by 50 percent. We anticipate
from these reductions a savings of $1.8 billion in fiscal 1996. In our range
of options, we consider Option A to be the absolute minimum which should
be reduced from this year's development assistance budget. Under no
circumstances should the Clinton Administration's development assistance
programs be fully funded.
<P>
     To assist you in deciding which countries' aid should be cut in
Option A, we have supplied you with a list of development aid recipients
scoring poorly on the Index of Economic Freedom. These are countries that
received either a "mostly unfree" or "repressed" score on the Index. Our
judgment is that you should scrutinize these countries very closely and
consider them prime candidates for reductions in -- or outright elimination
of -- economic development funds. They should be at the top of the list in
your efforts to meet the 50 percent reduction target.
 <P>
     OPTION B ($3.6 billion savings). The new budget environment may
require that you consider more drastic reductions in the development
assistance accounts. If this turns out to be the case, you can look to our
Option B menu of cuts in these accounts. In this option nearly all
development assistance aid is eliminated. Thus, all funding would be cut for
the African Development Foundation, the Development Assistance Fund, the
Development Fund for Africa, Eastern Europe and Baltic assistance,
population control, and other development programs. Savings from this
option would amount to $3.6 billion for fiscal 1996.
<P>
     As you move to reduce development aid spending, you certainly will
hear examples of development aid programs that "have made a difference"
in the lives of people throughout the developing world. Without question,
there have been "successful" development aid programs. Yet what is the
measure of success? Have these programs really made a difference to
national development, or have they been an oasis of achievement in an
otherwise barren environment? The best designed and executed agricultural
project will mean little in a country that is destroying itself through foolish
economic policies.
<P>
     Whether you choose Option A or Option B, you should be aware that
critics of cuts in development aid will try to portray you as lacking
compassion. They will use the same arguments that some people marshaled
to justify America's failed welfare system -- that "you don't care about
people" or that "some people" have been helped by the aid. You should not
be deterred by such arguments. Economic aid that does not encourage
economic growth or that serves no discernible strategic interest of the
United States is not only a waste; it is downright harmful to the people we
are pretending to help. Like our own welfare recipients, foreign governments
develop a kind of corrupting dependence on U.S. government funding.
Although the programs are different, the results are the same: We encourage
behavior that is self-destructive.
<P>
     Major cuts in development assistance do not amount to neo-
isolationism. Neither Option A or Option B touches military or security
assistance programs. Nor do they affect aid to Egypt and Israel. They affect
only aid that purports to spur economic development. Since it turns out that
most of this aid has been a failure, eliminating it would have no discernible
impact on international stability or international economic development.
America's overseas commitments would be reaffirmed not only by the
continuation of military and security aid, but by the far more important
military alliance and security commitments that the United States has made
to friends and allies overseas.
<P>
     In the end, it must be realized that the only reliable development
strategy is one that recognizes the true power of the market and the private
sector. In his excellent report, Development and the National Interest (1989),
former AID Administrator Alan Woods estimated that the American private
sector invested $12 billion a year in overseas development efforts. However,
the best "aid" any country can give another is free trade. The some $4
billion of bilateral development aid the U.S. provides to the developing
world is a drop in the bucket compared to the trillions of dollars that change
hands every year in private trade. No wonder that one of the most desired
prizes from the U.S. these days is not economic aid, but a free-trade
agreement. Most developing countries have come to realize that their future
rests not with AID or the World Bank, but with NAFTA and other free-
trade agreements.
<P>
Trim and rename Economic Support Funds.
  <P>  The rationale for Economic Support Funds (ESF) differs from that
for development aid. ESF is given to advance U.S. political and security
interests. While ESF, like development aid, does little or nothing to advance
economic development -- in fact, an argument can be made that it actually
retards economic growth -- we recommend continuing ESF for Egypt and
Israel. However, we believe that ESF funds should be renamed to reflect
their purpose more accurately. Since they are intended primarily to support
our security interests, we believe they should be renamed "Security
Supporting Assistance," which is what they were called before the name was
changed to Economic Support Funds in 1978. Israel and Egypt are by far
the biggest recipients of U.S. foreign aid. This year, Israel and Egypt will
receive $1.2 billion and $815 million, respectively, in Economic Support
Funds (ESF). These two countries command the bulk of ESF funding.
<P>
     OPTION A (no savings). No cuts in ESF are recommended in Option
A.
<P>
     OPTION B ($167 million savings). In this option we recommend a
50 percent reduction of economic support funds for all countries except
Israel and Egypt. In 1995, $334 million of ESF was appropriated for such
countries as Cyprus, Turkey, Morocco, Cambodia, and Ecuador. A 50
percent cut would damage our relations with these countries, but it would
not irreparably harm our fundamental national security interests. Such a
reduction would realize a savings of $167 million.
<P>
Revamp and cut aid to Russia and the Newly Independent States (NIS).
<P>     It is axiomatic that the U.S. has a vital stake in Russia's future.
Russia faces momentous challenges. Whether or not foreign aid can improve
Russia's chances of succeeding in developing free-market and democratic
systems is uncertain. I am inclined at this time to give the benefit of the
doubt to continuing a foreign aid program for Russia. I am sufficiently
convinced that, on balance, Western engagement in terms of foreign aid
helps keep the reforming spirit -- however it may flicker -- alive. But this
is a close call. Moreover, the point at which aid to Russia should be ended,
including a drastic reversal on reform, could come overnight. 
<P>
     What is crystal clear is that the case for continued Russian aid has
been weakened by the poor performance of AID. Without taking local
conditions into account, AID applied its Third World experience to Russia,
allocating the bulk of contracts to its "traditional" contractors, as opposed
to organizations and professionals with appropriate regional, industry, and
language experience. These multi-million-dollar nongovernmental
organizations -- including CARE, Save the Children, the Academy for
Educational Development, Experiment in International Living/World Vision,
and the Urban Institute -- had little or no experience in the former Soviet
Union. Unfortunately, their organizational culture, shaped by years of
working in the developing world, has hindered their work in the region.
Meanwhile, Russian nongovernmental organizations, even the most pro-
reform ones, are often excluded from the AID bidding process.
<P>
     Indeed, the AID contracting process is arcane and often understood
only by those with long-term relationships with the Agency. This effectively
screens out worthwhile organizations which lack an inside track. Tom Dine,
AID's Assistant Coordinator for the NIS, has publicly stated that if he could
have one wish fulfilled, it would be the abolition of AID's contracting
office, which has been primarily responsible for perpetuating the cozy
relationship with traditional contractors. 
<P>
     OPTION A ($200 million savings). Two recommendations are made
in Option A. The Congress should:
<P>
Reduce aid to Russia and the NIS from $839 million to $639 million. The
pace of aid delivered to this region so far has been slow, in part because
these countries are incapable of digesting the aid that already has been
appropriated. This region should not escape budget cuts. A good place to
look is the Officer Resettlement Program (ORP) which helps to build
housing for Russian army officers returning from abroad. The idea was to
prevent a restive and angry Russian army from challenging Yeltsin's
democratic regime. However, the Russian military has been mainly
responsible for the debacle in Chechnya. It stands to reason that if aid
should be cut, they should be at the top of the list. Thus, a $100 million
rescission should be imposed on funds already appropriated but not spent on
the Officer Resettlement Program, and another $100 million should be cut
from fiscal 1996's budget, not only for next year's appropriation for the
ORP, but also for other aid programs, such as the Eurasian Foundation,
which have not performed as well as expected.
<P>
Reprogram $75 million from health and environmental programs to other
programs. Health and environmental programs have a relatively low impact
on the development of a free market in Russia. There are difficulties in
identifying worthy projects in Russia and NIS. As a result, these funds are
disbursed at an even slower rate than in other areas. At the same time,
democratic reform, rule of law, and other crucial tasks are underfunded.
Thus, the money could be used better in building democratic institutions in
Russia. This proposal results in no net change in the overall Russian and
NIS assistance budget. 
<P>
 OPTION B ($839 million savings). The best circumstance for choosing this
option would be a determination by you that Russia no longer deserves our
aid or that the aid is not effectively assisting the transition to democracy and
a free market. Indeed, while in our estimation Russia still deserves aid for
now, it is not difficult to imagine circumstances in the near future when it
would not. The war in Chechnya has raised serious doubts about President
Yeltsin's commitment to democracy and reform. It is not even clear that he
is in charge of the country. Moreover, Russian foreign policy has become
less friendly in the past year. Yeltsin is opposing the expansion of NATO
and interfering in his neighbors' affairs.
<P>
     If, based on these facts, you were to decide that aid to Russia should
be eliminated entirely, you would realize a savings of $839 million for fiscal
1996. However, at this time we do not recommend this option. I fear that
cutting off all aid at this point would only drive Russia further into isolation
from the world community. Moreover, our democratic friends inside Russia
tell us that aid is still an important symbol of our commitment to them.
However, I cannot predict where I will stand on the issue of Russian aid
next year. If current trends inside Russia continue, I fear that I would be
hard pressed to recommend a continuation of aid next year.
<P>

Reduce funding to all multilateral development banks (MDBs).
  <P>   The fiscal 1995 House Republican budget would have ended U.S.
support for the International Development Association (IDA), the
concessional loan window of the World Bank. This proposal would have
realized savings in the billions over a five-year period. The Republican
budget alternative also proposed that the U.S. withhold all new capital
contributions to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development,
Asian Development Bank, International Finance Corporation, European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development, Inter-American Development Bank,
and African Development Fund. This proposal also would have realized
savings in the billions over five years. Whether the U.S. chooses to zero-out
some of these activities or make across-the-board funding cuts, it should
begin stepping away from the MDBs.
<P>
     The MDBs duplicate many private sector activities, particularly
lending. Many of the MDB loans could be secured from private financial
institutions. Indeed, over the last decade, there has been a flood of
investment to the developing world. The fact that many World Bank loans
could easily be privatized makes the point that its lending activities are
redundant.
<P>
     It is argued that there are troubled countries that would not be able
to attract capital without the MDBs. To the extent that this is true, it can be
attributed largely to the economic policies of such countries -- policies for
which the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and other MDBs
bear considerable responsibility. Consider the words of Czech Prime
Minister Vaclav Klaus, who has complained about the statist orientation of
the IMF and World Bank. Klaus has noted that IMF and World Bank aid "is
wrong and counterproductive." This aid, Klaus maintains, "is not taken
seriously, neither by the donors nor recipients. They are misused,
misdirected. They simply disappear. They are very often counterproductive.
They prolong the moment when the necessary domestic changes have to be
implemented." Klaus's insight can explain the deterioration of the World
Bank's project performance, as documented even in the Bank's own 1992
"Wapenhans Report." It also highlights the importance of aiding only those
countries moving rapidly toward the establishment of a free-market
economy, as is the Czech Republic. This imperative has been unappreciated
by the MDBs, and the U.S., frankly, has little chance of changing this.
<P>
     Another problem for the World Bank is the corruption of its
conditionality. The World Bank's structural adjustment programs, which are
foreign aid packages designed to liberalize the economies of developing
countries, have not been effective. It has been estimated that some half of
all economic reform programs endorsed by the IMF and the World Bank
break down. Yet the donors almost always soon return. In other instances,
development aid recipients pretend to comply with economic adjustment
program conditions while donors simply pretend to believe them. This
hypocrisy and lack of responsibility is a fallow field in which to plant the
seeds of economic growth.
<P>
     This game of pretend is not necessary. Even the World Bank
concedes this to be true when it notes in its 1993 World Development
Report that "Some of the most dramatic 'adjustment' reforms took place
without adjustment lending (as in Chile and Vietnam), and some countries
that received adjustment loans did little or nothing to pursue reforms (for
example, Tanzania and Zambia)." The key to developing vibrant free-market
economic growth is not to be found in the MDBs.
<P>
     This committee's report of last year quoted a 1982 Reagan
Administration review of the multilateral development banks and their
contribution to American security: "To the extent that the MDBs encourage
the participation of developing countries in that international system on a
permanent and self-sustaining basis, they are one of the major vehicles
available for pursuing these U.S. economic and political/strategic interests."
In the succeeding 13 years, I have not seen the MDBs achieve these goals
to much of an extent. Rather than make a ritualistic annual appropriation to
these institutions, I encourage the committee to make 1995, the fiftieth
anniversary of the creation of the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank, a time of fundamental reassessment. This would be done best
with a funding cut.
<P>
     OPTION A ($481 million savings). In this option funding for all
MDBs would be reduced by 25 percent. This would result in a savings of
$481 million for fiscal 1996. Reducing the MDBs in this way would send
a signal to the world community that unless the MDBs undertake major
reform, the United States will begin to step away from them and the
approach to multilateral development assistance which they represent.
OPTION B ($963 million savings). In this option funding for all MDBs
would be reduced by 50 percent. This would result in a savings of $963
million for fiscal 1996. This option would be chosen to demonstrate that the
U.S. has chosen to disengage from multilateral development assistance
altogether.
<P>
Eliminate the Agency for International Development.
  <P>   AID has failed at its mission of promoting economic development
overseas. Since its creation in 1961, AID has spent over $144 billion in
development aid. Yet most of the countries that have received U.S.
development aid remain mired in poverty, repression, and dependence. Of
course, a large part of this failure can be attributed to the fact that
development aid has been used to prop up socialist economies; hence, the
urgency of utilizing the Index of Economic Freedom.
<P>
     Before taking charge of AID two years ago, incoming Administrator
Brian Atwood labeled the agency a "disaster." Soon after this, Atwood
volunteered AID as a "reinvention lab" for Vice President Al Gore's task
force to reinvent the federal government. Of course, AID had undergone
four major management reorganizations and had been the subject of fourteen
management studies within the previous eight years.
<P>
     While Vice President Gore's September 1993 Creating a Government
That Works Better and Costs Less: Agency for International Development
found that "Reinvention is not simply an option or a challenge for AID; it
is an imperative," this report rejected "reasonable arguments" for AID's
absorption into the State Department or for its abolition. The President's
Commission on the Management of AID Programs (1992) and numerous
other studies had recommended absorption into State; the Hamilton-Gilman
Task Force Report (1989) had recommended abolition. The Vice President's
report instead concluded that, with reform and strong leadership, AID "could
reclaim its potential to be an effective provider of U.S. development
assistance."
<P>
     I would assume that AID has been implementing the reforms
recommended in the Vice President's report. Yet press reports over the last
few weeks suggest that AID came within a few threads of extinction at the
hands of the "Super State Department" proposal rejected two weeks ago.
What is troubling is what this says about AID's reform progress. It appears
either that the Vice President's report was not the right prescription for
shaping AID into an effective provider of development assistance or that
AID has been rejecting its medicine. Neither answer is encouraging, and the
situation begs the question of where AID goes from here. It should go away.
We have heard too many promises of reform, from both Republican and
Democratic Administrations, to give AID any more chances.
 <P>
     Defenders of AID make the point that another chance is due because
AID has been laboring under hopelessly burdensome and conflicting foreign
aid legislation. Indeed, the Vice President's report concluded that "AID does
not have a single, clearly defined and articulated strategic mission." The
report notes that AID's reinvention can succeed only if the Foreign
Assistance Act of 1961 (as amended) is replaced with comprehensive new
authorizing legislation.
<P>
     Yet AID struck out with its legislative reform effort. The Clinton's
Administration's Peace, Prosperity, and Democracy Act of 1994 was a
bureaucratic catch-all which did nothing to give AID a strong focus, never
mind a free-market development vision. Not surprisingly, it went nowhere
in the last Congress. So AID continues to operate without the reform
foundation everyone, including AID, realizes is desperately needed. Stated
bluntly, how can this committee in good faith continue to fund such an
operation?
<P>
     A trimmed down development aid program aimed at fostering free
markets around the world could be run out of the State Department, utilizing
its worldwide presence and achieving economies of scale. Any ESF could
be administered by such offices as the Under Secretary of State for Arms
Control and International Security Affairs and the State Department's
Bureau of Political and Military Affairs. 
<P>
 OPTION A AND B ($100 million savings). It has been estimated that if
AID were eliminated and its remaining functions folded into the State
Department, $100 million could be saved in overhead and administrative
costs.
<P>
CONCLUSION
  <P>   There should be no doubt that the foreign aid budget will be cut this
year. The only question is by how much. With that reality in mind, I have
combined the total savings from all the recommendations made in this
testimony into two budgetary options which I hope you will consider. They
are:
<P>     OPTION A ($2.58 billion savings). This option represents the
minimum amount which should be cut from this year's foreign aid budget.
Thus, we recommend reducing most bilateral development assistance
programs by 50 percent (for a total of $1.8 billion in savings for fiscal
1996) while trimming aid to Russia and the NIS by $200 million. The
bilateral development assistance reduction should be made in the following
programs: African Development Foundation; Development Assistance Fund;
Development Fund for Africa; Eastern Europe and Baltic programs; the
Inter-American Foundation; International Organizations; population control,
migration, and refugee programs. Moreover, we envision in this option
shrinking funding for multilateral development banks by 25 percent for a
total savings of $481 million. Finally, we propose a savings of $100 million
in administrative costs from abolishing AID.
  <P>  To assist you in deciding which countries should be cut in Option A,
we have supplied you with a list of aid recipients scoring poorly on the
Index of Economic Freedom. These are countries that received either a
"mostly unfree" or "repressed" score on the Index. Our judgment is that you
should scrutinize these countries very closely and consider them prime
candidates for reduction or outright elimination of funds. They should be at
the top of the list in your efforts to meet the 50 percent reduction target. 
<P>
     OPTION B ($5.67 billion savings). The new budget environment
may require that you consider more drastic reductions than outlined in
Option A. If this turns out to be the case, you can look to our Option B
menu of cuts. In this option nearly all development assistance aid is
eliminated ($3.6 billion in savings), including that for Russia and the NIS
($839 million in savings). The bilateral assistance programs affected would
be the African Development Foundation, the Development Assistance Fund,
the Development Fund for Africa, Eastern European and Baltic assistance,
population control, and other development programs. Also in this option is
a 50 percent drop in funding for the World Bank, the International Monetary
Fund, and other multilateral development banks for a total savings of $963
million. Moreover, this option includes a 50 percent reduction of economic
support funds for all countries except for Egypt and Israel ($167 million in
savings). Finally, $100 million would be saved by abolishing AID. Total
savings from this option would amount to $5.4 billion for fiscal 1996. 
<P>
     Whether you choose Option A or Option B, one thing is certain: the
budget for foreign aid should be reduced. At a time when America's
national security could be endangered because of shortfalls in defense
spending, it makes no sense to spend $2 billion to $3 billion a year on
development programs that do not produce economic growth and do not
serve the national interest. This money would be invested far more wisely
in reversing the decline of defense readiness or in funding the estimated
$100 billion shortfall in the Clinton Administration's five-year defense plan.
Why, because of falling pay, should America's servicemen and women have
to live on food stamps while AID funds population control programs in the
Third World? We need to reorder our priorities. We need a foreign aid
program that serves the national interest and promotes economic freedom
and economic growth.

<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><i>Michael Fumento</i> </a>
</center><hr>

<P>
 
Think you've had a hard week? Consider what happened to Mrs. Tina 
Bennis back in October of 1988.  One day she finds out that her 
husband,  appropriately named John, was arrested by Detroit police for 
having sex in a car with a prostitute. Then a few days later, adding  
insult to injury, the city seized the car as a "public nuisance." And 
it didn't give it back, even though the car was half Tina's.
<p>
If that sounds a bit unfair to you, you'll be interested to know that 
this isn't just some aberrational Detroit statute like those laws you 
hear about forbidding eating cherry pie in the bathtub on Sunday or 
some such. Indeed, property forfeiture laws are routinely employed by 
states and localities around the country as well as by the federal 
government. 
<p>
Under the federal and most state civil asset forfeiture statutes, law 
enforcement officials can seize a person's property without a notice 
or hearing if they merely have probable cause to believe it has 
somehow been involved in a crime. Proceeding against the property, the 
government need not file criminal charges against the owner or anyone 
else.  
<p>
Because of the fiction that the property is guilty, not the owner, 
cases to retrieve forfeited items have such quaint names as One 1958 
Plymouth Sedan v. Pennsylvania and United States v. 1960 Bags of 
Coffee. (No information available on whether Mrs. Olson was called to 
testify.)
<p>
"Involvement" may mean anything from a belief that the property is 
contraband to a belief that it represents the proceeds of crime (even 
if it is in the hands of someone not suspected of a crime), that it is 
an instrument of crime, or that it somehow facilitates crime.
<p>
In one famous case the oceanographic research vessel Atlantis was 
seized off the coast of Massachusetts because a single marijuana 
cigarette was found in the ship's crew quarters.  In another, 
authorities seized a Scripps Oceanographic Institute research vessel 
because a marijuana cigarette was found in the locker of a sailor who 
had long since been fired.
<p>
But it appears that most forfeiture victims are not big guys like 
Scripps who can afford attorneys to take back their property, but 
average Janes and Joes.
<p>
Using the Freedom of Information Act, the Michigan Association for the 
Preservation of Property found that in 1992 Michigan law enforcement 
agencies used civil forfeiture in 9,770 instances, confiscating an 
average of only $1,434 per seizure. Property taken included 54 private 
homes with an average value of only $15,991 and 807 cars with an 
average value of merely $1,412.  Poor Tina Bennis's car was worth only 
$660.
<p>
While these confiscations were probably crushing to those who suffered 
them, they are not enough to justify the thousands of dollars it would 
take to hire an attorney to get the property back.  You see, once the 
property is seized, the burden is upon the owner to prove its 
"innocence."
<p>
As Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) points out in his 1995 book Forfeiting Our 
Property Rights, "In more than 80 percent of asset forfeiture cases 
the property owner is not even charged with a crime yet the government 
officials can and usually do keep the seized property."
<p>
One of the most pernicious aspects of civil forfeiture law is that the 
property seized often benefits the seizer. During the Holy 
Inquisition, many a person went to his or her death because some 
official coveted their property. Unfortunately, that's not entirely a 
thing of the past as the Donald Scott case shows.
<p>
In 1992, federal, state, and local law enforcement officials raided 
Scott's Malibu home on his 200 acre ranch under the pretense that he 
might be growing marijuana.  Brandishing a gun to stave off what he 
thought were criminal intruders, he was shot to death.
<p>
In fact, Scott was passionately anti-drug. His "crime" may have been 
his repeated refusal to sell his scenic ranch to the National Park 
Service. The Ventura County district attorney concluded that "the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department was motivated, at least in part, 
by a desire to seize and forfeit the ranch for the government."
<p>
Civil forfeiture has allowed state and federal agencies to line their 
pockets with loot.  The amount deposited in the Department of 
Justice's Assets Forfeiture fund has increased from $27 million in 
1985 to $556 million in 1993. The Treasury Department's Forfeiture 
Fund took in $198 million in 1994.
<p>
Civil forfeiture needs to be seen for what it is, an end run around 
constitutional protections that begs for abuse. The notion that 
property can commit crimes is absurd. (Cars don't solicit prostitutes; 
people do.)
<p>
Forfeiture can be a valuable weapon in sucking the profits out of a 
criminal enterprise.  But the fair way to seize these is through 
something already on the books called criminal forfeiture. This 
procedure requires a criminal conviction before seizing property, 
eliminating much of the injustice of civil forfeiture.
<p>
True, this will eliminate those amusing case names like United States 
v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms. People who thumb through court 
reports in search of humor will just have to get their kicks some 
other way. We need to fight crime without taking the lives of Malibu 
millionaires or the clunkers of Detroit housewives.

<title>The Passions of the Greenpeacers</title>

<h2>The Passions Of the Greenpeacers</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
 
Commentator/philosopher Herbert Agar had a term for it -- "the 
anarchic passion to smash." He was writing fifty years ago about 
whatever it is that causes some people, especially when young, to give 
vent to the impulse to wreck -- if necessary, the nearest thing in 
sight. The politicization of that impulse had a lot of help during 
this century from ideology, which seemed to give it some purpose. The 
young Bolsheviks destroying everything they could lay their hands on 
in St. Petersburg. The young fascists on a spree in Milan. The Nazis, 
who could objectify that passion to smash in search of anything 
Jewish.<p>

We have it now, that anarchic passion, and the animating instrument is 
nuclear -- well, nuclear anything. Most recently the decision by the 
French to conduct some nuclear tests in the South Pacific. But 
anything that has the word "nuclear" attached to it helps to bring on 
that same spirit. Not long ago Jane Fonda was enthralling the younger 
generation by her movie The China Syndrome, the hero of which was a 
nuclear meltdown that threatened, oh, the end of the world, or 
something very close to that. The Greenpeace movement is based on an 
undifferentiated hostility to everything nuclear, and it is having a 
wonderful time these days in Tahiti.<p>

The French are a highly utilitarian people, in ways commendable and 
not so commendable. They acknowledge force majeure, as when Hitler 
quickly and decisively proved that his army was better than their 
army: so they quickly surrendered, and got along with the occupiers 
without too much of a fuss, leaving it to the exiled Charles de Gaulle 
to help to mobilize Great Britain and the United States to effect 
French liberation.<p>

When nuclear power was shown to be a reasonable means of providing 
energy, the French, without much fuss, simply went nuclear, so much so 
that nearly 80 per cent of French electricity is nowadays generated by 
nuclear plants. In the Sixties, President de Gaulle decided that it 
was not prudent to depend on American nuclear missiles to serve as a 
dispositive deterrent to Soviet expansionism, so he developed what he 
called a force de frappe, something small enough to be manageable but 
deadly enough to discourage overt Soviet military aggression. 
President Chirac, thirty years later, was persuaded that one more set 
of tests was necessary to ascertain that French nuclear resources were 
authoritative. Evidently only that one series is deemed necessary to 
achieve the desired level of efficiency -- and safety -- because M. 
Chirac has declared that after the conclusion of these tests, in May, 
he will commit France never again to test nuclear weapons.<p>

Philip Shenon of the New York Times reports on the honeymoon of a 
Seattle dermatologist, Sonja Krejci, and her new husband, Dr. Bill 
Clark, bound for a romantic Polynesian resort island after a scheduled 
connection at Papeete. But when they landed, far from making their 
connecting flight, they were imprisoned in the airport building 
surrounded by rioters, tear gas, and smoke. At one point the rioters 
assaulted everyone with rocks and stones, causing Dr. Clark, who is an 
orthopedic surgeon, to consider the possibility of needing to use his 
professional resources to keep his bride alive. "At one point," 
reports Mr. Shenon, "some of the rioters found a bulldozer, 'and they 
just drove it right into the terminal building -- smashing cars and 
destroying the restaurant,"' as the poor doctor put it. An estimate of 
the damage done to the airport comes to $11 million. No estimate is 
yet in on how many honeymoons originally scheduled for Tahiti have 
been rescheduled elsewhere.<p>

A reader of the ongoing press reports on the activities of Greenpeace 
and others stops suddenly -- or might do so -- to ask: What is it the 
protestors fear? Are the French experiments, conducted 750 miles from 
Tahiti, endangering anybody in Tahiti? For that matter, are they 
endangering anybody or anything in Mururoa, the atoll used for the 
nuclear testing? Has anybody detected a rise in pollutants in the area 
where the first tests were undertaken? Has a whale been killed? Two 
whales? Has $11 million in damage been done to the sea surrounding 
Mururoa?<p>

The answer has to be No, for the simple reason that if it were Yes, we 
absolutely would have heard about it. The Greenpeace types desperately 
need a martyr. A poisoned ocean, a scarred sun -- something that 
points to Chernobyl. But there isn't anything there. Only the anarchic 
passion to smash. <p>

<title>Buckley:  Grave Business In Los Angeles</title>

<h2>Grave Business In Los Angeles</h2><br>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>


 

The cliche has it that anything Johnnie Cochran et al. can do to 
spring their client is okay. If this is so, they have certainly abided 
by that liberty. At the end of Thursday, Mr. Cochran had done his best 
to convince the jurors that either O. J. Simpson is guiltless and 
should be set free, and perhaps lionized in an effort to expiate the 
troubles he has seen, or else the jurors don't believe in the Bible, 
in the Constitution, or that Hitler went too far.
                                              <P>
Now pay close attention to what is going on. The cameras take us to an 
impromptu press conference called by Fred Goldman, who is the father 
of Ron, the young man killed alongside Nicole. Mr. Goldman is teeming 
with resentment and fires both barrels. "He's talking about racism and 
he's talking about hate? Who does he connect himself with? This man 
ought to be ashamed of himself to talk among decent human beings. He 
is one of the most disgusting human beings I have ever had to listen 
to in my life. Because of racism, we should put aside all other 
thoughts, all other reason, and set his murdering client free?"
                                    <P>
Well, that statement brought counterfire from the other side. The 
elder sister of O.J. took the floor for the first time to plead the 
innocence and virtue of her brother. But she said something more 
important, really, than that she was standing by for sibling loyalty. 
She said that "only" the jurors could pronounce the truth on all these 
questions being raised. The truth, of course, on whether O.J. killed 
Nicole and Goldman. But, derivatively, the case Mr. Cochran was 
pleading: that Mark Fuhrman, the racist detective, was 
indistinguishable from Adolf Hitler, that the Los Angeles police are 
happy to send an innocent man to jail for life, even though they know 
him not to be guilty. The point here is that, once again, we are asked 
to see the jury as an instrument for uncovering the Truth. To believe 
this is to surrender to the powers of hypnotists.
                         <P>
That of course is what Johnnie Cochran and Barry Scheck have attempted 
to do, to hypnotize the jury, and the inducements have been about as 
comprehensive as they can be. If you believe that Hitler was evil, 
then you have to fight Hitlerism in America, which is embodied in Mark 
Fuhrman, who uncovered the glove with O.J.'s blood on it, which glove 
had been placed there by Hitler. If you believe that the Los Angeles 
Police Department did some sloppy work, then you must believe that its 
motive in doing so was to advance the fraudulent case against O.J. If 
you believe, with Luke, that little lies often indicate bigger lies, 
then you must vindicate O.J. You cannot, simultaneously, believe in 
O.J.'s guilt, and in St. Luke's divine inspiration.
                <P>
It does remind one -- does it not? -- of some of the great show trials 
of the Thirties, conducted by Stalin. When it was charged that 
Bukharin was guilty of counterrevolutionary activity, not only the 
Soviet court nodded its acquiescent head, but a lot of other people 
did too, including American intellectuals. It required the labors of 
the Dewey Commission and some hard analysis by a generation of 
scholars to set the record absolutely right. In Moscow the court was 
the creature of Josef Stalin and would have ruled, if told to do so, 
that the earth is flat. The question seriously arises whether the 
court, in Los Angeles, becomes the creature of Johnnie Cochran, whose 
use of apocalyptic rhetoric transforms the question, Did he do it, or 
did he not do it? into the question, Do you believe in God, do you not 
believe in God? Into, Do you believe in civil liberties, do you not 
believe in civil liberties? 
                                                                                <P>
If one had confidence in Judge Ito one might hope that he could move 
the jury back to reality, to relieve the jury of any notion that it is 
complicit in Nazism if it finds O.J. guilty. How would the Soviet 
court have reacted if it had been given, the day before its ruling, 
Arthur Koestler's Darkness at Noon to read? But Judge Ito is in over 
his head, and just possibly it is true that Western judicial procedure 
is in over its head. If a persuasive shaman is left free to seduce a 
bleary, near-dead-from-fatigue jury that theirs is to justify death, 
or to save Western idealism, then we are talking about something very 
different from the administration of justice.

<title>Buckley: 'Ideology' On Our Mind -- 2/20/96</title>

NEW YORK, FEBRUARY 20, 1996

<h2>
'Ideology' On Our Mind
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
buckley
.html">
William F. Buckley Jr.
</a>

<P>
The point has been made, most specifically by Washington Post 
columnist David Broder, that the principal candidates for President 
shrink from "ideology." Thus Mr. Clinton separates himself from the 
Gephardt wing of the Democratic Party, and Senator Dole allows a 
certain amount of water to pass between him and Newt Gingrich. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The whole matter of ideology both vexes and enlightens political 
thought. The word is used differently in political discourse. The 
average voter will seek some consistency, or appearance of 
consistency, in a candidate's platform. The philosopher scorns 
ideology because too often it overwhelms reason, prudence, philosophy. 
The word was French and came out of the crucible of the French 
Revolution, which was the bloody complement of the American 
Revolution. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Senator Phil Gramm has generally been considered the most consistent 
of the conservatives running for the Presidency this year. If you 
believe A, that government activity ought not to replace non-
government activity except when required, you will believe B, that the 
government should not run the local pizza parlor. Ideology is a body 
of ideas reflecting the social needs and aspirations of an individual, 
a group, a class, or a culture (American Heritage Dictionary). But 
ideology is also "a set of doctrines or beliefs" that form the basis 
of a political, economic, or other system. If your position on a 
political question derives from a doctrine, then you are committed to 
subordinating your political position to your doctrinal position. 
Otherwise, you tend to wobble. Some wobbling is an aspect of political 
opportunism -- Senator Gramm in Iowa did not criticize federal 
subsidies of the ethanol program, which is a relic of the Department 
of Energy's extravagances. Sometimes it is an extra-ideological 
deference to reality (let the Federal Government help Los Angeles 
after its earthquake). 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But then we begin to line up other political questions, to be 
scrutinized ideologically. And it is here that the word "presumption" 
is useful. If you believe A -- that the government should stay out of 
the way -- you believe this either dogmatically or empirically. Was it 
right to intervene in Somalia? No, if the undertaking was designed to 
transform Somalian culture -- we should know that this can't be done; 
we tried and gave up making the world safe for democracy. Yes, if the 
single objective was to prevent mass starvation. Presumptively, stay 
out. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What about tariffs? Long ago, conservative doctrine shaped up in favor 
of free trade. This was, indeed, an extension of anti-government 
doctrine. A tariff is a tax paid by one American for the benefit of 
another American. But it is more than that, because it denies to the 
American consumer the advantage of competitive bidding, and 
derivatively deprives the foreigner of the wherewithal to patronize 
American production. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What about educational vouchers? Conservatives will in almost every 
situation honor the supremacy of the consumer over the regulator, so 
that if Mrs. Jones wants that school for her child, not the public 
school, the conservative would seek to expedite the choice. . . . Is 
that question ideologically related to school prayer? Yes, it is: the 
state should not intrude its wishes, or its restrictions, in the 
culture of free men, freely associating with one another. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Immigration? National independence? The state is by no means useless, 
as the anarchists insist. The state is a "natural" institution, and 
exercises its authority in matters that relate to the commonweal when 
these are clearly national concerns. The flow of immigration into a 
country is self-evidently the proper concern of the state inasmuch as 
only its agents can say Yes or No at the border. And the traffic needs 
to be regulated because there is a greater demand than supply. Mr. Fox 
Butterfield finished his memorable book on Communist China by quoting 
one Chinese who said that if the means to do so could be found, every 
Chinese would go to America to live. "Even the lamp posts would go." 
And sovereignty asserts a recognition that the world has yet to see 
(or even envision) a cultural unity that combines in acceptable 
priorities what we have called the American proposition.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
So, Mr. Clinton edges away from ideologues in his own party (every 
problem is a state problem, and every dollar earned is forfeit to the 
state's agenda), and Senator Dole tries to shape an ideologically 
lucid opposition that appeals both to voters whose dogma is 
conservative, and to those whose inclinations are conservative. It is 
tough going, as much an art as a discipline.

<title>WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE MIAs?</title>
</head>
<center>
<h2>What to do about the MIA's</h2>
</center>
<hr> 
<b>New York, July 14</b>
<p>
<p>
Representative Randy Cunningham of California was a navy pilot during  
the Vietnam War. He was shot down. In recalling those days, in  
Congress last week, he broke into tears as he spoke of American soldiers  
who had died in his arms. He said that the Vietnamese had killed  
American prisoners and were withholding evidence to that effect. His  
conclusion: The recognition of the government of Vietnam "is not a  
political issue for me. This is right and wrong." 
<p> 
It isn't easy to talk back to such as Mr. Cunningham, certainly not if one  
has had no such experience of imprisonment by the Vietnamese. But  
then Senator John McCain was five and a half years a prisoner who  
endured torture. So was it with Pete Peterson of Florida. Bob Kerrey of  
Nebraska wasn't a prisoner, but in pressing the goals of war he won the  
Congressional Medal of Honor. John Kerry of Massachusetts won a  
Silver Star. And these four legislators support the recognition of  
Vietnam. 
<p> 
Whatever one's conclusion in the matter, we need, on meditation, to  
reject the suggestion that this is a moral question. The recognition of de- 
facto governments is the American tradition. Cuba and North Korea are  
exceptions, and the question is, do we want Vietnam to continue as  
another exception? 
<p> 
Here are the unspoken points in the controversy. 
<p>
1. There are no Americans alive who were put down as "missing in  
action.'' How do we know this? By the application of common sense.  
Since any live American soldier, captured between 1966 and 1975,  
surely wishes to return, why would he be kept in Vietnam? 
 <p>
If the Vietnamese kept hinting that a hundred Americans -- let alone  
1,618 Americans -- were going to arrive on a Boeing 747 the day after  
the United States handed over a billion dollars or whatever, the story of  
the MIAs would be comparable to the story of the Cubans caught by  
Castro during the Bay of Pigs invasion, or the Americans held hostage  
by Iran in 1979. Nothing is more useless than a dead hostage, and for  
that reason talk about the "whereabouts" of the MIAs should be  
restricted to talk about where they are buried. 
<p> 
2. If they are buried. Stories about the ferocity of the Vietnamese are not  
exaggerated, and when Congressman Cunningham is reduced to tears  
recollecting what the Vietnamese did, we can reasonably assume that his  
memory is exact. The Vietnamese killed a number of American  
prisoners. As a matter of fact, Americans killed some Vietnamese  
prisoners. And Americans killed a great many Vietnamese women and  
children in air raids. Wars animate the dark side of human nature, and  
although there is a difference between dropping a bomb on Dresden and  
executing soldiers at Katyn, no combating army is at all times governed  
by the models endorsed by international conventions. The American  
officer in charge of the Andersonville prisoner-of-war camp a century  
ago was hanged after the war because of his treatment of prisoners,  
13,000 of whom died. He was a Confederate captain, and his victims  
were American Unionists. We can't hang the malefactors in Vietnam  
because we lost the war. The short of it is that the Vietnamese don't  
know where all their victims were buried any more than the Argentines  
know where their victims -- dating back only 25 years -- were buried, in  
part because many of them were dropped from airplanes into the sea. 
<p> 
3. The Vietnamese government in recent months has been here and there  
cooperative in tracking down graves of dead American soldiers, but that  
government has not come forward with all the records it keeps. 
 <p>
Why is this so? 
 <p>
Almost certainly because those records would reveal that many  
Americans were in fact either killed, or permitted to die of starvation or  
of wounds. It should not surprise us that such records are tenaciously  
kept from view. And one wonders what is the nature of the satisfaction  
that bereaved wives and mothers would get from knowing that the man  
they loved, mysteriously missing since that day when he was captured,  
was in fact killed not in combat, but in detention? What would we have  
accomplished except the revival of bitterness and rage? And if we are  
dealing with the psychological question alone, do we really help the  
survivor by extinguishing hope, even hope forlorn? Would it satisfy those  
who have made all but a lifelong mission in search of her, to find the  
bones of Amelia Earhart?

<h2>
Buchanan And the GOP
</h2>

William F. Buckley Jr.

<P>
The New Hampshire event throws light primarily on Pat Buchanan even 
though, at only a point or two ahead of Senator Dole, his victory was 
nominal. The exhilaration was there, bringing to mind that of Senator 
Eugene McCarthy in 1968 when even though he did not defeat the sitting 
President, he came close enough (at 42 per cent) to electrocute Lyndon 
Johnson. A few weeks later, Johnson announced that he would not run 
for re-election. What has the Buchanan vote in New Hampshire told his 
own party?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This is not instantly clear, because many of his positions are also 
held by other contestants. Steve Forbes is not the original flat-tax 
man, but he is the flat tax's primary champion -- Buchanan, with this 
or the other modification, agrees. On turning functions over to the 
states and, where possible, to individuals, Buchanan's position is 
also that of Lamar Alexander. Senator Dole took a strong stand against 
the degeneracy of Hollywood and so pleased the social conservatives, 
to whom Mr. Buchanan speaks eloquently. Buchanan is isolated from the 
others on two matters, one specific, the other general. He would 
repeal the two treaties that commit us to free trade, NAFTA and GATT. 
And he would adopt an isolationist foreign policy. The other three 
would not. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And yet when Mr. Buchanan speaks of his candidacy he singles it out as 
entirely unique, a messianic episode. And there is a sense in which he 
is correct. These things are not up for arithmetical measurement. 
Suppose one reasonably predicted that on ten positions involving 
public issues, Buchanan and Alexander (or Dole) would vote the same 
way on eight. Does that make them in the long perspective 
indistinguishable?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The answer is, No. Because Buchanan is a figure whose persona 
overwhelms the political grid. In Houston in 1992 he declared that the 
United States was engaged in a war to the death between two cultures, 
the traditional and the countercultural. Many thought him correct (I 
do), but his tone was not that of Abraham Lincoln, but that of John 
Brown. The afflatus is historically distinguished and honored, and as 
often as not the prophet is martyred. He is seldom brought on, like 
Churchill, to act as leader. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There is another question, a matter of public and moral psychology. 
There are those Americans (again, I include myself) who believe that 
the isolationist temptation, both politically and economically, is a 
temptation most fiercely to be avoided, since its implications can be 
lethal. Although I do not believe for one minute that, if he were 
President, Mr. Buchanan would actually rush to dismantle NATO (any 
more than I believe that if Dole were President he would immediately 
balance the budget), the fact is that Buchanan said exactly that. The 
go-it-alone insularity is reflected in his economic nostrum for 
demoralized American workingmen: Blame foreigners. Charge the Japanese 
10 per cent on imports, the Chinese 20 per cent. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The political conundrum looms, as such wise men as there are in 
Republican politics acknowledge one thing, namely that there would not 
be much point in nominating Pat Buchanan with the mission of 
dispossessing President Clinton, since that is inconceivable. Buchanan 
is a prophet, not a king. That being so, practical men will pause over 
how exactly to handle the phenomenon. The memory of George Wallace 
comes to mind. In 1968 his popular strength was critical: he more or 
less owned the South, and he had a large following among hardhats in 
the industrial Midwest. But the Democrats were moving sharply left 
just then and had no time for him or for conservative Democrats in 
general. He avenged himself by running as an independent candidate, 
securing 13.5 per cent of the vote, and ensuring the election of 
Richard Nixon. Wallace's followers voted Republican for the next 
twenty years.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The challenge is to detach from Buchanan that in his campaign which 
the Republican Party ought to concern itself with, and be grateful to 
him for giving it focus. Buchanan almost singlehandedly revitalized 
moral political sentiment on the matter of abortion. His call for a 
national acknowledgment of a common culture has as its symbol a vote 
against Bilingual America. His earnest suspicion of predatory 
government is repeated by other candidates, but they are toothless in 
their language by comparison. The sheer joy with which Buchanan takes 
his positions is -- a joy to hear. A long night with the master 
cheerleader. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It will end in a few weeks, and then Republicans need to hope that the 
idealistic imperative of replacing Mr. Clinton will generate the 
necessary poultices, and mobilize the common will; which requires 
reorienting America in the general direction fought for by Pat 
Buchanan.

Latest  Scare is a  Tempest  in a Teapot    
    </h2>

<P>

Where are those tea-heaving Boston patriots when you need them?  Iced    
tea around the country is turning up deadly and the best that can said    
about it is that the British -- already beset by "mad cow disease" --    
don't have to worry about it since they don't like iced tea anyway.    
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
   
Well, actually no one has died from the tea.  Actually, no one has    
even gotten sick from it.  But that hasn't stopped the media from    
using such sound-bite headlines as "Killer Tea" and "Bad Brew."  Nor    
has it stopped major chains such as Wendy's, Kentucky Fried Chicken,    
Boston Market, Blimpie, and Taco Bell from dropping iced tea from    
their menus.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This tempest in a teapot began back in the summer of 1994 when a    
restaurant customer in Cincinnati asked the local health department to    
test some tea with an "off" odor that had been served him at a    
restaurant.  The Cincinnati Health Department ran a fecal coliform    
test and then ran out to 20 other restaurants, rounded up their iced    
tea, and tested it all.  It found a modest level of fecal coliform    
bacteria.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Coliform in a water supply is a sign of possible harmful    
contamination, including the sometimes deadly bacteria E. coli, which    
caused the Jack in the Box deaths (from eating undercooked beef) three    
years ago.    
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
But tea isn't water;  it comes from a plant and the leaves of that    
plant are naturally exposed to fecal bacteria from droppings of birds    
and other animals.  Bacteria has always been in tea isn't a warning    
sign of anything.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Nonetheless,  a year later the Health Department released the names of    
the restaurants to the Cincinnati Enquirer.  Since "enquiring minds    
want to know" the Enquirer ran a story titled "Iced Tea Worse than    
River," purportedly showing that "contamination is severe" in    
restaurant tea.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

From Ohio the story spread to Kentucky, Georgia, and other states.     
Television station after station went out to local restaurants and    
brought back their iced tea for testing, and each reported in    
breathless horror that all or virtually all of the samples contained    
bacteria.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

It apparently didn't occur or matter to them that if the tea were    
harmful there would have been a steady stream of sickened customers.     
In fact, deaths and illnesses of the iced tea epidemic continued to    
stand at zero.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Finally, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)    
felt compelled to act, issuing an advisory stating, "Tea is a beverage    
with little history of disease transmission," and "At present, no    
outbreaks of infection have been reported to CDC that were clearly    
associated with the consumption of tea."  No outbreaks ever, out of    
nearly 10,000 investigations of food-borne illness over the past    
decade.  The CDC did take the opportunity to provide appropriate    
directions on safely brewing tea.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But this didn't satisfy the Associated Press (AP), which labeled the    
advisory a "warning" and asserted it was based on tests indicating    
"high levels of fecal coliform bacteria, which can cause stomach upset    
and diarrhea."    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

And still nobody had gotten sick from drinking tea.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

AP's report led to more than 140 news segments, almost all alarming.     
"Along with what makes your tea so tasty, you could be getting a    
strong dose of some nasty bacteria that could make you sick," a    
Miami/Ft. Lauderdale TV reporter warned. A Tampa/St. Petersburg    
station declared, "You might be drinking danger and not even know it."      
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A Los Angeles station consulted the expertise of the person on the    
street.  It quoted one iced tea drinker as being "shocked" while    
another said, "I think it's outrageous."    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Meanwhile CNN co-anchor Katherine Calloway punctuated a news segment    
by saying, "I don't think I'll ever order iced tea in a restaurant    
again."    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

And still nobody had gotten sick from drinking tea.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Some stations interviewed "experts" until they found somebody to agree    
with them.  "If one [bacterium] is present, it's too much," a    
University of Texas School of Public professor told a Houston station.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

And still nobody had gotten sick from drinking tea.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

By February, the Wendy's chain had capitulated to the media-generated    
fear, suspending sales of the terrifying tea.  Perish the thought that    
the chain that pioneered a burger with three quarter-pound slabs of    
artery-choking, obesity-causing beef would sell its customers    
something that was bad for them.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

I went to a Wendy's last night.  Virtually every food served is    
guaranteed to push you towards a quadruple-bypass.  You can feel your    
arteries harden just scanning the menu.  They ought to have a team of    
paramedics with a heart resuscitator standing by for anyone who orders    
the Big Bacon Classic Combo.  But iced tea remains banned.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

And still nobody has gotten sick from drinking tea.        
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Other fast-food chains are switching to individual bags of tea, which    
will contain the same bacteria but, hey, it's not safety but the    
appearance of safety that counts, right?    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

I only wish I owned lots of stock in a soda pop company right now.

<title>Fumento: Procter & Gamble's Non-Fat Fat: Neither Satan Nor (Sigh) Savior   -- 3/8/96</title>

<h2>
Procter & Gamble's Non-Fat Fat: Neither Satan Nor (Sigh) Savior 
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

</a>

<P>
Okay, so it wasn't Time magazine's &quot;Man of the Year,&quot; but it came 
awfully close, making the cover of the January 8, 1996 issue. The 
subject was Procter & Gamble's remarkable fat substitute olestra, to 
be marketed under the name Olean. It's been hailed as a powerful 
weapon in the battle of the increasingly bulging American bulge. It's 
also been portrayed as a death-dealing villain. It is neither. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Food and Drug Administration has now approved olestra -- the first 
artificial fat available that can be used in the baking and frying 
process -- to be used in potato chips, taco chips, and crackers.  
Later P & G may request the FDA to approve it for use in such goodies 
as cakes, brownies, and french fries. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to most taste-testers, to the tongue foods made with olestra 
are identical to those made with real fat.  But to the body, olestra 
may as well be Teflon, since it literally slides through the 
intestines without stopping off to visit arteries, hips, or 
waistlines. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The FDA approved the fake fat over the objections of some scientists 
and consumer advocates, who warn that it has unusual risks.  Some 
studies have shown that as little as two ounces of olestra chips can 
act as a laxative. It can also cause other gastrointestinal 
difficulties including a condition called (forgive me; but science 
writers must sometimes be gross) &quot;anal leakage.&quot; 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But as such it will hardly be alone among favorite foods.  One needn't 
be familiar with the famous scene in the movie &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; to 
know the effect that beans can have.  And if you eat more than a few 
prunes or other dried fruits at one sitting you may well find yourself 
doing several more sittings somewhere else. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In any event, the FDA approval requires labeling the product to this 
effect.  My guess, though, is that the label will often be ignored by 
overzealous consumers -- though probably ignored only once. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
More alarming is olestra's ability to wash out of the body certain 
nutrients believed important for preventing disease. While P&G will 
fortify olestra with vitamins A, D, E, and K, it will not add back a 
controversial class of nutrients known as carotenoids, which many 
believe protect against cancer.  P & G says evidence for that is 
lacking. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This nutrient depletion &quot;could potentially produce a large number of 
deaths annually and major morbidity in the U.S. population,&quot; Dr. Meir 
Stampfer of Harvard University wrote the FDA. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But P & G's agnostic position has repeatedly been boosted recently by 
one study after another finding that the Vitamin-A derivative beta 
carotene, a carotenoid, apparently provides  no cancer-fighting 
effects. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The National Institutes of Health in December told the FDA that nobody 
knows if depletions at the levels olestra causes would really harm 
anyone.  But certainly one factor that boosts P & G's position is that 
for the most part, olestra can only wash out whatever went in with it. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Eat spinach and Pringle's potato chips together and you're going to 
lose the benefit of the spinach.  Alas, people are a lot more likely 
to combine the potato chips with dip and a beer or soda pop than with 
nutritious vegetables. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But if olestra isn't the anti-Christ, it may not prove much of a 
savior, either. &quot;By replacing the fat in snacks, Olean can help 
millions of Americans cut excess fat and move closer to achieving an 
important dietary health goal,&quot; says P&G Chairman John Pepper.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I'd say more like thousands, and here's why.  Americans have been 
hoodwinked into believing that anything that's fat free won't make 
them fat. They've bought tens of millions of books and videos from 
shysters like Susan (&quot;Stop the Insanity&quot;) Powter and Martin (&quot;The T-
Factor Diet&quot;) Katahn telling them exactly that. They so fervently want 
to believe it that they do. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But they're wrong.  Any energy consumed that is not burned off 
immediately becomes fat.  True, if you ate two ounces of potato chips 
cooked in olestra rather than fat, you'd have just 120 calories 
instead of 300.  For that matter, you could eat four ounces of olestra 
chips and still come out slightly ahead. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But if Americans could stand to eat that few chips, they wouldn't need 
fat substitutes in the first place and we wouldn't be the fattest 
nation on the face of the earth. Overeating is our problem and 
olestra, far from curing it, will only encourage it among many people. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Consider the experience with artificial sweeteners such as saccharin 
and aspartame (NutraSweet), which provide virtually no calories. Their 
use tripled in the 1980s and should have caused sugar consumption to 
decline and caloric intake to decline.  Instead even as artificial 
sweetener consumption has increased so has sugar intake, caloric 
intake, and Americans' waistlines.   
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
That said, if you have the discipline to simply swap artificial 
sweeteners for sugar and don't tell yourself that a Diet Coke allows 
you to eat an extra piece of fried chicken, you can come out ahead of 
the game. Likewise, if you eat ten olestra potato chips instead of ten 
fat-fried potato chips, you win. It's a matter of free will and having 
the strength to exercise it. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
That's why the FDA's decision was a good one. Government can protect 
us from dangerous substances, but government cannot protect us from 
ourselves.

<i>NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 14</i>
<hr>
<h2>X-Ray Time</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
It is useful to examine the federal deadlock through a strictly 
democratic prism.
<p>
1. We have a separation of powers that authorizes Congress uniquely to 
pass legislation; and a subdivision here that authorizes only the 
House of Representatives to write bills that will cost money.
<p>
2. The President is authorized to veto any bill presented to him by 
Congress. To override a presidential veto requires two-thirds of the 
vote in each house.
<p>
3. In the existing situation, a majority of both houses passes a 
measure that would simultaneously do a great many things, including 
program an increase in payments required by the public to sustain 
Medicaid and Medicare.
<p>
4. The President exercises his veto, complaining specifically about 
the measure's health-care provisions.
<p>
5. Congressional leadership asks itself: Given that an override of the 
veto cannot be recruited, how might Congress force its hand on the 
President?
<p>
Force its hand!? Yes, that is what Messrs. Dole and Gingrich are 
saying in effect, because they are seeking to implement what they 
understand as strict instructions from the American people. They are 
to move toward balancing the budget, and their plan for doing so is 
blocked by the President's power.
<p>
But Congress also has power. The continuation of federal activity, 
including the health benefits, requires financing. It is generally 
assumed that so-called entitlements are inertial forces that cannot be 
interrupted. But the forward movement of those forces requires 
constant propulsion, and this is doable only by appropriations by 
Congress.
<p>
The leadership is quite confident that its mandate hasn't withered 
since it was enunciated in the November election. A national survey 
done by Public Opinion Strategies only a week ago reveals that 66 per 
cent of Americans favor "balancing the budget [even] if that means 
that spending on Medicare and Medicaid would continue to increase but 
at a lower rate." Accordingly, Congress uses its trump card and 
freezes spending at the highest level authorized by a preceding 
Congress, i.e., at 4.9 trillion borrowed dollars.
<p>
So: The people voted, Congress acted, the President vetoed, Congress 
used its primordial power.
<p>
In a parliamentary system, such an impasse would be quickly solved. 
The parliament would be dissolved, an election scheduled. If the party 
upholding a balanced budget prevailed in that election, the prime 
minister would resign and be replaced by a member of the validated 
party. If otherwise, the prime minister would be back with a compliant 
legislature. But then, the prime minister wouldn't be occupying the 
executive mansion unless placed there by the ruling faction in the 
legislature. What we face today is what the British would call a 
constitutional crisis.
<p>
The public has not yet been discomfited, and no one will be for a 
period, the exception being 800,000 furloughed federal workers. The 
Treasury secretary is maneuvering and isn't likely to run out of gas 
unless a major creditor nation decides that there is too much harum-
scarum going on and, instead of holding its reserves in dollars, 
switches to yen, or marks, or pounds sterling.
<p>
What we do have is high-pitched political theater. The people are 
vaguely aware of the instructions they gave to the new Congress, but 
they are, with various degrees of intensity, concerned with medical 
care, and that element of Americans most concerned is of course the 
senior citizens, and it is they who exercise critical clout. The 
President is relying on his incantatory evocations of starving 
children and homeless old people, with here and there a tear shed for 
what used to be Yellowstone Park. Presidential indignation makes its 
way quickly to the headlines.
<p>
By contrast, it is Congress that is held to be the agent of all those 
things, and we come quickly on the supreme irony, which is that 
references are almost inevitably to the "rigid," the "defiant," the 
"reckless" Congress, the complement of the lonely, single defender of 
the people's interest. There was never a better example of everybody 
being out of step except Johnny.<p>

<h3>EPA'S OWN PANEL SAYS IT<br> MASQUERADES DIOXIN POLICY AS SCIENCE</h3>  

By <br><a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">Michael Fumento</a>
</center>
<hr> 
You probably don't remember when the EPA released its report on dioxin in September in the same way you remember, say, when JFK was shot or O.J. took his ride in the Ford Bronco. But the headlines might ring a bell:  "Dioxin Pollution Risks 'Worse than Feared,'" "Toxicity of Times Beach 'No Longer in Doubt,'" "Dioxin Scare is Real."<p>
Here's the catch.<p>
The EPA report was just a draft.  As in: "not the one that counts."  As such, it had yet to be evaluated by the agency's Scientific Advisory Board (SAB).  Now that board has rejected the conclusions that led to those scary headlines and sent the report back to the agency for a rewrite.<p>
Alas, no headlines this time. No, not a single major newspaper (or minor one that I'm aware of) ran a news story on the SAB decision, though Science magazine gave it a short write-up ("Panel Slams EPA's Dioxin Analysis") and there were a few editorials and op-eds.<p>
For 15 years now, the EPA has pursued a vendetta against dioxin, a by-product of paper bleaching, and of incineration of certain materials.  Until it was banned as such, it was also a by-product in the 
manufacturing of some herbicides, including the notorious Agent Orange.<p>
Ever since the chemical was found to be horribly toxic to guinea pigs -- albeit far less so to every other animal species tested, including other rodents -- the EPA and other environmental organizations have 
relentlessly attacked it as they have no other chemical save the pesticide DDT.<p>
Fear of dioxin contamination led to the evacuation of Love Canal and Times Beach, Missouri, and to telling Vietnam vets that they may be at extraordinary risk of disease.<p>
As a member of the class of chemicals called organochlorines, dioxin has become a cornerstone of Greenpeace's and other groups' efforts to ban all synthetic organochlorines -- a ban that would cripple the economy.<p>
The purpose of the EPA draft report was to show that this vendetta had been justified.  In addition to the old charge of dioxin being a possible human carcinogen -- causing as many as one in 1,000 human 
cancers -- the EPA added two newer charges: that it might affect human children in the womb and that it could compromise immune systems at levels approaching those to which Americans are currently exposed.<p>
While those human exposure levels are infinitesimal compared to our exposure to so many other chemicals, the EPA maintained that what causes illness in some animals at huge doses must also cause sickness in humans at tiny ones. Predictably it prompted such headlines such as "EPA:  Dioxin Exposure is Risky for People, Too."<p>
But several scientists at the meeting challenged the EPA's assumption, used in all its policy-making that there is no threshold below which a harmful chemical causes no harm. One was the University of Wisconsin's Alan Poland, widely known for his discovery of the "dioxin receptor," the molecule in cells to which dioxin must bind before it produces any affects.  He said 150 years of science contradicted the EPA no-threshold position.  Regarding dioxin, Poland said the normal level to which Americans are 
exposed -- four molecules of dioxin per cell -- is far below the number required to have an effect, considering that there are about 10,000 receptor molecules per cell.<p>
One EPA official complained to me that the board meeting had unfairly been characterized as negative. In fact, he said, the only problems the SAB found were with the ninth chapter. Of the first eight, it was highly complimentary.<p>
But that's just the point.  The first eight chapters were written by scientists outside of the EPA.  Only the last chapter, the conclusive one, the one from which EPA was to draw its regulatory policy and from 
which the media drew the headlines -- that was the one written by the EPA itself.
In that chapter, said Poland at the meeting, "policy masquerades as science."<p>
"This is probably the best data set that the EPA will see in my lifetime," Poland added.  "Yet, despite all of that, the first eight chapters are thrown away."<p>
Board members repeatedly accused the EPA of picking and choosing its data.  For example, the largest, most-heavily studied group of persons with known high exposure to dioxin were the members of Operation Ranch Hand, the men who did the actual spraying of Agent Orange on the jungles of South Vietnam. (Their motto: "Only you can prevent forests.") The EPA report duly noted any possible minor abnormality in this group.  But it neglected to say the Ranch Handers were strapping specimens of healthy humanity.<p>
"The EPA didn't mention that there were no more cancers than would be expected, no affects on the immune and nervous systems, no increase in deaths, and no increased birth defects in their children." SAB member and Office of Technology Assessment official Michael Gough told me.  "They mentioned nothing that didn't serve their purpose."<p>
One SAB member,  Dr. Knute Ringen of the Center to Protect Workers' Rights in Washington, D.C., concluded: "I think that the agency has pretty much come to the end of the line with regard to producing 
useful decision-making information on dioxin, and that it's time to go on to something else."<p>
But the EPA's dogged obsession with justifying its dioxin policy will not end -- unless, that is, Congress finally pulls the purse strings shut.<p>

<title>Se Habla Ingles</title>

<i>NEW YORK, SEPTEMBER 5</i><hr>

<h2>Se Habla Ingles</h2><br><a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><i><b>William F. Buckley Jr.</b></i></a><hr></center><br>
 

It was wise of Senator Dole to come down on English as the national 
language when he was firing away over the weekend at anti-U.S. 
academics. The movement to make English the official language of the 
United States is making legislative headway. The State of New 
Hampshire has just now enacted an English-language bill, and what 
appeals to New Hampshire, beyond apples, tends to appeal to 
presidential candidates.<p>

The principal lobbying group in favor of universalizing English (it is 
called "U.S. English") is ironically headed up by someone whose native 
language wasn't English (he is Mauro E. Mujica). And of course the 
heftiest warrior for English was the late senator and semanticist S. 
I. Hayakawa, whose native language was Japanese. Senator Hayakawa 
wanted nothing less than a constitutional amendment. U.S. English will 
settle for less; others want more.<p>

There is of course the other side. Why does the United States have to 
have a common language? After all, Switzerland doesn't.<p>

The first thing to learn about Switzerland is never to invoke what 
happens there in an effort to prove any point about any other country. 
Switzerland breaks all the rules, gets away with it; is a wonderful 
country with, unhappily, a bad drug problem.<p>

There are very good historical reasons why the French should have been 
permitted to nourish their language in Canada and, more recently, to 
insist on the recognition of French as a substitute language in 
everything from ballot forms to road signs. But every now and again 
Canada threatens to become two nations, and so reminds us of the 
burden the British would have been spared if, two hundred years ago, 
they had, after defeating the French, exported them back to France, or 
else sent them south to the United States, where immigrants were 
taught English.<p>

Opponents of the universalization of English use two arguments. The 
first is multiculturalist in ideology, the second, a faux 
cosmopolitanism. There is every reason in the world for the schools in 
the United States to teach foreign languages, beginning with Spanish, 
which is progressively important in commerce and hemispheric comity. 
But hanging onto one's Spanish if that is the native language is 
entirely different from depending on it.<p>

It makes sense in addressing the issue to close our eyes to what 
happens with the first generation. Yes, many immigrants -- perhaps 
millions -- who arrived here in middle age went on to become 
conversant with English. But millions did not, and will not, and it is 
an expression of geniality to give them radio and television and 
newspapers in Spanish.<p>

But their children need to be treated differently. I have experienced 
a 15-year-old boy who speaks English with difficulty even though he 
has lived in New York City with his mother for five years. It turns 
out that in public school, before he moved to a parochial school where 
he now studies, young Saul was taught six classes every day, five of 
them in Spanish.<p>

The quarrel is between two camps, one of them, so to speak, total 
immersion in its approach, the second a little looser. There are those 
who believe that English can only be rapidly mastered if every 
foreigner is required to use it when engaged in any transaction over 
which that person is superintended. Thus, for instance, employees at 
McDonald's would be required to talk to each other in English while 
on-premise. One way to generalize this approach is that everywhere 
you're not permitted to smoke, you are permitted to speak only in 
English.<p>

The approach of U.S. English is less draconian, so also is the House 
bill introduced by Representative Bill Emerson. It would enforce the 
use only of English in all government communications, forms, ballots, 
whatever. Mr. Emerson's bill has 180 sponsors, and in a previous 
version had also as sponsor Newt Gingrich, who endorses 
enthusiastically the notion of a national language, nationally 
accepted as such.<p>

It is really quite cruel to go in the other direction. A few years ago 
a middle-aged woman told me that when her parents were sent to Moscow 
they plunked her down in a Russian school. "I cried every day for 
about a month and in about six weeks I understood everything that was 
said in Russian." To stand in the way of young people devoting 
themselves to the English language is on the order of encouraging 
obesity by cramming them with Mars bars. It is surely the case that 
every immigrant who can now handle English is grateful for the 
experience even if it meant crawling through gnarled, spiky, thorny 
brushwood for a few months or years.<p>

Echoes of a Famine from 150 Years Ago
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">

<P>
GALWAY, REPUBLIC OF IRELAND
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Grown men wept at the sight.  Women screamed and tore their hair.  
Some fainted.  For they knew that from Galway Bay to Dublin, from Cork 
to Belfast, death would soon stalk the land.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The event was the infestation of the Ireland's potato crop with "late 
blight." It was to spark the "Great Hunger," the 150th anniversary of 
which we mark this year.  Before it ended, a million Irish had died, 
and perhaps a million more had emigrated, and the future of Ireland -- 
and the United States, where most of the emigres landed -- would be 
forever changed.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Botanists will tell you the famine was caused by the fungus 
Phytophthora infestans.  Yet wrong-headed government policies had at 
least as much to do with it.  As one Dubliner put it to me during my 
visit, "Where you see famine, politics must lie  just below the 
surface."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Before the famine, the Irish had been among the healthiest people in 
Europe.  Their usual daily diet was potatoes.  These comprised perhaps 
60 percent of the food for the people in general but close to 100 
percent for those in the poorer west and southwest regions of the 
country.  Potatoes could be grown economically even on the tiny 
parcels of land the Irish Catholics were allowed to cultivate. 
Further, they thrived even in the rocky, damp earth of the western 
part of the island.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The menu was monotonous but highly nutritious. If you ate enough -- 
and the Irish men ate as many as 14 pounds a day -- they supplied 
virtually every vitamin and nutrient your body needed.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But in 1845, this godsend became a deadly liability.  That's when the 
late blight first appeared.  (Ironically, it could have been the 
result of importing a new strain of potato from America to make the 
current strain healthier.) The blight moved so quickly you could 
practically watch its progression, and in a matter of days a field 
would be destroyed.  Like a dark veil it spread across parts of 
continental Europe, then England, and then hopped across the Irish 
channel.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Poor farmers watched in horror as their green field turned black and 
then began to give off a stench like putrefying flesh.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Still, in 1845 the blight only claimed about 60 percent of what would 
have been a bumper crop in Ireland.  Food in storage was enough to 
tide the population over for a year.  But when the late blight 
appeared again the next year, the stores had been exhausted and 
suffering would begin that the Irish to this day have not forgotten.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Many people died from outright starvation.  Autopsies performed on the 
dead would find their bodies entirely devoid of food.  Many more, 
however, in their weakened state, succumbed to "famine fever," a 
general term describing illness from typhus, dysentery, and cholera.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Reported the Cork Examiner of the poor in its community:
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Death is in every hovel; disease and famine, its dread precursors, 
have fastened on the young and old, the strong and the feeble, the 
mother  and the infant; whole families lie together on the damp floor, 
devoured by fever, without a human being to wet their burning lips or 
raise their languid heads; the husband dies by the side of the wife, 
and she knows not that he is beyond the reach of earthly suffering; 
the same rag covers the festering remains of mortality and the 
skeleton forms of their living, who are unconscious of the horrible 
contiguity; rats devour the corpse, and there is no energy among the 
living to scare them from their horrid banquet; fathers bury their 
children without a sigh, and cover them in shallow graves, round which 
no weeping mother, no sympathizing friends, are grouped; one scanty 
funeral is followed by another and another.  Without food or fuel, bed 
or bedding, whole families are shut up in naked hovels, dropping one 
by one into the arms of death.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite the potato failure, much of this suffering was not inevitable.  
For just as was the case recently in Ethiopia and Somalia, crop 
failures play on a part in famines.  The rest comes from the failure 
of government.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ireland was at the time actually a part, albeit reluctantly so, of the 
wealthiest nation on earth, the United Kingdom.  But many in Britain 
loathed its people.  In those days before CNN, British papers often 
depicted  the Irish as slothful and stupid "bogtrotters."  British 
cartoonists depicted them as hairless apes.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Like today, the government promised much and delivered little.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Much of Ireland's produce was in grains, but these continued to leave 
port for English and other destinations.  Some food was imported, but 
then as today, powerful special interest groups prevailed upon the 
government to severely limit imports rather than to hurt their bottom 
lines. Then, as today, the government set up public works projects to 
provide pointless make-work jobs, building roads that began and ended 
nowhere and docks where no port would ever be.  Then, as today, people 
were huddled together in massive projects.  Often as not disease ended 
their stay.  (Today, it would be crime or drugs.)
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Today the line, "We're from the government and we're here to help," 
has become a joke.  Back then, nobody laughed.  The hatred they 
developed has survived to this day and plays out in the bitter 
violence of the Irish Republican Army.  The combination of a deadly 
fungus and a deadly government policy continues to be lethal today, 
150 years later.

<h2>Crime Study Doesn't Show Racism</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><i>Michael Fumento</i> </a>
</center><hr>
  
 

One in three young black men is serving a criminal sentence, according 
to a new report that has received wide media coverage. Depending on 
your perspective, the timing couldn't have been more ironic or more 
fitting, coming as it did on the heels of the "not guilty" verdict in 
the O.J. Simpson case.
                                   <P>
Could this be what Simpson attorney Johnnie Cochran was talking about 
when he urged the jury to "send a message"?  Was the message that 
blacks are tired of blacks behind bars?
                <P>
There are certainly a lot there, though perhaps not as many as you 
might think from the news stories. In the report, the Sentencing 
Project, an advocacy group that favors alternatives to prison, 
estimates that on any given day 32 percent of black men ages 20 to 29 
are serving a criminal sentence. 
                                                                             <P>
That's 827,400 young black men. But what most of the news stories 
didn't tell you was that the majority were not behind bars but on 
probation or parole. If you don't think that's an important 
distinction, then you've never been in jail or prison and have never 
talked to anybody who has.
                                                                 <P>
The Sentencing Project study quite deliberately blurs this 
distinction, as when it says that "about 3/4 of all offenders under 
supervision have been convicted of a non-violent offense." True, but a 
1991 Department of Justice survey of state prison inmates found that 
of those actually incarcerated, half had committed violent crimes and 
fully 94% had either committed a violent crime or had received a 
previous criminal sentence.  
                                                  <P>
It's a good thing that the Sentencing Project didn't actually focus 
just on prison sentences, because the reality is that they have become 
a joke. Consider the four original suspects in the killing of British 
tourist Gary Colley at a Florida rest stop two years ago. One already 
had at least 56 prior arrests by the age of 13; another had more than 
30 arrests and a third had at least two dozen. The 13-year-old was 
released for lack of evidence and most recently was arrested for 
kidnaping and robbing a pizza deliverer at gunpoint.
                                         <P>
But the media reporting on the Sentencing Project study didn't go into 
any of this. Nor did the Rev. Jesse Jackson when he cited it at his 
"Million Man March" speech. Instead they concentrated on the disparity 
between black and white sentencing, noting that only 6.7% of 20-29-
year-old whites were ending up on the wrong side of the law.
                                <P>
To its credit, the study did not simply scream about racism, although 
the media attempted to portray it that way. It doesn't accuse all 
cops, or judges for that matter, of being Mark Fuhrmans. Rather, it 
says, the great majority of the increase in sentencing for blacks in 
recent years has come about because of a disproportionate emphasis on 
jailing those involved with crack cocaine usage.
                      <P>
Crack cocaine, it notes, is far more of a black problem than is powder 
cocaine, therefore discriminating against crack users and dealers 
means discriminating against blacks.
              <P>
But there is good reason to discriminate between types of cocaine. 
Several studies have concluded, as did that of Rutgers University 
researchers Kolin Chin and Jeffrey Fagan, that "arrest and conviction 
data suggest that violence and participation in drug selling are more 
strongly associated with crack than with cocaine [powder].
                                                      <P>
"The evidence is quite clear," American Enterprise Association 
Resident Scholar Doug Besharov told me. "Crack is a more addictive, 
violence-creating drug than is powder cocaine. Period."
                                             <P>
Further, the charge of drug possession is often used when the offender 
has committed other crimes that are much more serious but harder to 
prove. It is also often used in plea-bargaining cases, wherein the 
accused agrees to plead guilty to the least serious offense with which 
he has been charged.
                                  <P>
Besharov says, "There's no doubt that crack has assaulted the black 
community." Indeed, so have black criminals. Ninety percent of their 
victims are black themselves. White liberal do-gooders such as make up 
most of the staff at the Sentencing Project have little to fear if we 
slacken our efforts at criminal enforcement.
                         <P>
There's no doubt there's something pathologically wrong in a society 
in which a third of the members of the second-largest race are 
involved in the criminal justice system.  Throwing young men in prison 
or putting them on probation or parole doesn't solve this problem. The 
ultimate solution lies in getting rid of government programs that 
break down the family, like Aid to Families with Dependent Children, 
in improving the quality of public schools, in fostering a culture of 
personal responsibility and in no longer blaming racism for every 
black problem.
    <P>
So long as business as usual goes on in the black inner-cities, they 
will produce vast numbers of criminals and many of these will wind up 
in the penal system. And business as usual, it is.  After the O.J. 
Simpson verdict, one Nation of Islam leader called on Simpson to 
become an active symbol for the nation's troubled black youth. Jesse 
Jackson gushed, "O.J. can now be a big force, in my judgment, in 
taking the lead against domestic violence."
                                                         <P>
Egad! And John Wayne Gacy should have opened a home for wayward boys 
while Jeffrey Dahmer should have become president of the National 
Restaurant Association.
                                              <P>
No, putting away young black men doesn't cure the problem. But until 
we're willing to apply the cure, it can keep the problem from becoming 
that much worse.
                                    <P>

<title>What About The 'Overclass'?</title>

<i>New York, August 1, 1995</i><hr>

<h2>What About The 'Overclass'?</h2>
<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><i>William F. Buckley Jr. </i></a><hr>
</center>
<p>
<p>


<p>
<p>
The author Michael Lind was interviewed on the (indispensable) MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour and was questioned about some of the theses of his book The Next American Nation [reviewed this issue, p. 60]. One of these is that the United States is headed toward a "Brazilianization" 
of society, by which Mr. Lind meant that the affluent class is self-perpetuating and is sealing itself off from the rest of the country. How? By sending its sons and daughters to the most privileged 
colleges, taking refuge in private country clubs and mansions, intermarrying, and so on. The greatest entitlement in the hands of this overclass, said Mr. Lind, is the institution of the "legacy" in 
the primary colleges and universities. 
<p>
Interviewer David Gergen came up with a half-dozen super-prominent men in American political life who had not attended the fancy colleges. Furthermore, 45 per cent of top chief executives either dropped out of college or graduated from a second- or third-category college. How did 
Mr. Lind account for that? Oh. Well, he wasn't saying that meritocracy was dead in America, in fact it is more pronounced than it was in the nineteenth century. It just isn't meritocratic enough.
<p>
It is a very old complaint, that which is leveled at the wealthy and their progeny. It certainly attracted the attention of Andrew Carnegie, who favored a 100 per cent inheritance tax. The current 
federal estate tax is very high -- 60 per cent; 80 to 85 per cent on money left to grandchildren, beyond the generation-skipping allowance. The federal estate tax doesn't yield all that much revenue (the 1995 
estimate is $15.6 billion, or 1.2 per cent of total federal receipts) and definitive studies haven't been done -- because they can't be done -- to measure the economic impact of the high taxes. We do not know how many industrious and inventive Americans switch into overdrive instead of continuing to chug-chug up the hill to accumulate more to leave their children and grandchildren. The avoidance of taxes is a primal urge, like sex and patriotism and religion, and lighthearted redistributionists are well counseled to be aware of this, though when the jacobinical fever rages, people don't care whether they are stifling production with their taxes. All that they care about is that 
the Haves shall have less. 
<p>
On the matter of the "legacy" to entry into fancy colleges, Mr. Lind is on insecure ground again. It is true that at the margin, the practice goes on. But it is very far from being comprehensive. Twenty-
five years ago the admissions director of Yale University got into serious trouble with the alumni after several years' application of what very nearly amounted to an anti-legacy policy, during which he 
reduced to 13 per cent (from about 18) the sons of Eli admitted.
<p>
The question was raised, For what reason are alumni expected to give funds to their alma mater? Yes, perhaps, as a measure of gratitude for education and experiences received. And yes, because they wish their alma mater to continue to retain fine scholars. But first-rate scholars are going to be teaching somewhere -- they don't have to teach at any one university. At about that time (the Sixties), 
Professor C. Vann Woodward, the distinguished Southern historian, was lured away from Johns Hopkins by Yale at considerable expense. This move did not further "education": the kids are as bright at Johns Hopkins as at Yale; and anyway, professors at that level are hired primarily to write books and teach graduate students.
<p>
To contribute to Yale to make it possible for Vann Woodward to move there traces to a perfectly understandable pride, tribal in character, in maintaining in first-rate condition the university to which the 
alumnus hopes his son or daughter will one day be admitted. Mr. Lind's thesis isn't really persuasive unless somebody comes up with Animal House students congestively present at Yale or Harvard or Stanford. That won't happen because such folk don't, pace Lind, get admitted. No alumnus is going to yell, whatever his contributions to his alma mater, if his son is turned down after coming in with a combined SAT score in three digits.
<p>
An old bark, an old tree, bringing to mind that the problem in Brazil is that they don't behave as we do.

<html><head><title>Buckley:  The UN at 50</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg"><center><i>NEW YORK, OCTOBER 24</i><hr><h2>The UN at 50</h2><br><a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
 
Fifty years of the United Nations certainly does not bring on 
undifferentiated congratulations. The world organization received a 
jump start on hypocrisy when, in San Francisco, on a motion that 
Sweden, Switzerland, and Ireland be admitted, the ruling was negative, 
on the grounds that they were not "peace-loving nations." They were 
three countries that had not gone to war. But the term "peace-loving" 
had already got into the hands of the wordsmiths who gave us the 
"Democratic Republic of Germany," which was Soviet-speak for 
undemocratic unrepublican East Germany. 
<p>
In the Security Council we had from the outset the Soviet Union as a 
permanent member with veto rights, and then China, with the same 
rights. And in the General Assembly, with spooky consistency the Third 
World powers voted against Western measures, in line with Soviet 
measures. When in 1960 Fidel Castro, freshly arrived in power, visited 
the UN, he was hailed as a hero. In 1979, after he had clearly 
established himself as a ruler as tyrannical as those who presided 
over North Korea and Albania, he visited the United Nations again; 
and, again, was treated as a hero by the majority of its members. 
<p>
On Sunday, President Clinton opened the celebratory proceedings by 
giving a moderate speech about this and that. Later in the day, Castro 
spoke -- the usual tirade against Western conventions, larded with the 
usual declamations in favor of self-government everywhere except in 
Cuba -- and got an ovation. Much heavier applause than that given to 
the President of the host country, our old friend, the superpower, 
Uncle Sam. 
<p>
We pause to note that one reason for the anti-U.S. fever within the UN 
these days is our failure to pay our debt to the UN. When the 
organization was founded, President Truman accepted an imposition on 
the U.S. of 40 per cent of the UN's budget. In the immediate postwar 
world that was not an unreasonable allocation, given that we were at 
the time generating about 50 per cent of the world's production. In 
1972 we reduced our share to 25 per cent, in line with the reviving 
economic fortunes of other countries. But in 1982 we began to stall on 
our payments, in part because we thought the allocations for peace-
keeping expenses were rigged against us, in part because the relevant 
committees in Congress found it tempting to economize at the expense 
of an organization not all that popular back home.
<p>
But the result of it is a very considerable embarrassment. If the 
State Department believes we are unfairly burdened, then that case 
should be made. But to make it by simply refusing to pay is to act the 
deadbeat. We are not alone in lateness in paying our share, but we are 
the major offender and certainly the most conspicuous. It would be 
nice to hear from the presidential candidates that they don't go for 
cheating on obligations, whether to the American Express Company or to 
the United Nations.
<p>
The pointed objective of Fidel Castro this time around is to generate 
pressure to repeal the U.S. embargo. It is nice to see the 
tatterdemalion prince of universal prosperity through Marxism begging 
U.S. business to come on down and give him a hand. And on the merits 
of the argument, there is every reason to restore relations with Cuba 
given that it is no longer a salient of a global power seeking the 
overthrow of the United States. We would need to swallow our pride, 
but then that is healthy: we did not succeed in bringing Castro down, 
and it is not dignified to salve our bad consciences by continuing 
policies appropriate only during the Cold War. We are trading with 
Vietnam and China, and we never really broke off from trading with the 
Soviet Union, so why Castro?
<p>
He made his demonstration at the UN, and sharply, and sadly, reminded 
us all that if the division within the UN were once again suddenly to 
return to Communist superpower challenging Western superpower, we'd 
almost certainly find ourselves face to face with the old lineup. 
About 80 per cent anti-American. The old juices run strong, anti-, and 
jealous of, success; there are memories mired in anti-colonialist 
slogans, and then, too, some defensible skepticism over U.S. 
leadership. 
<p>
But the UN is with us. We should pay our debt, ignore most of its 
pieties, and make policy as we have always made it, soliciting UN 
sanction but quite prepared, when necessary, to ignore it.

<title>The Susan Smith Case</title>
</head>
<center><h2>The Susan Smith Case</h2></center>
<p>
<p>
<hr>
NEW YORK, JULY 28
<p>
<p>
The brother of Susan Smith asked the jurors what would be the point of 
sentencing Mrs. Smith to death -- hasn't there been enough tragedy in 
her family already? That statement did not resonate very widely 
because Mrs. Smith's family comprised the two boys she murdered, and 
an ex-husband who had already told the jury he thought she should be 
executed. And of course the point logically arises: If there is a law 
in South Carolina specifying execution for capital offenses, what 
capital offenses are we going to sub-specify as especially appropriate 
for execution?
<p>
Well of course no one disputes the sheer horror of the means by which 
Mrs. Smith elected to kill her children. Under the circumstances, the 
defense needed to go in a different direction from what the defense 
has done with O. J. Simpson. It needed to plead with the jury the 
awful aspects of her own life.
<p>
Newspaper readers are familiar with the details: the suicide of her 
father when she was 6, seduction by her stepfather when she entered 
her teens, a marriage that resulted in two sons followed by a divorce 
followed by a love affair with her boss alongside a love affair with 
her boss's son coextensive with sex with her stepfather. The reason 
for all of this, the defense explained, is the trauma of the suicide 
of her father and the fear she felt that to break away from her 
stepfather would be in the nature of renewing the wound that had left 
her fatherless at 6 -- and how are we doing, ladies and gentlemen of 
the jury, have we got you in the Menendez mood? You do remember the 
Menendez brothers, and how convincing it was that they really felt 
they had to empty their shotguns at their mother and father?
<p>
It pays, if only as an exercise, to credit the teleology of Susan 
Smith's mental development. Let us assume that the suicide of her 
father led her compulsively to submit to sex with her stepfather. Let 
us suppose that that driving compulsion to love copiously led her to 
leave her husband and take to her bed her boss, and then his son; that 
her anxiety for the continued sexual devotion of the son led her to 
interpret his statement that he would not marry a woman and take on 
the burden of two children to the perfectly logical conclusion that 
the children were an insufferable burden: that that led her 
compulsively to strap the two impediments onto the back seat of the 
car, and let it slide into the lake. A quite natural sense of self-
protection caused her to tell police of a black abductor who at 
gunpoint had whisked the children away. And then after nine days, as 
the circumstantial evidence tightened about her, she began to descry a 
noose. At that point she confessed.
<p>
Now the refinement of the McNaghten defense, which requires the 
prosecution to establish that the defendant knew the difference 
between right and wrong, would not appear to have applied. Mrs. Smith 
acknowledged to her ex-husband that she was "sorry" she hadn't 
accepted his offer to take the boys home with him.
<p>
What was fought over, in the jury deliberations, is really the 
question of capital punishment. 1) The gravity of the offense was 
established. 2) The defendant's knowledge that what she did was wrong 
wasn't doubted. In which case, 3) shouldn't she be sentenced to death?
<p>
The risk in capital prosecutions was of course highlighted by the 
Menendez verdict. The law, roundly stated, tells us that you may not 
kill another person except in self-defense. The Menendez brothers had 
no such excuse, but they were got off by a lawyer who mesmerized the 
jury into rogue theories of psychological compulsions.
<p>
Such arguments go to eristic legal lengths. Suppose we begin with the 
simple postulate that murder is aberrational behavior. Then the 
question -- under the handling of defense lawyers -- becomes: What 
caused such behavior? Mean parents? Suicidal fathers? Cruelty? Sex? 
Fear? -- the list is infinite because the postulate is fixed. It is 
that if somebody is murdered, it has to be that the murderer departed 
from the moral fixes that restrain other human beings. Accordingly the 
quest is for the cause of the misbehavior, and the only penological 
reason to keep the murderer in jail is to prevent him from doing it 
again.
<p>
It became, really, that all over again, a fight over capital 
punishment. "What happened to Michael and Alex is a tragedy," said the 
defense. "To strap Susan in a chair and send 2,000 volts into her in 
the name of justice -- "
<p>
He was interrupted by the prosecution, who reminded him that more 
humane means of execution had been authorized by the State of South 
Carolina. But the State of South Carolina might just as well abolish 
capital punishment now that Susan Smith has been spared.

<title>Fumento:  Population Action Tells a Fish Story about Fish Supply </title>

<h2>Population Action Tells a Fish Story about Fish Supply </h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><i>Michael Fumento</i> </a>
</center><hr>

 
 

"A burgeoning population and the growing demand for seafood may make 
fish unavailable to nearly a billion of the world's poor in the next 
century, says a new report." If you read USA Today or any number of 
other papers that carried a similar story, you probably believe that. 
Which is too bad because the report, issued by the pro-population 
control Population Action International is just one big, well, fish 
story.
 <P>
There's one huge problem with the report.  See if you can pick it out 
by reading between the lines of report co-author Robert Engelman. 
"We're up against the wall," he said. "Since the end of the  80s, 
we've been catching the same amount of wild fish around the world, 
[but] there are about 90 million more people every year."
               <P>
Did you notice the qualifying word: "wild"?  Yes, the statement is 
true for wild fish but completely ignores the role of farmed fish, 
called "aquaculture."  Looking at data provided in a 1995 United 
Nations Food and Agricultural Organization publication, "The State of 
World Fisheries and Aquaculture," we see that for the earliest year 
provided (1984) there were 51,105 thousand tons of wild fish caught 
with 6,933 thousand tons raised on farms.  Wild fish capture peaked 
out in 1989 and has dropped slightly to 56,470 thousand tons by 1993, 
but aquaculture continued growing like gangbusters to 15,800 tons by 
1993.
     <P>
Cmbining both types of fish, there was far from a decline but rather a 
24% increase in the nine-year period, fueled by a 128% growth in 
aquaculture. At the same time world population increased by only 16%. 
Unless you just happen to hate fish, that's a mighty nice "wall" we're 
up against. Far from running out of the slimy things, we're 
practically swimming in them.
                    <P>
Unfortunately, neither USA Today nor some of the other papers that 
carried the story bothered to mention aquaculture. In fact, nobody who 
carried the story allowed any criticism of the report at all.
                              <P>
The Population Action International study does mention the growing 
aquaculture industry, saying it "compensates somewhat for declines in 
fish catches." It even depicts a chart showing its phenomenal growth. 
But it downplays the industry, saying "Cultivation of fish has so far 
proven too costly to provide large amounts of food to poor people."
   <P>
But the aforementioned U.N. publication, using the same data as 
Population Action International, says otherwise. "The balance of 31 
million tons in the supplies of food fish required by the year 2010 
would have to come from aquaculture, which has been expanding at a 
rate of one million tons a year, increasing to almost two million tons 
in 1993." Meanwhile, to continue feeding the world at the same rate 
would require "an overall average annual increase of less than one 
million tons a year."
            <P>
While Population Action says, "There is little prospect for major 
expansion of aquaculture in Africa, the U.N. report says aquaculture's 
phenomenal "growth should continue, recognizing the SIGNIFICANT 
POTENTIAL OF INCREASED FARMED FISH PRODUCTION IN AFRICA and Latin 
America." (Emphasis mine.)
                         <P>
Yet, the real powerhouse could be the United States. So far all of 
North America produces only 3.7% of the world's aquaculture.  The 
United States produces less than a 16th of China's output. The reason 
is that Americans are not big fish eaters and that, exactly opposite 
of what Population Action is telling us, those who are big fish eaters 
are finding or growing a plentiful supply. But if that ever changes, 
America's ingenious farming know-how combined with abundant lakes and 
waterways will combine to make us not just the breadbasket but also 
the fishbasket of the world.
                                    <P>
What we're seeing is a rapid transition from depending on wild fish to 
raising our own which parallels civilization's movement from hunting 
and gathering to husbanding animals and raising crops. The very reason 
that fish farming is catching on so rapidly is that it is so much 
cheaper and more efficient than setting out in boats and hoping for 
good fortune. Less romantic perhaps, but them's the breaks.
                                               <P>
The problem with all the population control groups and individual 
gurus like Paul Ehrlich is that they first decided they were against 
population growth and have spent the entire time since then trying to 
find evidence to justify their position, rather than forming their 
position based on the evidence. The result has been a stream of 
nonsense that essentially began with Ehrlich's 1968 book The 
Population Bomb which told us that "the battle to feed humanity is 
over."
                                                        <P>
In fact, except for the occasional politically-inspired famine such as 
Ethiopia's, humanity is much better fed today than it was in 1968. 
Man's ingenuity in providing new food supplies has readily outpaced 
his growth in population growth.  Now, even as population growth is 
already slowing on its own, we're beginning a new era of genetically-
designed foods that will make even progress to date look anemic.
                                                                    <P>
 My advice to the population controllers:  If you don't like having 
more people around in  the same sense a lot of American just don't 
like eating fish, then simply say so. Quit concocting false evidence 
to scare everyone who doesn't share your taste.

As for the rest of us, just ask any mermaid you happen to see, "What's 
a big fib?" "The Population Action study."

<h2>
Media at Loss for Words Over AIDS Decline
   
    </h2>

<P>

                
Ya know, it's getting so you can't trust anyone these days.  A few 
weeks ago, I was enthralled by the hit movie "Fargo," in part because 
its producers claimed that the tale of murder and mayhem in a small 
Minnesota town was based on a true story.  Only the names were 
changed, we were told, out of respect to the dead.  But there were no 
dead.  The movie was virtually a complete fabrication. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Maybe the movie's producers took their cues from the way the national 
media handles the news concerning AIDS.  Unlike "Fargo," there have 
been lots of deaths with AIDS. But as the latest yearly data just 
released from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) show, the epidemic that so recently was tagged as spiraling out 
of control is now fizzling. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Overall, AIDS cases were down seven percent last year, from 79,897 to 
74,180. Great news, right?  Try "no news"--at least to most of the big 
boys in the media. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
All three major TV network newscasts ignored the CDC's annual report, 
as did all three of the nation's major newsmagazines and most of the 
nation's major newspapers. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Oh, sure, USA Today gave it a graphic comprising 69 words.  And the 
New York Times mentioned that new data existed, but only gave the 
numbers for New Jersey.  The Washington Post only gave it brief 
mention in an editorial. After all, we wouldn't want the nation's 
lawmakers to know that the disease they keep throwing more and more 
money at is on the decline, would we? 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Contrast this with the coverage the media gave the epidemic in 1994, 
when cases greatly increased, albeit as the result of a statistical 
artifact resulting from the CDC expanding the definition of what 
constitutes an AIDS case.  Back then the New York Times's Lawrence 
Altman devoted a thousand words to the story, with the scary title 
"AIDS Cases Increase Among Heterosexuals."  Actually they "increased" 
among ALL groups, but what the hey? 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And yes, both USA Today and the Washington Post wrote the story up two 
years ago, as did the Los Angeles Times and all the other big guys. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
This is actually the second year in a row that AIDS cases have fallen, 
but it means a lot more this year.  That's because last year the data 
were still reflecting the shakeout from the new case definition.  The 
explosion of cases reported in 1994 led to a dearth in 1995.  But this 
year the decline is clearly real. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Even those reporters who did deign to mention that the largest 
epidemic of the century was starting to implode nonetheless managed to 
put a PC slant on it.  Thus, Karen Hill's story for the Associated 
Press (AP) was sent out over the wires as "AIDS Rate Down Nationwide, 
But More Blacks, Women Infected."  The body of the story also 
indicated that there  is a "spread" of the disease among women. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In actuality, 123 FEWER adult or adolescent women were reported to 
have contracted AIDS in 1995 than the year before.  It's nice to know 
that even if your child never learns to add or subtract, he can always 
get a job with the nation's largest wire service. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
If AIDS really were spreading among women, it sure would be hard to 
explain how births to women infected with the AIDS virus dropped 
dramatically from 957 to 730.  Many states didn't have a single baby 
born with AIDS.   
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
How about that heterosexual "explosion" the media loves to talk about?  
Actually, there was a drop of 500 cases in that category.  Even AP 
didn't try to mess with that number; instead, like everybody else, 
they just ignored it. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
How about teenagers?  It wasn't long ago that the media were telling 
us that AIDS among teens would soon be more common than pimples.  But 
teen AIDS cases fell, too. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Indeed, in every way the AIDS epidemic has stubbornly refused to act 
like the media, the media's anointed "experts" and the government have 
said it would go.  It has steadfastly refused becoming a democratic 
disease, an "equal opportunity destroyer" as the nation's largest AIDS 
lobbying group once put it. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Instead, the disease is more and more one of the marginalized in our 
society.  Blacks are about 12 percent of the population, yet they now 
contribute as many victims to the epidemic as do whites.  Hispanics 
also are grossly over-represented.  Broken down by risk factor, the 
vast majority of cases continue to come from homosexual men and 
intravenous drug abusers. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
White heterosexuals, the "risk group" on which the media harp 
incessantly, made up two percent of all AIDS cases last year.   
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
None of this should be in the least surprising.  I predicted it nine 
years ago in my first science article.  I did so not by slaughtering a 
chicken and reading its entrails, but simply by consulting the 
publicly available data and interviewing the real experts. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The media and the government ignored these data and those experts, 
instead fabricating an epidemic of white, middle-class heterosexuals 
with false headlines, misleading statistics, and celebrity victims.  
This led to the wasting of hundreds of millions of dollars fighting 
non-existent fires while the real ones have raged on.

<h2> How the Media Reward Themselves for Dishonesty

When it comes to Gulf War Syndrome (GWS), the evidence keeps going in 
one direction and the media keep going in the other. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the most recent development, the Pentagon has just released its 
latest study.  It looked at almost 19,000 Gulf vets and found, once 
again, that aside from certain psychological problems there's no 
pattern of symptoms to suggest that "Gulf War Syndrome" means anything 
other than any sickness that happens to befall a Gulf vet. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

GWS is essentially a media creation.  Out of the 700,000 vets who 
served in the Gulf, a few began complaining of various but unrelated 
ailments.  Soon the media got ahold of it and pronounced this a 
mystery, as if out of 700,000 men and women after a period of a few 
years, none were supposed to be sick.  When soldiers read of this 
mystery "syndrome" they began assuming, in the way people do, that any 
illness they had was related to it.   At last count, their were over 
75 symptoms attributed to GWS, ranging from life-threatening ones like 
cancer and heart disease to lesser ones like weight loss and weight 
gain, graying hair, kidney stones, thick saliva, hot and cold flashes, 
increased urination, lightheadedness, sensitive teeth, hemorrhoids, 
and a "foot fungus that will not go away." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Most of the symptoms are often connected to psychosomatic illness, 
such as joint pain, memory loss, and headaches.  Others, like semen 
that burns the skin, are as unsubstantiated as Elvis sightings. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Every major study looking for a cause of GWS has found the same thing.  
There just ain't no such animal.  The first two of these came from the 
National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense, and both 
found that other than psychiatric ills induced by stress, Gulf vets 
have no more illness than one would expect.  These studies were 
criticized somewhat for their methodology by the  National Academy of 
Science's Institute of Medicine (IOM), and the media gaily repeated 
that criticism.  But in January the IOM itself concluded there was no 
such thing as GWS. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Nevertheless, the media continue to promote the story and to 
congratulate themselves for it.  Life magazine has just won the 1996 
John Bartlow Martin Award for Public Interest Magazine Journalism for 
its November cover story, "The Tiny Victims of Dessert Storm." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The article--which purported to discover a high rate of birth defects 
among children of Gulf War vets--was "a good, tough, moving look at a 
national tragedy," gushed contest judge Doug Balz, managing editor of 
the Chicago Tribune Sunday Magazine.  It worked "on both the heart and 
mind of the reader." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Again, with all those children born to 700,000 vets, you're going to 
have a certain number of problems.   But study after study has found 
no more problems than would be expected.  These include one from the  
Mississippi Department of Health of an alleged birth defect cluster, a 
larger study of 620 pregnancies at Robins Air Force Base, and a 
combined study of 6,392 pregnancies at several bases which found Gulf 
vets' wives' miscarriages at the same level as that population had 
before deployment to the Gulf.  It was also about half the civilian 
rate. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"I think it's unconscionable to frighten people out of reproducing 
unless you have some good data to support that contention," Dr. 
Russell Tarver, who led the Mississippi National Guard investigation, 
told me. "I think you're committing a crime against those veterans." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

That's what Life did.  It carefully ignored each of these studies.  
Instead it simply regaled its readers with touching anecdotes about 
children with birth defects whose parents had become convinced--by 
other stories like Life's--that being endowed with a perfect baby is a 
God-given right which was cruelly taken from them because of their 
service in the Gulf. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Why do the media continue to ignore the evidence in favor of personal 
testimonials from people they themselves have terrified? 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 "There's no question that the media tend to look at the negative side 
and the bad news more than the positive side and good news," Los 
Angeles Times news critic David Shaw told me.  "This is particularly 
true of medical problems and health issues because these are things 
about which the people worry the most. That's doubly true when 
children are involved. People tend to throw all skepticism out of the 
window." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Part of the problem, Shaw adds, is the "herd of independent minds" 
phenomenon.  Members of the press corps are loath to write anything 
that will make them seem odd.  "Reporters tend to be more likely to 
parrot the conventional wisdom," says Shaw.  "There's a premium to be 
paid for doing the story that goes against the grain."  And one to be 
gained for going with it, as the Life award shows. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But doesn't accuracy count?  Not usually. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"In the two years I was a judge at the Pulitzers I don't remember 
hearing anybody saying `Let's make phone calls'" to verify what's in a 
story, said Shaw.  I think the assumption is that if there were 
something wrong with the story the paper wouldn't be entering it." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Lately there's been a lot of hand-wringing from the media about why it 
seems the public hates them.  Why?  They reward dishonesty and 
incompetence with cover stories of major magazines.  Then they hand 
out awards for those stories.  Good people suffer as a result.  What's 
not to hate?  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<hr>
<h2>Jerry Garcia, RIP</h2><p>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><i><b>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
If I ever heard a song played by the Grateful Dead I wasn't aware of 
it. If I had been, I'd have pricked up my ears and listened real hard 
because I have a memory. It is of a young man who came to work at my 
shop. He had just graduated from Harvard, wanted to do some opinion 
journalism, and qualified for a summer internship that stretched into 
two or three years.<p>
It was toward the end of the decade of the Sixties that he drew me 
aside one day, after we had gone to press. He said that he had been to 
a concert by the Grateful Dead and that it was a wonderful experience, 
and that he would go again whenever the group was in reach, and he 
invited me to join him at one of the concerts, which I wish I had 
done. <p>
I have to suppose that, like so many others, I would have survived the 
experience without such harm as finally came to Jerry Garcia and, 25 
years before Garcia, to our young intern. He did his work, but with 
progressive listlessness. His editorial paragraphs had never been 
razor sharp but they had been trenchant and readable, and now they 
were murky.<p>
Things got worse, and now came the trappings, which were conventional. 
It began with sandals, then went in the usual direction, though I 
don't remember that he ran a ring through his ear. When an anniversary 
issue was planned for the magazine he suddenly demanded that his 
"generation" be represented, so I told him to go ahead and write what 
he thought would be a useful essay.<p>
I don't remember seeing it myself, but I was told not that it was 
unsuitable, or unfinished, or unprofessional, but that its meaning was 
impenetrable. At about that time an associate ten years older reported 
his (informed) opinion that our intern was going off the deep end. At 
a collegial staff lunch he once excused himself so abruptly as to 
provoke the melancholy conclusion that he had needed a quick jolt of 
whatever drug he was taking. One day he announced that he would be 
married, and soon brought in an addled flower child dressed as he 
dressed. One weekend they just faded away. A few years later we 
received formal invitations to a second marriage, to a South American. 
He went with his new bride to her country and taught English. In due 
course he sent us an article submission. It was potentially 
publishable but needed work, and the managing editor sent it back to 
him with recommended changes. We did not hear from him again, except 
after another interval of five years or so, when we learned he had 
married yet again, this time to a native, and gone off to live in the 
hills. Question before the house: Is Jerry Garcia in some way 
responsible for this?<p>
The issue of Newsweek that put Garcia on the cover quoted in huge type 
the words of a 21-year-old college student. "It's a free life when 
you're at a show. It's all about happiness. I'd just take my watch off 
and want time to stop." It isn't easy to rail against anyone who 
brings happiness, and one has to assume that many, perhaps the 
majority, of those who heard "shows" by the Grateful Dead achieved 
their highs without the use of intoxicants. But something unusual 
accounted for the young Americans, pictures of them reproduced in the 
days just gone by, exhibiting Dionysiac pleasure in their role as 
Deadheads. Exuberance finds its forms throughout the world and 
concentrates its energies on the young. But is the joy unconfined? 
Ought it to be?<p>
Jerry Garcia died only a week after leaving the Betty Ford Center. He 
is quoted as having said two years ago that, really, he needed to do 
something to restore his health, otherwise he would be dead, like "two 
years from now." He went on schedule, and is said to have died with a 
smile on his face, no doubt because he was a happy man but also 
because he made so many others happy. But he also killed, if that's 
the right word for such as our intern, a lot of people. And although 
he had a pulsating forum world wide for thirty years and knew from his 
own experience what his habits were doing to him, he never went public 
on it, not really. One has to suppose, sadly, that in his case, going 
public on his problem, extending a truly firm handshake to his 
legions, would have required the dramatic gesture of retiring from the 
stage. If he had done so, it would not have been wounding to those of 
us who were never exposed to Jerry Garcia's special intoxicant, but, 
if he had done so, how many would have had better prospects for 
health, love, and longer lives?<p>

Study Finds Pesticides Not the Problem, Eating Habits Is

<P>
At least once a year, it seems, Americans are hit by a carpet bomb 
attack orchestrated by environmental groups and the media.  The theme: 
Our food supply is killing us because of pesticides used by greedy 
corporations and chemical companies.  Anyone who denies it is accused 
of being a dupe of industry.  But now a counter-attack has been 
launched by the highly influential and independent National Research 
Council, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Far from posing the clear and present danger that the environmental 
groups say they do, the NRC says that the synthetic chemicals that 
prove carcinogenic in large-dose rodent testing are greatly 
outnumbered by natural chemicals which do the same thing. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The good news is that according to the report, neither seems to pose 
much risk. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"While some chemicals in the diet do have the ability to cause cancer, 
they appear to be a threat only when they are present in foods that 
form an unusually large part of the diet," said Ronald Estabrook, 
chairman of the NRC committee.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What really counts, the report says, is not those things we 
unknowingly take into our bodies in minuscule quantities, but rather 
foods that we intentionally ingest in  massive doses: fats, calories, 
and alcohol. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While the report specifically looked at cancer, it certainly bears 
noting that the worst thing about these ingredients is their ability 
to induce death not from cancer but from obesity, heart disease, and 
liver damage.  Further, another dietary component, fiber, has been 
strongly tied to a reduced incidence of cancer and heart disease. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In other words, if you're really worried about cancer or your health 
in general, these are the things to concentrate on.  It means, 
essentially, doing what your mom told you to do: eat more fruits and 
vegetables and consume anything else in moderation. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yet only one in five American children eat five or more servings of 
fruits and vegetables a day, the government's dietary recommendation. 
We get a third of the fiber we're supposed to.  At the same time, 
Americans are taking in more calories than ever and have made 
themselves the fattest western nation on earth, causing an estimated 
300,000 premature deaths each year. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Environmental groups have effectively scared many Americans away from 
fresh produce.  The Alar campaign in 1989 remains the most prominent.  
Orchestrated by the Natural Resources Defense Council, it had 60 
Minutes declaring the apple growth regulator Alar, "The most potent 
cancer-causing agent in our food supply."  Actress Meryl Streep 
appeared before Congress to blubber and demand, speaking of course on 
behalf of all mothers, that chemicals like Alar be yanked.  It was. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yet the Alar campaign was only one of many environmentalist-media 
joint efforts. "Do I Dare to Eat a Strawberry?" ran the title of a New 
York Times article last fall, promoting a paper by the Environmental 
Working Group. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These scares have doubtless impacted buying habits but have had even 
greater impact on regulatory agencies--especially the EPA, which feels 
a need to react to each new horror story. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"I'm very concerned about diets," says Berkeley biologist Bruce Ames, 
the scientist whose research into natural carcinogens inspired the NRC 
report. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 "If you don't get enough vitamin C," he told me, "it's like stepping 
unprotected in front of an X-ray machine. And we're spending no money 
trying to get the poor to eat better diets and we're taking on average 
of  $2,000 from each family for EPA regulations.  I think we just have 
our priorities completely out of whack." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
That goes for both personal priorities and national ones. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
On a personal level, we contentedly stuff our faces with Ho-Hos, 
Twinkies, and Big Macs. And while getting significantly more fiber is 
as easy as buying whole wheat bread instead of white, Americans 
overwhelmingly choose white bread, safe in the belief that the 
government is regulating away any and all types of cancer. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Nationally, it's time for the feds to end what could be called the rat 
race--the assumption that says that anytime a synthetic chemical in a 
huge dose (typically several hundred thousand times what a human would 
take in) promotes cancer in a laboratory rodent, we must race to 
regulate or ban it. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's also time to get rid of the notion (common among 
environmentalists) that whatever nature makes is harmless while 
anything developed in a lab is harmful. As the NRC report--and a mass 
of other evidence--shows, a carcinogen is a carcinogen.  If it's 
present in significant enough amounts to invite regulation, then the 
regulations should apply whether the source was Ma Nature or Dow 
Chemical. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"This suggests we need to look at both natural and synthetic 
pesticides, compare them, and come up with better tests," says Fran 
Smith, president of the Washington-based Consumer Alert. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Indeed, the committee said more naturally occurring chemicals should 
be individually tested for their ability to cause cancer, starting 
with those that are found in the highest concentrations in commonly 
consumed foods.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But don't count the environmentalist groups out yet.  Over the last 
few years, as their case against synthetic chemicals causing cancer 
has grown weaker and weaker, they've started blaming them for other 
problems.  These include immune dysfunction and declining sperm 
counts.  If it's true that you just can't keep a good man down, that 
goes double for a bad environmentalist.

<i>NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 10</i>

<hr>

<h2>What Made Colin Run?</h2><br>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>

The grave dignity of Colin Powell's announcement had the effect of 
causing dismayed observers to thrash out at those who had opposed his 
candidacy. This is a psychological phenomenon: Mom has an accident 
coming home from work and reproaches abound -- Why did Dad let her go 
on working so late in life? Why didn't Sonny, who after all is a car 
salesman, force Mom to get a better, stronger car? To say nothing of 
Mom's stupid eye doctor, who should have known Mom's glasses needed 
strengthening.
<p>
It happens even to wise and street-smart chappies, e.g., William 
Safire of the New York Times. He let himself go twice in his Powell 
column, once directly, once obliquely. He set up his target by 
carefully orienting his argument as testimony to General Powell's 
courage, a technique he knows as paralepsis, which is the affirmation 
of the point you wish to make by denying it ("I come to bury Caesar, 
not to praise him"); only Safire did it the other way around. 
"Certainly Powell was not chased off the field by the performance last 
week before the National Press Club of the Hard-Right Follies; the 
finger-wagging by that old abortion-and-school-prayer set was manna 
from Heaven for a moderate Republican's nomination campaign." Later in 
the same column, Mr. Safire made reference to "Arlen Specter, the pro-
choice candidate, with nobody on his side on that issue except the 
majority of Republican voters."
<p>
The Miami Herald weighed in weightily. "True conservatives want frugal 
government, but also prudent investments in children, concern for the 
needy, and a desire to widen economic opportunity, not just pile 
benefits onto the wealthy. General Powell says that 'the party of 
Lincoln' (a phrase borrowed from Kemp) [my impression was that the 
phrase was first used by Andrew Johnson] can balance these interests 
best, and that's why he chose to be a Republican. But he recognizes 
that he will have to fight -- hard -- to restore those values to a 
party lately hijacked by the Christian Coalition and its acolytes." 
And then Maureen Dowd, also of the New York Times, contributed the 
news that General Powell "had exposed the Christian Right as a 
panicked sectarian phenomenon."
<p>
What are we to make of all this? The Christian Right is indeed 
sectarian, which is why it isn't the Muslim Right, or the Jewish 
Right, however much the three faiths may have in common. And 
"panicked" is probably a defensible term to describe a movement deeply 
concerned by a rise of 400 per cent in serious crimes during the past 
generation and 300 per cent in illegitimate births. The word 
"panicked" is subjectively used, of course. Only three days ago, one 
newspaper report informed us that President Clinton was "panicked" at 
the prospect of General Powell's running. We have to assume that a 
metaphor was intended, given that nobody caught Bill Clinton about to 
throw himself out the window.
<p>
But the reference by Bill Safire is confusing, the business about 
"that old abortion-and-school-prayer set." Either he is saying that 
there should be term limits on concern over abortion and school 
prayer, or else he is saying that the questions have been debated and 
are behind us. It isn't that Mr. Safire is indisposed to stay in a 
battle for as long as it takes. He was a doughty soldier during the 
Cold War, which began many years before Roe v. Wade, but Safire was in 
there right up until the Berlin Wall came down, God bless him, and if 
it takes a hundred years to guarantee the safety of Israel, we cannot 
reasonably doubt that Bill Safire's great-grandchildren will be 
sounding the Zionist bell, and more power to them. If he is saying 
that, on the contrary, people ought to give up on school prayer, there 
are those who respectfully disagree, among them -- who knows? -- God!, 
who is contingently capable of influencing elections. And a call to 
acknowledge human life in the fetus isn't a question of the kind one 
ought to get bored about unless research absolutely establishes that, 
all the time, a fetus was really no different from a tomato.
<p>
The right-wing gentlemen who met last week to serve notice on General 
Powell that he had made references disquieting to them, honorable 
representatives of conservative positions within the GOP, spoke 
respectably on the issues to which they have devoted themselves for 
many years. They didn't raise a single question about General Powell 
that hadn't been raised, that same week, by George Will, but Mr. 
Safire and Miss Dowd and the Miami Herald have an instinctive sense -- 
maybe it was sharpened by reading General Powell's autobiography? -- 
who to pick on when Mom has an accident on the highway, and who to let 
alone.<p>

<title>Where Does Fuhrman Take Us?</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<i>New York, August 25, 1995</i>
<hr>
<h2>Where Does Fuhrman take Us?</h2><p>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html">
<b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</b></i></a>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
One account analyzes the Mark Fuhrman situation as follows: If the 
exposure of the tapes comes in as the closing episode in the trial, 
the probability is high that the disgust and loathing for Detective 
Fuhrman (richly deserved) will provoke in the jury a sentiment 
extraneous to the question, Did O. J. kill his former wife and her 
companion? Instead, the analysis goes on, the jurors will ask 
themselves, How can we express our disgust? Well -- the analyst 
concludes -- by voting, Not Guilty.<p>
The prosecution will of course make an earnest, desperate attempt to 
situate the tapes in context. Marcia Clark will argue that Houdini 
himself could not have contrived to arrange the evidence against O. J. 
with which the prosecution has made its case. The chief of police in 
Los Angeles, Mr. Willie Williams, told a press conference that "it is 
inconceivable to believe that for this one murder 10, 20, 30, or 40 
people got together to plot against Mr. Simpson." Only Oliver Stone 
could stitch together a plot to do in O. J. that originated at two in 
the morning and matured with a bloody glove at his residence, and 
bloodstains that identified O. J., his ex-wife, and Mr. Goldman here 
and there along the route from the scene of the crime back to 
Simpson's residence.<p>
But the thinking at the moment is that the jury will waive matters 
that have dulled in memories of men and women who must be feeling as 
though they had been sentenced to perpetual isolation during a 
seemingly endless trial. Human sensibilities are as they are, and the 
jurors are not likely to blame the defense for their incarceration. 
The enemy will be the Establishment: the judge who ordained their 
isolation, the prosecution that droned on endlessly, and, above all, 
the Los Angeles Police Department, which retained in its ranks someone 
who -- if the tapes are to be believed -- lives in fury against the 
existence of blacks, women, homosexuals, and civil rights. <p>
It is mystifying what exactly were the objectives of Mr. Fuhrman in 
his recorded conversations with Laura Hart McKinny, the scholar at the 
North Carolina School of Arts, starting in 1985. He reported to her 
(according to one passage in the tapes) how on one occasion he and 
fellow officers handled four suspects. "We basically tortured them. We 
broke 'em. Their faces were just mush. They had pictures of the walls 
with blood all the way to the ceiling and finger marks of [them] 
trying to crawl out of the room." A messy business, handling suspects 
in that way. It required Mr. Fuhrman and his fellow law enforcers to 
clean themselves up with a garden hose. <p>
Now the Fuhrman narrative gives one pause. It does not surprise that 
here and there one comes upon sadists, whether in Los Angeles or in 
Gulag. The viewers of the Rodney King beating tend to reason, Why 
should we be surprised? Such evidently is the way the police in Los 
Angeles, and perhaps elsewhere, routinely act. But the Rodney King 
story is complicated. Extensive investigations revealed that there was 
a genuine, spastic concern that King might be armed, might have 
intended his own impetuous defense using a weapon. But in the Fuhrman 
telling of the treatment of four suspects there would seem to be 
nothing of that. It was clinical sadism. <p>
Already a quiet investigation by the Los Angeles Police has begun, 
designed, no doubt, to track the record of men handled over the years 
by Detective Fuhrman. Why did they not complain of their treatment by 
him? And if there was a record of Fuhrman engaged in such activity, 
why was he retained in the force? How will he be handled by the law? 
As a perjurer? He swore under oath that he had not used the term 
"nigger" when manifestly he had done so, using the word not in the 
detached tones of a storyteller, but with invidious gusto. "You're 
talking sh--. You sound like a nigger."<p>
It is endlessly fascinating. Fuhrman the cool bigot. O. J., who earned 
the confidence of his private investigator because of the coolness of 
his behavior in Chicago in the hours immediately after the killing. 
How could somebody so casual in his conduct during those hours before 
being told of his ex-wife's murder be guilty? But of course such 
reasoning, from the particular to the general, would justify 
confidence that the Fuhrman observed on the witness stand could not be 
the same Fuhrman who spoke into those tapes. <p>
The jury's responsibility in this case is awesome, extending far 
beyond the question of O. J.'s guilt or innocence. It touches on the 
recognition of the awful baseness of which human beings -- Americans -
- are capable. <p>

<title>NY Times Blows Hot Air Over Global Warming</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<hr><center><h2>NEW YORK TIMES BLOWS <br>HOT AIR OVER GLOBAL WARMING </h2>By Michael Fumento 
</center><hr><p> 

If you're like me, about twice a month you get a fat yellow envelope 
from this guy named  Ed McMahon, saying "YOU, JOHN DOE could already 
be the winner" of 9 million dollars or some such. If you're like me 
you toss the envelope away, realizing that here the difference between 
"could" and "are" is vast and virtually insurmountable.<p>

So, it is too, in the world of environmental doomsaying, which leads 
us to the subject of the New York Times front-page article by William 
K. Stevens: "Scientists Say Earth's Warming Could Set Off  Wide 
Disruptions." In that same edition a Times editorial decried possible 
congressional cuts in funding for global warming research.<p>

This article was intended as the knock-out blow, with the setup left 
jab having come a week earlier in the form of another Steven's front-
page article "Experts Confirm Human Role in Global Warming."  There 
Stevens began with a reference to a draft report by the U.N. 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). "In an important 
shift of scientific judgment," he wrote, "experts advising the world's 
governments on climate change are saying for the first time that human 
activity is a likely cause of the warming of the global atmosphere."<p>

Actually, scientists have long acknowledged that human activity, 
through release of "greenhouse" gases that trap heat, would cause some 
warming. As Robert Balling Jr., Director of the Office of Climatology 
at Arizona State University says, "The issue all along has been how 
much warming and whether it would be countered by other cooling 
mechanisms."<p>

Any environmentalist will gladly tell you the interaction of various 
forces on the globe can be terribly complicated. Probably the main 
complication here has been the effect that the heat build-up would 
have on water vapor, which in turn could cause a cooling effect.<p>

Such complications have spawned a huge number of models estimating 
just how much total heat increase the globe would experience, ranging 
from "utterly insignificant" to the doomsayers' "extra crispy."<p>

The real news of the IPCC draft report, according to report  reviewer 
and University of Virginia climatologist Dr. Patrick Michaels, is that 
the doomsayers' model is kaput.<p>

"What Stevens completely missed is that the mid-point of the model 
which they are now touting shows far less warming than the model upon 
which they based the 1992 Rio de Janeiro agreement," he told me.<p>

That treaty committed the nations of the earth in principle to spend 
tens of billions of dollars to reduce greenhouse emissions.<p>

Yet Michaels believes that this latest warming projection could still 
be far too high while another respected researcher, Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology climatologist and IPCC report reviewer Richard 
Lindzen, believes that warming will probably always be at a level 
difficult or impossible to detect above normal yearly fluctuations.<p>

Lindzen says newer projections show less and less warming than 
previous ones because they are being tweaked into doing so. The 
reason?  Real-life measurements are showing only slight warming. 
According to NASA scientist Roy Spenser, 17 years of satellite data 
show a rate of warming of about 7/100 of a degree per decade, or a 
rise of about 7/10 of a degree by the year 2100.<p>

That's "considerably less warming than climate models predict," he 
told me.<p>

Which leads us to part two of Stevens' attack, the potential 
catastrophe which is as likely as Ed McMahon showing up at your door 
with a check.<p>

It's not only that warming is far less than what was predicted. Less 
warming means fewer effects and less dire ones. More than this it 
seems increasingly clear that this warming is not a generalized one. 
Most of the warming it appears will be at night, when the temperatures 
are coldest.  Most will also be during the winter and in the frigid 
far north at that.<p>

"The season to season extremes are decreasing," says Michaels.<p>

Global warming-induced melting of the polar ice caps was the basis for 
Kevin Costner's embarrassing movie "Waterworld," in which virtually 
the entire earth is submerged. Terrified island nations are the 
strongest supporters of costly international sanctions against 
greenhouse gas restrictions.<p>

But, notes Michaels, if anything significant global warming could be 
expected to add to the polar caps by increasing precipitation above 
the poles. "Waterworld" flops again.<p>

Speaking of island nations, how about those predictions of vast 
numbers of  "super" hurricanes?  The Environmental Defense Fund's 
Michael Oppenheimer, an important source for Stevens, has predicted 
one of these as early as 1997,  killing 22,000 Floridians.<p>

But according to a paper by eight prominent researchers in the 
November 1994 Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 
Floridians can rest easy. They wrote, "year to year variations" in 
weather "are so great that they must effectively  swamp' any quite 
modest effect" of  global warming on hurricane frequency.<p>

It's true that the IPCC draft report on which Stevens based his dire 
story does mention the possibility of severe climate problems, but as 
Michael MacCraken, who is coordinating the U.S. governmental review of 
the IPCC report, explained to me, that's because it was just a first 
draft and the authors were obligated to mention any and all possible 
weather permutations, if only for later drafts to shoot them down.<p>

Tomorrow the earth COULD be invaded by flying saucers with tall aliens 
carrying cookbooks entitled To Serve Man. But idle speculations are 
best left for things like the O.J. Simpson trial, not matters of world 
import and the front page of  the New York Times. <p>

<i>1/17/96</i><hr><h2>Catch Drunks, Don't Harass Drivers</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><i>Michael Fumento</i> </a>
</center><hr>
<P> 
On Christmas Eve, 1966, my godfather smashed his car into a tree and 
killed himself.  He was drunk. The best that could be said of his 
sorry exit from this earth was that unlike so many other drunk 
drivers, he didn't take anybody with him.
<P>
You might think this would make me very concerned with drunk driving 
laws and you'd be right. But you'd be wrong if you think it has made 
me an advocate of the continuing trend to reduce allowable levels of 
drivers' blood alcohol content (BAC) from 0.1 percent to 0.08 percent.
<P>
It's not that I wouldn't be in good company.  Mothers Against Drunk 
Driving (MADD) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
(NHTSA) have lobbied vigorously for lowering the limit to .08, while 
the American Medical Association wants it lowered to 0.05 and the 
Department of Health and Human Services wants it knocked down even 
lower to 0.04. But the evidence these good folks cite to support their 
new drinking laws just doesn't wash.
<P>
True, the number of what the NHTSA calls "alcohol-related deaths" has 
shown a steady and significant decline since the early 1980s. During 
that time, a number of states--now totaling 13--have screwed down the 
legal BAC limit from 0.1 to 0.08.
<P>
But does this mean there's a connection? The key word is "deaths." In 
fact, traffic deaths in general have been going down for years as a 
result of safer cars and higher seat belt usage rates. So it only 
makes sense that those from any given cause, including alcohol, would 
be declining.
<P>
A better measure is alcohol-related collisions.  This number has gone 
down just a bit, and it's not at all clear it has to do with those few 
states lowering their BAC limits.
<P>
It's not that drivers don't show signs of impairment at levels below a 
BAC of 0.1.  Indeed, research has shown impairment at levels of 0.04 
or even lower. I drink so little alcohol myself that I could probably 
be impaired driving by a brewery and smelling the smoke stack exhaust.
<P>
Rather, the issue is should we put out a net so wide and so tightly-
woven as to sweep up huge numbers of people or should we concentrate 
on those most likely to create carnage on the streets?
<P>
The net analogy is not a bad one. Even advocates of a 0.08 BAC limit 
admit that drivers below the level of .1 rarely drive erratically, 
hence the only way to catch them will be putting up more police 
roadblocks and doing more random breath testing.  And what will we get 
for these pesky little violations of drivers' privacy?
<P>
Dr. H. Laurence Ross, a professor at the University of New Mexico and 
author most recently of Confronting Drunk Driving, estimates a 
potential increase of 60 percent of DWI offenders (legally-speaking) 
under 0.08 with the possibility of no decrease in fatalities. The 
reason is that the potential of alcohol to impair drivers and cause 
accidents is directly proportionate to the amount consumed.
<P>
According to a recently released study from the Harvard Injury Control 
Center, "Among all male drinking drivers who were killed, 67 percent 
had BACs of 0.15 or above.  Among young adult male drivers (ages 20-
34), 41 percent had BACs of at least 0.20, or twice the legal limit in 
most states."
<P>
Lower BAC advocates note that about 3,000 fatalities each year are 
caused by drivers with BACs of less than 0.1.  But this is misleading. 
The vast majority of fatalities are caused by people with no 
measurable alcohol in their systems at all, yet they still managed to 
kill someone.  For all we know, the drivers who killed those 3,000 
people would have done so just as readily without the aid of liquor. 
<P>
Ironically, one opponent of .08 BAC laws is MADD founder Candy 
Lightner.  In 1992 she wrote, "If we really want to save lives, let's 
go after the most dangerous drivers on the road.  Putting our trust in 
new laws and regulations that attack only the tip of the iceberg will 
not make our highways safer."
<P>
Lightner has been branded a traitor by MADD, especially since two 
years after writing those words she became a lobbyist for the liquor 
industry. Nevertheless knows whereof she speaks.  The man who ran down 
her own 13-year-old daughter in 1980 has been arrested several times 
for drunken driving, each time with a BAC of 0.2 or higher.  And each 
time he gets out of jail and goes at it again.
<P>
Lightner argues that police ought to concentrate their resources on 
arresting drunk drivers, not just drivers who happen to have been 
drinking. When serious offenders are arrested they need to be treated 
seriously, with license revocations and other penalties that increase 
steadily as their number of offenses increases. 
<P>
But to arrest drunk drivers you need police, and suddenly declaring 60 
percent more Americans as criminally inebriated will stretch resources 
thinner than ever.  "Adoption of 0.08 percent BAC has not to date been 
accompanied by any comparable new investments in police resources," 
notes Dr. Ross in a recent issue of Health Drinking magazine, "thus 
diluting an already inadequate control system.  The effect may well be 
to reduce the chances of any impaired drivers being arrested."
<P>
That's something to think about the next time a weaving automobile 
shoots past you and you wonder how come there's never a cop around 
when you need one.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Big labor is on the move this summer.  On Saturday, June 1, the <a href="http://www.aflcio.org">AFL-CIO</a> is kicking off 
their <a href="http://www.aflcio.org/usummer">"Union Summer"</a> campaign.  The program involves young workers and college students who will organize union campaigns and direct liberal political efforts.  To help workers find their "voice" against "todays profit-crazed corporations," Union Summer 
participants will work in locations around the country to raise support for their cause.</p>  

<p>This activist program represents the labor unions' latest efforts in attacking corporate 
America and feeding misinformation to honest, hard-working Americans.  In the past few 
weeks, the labor unions rolled out an aggressive ad campaign which supported an 
increase in the minimum wage.  The campaign was directed toward House Republicans in 
districts with high union membership.  With the House passage of the minimum wage a 
few weeks ago, these attack ads had a direct impact on the outcome.</p>  

<p>In her article entitled, <a href="http://www.townhall.com/townhall/columnists/schlafly/schl030796.html">"Looking Out for Union Politicking in Congressional Campaigns,"</a> Phyllis Schlafly, president of Eagle Forum, has followed the union tactics and how the AFL-CIO plans to spend $35 million on an ad campaign "to defeat 75 Republican Congressmen in the 1996 November elections."  This amount of money spent on advertising is seven times more than is regularly spent in federal elections.  An <a href="http://www.townhall.com/townhall/columnists/duplantier/dupl032596.html">F.R. Duplantier column</a> provides further insights into the unions heavy investment in ad campaigns for the upcoming elections.</p>     

<p>The good news is that some television stations across the country have either refused to 
air or eventually pulled the advertisements from their rotation, according to the National 
Republican Congressional Committee.  In one instance, on May 25, the Evansville 
Courier reported how the WEVV-44 television station canceled AFL-CIO commercials 
which criticized US Rep. John Hostettler because the ads were false, accusing the 
Congressman "of cutting Medicare and student loans."  Skip Simms, WEVV-44 general 
manager, said, "We felt the statement in the ad was not true, therefore we pulled it.  The 
information the AFL-CIO provided us to support the statement was pretty weak."  Other 
freshman Republican Congressmen who have been on the unions "hit list" include 
Edward Whitfield (KY), Todd Tiahrt (KS), James Longley Jr.(ME), Jon Christensen (NE), and 
Randy Tate (WA).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.townhall.com/sbsc/">The Small Business Survival Committee</a> (SBSC) has written extensively on other tactics and strategies of the labor unions (i.e. Republican attack ads, mismanagement of union 
dues).  The May 23 issue of SBSCs <a href="http://www.townhall.com/sbsc/laborwatch/lw-14.html">Labor Watch</a> covers how the National Education Association (NEA) and the American Federation of Teachers just finished their strategy session, setting a liberal legislative agenda for the 96 elections.  According to Labor Watch, the NEAs tax-and-spend policies would "increase the size of government by nearly 40%; . . . most of the issues on their list have little or nothing to do with education."</p>  

<p>According to <a href="http://www.townhall.com/abb/">Americans for a Balanced Budget</a> (ABB), AFL-CIOs president, John Sweeney, fails to represent his rank-and-file members in the union.  In a <a href="http://www.townhall.com/abb/pr/043096.html">poll Frank Luntz 
conducted for ABB</a>, union members overwhelmingly were in favor of Medical Savings Accounts, a balanced budget, and tax cuts.  Sweeneys blatant disregard for the views of the rank-and-file members illustrates his "leftward views and desire to return the Congress back to Democrat control."<p/>

<p>Whats alarming about Union Summer is that the AFL-CIO is now getting young people involved in their misinformation campaign.  According to AFL-CIO president Sweeney, he will use 1,000 young workers and college students to build the new grassroots campaign by having them "planning, phone calling, door knocking, organizing, and demonstrating."  <a href="http://www.townhall.com/sbsc/laborwatch/lw-11.html">Labor Watch</a> reports their movement will focus on "minimum wage fights at the state and local level, and agitating against the California Civil Rights Institute."  The students involved will work three weeks at a time, receiving "training, free housing, and a stipend of $210 a week."</p>

<h2>Nightmare Time</h2>
<p>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></a>
<hr></center>
<p>
The sudden thrust by the Croatians at the expense of neighboring Serbs tells us not very much that there is armed life in the area and that finally something stoexcept pped what was appearing to be a Blitzkrieg by Bosnian Serbs. Their objective has been, for four years, Sarajevo.  Collateral triumphs have been the discrediting of the United Nations, NATO, and U.S. foreign policy.
<p>
The break in America from the isolation of yesteryear was the result of the reduction from thirty days to thirty minutes of the traversability of the space that had shielded America from Europe for four centuries. The principled arguments -- revisionist but nonetheless convincing -- against our entry into the First World War were decreasingly safe when used to oppose our entry into the Second 
World War. It is of course a hackneyed irony to remark that Sarajevo triggered the First World War and is now a point of conflagration that could trigger, if not a world war, a collapse of the scaffolding we 
hoped to build in the postwar years. 
<p>
The primary cause of disillusion with world-mindedness after the Second World War was the diplomatic defeats we suffered in Europe and then in Asia. Having joined the Allies in a mission initiated to restore sovereignty to Poland, we were maneuvered into the totalitarian desolation of much of Europe under Stalin. At the other end of the world, having triumphed over imperialist Japan we stood by helpless against the Communization of China under Mao Tse-tung. To say the least, this damaged the sensibilities of those Americans who dreamed of making the world safe for democracy. But a further and protracted jolt was the formation of the United Nations. Not that the idea of an international body was wrong, but that the UN became almost overnight the diplomatic ganglion of hypocrisy. There the Soviet Union dominated the votes of the Third World. After jubilation over the retreat of British imperialism in India, Americans stood shocked and aghast when Pandit Nehru refused to condemn the Soviet tanks that gunned down students in Budapest who sought a few scraps of liberty. 
The United Nations, in short, didn't work, and indeed sheltered the most impudent rhetorical hypocrisies in diplomatic history. 
<p>
After the Nuremberg trials the civilized world seemed to be united on at least one proposition, namely that genocide would not again be tolerated. Well, it was tolerated. When it happened in Africa we 
managed discreet sighs and, in the closet, whispered that civilization had yet to reach certain parts of the world. But then with the end of Communism a refreshment of international idealism temporarily took 
over. The UN, for one thing, would no longer serve as an echo chamber for Soviet lies and hypocrisy. Then along came Yugoslavia, RIP.
<p>
There to the north, northeast, and west loomed the mighty power of Russia, Germany, France, and England. Diplomatic efforts to arrest ethnic cleansing crystallize as games concocted to engage the 
attention of students at war colleges. In the background geographically, in the foreground geopolitically, was the United States. On the one hand it was clearly the burden of Europe to handle 
the mess in Yugoslavia. On the other hand, we were the undisputed superpower, and it turned out that we could not breathe the requisite concern into our NATO allies. And so, month after month, year after 
year, nothing is done except that people kill each other and latent hostilities are stimulated. There is the Serb affinity for Russians and vice versa, the Western European historical affinity for Croatia. 
The Muslim world correctly questions whether there is any reliable concern in Europe for aggressions at its expense. The Greeks watch nervously at movement in the other Macedonia, and the Turks, however frequently they are reminded of their own historical excesses, let it be known that they are brothers of the Bosnians being killed, tortured, raped.
<p>
In New Jersey if year after year a county can't manage its own schools, Trenton takes the schools over. The metaphor is easily resisted: How exactly does NATO take over Belgrade? But that is the 
wrong approach in a century in which the question, How do we split an atom? was answered: We shall proceed to do so. 
<p>
The NATO enterprise is discredited. The Europeans are mired in their spiritual trough, and the feeling in America is, more and more: Two hot wars and one cold war are enough for one century. You figure it 
out.  Unhappily, history won't stand by to permit us our alienation. The reason we are entangled in Europe -- and in the Pacific -- is that we can't escape the consequences of  what happens there.

<i>1/25/96</i>
<P>
<h2>GM's Electric Turkey </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><i>Michael Fumento</i> </a>
<P>
Imagine a car with a third the cruising range of the cheapest one on 
the market.  Imagine that while the cheapest car takes about three 
minutes to refuel this one takes three to 15 hours, depending on the 
equipment you buy to refuel it.  Imagine that the car will only be 
sold in a few markets in the southwest because it's useless in cold 
temperatures.  Now, if your imagination really stretches, imagine that 
this joke of an automobile costs about $35,000 or four times what the 
cheapest car goes for.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;But this is no imaginary car. It's General Motors' much-celebrated EV1 
electric car, the product of many years of development and one 
extremely large dose of environmental nonsense.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;Resembling a turtle with angular lines, GM's electric Edsel isn't the 
technological marvel it's advertised to be. Indeed, it's all too 
similar to the electric cars that competed with and lost to piston 
engine-powered cars almost 100 years ago.  Moreoever, piston 
technology has improved steadily since then.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;An economy car equipped with such an engine can be propelled an 
amazing 50 miles with a mere gallon of gasoline that weighs only eight 
pounds and costs less than bottled water.  The EV1, in contrast, uses 
low-tech lead acid batteries that in the best of weather propel the 
car only 90 miles with 1175 pounds of batteries, almost half the 
weight of the car itself.  Other types of batteries such as nickel-
metal hydride, nickel cadmium, zinc-air, and lithium would give a much 
longer charge but at even greater expense.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;The lead-acid batteries are not only heavy but huge.  The EV1 has only 
two seats, not because it pretends to be a sports car but rather 
because batteries take up what would be the back seat. Lead-acid 
batteries also last only two to three years and are an environmental 
mess to dispose of in a land fill. 
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;Not all the criticisms of  electric cars are deserved--just most of 
them.  For example, some on the extreme fringe of the environmental 
movement claim that they shouldn't be labeled zero emission vehicles 
because the power plants that supply the electricity emit pollution 
when they burn coal or oil.  True, but the emissions which electric 
cars produce are generally far outside the city where pollution is a 
problem.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;It's too bad some of the environmental nuts don't understand this, 
because essentially, GM has built a car that only a rich tofu-eating 
environmental looney could be interested in--like, say, actor/activist 
Ed Begley Jr.  Problem is, he already has one.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;That's a huge chunk of the electric car market that's already got one 
in the garage.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;But it's not really GM that built the EV1; rather it's the bureaucrats 
at the California Air Resources Board (CARB) who did.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;In a fit of  both arrogance and technological ignorance, CARB mandated 
back in 1990 that by 1998, two percent of all new cars sold in 
California would have to be zero-emission ones, thus sending the car 
companies scrambling to develop electric vehicles. Ironically, just 
two weeks before the EV1 was announced, CARB backed down  and pushed 
the mandate off into the 21st Century.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;Why GM decided to market the car anyway is anyone's guess, though 
rumors fly (which a GM spokesman denied to me) that the introduction 
was a quid pro quo to get CARB to drop the mandate.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;In addition to ignoring technological reality, the CARB mandate also 
ignored how much cleaner cars have already gotten.  Cars built these 
days put out only about four percent of the exhaust of cars produced 
in 1970. That's why the air above every American city has gotten so 
much cleaner since then.  The reason these cars sometimes put out 
large amounts of  pollution is because like anything mechanical, they 
can break and must be repaired.  Also, their owners can tamper with them to improve mileage at the expense of high emissions.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;What's needed is a device that can detect defective or tampered-with 
exhaust systems.  It happens that Dr. Donald Stedman and other 
researchers at the University of Denver have invented just such a 
device.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;When placed by the side of the road, it measures how much pollution a 
car puts out as it drives  by. High emissions trigger a video camera 
which films both the car and its license plate. This allows the 
municipality using the device to send a letter (perhaps backed by a 
threat of a fine) to the violator informing him that his car emits too 
much pollution and must be repaired.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;The ability of remote sensing to "read" vehicle exhaust accurately and 
cheaply has been demonstrated repeatedly in the U.S. as well as in 
Canada and Great Britain. Alas, its biggest advantage is its biggest 
drawback.  Because it only singles out gross polluters and leaves most 
of us alone, bureaucrats hate it.  They'd rather foist upon us 
nonsense like the EV1 electric turkey.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;It's possible that electric cars will one day be a viable form of 
transportation for something other than short trips or putting around 
the golf course, but that day is years away.  For now, rather than 
giving in to environmentalist pleas and extortion, the automakers 
should line up behind remote sensing as a way of keeping gasoline cars 
running clean.

<title>Hiroshima -- Happy Birthday?</title>
</head>
<center><h2>Hiroshima -- Happy Birthday?</center></h2>
<p>
<p>
<hr>
William F. Buckley Jr, New York August 4th
<p>
Harry Truman was not an ambiguist, just to begin with. And in any 
case, important declarations are usually summary. "I do," is all that 
is necessary in answer to the question, "Do you take this man for your 
lawfully wedded husband?" When asked for final approval to drop the 
atomic bomb over Hiroshima, Harry Truman, in Potsdam, scribbled out in 
longhand, "Suggestion approved. Release when ready." It seems a 
millennium since the idiomatically similar order was given by Admiral 
Dewey to the captain of his flagship at the Battle of Manila Bay in 
1898: "You may fire when you are ready, Gridley." Truman authorized 
the non-platonic beginning of the nuclear age, at the convenience of 
the commander of a bomber squadron on the 39-square-mile island of 
Tinian.
<p>
Time magazine did a good job last week in describing the elements of 
the contest between East and West that was finally detonated at Pearl 
Harbor, and a harrowing account of the terrible bloodiness of the 
Pacific war and of the breathless interval between the bomb's falling 
at Nagasaki and the quiet-spoken words of the Emperor Hirohito, 
besought by a cabinet divided between surrender and suicide. He 
elected to surrender.
<p>
Books have been written and prayers for divine guidance said to 
examine the morality of the bomb. If it is true that the intentions of 
the perpetrator are the final determinants of moral rectitude, then 
Truman is clearly blameless. He had weighed reports of projected 
American casualties in an invasion of Japan; estimates ranged between 
thirty thousand and a half-million dead and wounded. The same 
strategists projected Japanese casualties at many times that number, 
and even as Truman thought about the question -- before even the trial 
bomb at Alamogordo had established that Little Boy (Hiroshima) and Fat 
Man (Nagasaki) would indeed work their devastation -- we were 
routinely proceeding with our concentrated bombing of Japanese cities. 
Over eighty thousand were killed in the firebombings of Tokyo even as, 
a few months earlier, we had in three waves killed almost as many 
Germans in Dresden with the saturation bombings.
<p>
Did Harry Truman give sufficient thought to alternatives? There was 
the possibility of encouraging an earlier intervention against Japan 
by the Soviet army. There was the possibility of amending the terms of 
surrender sharply enough to affect the thinking of the bitter-enders 
in the Japanese military. The answer to these questions can't be 
given, not because the alternatives weren't presented to Truman, but 
because we don't know to what extent they captured his attention. We 
had only just conquered Okinawa, with a loss of 12,500 American 
servicemen. A national poll showed 90 per cent of Americans supporting 
in effect unconditional surrender. As far as Truman was concerned, we 
should give him the benefit of the doubt: the nuclear bomb was simply 
the next weapon in line. We had traveled, in Truman's lifetime, from 
biplanes to B-29s. Why cavil at a single bomb that could effect the 
same damage as a thousand bombers?
<p>
The soul-searching came later. It required centuries to mobilize 
civilized opinion against slavery and against torture. It is not 
finally settled even now on capital punishment. Nor is it on nuclear 
weaponry as a deterrent, but then of course in order to deter, nuclear 
weapons need to threaten. A civilized scholar very close to several 
Presidents once observed to me that if the Soviet nuclear flotilla had 
actually launched, he would have seen no purpose in counselling the 
President to launch our own: what had been there as a deterrent, 
designed to be conclusive, hadn't worked -- so why kill 150 million 
Russians? No one of course will ever know whether such reasoning would 
have stayed the hand of a U.S. President. It sufficed that Soviet 
leaders did not rule out nuclear retaliation: whereupon nuclear 
stalemate was born. It had a long life.
<p>
It does surprise that the evangelistic energy now spent on the horrors 
of Hiroshima does not bear little buds that would encourage the 
development of defensive means to intercept the hypothetical nuclear 
bomb of tomorrow. For reasons quite impossible to understand, those 
most transfixed by the horrors of Hiroshima are most unconcerned by, 
or even hostile to, any effort to accost not the evil in men's minds 
and nature -- perhaps because this is not possible -- but the weapons 
such men can deploy.

<title>Buckley:  The Hangover</title>

</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<center>

<i>NEW YORK, OCTOBER 5</i>

<hr>

<h2>The Hangover</h2><br>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
The brainy wife of the brainy professor said, "I think the O.J. 
verdict should be protested." The brainy professor said, "How?"
                            <P>
Indeed. How?
                    <P>
The prattle, in which such as Senator Dole are engaged, is that we 
must accept the verdict and turn over a new leaf. Well, it is one 
thing to accept the verdict as a juridical reality: Nobody is arguing 
that O. J. Simpson should be sent back to jail. It is quite another 
thing to abide by the superstition that justice has been done. A lot 
of white folks who lynched black folks in the bad days went scot free 
because white jurors wouldn't convict them. But there are those who 
left that age with their honor intact: they screamed and yelled, and 
insisted that justice was not done. Screaming and yelling doesn't come 
naturally to a lot of people, but the brainy wife of the brainy 
professor was right, the verdict should be protested. 
          <P>
One way to do this is to remark the little filigrees on formal 
acquittal, and resist their effrontery. Johnnie Cochran tells the 
press moments after the verdict that the will of God has been done, as 
he knew it would be. One sighs: someone who can compare Mark Fuhrman 
to Adolf Hitler can, one supposes, adduce the will of God as 
motivating the jury's finding. Let us in charity assume that the 
relatives of O.J. sincerely thought him to be innocent, and pass over 
their bulletins to the effect that justice had been done. But what are 
we to make of O.J.'s solemn declaration that, now that the distraction 
has been swept away, the police should get serious and search out the 
real killer. He, O.J., will do "whatever it takes" to identify him. 
One way to begin this search is for everyone to submit a blood sample 
to the laboratories. And then ask the one out of 28 million with the 
telltale blood -- that adds up to about thirty people, sprinkled about 
in Tibet, Tierra del Fuego, and Kazakhstan -- what they were doing on 
the night of June 12, 1994.
<P>
And yes, we really should equip ourselves against hit-and-run self-
vindication by legerdemain. Johnnie Cochran was on Larry King Live on 
Wednesday saying what you would expect, the phone rings, and lo! O.J. 
is on the line. He says serene things, and then chastises a woman who 
had called in to ask Mr. Cochran to explain the shadowy creature who 
had been identified by the limo driver as coming into the Rockingham 
driveway just before 11 the night of the murders. O.J. says, Did the 
woman not listen to the witness, because the witness, if you followed 
him carefully, had said something quite different, and oh! how much 
he, O.J., had suffered from people drawing conclusions from the 
testimony which the testifiers had simply not said, understand?
                                     <P>
It is on the order of rising to say, "I told you there wasn't a purple 
cow on the property that night, DID I NOT?" People begin nodding their 
heads. We are off to the races with the reconstruction of the scene 
that night in June, one little piece at a time. 
                         <P>
What effect will the verdict have on the career of Colin Powell, 
somebody asked? Answer: One would hope none. But there is most 
definitely a danger there. When 75 percent of black Americans believe 
that the answer is A, not B, and 75 percent of white Americans 
believe that the answer is B, not A, then what we have is a breakdown 
in communication between two cultures. Either we share a common 
language and a common rational apparatus or we do not. It is a very 
very scary thing when three-quarters of one ethnic group flatly 
disagree with three-quarters of another ethnic group about the 
structure of rational arguments. It is simply wrong to suppose that 
the white majority believed O.J. to be guilty because he was black. It 
is simply undeniable that the black majority believed him innocent 
because he was black. And -- remarkably -- those figures remained 
static throughout those endless months of testimony. It was tempting 
for the white majority to conclude that the black majority was engaged 
in iconolatry. O.J. is a hero and that is the end of it. 
                <P>
Not entirely hard to understand. If the spelunkers were to come up 
from their caves with evidence that St. Francis of Assisi ate live 
pigeons for breakfast, there are those of us who would simply refuse 
to believe it. Legends, to be legendary, must be sacred, inviolate. 
But this is not to dodge the question: Yes. If the innocence of O.J. 
is a black postulate, then intercommunication has suffered a quite 
awful setback.

<title>GULF WAR SYNDROME: SON OF AGENT ORANGE</title>
</head>

<hr><center><h2>Gulf War Syndrome:  Son of Agent Orange</h2></center>
<p>
<p>
<center>By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">Michael Fumento </a>
</center><hr>
<p>
<p> 
Yet another scientific study has found no evidence that Gulf War 
Syndrome (GWS) is anything other than a broad tag applied to any 
illness found in any Gulf Vet. But those who deny the evidence remain 
undaunted. After all, says Veterans Affairs Secretary Jesse Brown, it 
took 20 years for the government to conclude that Agent Orange, a 
defoliant used on the jungles of South Vietnam, caused severe health 
problems in vets. Now the government liberally doles out payments to 
Vietnam vets with any number of diseases it claims have been linked to 
Agent Orange.
<p>
Indeed, the cry of "It's Agent Orange all over again!" has become the 
"Remember the Maine!" slogan of the GWS alarmists.  And they're right, 
but not in the way they would have us believe.
<p>
Both then and now there were wild, unsubstantiated tales of exposure.  
With Agent Orange, soldiers complained of being drenched with an 
orange-colored powder or liquid from the sky.  But the name comes from 
the color of the containing barrels. Agent Orange is clear and always 
a liquid. With GWS we hear of soldiers absolutely convinced they were 
hit by poison gas, even though during the whole of the war not one was 
ever treated for such exposure.  
<p>
Then and now there were wild rumors of miscarriage and birth defects 
among offspring of vets.  One case we keep hearing about is an alleged 
cluster of birth defects among National Guard families in Mississippi.  
But a health department investigation showed no more birth defects in 
that group than normal.  Wider studies have shown the same thing for 
both the offspring of Vietnam and Gulf War vets.  No study has ever 
shown them to have more birth defects or more miscarriages than vets 
who didn't go to war.
<p>
Then and now any symptom any vet got was blamed on the alleged 
illness. More than 75 symptoms have been attributed to GWS, ranging 
from bleeding gums to aching joints to graying hair to weight gain to 
heart disease. Even malaria and herpes have been attributed to GWS, 
though previously these were thought to have been spread by mosquitoes 
and sex.  If you have chronic back pains and didn't go to the Gulf, 
it's just chronic back pain. If you went, it's Gulf War Syndrome.
<p>
Then and now vets who got cancer automatically blamed it on the 
offending agent, as if vets who serve in wars are never supposed to 
get the disease. But one out of four Americans will eventually 
contract cancer.  Studies on Vietnam vets showed that they had no more 
cancers than among vets who didn't go to war, and the same has held 
true of Gulf War vets.
<p>
An on-going study of military personnel who actually did the Agent 
Orange spraying and who received far greater exposure than did ground 
troops indicates they are just as healthy as counterparts who received 
no Agent Orange exposure.
<p>
The same is true of studies of Gulf vets. The only illnesses they have 
to a greater degree than soldiers who didn't go to the Gulf are 
psychologically-related. These may be very real and debilitating, but 
they weren't caused by anything in the Gulf itself.  The prime cause, 
ironically, is probably being told they are being ravaged by a mystery 
illness.  Doctors have long known that if you tell people they are 
ill, they'll start sprouting numerous symptoms completely unrelated to 
their actual illness.
<p>
Then and now no purported link between illness and the alleged cause 
is considered too ludicrous. The first famous Agent Orange victim, 
Paul Reutersham, who died of cancer, was by his own admission 
completely enclosed in a supply helicopter at the time the area he was 
in was being sprayed.
<p>
The most reported-on death from GWS is Michael Adcock.  His mother 
claims a gas-laden Scud missile had exploded nearby 24 hours before 
her son developed his first cancer symptom. But cancers such as his 
usually take decades to develop and no cancer manifests itself in 
anything near 24 hours.
<p>
Then and now  the hysteria was driven by veterans lobbyists (most 
prominently the American Legion), by congressmen who opposed the war 
in question and who leap at any excuse to spend other people's money 
to show their compassion, by a media far more interested in selling 
terror than telling the truth, and (of course) lawyers.
<p>
Then and now, science was openly disavowed. In 1990, a veterans 
lobbyist said of Agent Orange, "we must now presume that the 
scientific community cannot be trusted [and] a political decision must 
be made on this issue to provide compensation to veterans."  In 1995 
President Clinton  leapfrogged over the heads of scientists in 
establishing a political panel to review GWS evidence, with Hillary 
Clinton serving as the Administration's point person on the issue.
<p>
Then and now, to question the causation-disease link was to be accused 
of being heartless and unpatriotic, as if it is compassionate and 
patriotic to mislead healthy people into believing they--and their 
wives and children--live under the shadow of a terrible disease.
<p>
Yes, then and now, vets have truly suffered, but not from any exposure 
they received during wartime. Rather it is exposure to those who claim 
to be their friends and allies that has caused their terror and even 
some of their symptoms.  With friends like those, who needs Ho Chi 
Minh and Saddam Hussein?

<title>Fumento:  (W.R.) Grace Under Fire--For All the Wrong Reasons </title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<h2>(W.R.) Grace Under Fire--For All the Wrong Reasons </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><i>Michael Fumento</i> </a>
</center><hr>
 

It's clearly a case of Grace under fire.  No, not the popular 
television show, but the Florida-based company W.R. Grace, the world's largest maker of speciality chemicals. Doing the firing is an activist group called the Foundation for Economic Trends (FET), headed up by the vociferous Jeremy Rifkin. Rifkin is leading a coalition of some of 200 groups and brandishing a petition signed by 100,000 Indian citizens.
<p>
Why the fuss?  To understand, you have to know a little about 
something called a neem tree.
<p>
The neem tree grows in a number of countries with tropical climates, 
but is especially plentiful and revered in India. Scientists call it 
one of the most helpful plants on earth, while Indians consider it 
sacred, calling it "the curer of all ailments." Its bark, leaves, 
flowers, and seeds are used to treat a variety of illnesses including 
leprosy, diabetes, ulcers, and skin disorders. The twigs are used as 
an antiseptic toothbrush while the seed oil is used to make toothpaste 
and soap. Oil from the seeds is a potent spermicide. The powdered 
leaves are used for facial cream.
<p>
In short, the neem appears to do everything but take your pulse and 
check your blood pressure. 
<p>
But what most appeals to the folks at W.R. Grace is that oil from the 
seeds is a powerful insecticide, repelling more than 200 species of 
bugs. The oil has long been used as such by Indians, but in its 
natural state the pesticide properties begin to decay within a matter 
of weeks or even days. Grace has developed a way of making this 
natural pesticide available to everyone by stabilizing it, thereby 
extending its shelf life for two years or more. The company has 
received a patent for the process.
<p>
"Foul!" cries Rifkin, who calls the patent "genetic colonialism" and 
is trying to get it revoked. "What we have here in broad terms," he 
told me, "is the beginning of worldwide discussion on who should 
control the gene pool."
<p>
I tried very hard to extract a valid point from Mr. Rifkin but failed.<p>  
First, he admitted that Grace's actions in securing a patent using 
Third World resources is hardly new or exceptional, but is just 
another case of "northern countries" exploiting "native genetic 
resources."
<p>
It's a bizarre accusation. Nobody should "control the gene pool," 
obviously, and Grace isn't trying. It didn't apply for a patent on the 
neem tree or its seeds or the oil from the seeds. The patent was for a 
process. To deny its patent because it involves a living thing is like 
saying someone can't get a patent for building a better mousetrap 
because the base of the mousetrap is made from wood.
<p>
Under U.S. law, a process or substance or invention may receive a 
patent--which is a temporary right of exclusive use and production--if 
it is novel, useful, and not obvious. You cannot therefore patent a 
gene, either here or abroad, since genes have always been around. <p>What 
you can do is patent a process you have developed using those genes or 
their product--in this case the oil from seeds.
<p>
All Grace's patent restricts is the ability to use the same 
stabilization method they have used. It doesn't even apply to 
extraction or processing of the neem extract prior to stabilization.  
<p>Nor does it even apply in India, since U.S. patent law doesn't extend 
there.
<p>
Rifkin says Grace's process isn't really even novel and that the 
patent should have been denied on that basis alone. Fine, let the 
Patent Office decide that.
<p>
Thus the "genetic" part of Rifkin's charge is obviously just a straw 
man.
<p>
What apparently rankles him is that some fat-cat Western company--no 
doubt headed up by porcine cigar-chompers--is once again exploiting 
Third World wealth. Rifkin complained to me that this was just another 
case of "northern countries" exploiting "native genetic resources."
<p>
The neem tree happens to be a convenient vehicle for his anti-
corporate crusade.
<p>
"Rifkin has cleverly picked an emotional issue because it's a 
religious tree in a Third World country," Says Henry Miller, a senior 
research fellow at the Hoover Institution in Stanford, California and 
a former FDA official.
<p>
But again, the colonialism charge just doesn't stick with Grace.
<p>
Some 22 companies have obtained patents regarding the neem tree, of 
which three are Indian. Grace buys its neem seeds on the open market 
and purchases less than three percent of the crop, which is 
unfortunate since 84% of the neem crop falls to the ground unharvested 
and simply rots.  Grace's Indian operation is run through an Indian 
holding firm, of which Grace is just a minority owner.
<p>
If this is the best one can do these days in ferreting out Ugly 
Americans, we Americans must be pretty handsome these days.
<p>
Rifkin and the FET are right that just because something CAN be done 
doesn't mean it SHOULD be done.  We need industry watchdogs like FET. 
<p>But there are no real ethical issues involved here, much less any of 
the Brave New World variety that FET likes to talk about. 
<p>
There's just a tree, with some really terrific products to offer, and 
one American company that isn't about to let its nationality get in 
the way of offering them.

<html><head><title>Buckley:  Should There Be a Law?</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg"><center><i>NEW YORK, OCTOBER 13</i><hr><h2>Should There Be a Law?</h2><br><a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
 

This is an exploratory column, its purpose to encourage thought on a 
question that badly needs thinking about. 
<p>
The Problem: The birth every year of one million babies to unwed 
mothers. 
<p>
The Consequence: One million children who, on reaching the age of 13, 
tend to run into difficulties. The statistics tell us that the child 
raised by a single parent is likelier by a factor of 600 per cent to 
commit crimes, consume drugs, quit school, and bear, or sire, children 
out of wedlock. Assume -- if only to be hopeful -- that the problems 
diminish after age 19, we are still left with six million teenagers 
who are a heavy social burden, as also, of course, a burden to 
themselves. 
<p>
A Social Deterrent? Since manifestly it is against the interest of 
society, for reasons moral and material, to encourage the birth of 
babies to unwed mothers, what might be done to discourage the 
practice? Only one serious suggestion has been made, and at book 
length, by Mr. Charles Murray. He believes that welfare payments to 
unwed mothers serve as inducements and therefore that to eliminate 
that miscarriage of charity would significantly reduce illegitimacy 
(which is up, in the last thirty years, from 5 per cent to 18 per cent 
among whites, from 25 per cent to 63 per cent among blacks). We have 
seen that Congress has played around with this question, and that the 
proposal is well on its way to limit payments to two illegitimate 
births. This approach hardly addresses the problem with appropriate 
sternness. Among other things, we all know that if the third child 
were sick or starving, we'd look after it. The effort should focus on 
preventing the procreative act, rather than on mistreating the child.
<p>
A Civil Delinquency? As things now stand, the father (or mother) of a 
child born out of wedlock runs into no civil resistance of any sort. 
As far as the law is concerned, it is safer to have a bastard child 
than to double-park. A couple of years ago Bill Moyers did a 
documentary on the culture of wanton sex and found himself speaking to 
a young black stud, about twenty years old if memory serves, who 
proudly acknowledged fatherhood of three children by three different 
girls/ women, and gaily announced his intention of pursuing his 
bluebirdism, since he found it amusing. All that Mr. Moyers was able 
to manage was a gentle sigh for the pieties of yesteryear, which will 
get you exactly nothing from the people we are talking about. 
<p>
Are There Other Deterrents? Well yes, there are. To list some such is 
not necessarily to recommend them. But just as the Pentagon 
undoubtedly has a file on how to invade Switzerland, here is one on 
some of the deterrents that might be given a little thought.
<p>
 -- Deny a driving license to the parents for five years. (This side 
of imprisonment and death by hanging, this is the deepest known 
deprivation in the American culture.)
<p>
 -- Require the father to perform ten hours of appropriate work every 
week on whatever project makes sense. 
<p>
 -- Require the father to spend three evenings every week sequestered. 
Including Saturday night.
<p>
 -- Do a vasectomy on the man. A Norplant on the girl. 
<p>
Now these approaches raise problems, to put it lightly. There is, to 
begin with, the problem of locating the father. This accomplished, 
some proceeding or another would need to address the question whether, 
when the sexual union was done, the parties had agreed somewhere along 
the line to get married. In Sweden, about one-half the babies are 
conceived pre-marriage, but 90 per cent are born to two parents living 
together. How do you handle the situation: "Henry said he loved me and 
we'd be married just as soon as he finished high school"?
<p>
Is there a constitutional problem? Suppose that Henry says that 
without a driver's license he will be fired, because he earns his 
money delivering newspapers? Can the physical detention of the father 
be done without a judicial proceeding? Are there at hand convenient 
ways of absolutely identifying the father by DNA? Are vasectomies and 
Norplants acceptable, under such circumstances, in moral theology?
<p>
All these are designed as open questions, to flush out thought. 
Although commentary can't be acknowledged, I'd welcome having it,

York, N.Y. 10016.

<i>NEW YORK, DECEMBER 19</i>
<hr>
<h2>Who Is to Blame?</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
<P>
On the program 60 Minutes, a half-dozen retiring legislators submitted 
to friendly interrogation inquiring into the reason for their decision 
to give it all up, go home. Most of their complaints we are familiar 
with. Unquestionably the most searing is the business about money: 
Senator Alan Simpson reported that a senator has to raise a minimum of 
$10,000 every week, which is a heavy load. When you consider 10 thou 
times 52 times 6 that adds up to over $3 million -- which is only one-
third of what retiring Senator Paul Simon had to spend to get back 
into the Senate. 
<P>
Is that situation inherently corrupt? Not a bad question. One senator 
put it this way. He gets back to his hotel at 10 P.M. after a hard day 
of electioneering and he has twenty telephone messages, all of them 
from strangers. But one name he does recognize, because that goodbody 
had donated $1,000 to the senator's campaign. The senator has the 
energy left, at that time of night -- after such a day -- to make one 
phone call, so whom does he call? Right. And even if it happened that 
the caller's message was, Please vote in favor of Measure X, and the 
senator goes out and votes against Measure X, it still remains that 
the only person who got through to him was a Measure X enthusiast, and 
enthusiasms have a way of communicating themselves, not least when 
fueled with thousand-dollar bills. Is there a way to stop all that? 
No, not under our system. It could be changed only by going to a 
parliamentary system on the British model.
<P>
But a less conventional complaint of some of the retiring gentlemen 
had to do with the under-celebrated art of compromise. People just 
don't understand, one man put it, that politics is -- you guessed it, 
the art of compromise. The gentlemen being interviewed were too polite 
to say it in exactly as many words, but what they were criticizing was 
the Gingrich House. To use bald figures, one had the impression that 
if Gingrich would simply give up on tax reform, he'd get substantially 
what he wanted in the way of tax reform. 
<P>
And of course compromise is the civilized approach to most 
controversies, but the operative word in that sentence is "most." And 
the entrenched mood of the congressmen who do not wish to compromise 
with Mr. Clinton is reinforced by the rhetoric used by Mr. Clinton and 
his satellites. It could be that your call to reduce medical expenses 
by $270 billion in seven years could be adulterated a little, say to 
$250 billion in eight years, that kind of thing -- do it, take a deep 
breath, and sigh resignedly over the rough nature of democratic 
compromise. 
<P>
But to engender receptivity for the compromise mode requires 
rhetorical adaptation at the other end, and this President Clinton is 
ostentatiously declining to do. He speaks instead of Republicans 
wishing to cut medical services for the aged and the indigent, using 
words appropriate to a situation in which Congress was planning to 
sequester a million people every year in a huge federal compound and 
let them die there of starvation and exposure. Slowly. 
<P>
Even the most dogged defenders of state welfarism here and there break 
under the strain. The New Republic's editorialist, remarking on the 
success Mr. Clinton is having with his phony scare tactics, lays the 
final blame on the voting public. "The only people being fundamentally 
irresponsible in the recent -- and continuing -- budget battle are the 
American people. They are, to borrow a phrase from our colleague 
Michael Kinsley, big babies. A year ago, in a realigning election, 
voters ushered in a Republican Congress that had pledged, in complete 
candor, to balance the federal budget. In the days before that 
election, voters backed Republicans over Democrats by a 2.8 per cent 
margin. Then the Republicans made a fatal error: they tried to deliver 
on their promise. The result is that in the last few months, the party 
positions have been completely reversed. The Democrats now lead by 2.4 
per cent." 
<P>
But then whom do you blame for the people's immaturity? The 
editorialist suggests it is the people themselves who are to blame, 
for wanting one thing and authorizing another. "Speaker Gingrich, for 
all his failings, is the first American politician actually to 
confront the public with the reality. For that, he gets an approval 
rating of 27 per cent." Any effort to bail out the American people for 
this act of irresponsibility would have to reason to the people's 
ignorance for believing what their President has been telling them, 
six times a day, for the past six weeks. If the voters believe Clinton 
is correct -- that passage of the Contract with America will result in 
agony and death for uncounted hundreds of thousands of Americans -- 
then they are right to say no to Mr. Gingrich. 
<P>
And the problem becomes: What to do about demagogues in the White 
House? Vote them out of office? Yes, but what will inform the voters 
that that is the thing to do?<p>

<title>Buckley:  Understanding the Papal Bull</title>

</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<i>NEW YORK, OCTOBER 10</i>

<hr>

<h2>Understanding the Papal Bull</h2><br>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>



The impression made by Pope John Paul was quite simply stunning. 
Granted, the panoply was intoxicatingly splendid; yet all those 
millions of candles and choirboys and bishops would not have given the 
spectator such life as he got from what he saw and heard if its 
centerpiece had been a nice old bore. The transfiguring feature of all 
those appearances was the man, and his words. "May the Holy Spirit 
strengthen your hearts, making them blameless and holy before our God 
and Father, so that you may serve His people with ever greater joy." 
We are not talking about sound bites.
                                                            <P>
But one needs to be reminded that the exhortations of a pope are 
customarily done in the paradigmatic mode, which is fitting for the 
primary spokesman for Biblical injunctions. The language of Moses and 
of Christ is totalist in its formulation. We are enjoined to be -- 
saintly.
                                            <P>
This is beyond the reach of all but the very few. Even so, what we 
hear said about how we should be cannot be attenuated by the 
foreknowledge of man's inability to attain perfection. Give everything 
you have to the poor and join the pilgrimage of Christ -- here is a 
rock-solid injunction, toward the discharge of which human efforts are 
almost necessarily asymptotic. States are the organs of individuals, 
and so one runs into difficulties translating Christian imperatives 
into social policy. This is a problem that every pope in this century 
has faced, and Pope John Paul II cannot solve it, perhaps because it 
cannot be solved.
                            <P>
It has frequently been noticed that papal declarations tend to be 
undernourished on the matter of production. The emphasis is almost 
always on distribution. Thus we hear from papal declarations dating 
back more than one century about the obligation of the rich to give to 
the poor. The question naturally arises: It is right for Wealthy John 
to give to Poor Peter, but do we translate this into an obligation by 
John to vote to instruct Internal Revenue to descend on Wealthy James, 
to give to Poor Peter? The incorporation of individual virtue into 
state policy is a difficult business.
                 <P>
Consider the question of immigration. The Pope said, shortly after 
landing, "America keeps compassion, generosity and concern for others 
at the very heart of its efforts. . . . From the beginning until now, 
the United States has been a haven for generation after generation of 
new arrivals. Men, women, and children have streamed here from every 
corner of the globe, building new lives and forming a society of rich 
ethnic and racial diversity based on commitment to a shared vision of 
human dignity and freedom."
  <P>
Now this is not accurate historical accounting. What it is is a 
sublimation of American history. It is American history as it would be 
recounted if Americans were all saints -- and if no grass ever grew to 
interrupt the waterflow of goodness.
                                                                              <P>
What is true is that American compassion has been marked and still is: 
50 per cent of the world's immigration to the developed countries is 
into the United States. But it is also true that several times in 
American history Congress has elected to limit, or even to suspend, 
immigration. Sometimes the motivations of individual congressmen are 
xenophobic -- they just don't want any more foreigners. The Oriental 
Exclusion Act was quite straightforward on this matter.
                                                               <P>
But sometimes, also, practical considerations were at the forefront of 
legislative action. During the Depression it would hardly have made 
sense to invite a large wave of immigrants into a country in which 
millions were suffering and 20 per cent were unemployed. And then the 
question arises today: Is it a trespass on Christian principles to 
advocate a temporary restriction in the current rate of immigration? 
Is Barbara Jordan -- who headed the commission that recommended 
exactly that -- anti-Christian?
                                               <P>
Manifestly, it isn't so. Yet to advocate reduced immigration isn't to 
fault the Pope for speaking in the language of prophets, who deal not, 
and should not deal, with such questions as: Is California going broke 
under the burden? Is multiculturalism breaking up our culture? Why are 
there national borders, if immigration is not properly a matter of 
government policy?
                                   <P>
What we are left with is the papal injunction to: compassion, 
generosity, and concern for others. The particularization of those 
sentiments is necessarily a problem for individual states.

<title>Fumento: Sugar, The Everglades... And Big Government  -- 3/6/96</title>

<h2>
Sugar, The Everglades... And Big Government
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Michael Fumento
</a>

<P>
Poor Al Gore.  Even when he correctly diagnoses a problem, he just 
can't come up with a solution that doesn't involve Big Government--
even when Big Government  is the problem in the first place. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Case in point: the threat to one of the world's most magnificent and 
important eco-systems, the Florida Everglades. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This threat is primarily from sugar farming, which uses up more and 
more of this precious land every year.  Far worse, huge amounts--as 
much as 80 percent--of the phosphorous used in fertilizing sugar cane 
in Florida drains into the Everglades. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This sets off  a chain reaction, stimulating growth among bacteria and 
algae and also fostering the growth of cattails which choke off the 
marshes, ruining nesting places and destroying animal food supplies. 
Thousands of acres have been overrun by these super cattails. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The farming has also dramatically reduced the flow of fresh water from 
Lake Okeechobee into the Everglades, again damaging the eco-system.   
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Gore's solution to this is a tax-and-spend Democrat's solution to all 
problems--raise taxes and spend them.  Tax all sugar growers a penny a 
pound and spend the money to buy as much as 140,000 acres back from 
farmers to convert them back to marshlands.  His explanation is that 
we already subsidize sugar 18 cents per pound, so really we'd just be 
cutting their subsidy. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Alas, the situation isn't nearly that simple. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In fact, the government does not directly subsidize sugar. It does 
guarantee sugar farmers a minimum of 18 cents return per pound, but it 
never pays any of that out.  Rather it enforces import restrictions to 
prop the price of sugar up.  Sugar in this country currently 
wholesales for about 23 to 24 cents a pound, about twice the cost 
globally. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
So what Gore is proposing isn't holding back a bit on a subsidy, it's 
just a tax, and one that will leave the import restrictions completely 
intact. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yet it's the import restrictions that are the real cause of the 
problem.  By artificially inflating the production value of sugar, 
they encourage industry to grow far more crops than they otherwise 
would.  In 1981, 334,000 acres of Everglades were used for sugar 
farming; today the number is about half a million acres. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Get rid of the protections and farming in the Everglades will plunge.  
If this puts sugar cropland back to its 1981 level, it will give us 
back 166,000 acres of wetlands--26,000 more than the Gore proposal.  
It will also greatly reduce the price that Americans pay to prop up 
Big Sugar's profits.  In all, the sugar program is estimated to cost 
consumers $1.4 billion a year. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But what if this doesn't go far enough in helping the Everglades?  
Then step two would be to levy a tax on the polluters themselves, the 
farms in the Everglades.  Taxing beet farmers in Louisiana to pay for 
damage caused by cane farmers in Florida is hardly fair, nor does it 
accomplish the purpose of discouraging environmentally harmful 
farming. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Actually, steps one and two will complement each other.  That's 
because by getting rid of the import restrictions, the price of sugar 
cane farmland in the Everglades will drop considerably.  Far less tax 
money would be needed to buy up crop land and turn it back to the 
egrets, eagles, and alligators. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Big Sugar will scream that this is all terribly unfair.  Competition?  
Why, it's downright un-American!  Further, 420,000 American jobs will 
be lost, they claim, as the American sugar industry folds.  Actually, 
the USDA says that sugar farmers employ about 46,000 people 
nationwide, including perhaps 15,000 in Florida.  In any case, the 
sugar industry would hardly fold and the  government could use 
lowering our sugar import restrictions to pry open markets in other 
countries which would create American jobs. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Unfortunately, both the House and the Senate have just thrown away 
chances to reduce or eliminate Big Sugar's protection.  That may have 
something to do with all the sweet green stuff the industry spreads 
around.  Together, the sugar cane, sugar beat and corn sweetener 
interests contributed almost $12 million to candidates for federal 
office from 1979 through 1994, according to the Washington-based 
Center for Responsive Politics. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But if the Clinton Administration wants to do the right thing, there's 
still time to insist that the new farm legislation does so.  If only 
it can get over its belief that Big Government is the solution to a 
problem that Big Government's largesse to Big Sugar created in the 
first place.

<title>ANTI-OBESITY DRUG IS HEAVY ON HYPE</title>

<h2>ANTI-OBESITY DRUG IS HEAVY ON HYPE</h2>


By <br><a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">Michael Fumento</a>
</center><hr>
<p>
<p>
It seems that when it comes to weight-loss products, the expression 
"If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is" just doesn't have 
meaning.  So it has been with the so-called "miracle anti-fat pill," 
which isn't a pill, isn't a miracle, and has "hype" written all over 
it.
<p>
Recent studies in Science magazine have claimed synthesized high doses 
of a naturally-occurring hormone, called leptin, caused mice to go 
from Jackie Gleason to Art Carney in a matter of weeks. This has 
sparked a celebration in various media outlets.  The St. Petersburg 
(Florida) Times, the most-read newspaper in one of the fattest parts 
of the country, gushed, "Just think: You could gorge yourself on ice 
cream, potato chips, tacos . . . . Then just pop a miracle pill, and 
your worries are over . . . . The world would be couch-potato heaven."  
<p>
Ah . . .  Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow there's a drug, 
right?
<p>
Reality check.
<p>
The first little problem with leptin is that the "pill" is actually 
injections, possibly daily, for life.
<p>
No big deal?  Ask any insulin-dependent diabetic.  The difference 
between leanness and simple obesity (obesity is usually defined as 
being 20% over ideal weight) is about the equivalent of a McDonald's 
Big Mac.  Probably few of us would cherish trading sandwiches for 
shots.
<p>
Then there's the efficacy issue. Leptin works wonders on rotund 
rodents and no doubt Mickey will soon have heard the last of Minnie's 
teasing about his "beer cheese belly." But mice are not small men.  
Medical literature is replete with instances of drugs that cured or 
killed rodents yet had no effect on humans.
<p>
Recent research by Dr. Jos Caro and others at Thomas Jefferson 
Medical Center in Philadelphia, including a study in the June Journal 
of Clinical Investigation, has found that obese people actually 
already have far higher levels of leptin than do lean ones.  This 
could mean that leptin is useless as a weight regulator in humans.  
Or, as Dr. Caro told me, the situation could be like Type II diabetes, 
in which sufferers have high levels of insulin but are resistant to 
its effects and therefore must be given much more insulin.
<p>
Maybe a massive dose of leptin would work on obese humans, says Dr. 
Caro. "But that is an optimistic view. It may also not work."    
<p>
Then there's safety.  We don't know yet how safe large leptin 
infusions are for mice, much less humans.
<p>
What all this means is that the two-year timeline some reporters have 
suggested for general use of the drug is laughable.  Five is more like 
it, and perhaps far more.  
<p>
Assuming leptin even worked perfectly, there would still be the 
problem that obesity is often just the most obvious indicator of the 
physical harm on ourselves by overeating and underexercising.  Leptin 
won't strengthen the lungs, heart, and other muscles grown soft 
through too many hours of watching Home Improvement and Roseanne.  It 
won't lower cholesterol levels. It won't prevent colon cancer and 
other malignancies linked to a bad diet.
<p>
And then there's another kind of harm for which obesity is merely a 
marker, the mental attitude that's led to the obesity epidemic.
<p>
Despite the other obesity hype we've been hearing lately, that of "fat 
genes," genes cannot explain the waistline explosion of the last two 
decades that has made a third of us obese and as many as three-fourths 
of us overweight.  Genes cannot explain why Americans of European 
descent weigh so much more than do Europeans, making the land of the 
free also the land of the fattest people on earth.
<p>
Yes, there is evidence that some human obesity is genetic, and if some 
300 pounder insists he sustains his weight on a turnip a day, I won't 
argue.  But most fat people are only lying to themselves when they 
blame their ancestors.
<p>
One better object of blame is a culture that encourages overeating and 
underexertion. Another is ourselves.
<p>
It used to be that concepts like "self-restraint," "delayed 
gratification," "self-denial" and "all things in moderation" were 
indicative of building character.  Now they have become quaint.
<p>
Tell an overweight American he should eat less and exert himself more 
and you're likely to get the same incredulous response you'd get if 
you told a welfare mother with seven children by six men that human 
beings should not behave like rabbits.
<p>
Gluttony isn't called one of the seven deadly sins because it can 
spoil your looks in a bikini, but rather because of its impact on the 
spirit.  But Americans don't want to hear about that sin or any other.
<p>
Instead, we want to indulge, and we don't want to bulge.  So we spend 
billions of dollars a year chasing after fad diets, false prophets, 
anti-cellulite salves, pills, foods, drinks, and exercise equipment 
guaranteed to effortlessly burn off gazillions of calories. We buy 
books and videos from screaming women with blonde crewcuts, and 
purchase cream promising to magically drain the fat from our thighs.
<p>
 Sure, no miracle cure has worked yet, but the next one just might. 
Anything's better than a little self-discipline, a little denial.  And 
who knows, maybe the next promised miracle will really pan out.  Maybe 
leptin will.
<p>
Yes, some day we may all be able to walk around in a glorious leptin 
lethargy with feedbags on one end and bags like they sling under 
parade horses on the other end.  
<p>
But alas, what truly ails this nation no drug is going to cure.

<title>Steve Forbes, Front and Right</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
<i>NEW YORK, SEPTEMBER 22</i>
<hr>
<h2>Steve Forbes, Front and Right</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
 
The entry into the presidential race of Malcolm (Steve) Forbes Jr. is 
something more than merely ho-ho time. Commentator William Schneider, 
on CNN, snappily summed it up: If Dole stumbles, it becomes an open 
race, and Forbes has the money to project his views.<p>

They are as rumored. The single unusual feature of his free-market 
program is a call for a return to the gold standard, something we have 
not heard much about since Lewis Lehrman retired from politics. Money-
exchange issues don't have the sex they had back when William Jennings 
Bryan set out to save the American people from crucifixion on a cross 
of gold. What the word "gold" tends to communicate today is merely 
sound currency, anti-inflation. Mr. Forbes assured his following that 
when his Administration takes office, once again people will be able 
to think in terms of 4.5 per cent interest rates on their mortgages.<p>

Beware, said Forbes, the use of the comparative "-er." As in "cheaper" 
government, "lower" taxation. Forbes would do away entirely with the 
tax code. He calls for a $36,000 exemption from federal taxes, after 
which the tax would be a flat 17 per cent. Capital-gains taxes would 
be phased out. Prometheus, unbound.<p>

Steve Forbes will tell you in unharassed conversation that there is 
something missing in the other campaigners for the Republican 
nomination. In his announcement speech he paid the formal courtesies 
to the other candidates: every one of them would be an improvement on 
what we now have. "[Yet] I think a lot of people would agree, there is 
an empty feeling in this campaign so far. One reason is that none of 
the other candidates is raising high the banner of economic expansion 
and opportunity. . . . But there are other reasons for the empty 
feeling. The fact is, the other candidates, on both sides, are 
insiders. And we all know that if the insiders had the answers, they 
would have implemented them by now." The emphasis, says Forbes, is on 
his own entrepreneurial background. This uniquely qualifies him, in 
his understanding, to lead the charge to high-octane economic energy.
<p>
But when he has the quiet opportunity to do so, he focuses, of course, 
on Phil Gramm, the only competitor in sight, in the event Dole should 
founder. "He is as smart a man as I have ever known," Steve Forbes 
will tell you. But -- he thinks -- Gramm's candidacy overstresses the 
negative, the need to cut spending in particular. Forbes is the 
enthusiast who sees an American giant bursting with innovative energy, 
shackled by the Lilliputians of Washington with their tax codes, 
regulations, bureaucracy -- the culture of Washington, which, he says, 
as a true outsider he is uniquely liberated from. Steve Forbes truly 
believes that the special music in the political air of 1996 is not 
elsewhere being heard, and that he can serve as the tunesmith for the 
nation.<p>

The announcement speech he made was hardly musical (". . . like John 
F. Kennedy did," "like Ronald Reagan did . . ." -- Steve Forbes and 
Adlai Stevenson attended the same college!). But it was very very 
American. He has come into the political fight with the brashness of 
the wholesome iconoclast. There is nothing there of the grouch, no 
petulance, no swagger: Steve Forbes is not Ross Perot. And even though 
the odds are preposterously adverse, he is willing to make the run and 
to finance his own campaign.<p>

What can sympathetic but skeptical conservatives say about it all? 
"Look," Forbes said recently to a friend. "I am a male, I am white, a 
Protestant, an Ivy Leaguer, rich, business-oriented, without practical 
political experience. It couldn't be worse, but at least I'd like to 
be free to fall down on my own arse, without any help from 
conservatives." Fair enough, and bon voyage. <p>

<title>Fumento: The Media's Militia Hate-Fest -- 8/8/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<blockquote><blockquote>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>August 8, 1996</i><br>
<h2>The Media's Militia Hate-Fest</h2>
You've got to hand it to those braniacs in the media. Almost before 
the blast of the Olympic bombing stopped ringing in our hears, they 
knew whodunnit. Actually, it was a simple deduction for them.  The 
person who phoned in the warning had an American, white-sounding 
voice; therefore it was (ominous music, please) THE MILITIA! <p>

Now, now, don't pay any attention to the talk about this loner 
security guard with the hero complex.  The media had its men long ago. <p>

Here's how the Associated Press (AP) began a story. "The bomber who 
brought terror to the Olympics was a white male, may not have worked 
alone and may have shared militia groups' hatred of international 
organizations." <p>

Of course, this means he just as easily could have worked alone and 
despised militia groups almost as much as, say, the media do. But 
that's not the way AP wanted to slant it. <p>

Then there was the headline: "Two Militia Members Potential Suspects 
in Olympics Blast." <p>

"Potential" here serves the same purpose as "may" in the AP story. It 
takes nothing and makes it seem like something. Heck, as an American 
male with a white-sounding voice  (not to mention one who was trained 
to blow things up in the Army) I could have been a potential suspect.  
(I hope I don't get a call from the FBI now.) <p>

When I did a search of the Nexis computer data base of newspapers, 
magazines, and TV news shows and plugged in the key words "militia," 
"Olympic," and "bomb," I found no fewer than 343 articles containing 
those terms! <p>

Granted, a couple of those pieces actually said there was no reason to 
suspect the militia.  But most of the rest bent over backwards, 
sideways, and at any odd angle to try to tie these things together. <p>

Why? <p>

"With the Oklahoma City bombing, there were 36 hours in which it was 
Middle Eastern terrorists," David Kopel, research director of the 
Independence Institute in Golden, Colorado reminded me. "It's the same 
human instinct to rush to judgment against whoever is the modern hate 
object." <p>

Says Kopel, "A lot of what the media thrives on is conflicts of good 
versus evil.  What they put into the `evil' box varies with sociology 
of the times.  In the 1910s it would have been anarchists; in the 
1930s it would have been sex-crazed Negroes on marijuana.  Now it's 
the tobacco industry and gun owners." <p>

So part of the reason the media hate the militia is because they have 
guns.  (God help them if they also smoke.)  But certainly another 
factor is the media fear what they don't understand.  Since they are 
so enamored of big government, they can't possibly comprehend the 
thinking of people so very mistrustful of big government.  Indeed, 
it's safe to say that many militia members are downright paranoid, but 
that's hardly illegal and hardly a characteristic of only militia 
groups. <p>

Further, both the media and the public have a misconception of the 
militia because the only time you hear of them, they've done something 
wrong, be it stockpiling illegal weapons or refusing to pay taxes. 
But, says Kopel, focusing on criminals on the fringe of the militia 
movement, "Is no more fair than saying that the cops who beat up 
Rodney King are representative of police throughout the country." <p>

Finally, the pot is being stirred by groups which make their living by 
making you think all militia members are white boys who wear pointed 
white hoods or greet each other with "Heil Hitler!" instead of 
"Hello!" (Never mind that the leader of one of the largest militia 
units, J.J. Johnson of Ohio, is black and that he's called the media 
attempts to identify the militia with racism as "drive-by 
journalism.") <p>

One such group is the Center for Democratic Renewal (CDR), which as I 
documented in a July 8 Wall Street Journal article basically 
fabricated the "epidemic" of black church burnings.  Depending on the 
gullibility of the reporter, the CDR will say there are anywhere from 
50,000 to 200,000 militia members and allies, though a 1995 Anti-
Defamation League report put the figure at 15,000. <p>

Another militia-baiting group is the Southern Poverty Law Center, 
headed by Morris Dees.  The Atlanta bombing, he suggested to wide-eyed 
reporters, might be a militia effort to "disrupt the one-world 
movement." <p>

It probably never occurred to most of us, militia included, that the 
modern Olympic games--now a century old--were part of any one-world 
movement, instead of a forum for athletes to glorify their countries 
and earn fat endorsement contracts. <p>

 But Dees profits handsomely from spreading hysteria. According to an 
August 3 USA Today story, his group has now amassed a fortune of $68 
million, even while other civil rights groups are going broke. <p>

"Morris Dees is an effective, demagogic hatemonger who's using his 
immense talents to get rich by making Americans afraid of each other," 
says Kopel. "He's a fraud who has milked a lot of very wonderful, 
well-intentioned people," Stephen Bright of Atlanta's Southern Center 
for Human Rights told USA Today. <p>

Says Kopel, "If the militia hadn't come along, Dees and the CDR would 
have had to invent them, and they have indeed invented what they mean 
to a lot of people." <p>

That includes virtually the entire U.S. media. Now if they can only 
find a way to blame the downing of TWA Flight 800 on a small band of 
militia in Idaho . . .  <p>

<H2>President Reagan's First Inaugural Address</H2>
<HR>

<P>
Tuesday, January 20th, 1981. <HR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Senator Hatfield, Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. President, Vice President
Bush, Vice President Mondale, Senator Baker, Speaker O'Neill,
Reverend Moomaw, and my fellow citizens: To a few of us here today,
this is a solemn and most momentous occasion; and yet, in the
history of our Nation, it is a commonplace occurrence. The orderly
transfer of authority as called for in the Constitution routinely
takes place as it has for almost two centuries and few of us stop
to think how unique we really are. In the eyes of many in the
world, this every-4-year ceremony we accept as normal is nothing
less than a miracle.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Mr. President, I want our fellow citizens to know how much you
did to carry on this tradition. By your gracious cooperation in
the transition process, you have shown a watching world that we
are a united people pledged to maintaining a political system
which guarantees individual liberty to a greater degree than any
other, and I thank you and your people for all your help in maintaining
the continuity which is the bulwark of our Republic.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The business of our nation goes forward. These United States are
confronted with an economic affliction of great proportions. We
suffer from the longest and one of the worst sustained inflations
in our national history. It distorts our economic decisions, penalizes
thrift, and crushes the struggling young and the fixed-income
elderly alike. It threatens to shatter the lives of millions of
our people.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Idle industries have cast workers into unemployment, causing human
misery and personal indignity. Those who do work are denied a
fair return for their labor by a tax system which penalizes successful
achievement and keeps us from maintaining full productivity.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
But great as our tax burden is, it has not kept pace with public
spending. For decades, we have piled deficit upon deficit, mortgaging
our future and our children's future for the temporary convenience
of the present. To continue this long trend is to guarantee tremendous
social, cultural, political, and economic upheavals.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
You and I, as individuals, can, by borrowing, live beyond our
means, but for only a limited period of time. Why, then, should
we think that collectively, as a nation, we are not bound by that
same limitation?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We must act today in order to preserve tomorrow. And let there
be no misunderstanding--we are going to begin to act, beginning
today.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The economic ills we suffer have come upon us over several decades.
They will not go away in days, weeks, or months, but they will
go away. They will go away because we, as Americans, have the
capacity now, as we have had in the past, to do whatever needs
to be done to preserve this last and greatest bastion of freedom.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our
problem.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
From time to time, we have been tempted to believe that society
has become too complex to be managed by self-rule, that government
by an elite group is superior to government for, by, and of the
people. But if no one among us is capable of governing himself,
then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else? All
of us together, in and out of government, must bear the burden.
The solutions we seek must be equitable, with no one group singled
out to pay a higher price.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We hear much of special interest groups. Our concern must be for
a special interest group that has been too long neglected. It
knows no sectional boundaries or ethnic and racial divisions,
and it crosses political party lines. It is made up of men and
women who raise our food, patrol our streets, man our mines and
our factories, teach our children, keep our homes, and heal us
when we are sick--professionals, industrialists, shopkeepers,
clerks, cabbies, and truckdrivers. They are, in short, &quot;We
the people,&quot; this breed called Americans.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, this administration's objective will be a healthy, vigorous,
growing economy that provides equal opportunity for all Americans,
with no barriers born of bigotry or discrimination. Putting America
back to work means putting all Americans back to work. Ending
inflation means freeing all Americans from the terror of runaway
living costs. All must share in the productive work of this &quot;new
beginning&quot; and all must share in the bounty of a revived
economy. With the idealism and fair play which are the core of
our system and our strength, we can have a strong and prosperous
America at peace with itself and the world.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, as we begin, let us take inventory. We are a nation that has
a government--not the other way around. And this makes us special
among the nations of the Earth. Our Government has no power except
that granted it by the people. It is time to check and reverse
the growth of government which shows signs of having grown beyond
the consent of the governed.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is my intention to curb the size and influence of the Federal
establishment and to demand recognition of the distinction between
the powers granted to the Federal Government and those reserved
to the States or to the people. All of us need to be reminded
that the Federal Government did not create the States; the States
created the Federal Government.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now, so there will be no misunderstanding, it is not my intention
to do away with government. It is, rather, to make it work--work
with us, not over us; to stand by our side, not ride on our back.
Government can and must provide opportunity, not smother it; foster
productivity, not stifle it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
If we look to the answer as to why, for so many years, we achieved
so much, prospered as no other people on Earth, it was because
here, in this land, we unleashed the energy and individual genius
of man to a greater extent than has ever been done before. Freedom
and the dignity of the individual have been more available and
assured here than in any other place on Earth. The price for this
freedom at times has been high, but we have never been unwilling
to pay that price.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is no coincidence that our present troubles parallel and are
proportionate to the intervention and intrusion in our lives that
result from unnecessary and excessive growth of government. It
is time for us to realize that we are too great a nation to limit
ourselves to small dreams. We are not, as some would have us believe,
doomed to an inevitable decline. I do not believe in a fate that
will fall on us no matter what we do. I do believe in a fate that
will fall on us if we do nothing. So, with all the creative energy
at our command, let us begin an era of national renewal. Let us
renew our determination, our courage, and our strength. And let
us renew our faith and our hope.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We have every right to dream heroic dreams. Those who say that
we are in a time when there are no heroes just don't know where
to look. You can see heroes every day going in and out of factory
gates. Others, a handful in number, produce enough food to feed
all of us and then the world beyond. You meet heroes across a
counter--and they are on both sides of that counter. There are
entrepreneurs with faith in themselves and faith in an idea who
create new jobs, new wealth and opportunity. They are individuals
and families whose taxes support the Government and whose voluntary
gifts support church, charity, culture, art, and education. Their
patriotism is quiet but deep. Their values sustain our national
life.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I have used the words &quot;they&quot; and &quot;their&quot; in
speaking of these heroes. I could say &quot;you&quot; and &quot;your&quot;
because I am addressing the heroes of whom I speak--you, the citizens
of this blessed land. Your dreams, your hopes, your goals are
going to be the dreams, the hopes, and the goals of this administration,
so help me God.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We shall reflect the compassion that is so much a part of your
makeup. How can we love our country and not love our countrymen,
and loving them, reach out a hand when they fall, heal them when
they are sick, and provide opportunities to make them self-sufficient
so they will be equal in fact and not just in theory?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Can we solve the problems confronting us? Well, the answer is
an unequivocal and emphatic &quot;yes.&quot; To paraphrase Winston
Churchill, I did not take the oath I have just taken with the
intention of presiding over the dissolution of the world's strongest
economy.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In the days ahead I will propose removing the roadblocks that
have slowed our economy and reduced productivity. Steps will be
taken aimed at restoring the balance between the various levels
of government. Progress may be slow--measured in inches and feet,
not miles--but we will progress. Is it time to reawaken this industrial
giant, to get government back within its means, and to lighten
our punitive tax burden. And these will be our first priorities,
and on these principles, there will be no compromise.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
On the eve of our struggle for independence a man who might have
been one of the greatest among the Founding Fathers, Dr. Joseph
Warren, President of the Massachusetts Congress, said to his fellow
Americans, &quot;Our country is in danger, but not to be despaired
of.... On you depend the fortunes of America. You are to decide
the important questions upon which rests the happiness and the
liberty of millions yet unborn. Act worthy of yourselves.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, I believe we, the Americans of today, are ready to act worthy
of ourselves, ready to do what must be done to ensure happiness
and liberty for ourselves, our children and our children's children.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And as we renew ourselves here in our own land, we will be seen
as having greater strength throughout the world. We will again
be the exemplar of freedom and a beacon of hope for those who
do not now have freedom.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
To those neighbors and allies who share our freedom, we will strengthen
our historic ties and assure them of our support and firm commitment.
We will match loyalty with loyalty. We will strive for mutually
beneficial relations. We will not use our friendship to impose
on their sovereignty, for our own sovereignty is not for sale.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
As for the enemies of freedom, those who are potential adversaries,
they will be reminded that peace is the highest aspiration of
the American people. We will negotiate for it, sacrifice for it;
we will not surrender for it--now or ever.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Our forbearance should never be misunderstood. Our reluctance
for conflict should not be misjudged as a failure of will. When
action is required to preserve our national security, we will
act. We will maintain sufficient strength to prevail if need be,
knowing that if we do so we have the best chance of never having
to use that strength.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Above all, we must realize that no arsenal, or no weapon in the
arsenals of the world, is so formidable as the will and moral
courage of free men and women. It is a weapon our adversaries
in today's world do not have. It is a weapon that we as Americans
do have. Let that be understood by those who practice terrorism
and prey upon their neighbors.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I am told that tens of thousands of prayer meetings are being
held on this day, and for that I am deeply grateful. We are a
nation under God, and I believe God intended for us to be free.
It would be fitting and good, I think, if on each Inauguration
Day in future years it should be declared a day of prayer.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This is the first time in history that this ceremony has been
held, as you have been told, on this West Front of the Capitol.
Standing here, one faces a magnificent vista, opening up on this
city's special beauty and history. At the end of this open mall
are those shrines to the giants on whose shoulders we stand.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Directly in front of me, the monument to a monumental man: George
Washington, Father of our country. A man of humility who came
to greatness reluctantly. He led America out of revolutionary
victory into infant nationhood. Off to one side, the stately memorial
to Thomas Jefferson. The Declaration of Independence flames with
his eloquence.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And then beyond the Reflecting Pool the dignified columns of the
Lincoln Memorial. Whoever would understand in his heart the meaning
of America will find it in the life of Abraham Lincoln.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Beyond those monuments to heroism is the Potomac River, and on
the far shore the sloping hills of Arlington National Cemetery
with its row on row of simple white markers bearing crosses or
Stars of David. They add up to only a tiny fraction of the price
that has been paid for our freedom.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Each one of those markers is a monument to the kinds of hero I
spoke of earlier. Their lives ended in places called Belleau Wood,
The Argonne, Omaha Beach, Salerno and halfway around the world
on Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Pork Chop Hill, the Chosin Reservoir,
and in a hundred rice paddies and jungles of a place called Vietnam.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Under one such marker lies a young man--Martin Treptow--who left
his job in a small town barber shop in 1917 to go to France with
the famed Rainbow Division. There, on the western front, he was
killed trying to carry a message between battalions under heavy
artillery fire.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We are told that on his body was found a diary. On the flyleaf
under the heading, &quot;My Pledge,&quot; he had written these
words: &quot;America must win this war. Therefore, I will work,
I will save, I will sacrifice, I will endure, I will fight cheerfully
and do my utmost, as if the issue of the whole struggle depended
on me alone.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The crisis we are facing today does not require of us the kind
of sacrifice that Martin Treptow and so many thousands of others
were called upon to make. It does require, however, our best effort,
and our willingness to believe in ourselves and to believe in
our capacity to perform great deeds; to believe that together,
with God's help, we can and will resolve the problems which now
confront us.

And, after all, why shouldn't we believe that? We are Americans.
God bless you, and thank you.

<h2>

The Strangling Vines of Regulation   
    </h2>


<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">

<P>

                
                       
     Even my most libertarian friends will admit to me in moments of weakness that there are
some government regulations they don't particularly mind.  My favorite is the one governing how
many rodent hairs or droppings can be in a jar of peanut butter.  And where would dumb sitcoms
be without a gag about the infamous prohibition against removing mattress tags?<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     The big problem with regulations is that they're the opposite of parties--more is definitely
not merrier.  And while somebody may or may not benefit from them, somebody always pays for
them.  Often enough, that somebody is all of us.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     That's the conclusion of two recently released papers from the Center for the Study of
American Business (CSAB) at Washington University in St. Louis.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     The first, by Ohio University economist Richard Vedder, finds that government
regulations cost the U.S. economy $1.3 trillion a year in lost productivity. To give you an idea of
how much that is, if you took 1.3 trillion dollar bills and stacked them on top of each other they'd
reach--well, awfully damned high.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     The second paper, by economist and CSAB Chairman Murray Weidenbaum, finds that the
companies that suffer most from regulation are medium-sized firms.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     Vedder notes in his report that regulation imposes direct costs, requiring businesses to
spend to put into effect government mandates.  But it's the indirect costs--in the form of reduced
productivity growth--that really clobber them.  Vedder says this means the economy only grows
at a rate of one percent per year, instead of the two percent it should.  If regulatory activity
remained at 1963 levels, the 1993 U.S. Gross Domestic Product would have been about $7.6
trillion.  Instead it was only $6.3 trillion.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     That means lost jobs, jobs that never get created, and lower wages.  It means a drag on
the stock market so that mutual fund you're counting on to support you in geezerhood won't be
nearly as big as it would otherwise.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     Vedder says environmental regulations make up the lion's share of the costs, but he hasn't
done a breakdown to see exactly how much it is.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     "I will concede there could be benefits," to some regulations, Vedder told me.  Maybe
from lots of regulations.  "But the problem is we've abandoned the principle of moderation. 
There's diminishing returns with regulations as with anything."
     For example, he says, "The first billion spent on particulate matter [a cause of air
pollution] probably eliminates a lot, but maybe the tenth or 20th or 50 billionth reduces the
pollution by very small amounts.  The cost-benefit ratio turns negative at some point.  I would
suggest those severely diminishing returns had already set in probably over a generation ago and
we've been paying the price ever since."<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     The point of Weidenbaum's study is that it's the nation's medium-sized businesses--not
the big multinationals like AT&T and IBM or the mom & pop operations that people are always
so concerned about--that bear the brunt of this regulatory onslaught.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     That's because the medium-sized firms fill out pretty much the same forms and meet the
same requirements as the big boys.  But the big boys have a lot more sales to show for their
troubles.  In fact, the costs of complying with regulations for companies with 20 to 499
employees averages over $5,000 per worker, says Weidenbaum, compared to just under $3,000
for companies with more than 500 employees.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     As for the little businesses, everybody feels sorry for them, so they have lots of
exemptions.  A lot of  regulations only affect companies with 50 or more people.
     But don't think these companies don't suffer, too.  What happens if they're at 49
employees--and there are probably one heck of a lot of companies with 49 employees--and just
need to expand by a couple more?  Generally speaking, they don't.  It's too much of a headache.
     The answer, as Weidenbaum stresses, is not to raise the level at which the regulations kick
in.  Make the cut-off  75 employees and you're going to find an awful lot of companies with 74.
     Rather we need to re-evaluate our regulatory system completely.  We should start with the
perverse system of incentives we give regulators.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     As it stands, if you're a environmental or health researcher and you don't discover a new
problem, you're probably not going to get your grant renewed.  So you make darned sure you
find a problem.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     Then the government regulator hears about the newly discovered problem.  He has to
implement a regulation to reduce or prevent it or he's probably not going to keep being able to
justify his job.    <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     That's how it's possible to end up spending billions more each year on regulations with no
discernible increase in benefit to safety, health, or even aesthetics.  We need to clean house.  We
must subject current as well as proposed regulations to a rigorous cost-benefit analysis, keeping in
mind that even beneficial regulations are a drag on the economy.  Just don't touch the one that
keep's Mickey Mouse's cousins out of my peanut butter.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Committee Brief #9<br>
Originally published at 6 pages on March 4, 1995

<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>

     Mr.  Chairman, members of the Committee, I applaud your decision
to hold this hearing on the October 21 "Agreed Framework" with North
Korea.  It is my belief that this committee, now under new management, has
the opportunity to provide leadership as the Congress, the Administration,
and our allies seek a path to peace on the Korean Peninsula.  This is a vital
American national security goal since our economic interests in the region
are high and since Korea is the only place where large numbers of U.S. 
troops are in harm's way. 
<P>
      Since its inception 22 years ago, The Heritage Foundation has
actively advocated American policies to promote peace and freedom on the
Korean Peninsula.  For more than twenty years I have traveled regularly to
the Republic of Korea.  Just last month, I visited Korea on what I believe
was my 43rd visit.  During that trip, I had the honor to meet again with
President Kim Young Sam and Prime Minister Lee Hong Koo.  Given the
many questions raised both in Seoul and in Washington about the Agreed
Framework, I assured President Kim that the new Congress would
extensively review the new nuclear accord with North Korea. 
<P>
           Judging by some media reports and Administration
statements, one might conclude that the North Korean crisis is over.  Many
observers were eager last year to congratulate the Administration on its
nuclear deal with North Korea, and the issue quickly faded from the front
pages.  In late January one could hear CNN reporters refer to the "nuclear
issue that has been resolved."  Just last February 14 -- a week ago -- as he
took time to criticize the National Security Revitalization Act of the
Contract With America, Defense Secretary William Perry said that the
Agreed Framework had "stopped the North Korean nuclear program in its
tracks."
<P>
          I would suggest that the Secretary was premature in his
assessment.  Even the most optimistic estimates hold that we will wait at
least a decade for the Agreed Framework to result in the dismantling of the
visible portion of North Korea's nuclear weapons facilities.  If fully
implemented, the October agreement can serve as a basis for real progress
in ending North Korea's nuclear threat.  But we must also be mindful of
North Korea's consistent strategy of attempting to drive a wedge between
the United States and South Korea, the agreement's limitations, and the
capacity of North Korea to manipulate and undermine the agreement.  The
agreement was not even four months old when, on Wednesday of last week,
the North Koreans threatened to walk away from the accord rather than
accept South Korean light-water nuclear reactors.  To put it mildly, it may
become necessary to adjust what appear to be inflated expectations of this
agreement.
<P>
          Real peace on the Korean Peninsula will depend on much
more than a bilateral "framework" between Washington and Pyongyang. 
We must remain mindful that our wider interests in Korea and Asia are
deeply affected by this agreement.  But others, such at the 43 million
citizens of our Republic of Korea ally, have even more at stake.
<P>
          How this agreement could affect our alliance with South
Korea is of fundamental importance.  This agreement cannot succeed
without Seoul's cooperation, as well as our consistent recognition of Seoul's
interests as we proceed.  Vital American security and economic interests are
at stake, as well.  We have 37,000 troops stationed in South Korea.  South
Korea is now one of Asia's most vibrant democracies and an increasingly
important global partner for the United States.  A South Korean, Dr.  Kim
Chulsu, is now a leading candidate to head the new World Trade
Organization -- a bid, incidentally, that I believe deserves American support. 
Beyond the immediate safety of our citizens and soldiers, both Washington
and Seoul know that tension reduction on the peninsula will go far to ensure
peace in Northeast Asia.  With that, Americans, Koreans, Japanese, Chinese,
and Russians will continue to profit from Northeast Asia's enormous
economic potential. 
<P>
           But still an obstacle to such a promising future is North
Korea's insular, well-armed, and hostile regime.  The December downing
of an American helicopter which strayed into North Korean airspace and the
resulting death of one serviceman and the lengthy detention of another are
but the most recent reminder that we have not achieved "peace in our time"
with Pyongyang.  The North still deploys a 1.1 million-man military against
the South, designed not for defense but for a blitzkrieg operation to conquer
its neighbor.  The 13 million people of Seoul, plus many of our troops who
are about as far away from North Korea's artillery as we are now from
Baltimore, are in a constant state of danger.  North Korea's record of
terrorism has been reviewed numerous times before this committee.  Last
year, the North's long-time dictator Kim Il Sung died, yet the new
leadership structure remains unknown.  North Korea is a country shrouded
in secrecy and well-known for unpredictability and violent acts.
<P>
          Recognizing the danger posed by North Korea's plutonium
reprocessing, the Bush Administration addressed the challenge frontally,
initiating a series of integrated policy moves which produced considerable
progress before the November 1992 elections froze these effects.  The Bush
Administration worked closely with our allies in Seoul and Tokyo, not only
to address the nuclear issue, but to advance North-South reconciliation.  Our
efforts encouraged talks between North and South Korea that resulted in two
landmark agreements on denuclearization and reconciliation in December
1991.  The former specified that both North and South Korea would possess
no nuclear weapons or plutonium reprocessing facilities and provided for
North-South mutual inspections.  The latter agreement called for sweeping
political, economic, and social confidence-building steps.  The enthusiasm
with which these agreements were greeted recalls the enthusiasm of last
October.  However, neither of the 1991 agreements has been implemented
because of North Korean intransigence. 
<P>
           It should be recalled that Pyongyang signed the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1985 but subsequently refused inspections
stipulated by the treaty.  The Bush Administration did, however, pressure
Pyongyang into allowing the first-ever inspections by the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in 1992.  Those inspections revealed that
North Korea had very likely produced significant amounts of weapons-grade
nuclear fuel.  Suspecting serious violations of the NPT, the IAEA called for
special inspections of two suspect sites in February 1993.  Pyongyang's
response the following month was to announce its intention to withdraw
from the NPT.  North-South talks also have been stalled since then.
<P>
          A slowly building crisis atmosphere ensued and led to the
Agreed Framework of last October.  To reach this agreement, however, the
Administration abandoned a bipartisan principle of U.S.  policy it had
previously accepted from the Bush Administration.  This core principle was
that there would be no improvement in U.S.-North Korean relations until
Pyongyang satisfied all of its commitments to the International Atomic
Energy Agency and to Seoul.
<P>
          For example, one might inquire what Assistant Secretary of
State Robert Gallucci meant when he said in September 1994, "I wish to
leave no ambiguity on the point that there will be no overall settlement... no
provision of light water reactors, until the question of special inspections is
settled."  As we now know, these special inspections that the IAEA has
requested for two years will not take place until elements of the light-water
reactors are in place -- a process that will take at least five more years.
<P>
          Was there an alternative to abandoning this principle of full
transparency?  I believe there was.  In June last year, my Heritage
Foundation colleague Daryl M.  Plunk issued a paper that called for a more
modest, though fair, "package deal" that would have linked reasonable
political and economic rewards to Pyongyang's full compliance with the
IAEA demands and with the 1991 North-South denuclearization agreement. 
But instead of demanding full North Korean nuclear transparency, the
Administration decided to grant the North rewards, including relaxed trade
rules, exchange of liaison offices, a half-billion dollars worth of fuel oil, and
a multi-billion-dollar nuclear power plant project well before transparency
is established.
<P>
          There are three other aspects of the Agreed Framework that
I call to the Committee's attention. 
<P>
 I wonder about the legal and political standing of an "Agreed Framework." 
It is not a treaty, and it is not an executive agreement.  What is the precise
status of what the Administration signed last October? 
<P>
 There is the issue of the October 20 letter that President Clinton sent to
"His Excellency Kim Jong Il, Supreme Leader of the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea."  In it, the President says that, in the event that this
reactor project is not completed or alternative fuel is not provided for
reasons "beyond the control of the DPRK," he will "use the full powers" of
his office to provide the reactors and fuel, "subject to the approval of the
U.S.  Congress."   If the Administration is not able to arrange for
multinational funding for the promised reactors and fuel, what is the
potential liability to the American taxpayers?
<P>
Then there is the issue of North Korea's present ability to build nuclear
weapons.  The Agreed Framework does not provide for obtaining North
Korea's previously produced weapons-grade plutonium.  Both the IAEA and
our own CIA have repeatedly said that it could provide the basis for one or
two nuclear weapons.  Other sources have placed this capability significantly
higher.  This capability may not present a broad strategic threat to the
United States, but it could pose a very potent threat to South Korea and to
the nations of the region.  It is quite possible that, while reaping generous
benefits from the agreement, the North is at this very moment building
nuclear bombs. 
<P>
      It is my assessment that Seoul, despite its public support for the
Agreed Framework, remains troubled, especially by the last point I
mentioned.  In addition, Seoul remains legitimately concerned that
Pyongyang is actively seeking to use the agreement to pressure Washington
into concessions that are aimed at isolating South Korea or at least putting
distance between Seoul and its U.S.  ally.  This is the goal of Pyongyang's
April 1994 demand that the Military Armistice Commission that manages
the 1953 Armistice Agreement be replaced by a bilateral U.S.-North Korean
peace treaty.  It is also the goal of Pyongyang's repeated refusal to accept
South Korean light-water reactors, even though Seoul will be paying most
of the bill.  I remind the committee that the Administration has assured us
in the past that the North agreed to South Korean technology.  This is yet
another instance of North Korea reneging on its promises. 
<P>
           Mr.  Chairman, the October deal was not the best deal the
United States could have achieved.  It is my hope that its defects will be
fully investigated by this committee and other committees in both houses of
the Congress. 
<P>
           I do not want to suggest, however, that the agreement be
abandoned.  We only have one President and one Secretary of State at a
time.  Instead, I would like to suggest that the Congress can take a
leadership role in strengthening the implementation of this agreement.
<P>
          A lasting peace for Korea cannot be achieved solely through
agreements between Washington and Pyongyang.  The key to lasting peace
is North-South dialogue.  The Congress can promote this by focusing on the
principal requirement for real progress on the Korean Peninsula:  North
Korea's entering into a genuine and productive dialogue with South Korea. 
Section Three of the October agreement obligates North Korea to resume
this dialogue.  But we can surely expect Pyongyang will make every effort
to avoid this requirement indefinitely.  In fact, it gives every indication that
this is its intention.
<P>
          This must not be the case.  Congress can and should speak
strongly to this part of the agreement and in that process help the
Administration restore a balance to its goals.
<P>
          To do this, Congress should pass a joint resolution expressing
its view that future funding and political support for the Agreed Framework
be heavily dependent upon steady progress in improved North-South
relations.  Easing the nuclear crisis is not enough.  American interests are
best served by more sweeping tension reduction steps.  This is the principle
embraced in a resolution that has been introduced in both the House and the
Senate (H.  Con.  Res.  19 and S.  Con.  Res.  4), and I urge this committee
to consider this important initiative.  It is important to note that this
carefully crafted bill works within the requirements of the Agreed
Framework, and does not amend it.
<P>
          Passage of this joint resolution will advance the cause of
peace in three ways:
<P>
It will put North Korea on notice that it must take real and substantial steps
to reduce tensions with South Korea.
<P>
It will send a much-needed message of support to our ally, South Korea.
<P>
It will encourage the Administration to move beyond the narrow pursuit of
non-proliferation goals to a broader agenda that advances resumption of a
productive North-South dialogue and long-overdue tension reduction.  This,
I would suggest, offers the best chance for securing an enduring peace on
the Korean Peninsula.
<P>
     In closing I would like to share with the committee what a former
senior government official of the Republic of Korea wrote me in a private
letter dated February 20 following a visit to Washington and New York:
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
     To be frank with you I was quite disturbed to find that there
     seems to be an unmistakable trend among the people in and
     out of the Administration to de-link implementation of U.S.-
     North Korea accord from the progress of North-South
     dialogue.  As you would agree, there is a great danger in this
     approach and this will be the most thorny point between
     U.S.-Korea relations for some time.
     <P>
     Certainly the resolution in the Congress urging linkage
     between the two tracks will be of great significance in
     correcting the Administration's course toward a more
     desirable direction.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<i>NEW YORK, DECEMBER 22</i>
<hr>
<h2>The Inside War</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
<P>

The sequence is roughly as follows:
<P>
1. Senator Dole makes a statement: He will not, in 1996, urge the GOP 
to endorse a constitutional amendment that would ban the practice of 
abortion. 
<P>
Buzz . . . Why is Bob doing this? He needs the right wing of his party 
to get nominated . . . No, stupid, he is thinking about the election 
now. He has already won the nomination. He is following Nixon's rule: 
Woo the Right in order to be nominated, the Left in order to be 
elected. 
<P>
2. Ralph Reed, the Executive Director of the Christian Coalition, 
fires immediately. "Senator Dole's remarks not only represent an 
uncharacteristic departure from his previous record, but a stunning 
reversal from the winning Reagan position that has sustained the 
Republican Party for 15 years and helped make it a majority party. Not 
a single pro-life incumbent of either political party lost in 1994 and 
1995. Senator Dole is also the only leading candidate who has declined 
to sign a pledge that he supports the pro-life plank in the Republican 
Party platform." 
<P>
The sentence of the court was duly executed: "The Christian Coalition 
will distribute 22 million voter guides in the presidential primaries 
next winter and spring. Those voter guides will accurately reflect 
Senator Dole's and other candidates' positions on this issue." The 
next day, the Dole campaign "clarified" its candidate's remarks.
<P>
3. Noemie Emery ("a freelance writer living in New York") writes a 
lead article for The Weekly Standard. Early in its career, The 
Standard published an eloquent editorial affirming the pro-life 
position. Miss Emery says in effect, Look. Though we rightly consider 
the fetus a human being, it is something less than that exactly, and 
under the circumstances different moral perspectives are 
understandably brought to bear on the question, and the GOP should 
drop its categorical position and settle, instead, for progressive 
restrictions, leading in the right direction. 
<P>
Irving Kristol, a few days later, in an eloquent article in the Wall 
Street Journal berating the excesses of modern secularists, then asks, 
What are the mistakes of the other side? There are several. "Whatever 
one's views on abortion, it is clear that public opinion, today and 
for the foreseeable future, will not accept its criminalization." He 
upbraids his fellow conservatives: "By permitting their passions to 
dominate the issue, by converting their commitment to a 'right to 
life' crusade rather than to policy, they have made the best the enemy 
of the good -- a common error of zealotry in politics."
<P>
4. NATIONAL REVIEW sees in the Emery article a "part of a continuing 
effort to revise the Republican platform. Last year conservatives 
William Kristol and George Weigel suggested in NATIONAL REVIEW that 
pro-lifers focus on more readily achievable objectives such as 
parental-consent laws or bans on third-trimester abortions. Pro-lifers 
could debate the prudence of this position within the context of 
shared objectives: a reduction in the number of abortions and legal 
recognition of the practice's injustice." 
<P>
But the editors make two points, one of them transcendent in 
character: "Miss Emery and Mr. Bennett would reach a different 
judgment on abortion, and the reason is plain to everyone but them: 
they evidently do not regard abortion as 'wrong' in the same sense 
that infanticide is wrong." And a most telling empirical political 
point: If the strategic design of the pro-lifers is to win the fight 
with progressive tactical strikes, they are entitled to ask, "Where is 
a comparable modesty or prudence on the other side? Where is the 
willingness, on the part of Senators Kennedy and Specter, to accept 
restraints even on a handful of abortions, such as the grisly 'partial 
birth' abortions? The fact of the matter is that Noemie Emery and 
William Bennett have no audience on the pro-choice side. The pro-
choicers will not concede even the slightest restriction on abortion, 
because any restriction implies its wrongness." 
<P>
Kremlinologists can divert themselves by reflecting that William 
Kristol was a trustee of NATIONAL REVIEW until he became the 
(founding) editor of The Standard, that he is the son of Irving 
Kristol, that William Bennett was for several years a Senior Editor of 
NATIONAL REVIEW, that Bennett -- and Kennedy! -- are both Catholics, 
that George Weigel is a theologically trained Catholic, that Ralph 
Reed and Bob Dole are Protestants, the Kristols Jewish: and, of 
course, all of them Republicans. Just one more example of hegemonic 
conservative thought.<p>

The Problem of the Fatherless Child I

The weekend paper ran a cartoon by Mike Smith of the North American 
Syndicate. In a sequence, the freckled little girl with long hair, 
reproduced eight times with eight balloons, tells us what she is 
thinking: "This is Cindy." "Cindy is 13 years old." "Which means she 
can't drink." "She can't drive." "She can't even buy cigarettes." 
"Which is all the better for the health and safety . . . of her 
daughter." 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In October, in this space, I designated the single-parent household, 
as so many others have, as the primary social problem in America. I 
meditated that since the steep rise in illegitimate births over the 
past thirty years (from 5 per cent to 18 per cent among whites; 25 to 
63 per cent among blacks) few ideas have crystallized on how to arrest 
a development that is afflicting one million children per year (they 
will in their lifetime -- mostly before they reach maturity -- run a 
600 per cent greater chance than children raised by two parents of 
life in poverty, criminal activity, addiction to drugs, illiteracy). 
The single novel idea, developed at systematic length, is that of 
Charles Murray, who in his book Losing Ground endorsed an end to 
public welfare as a disincentive to sexual promiscuity (and to sloth). 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I asked readers to share with me their own suggestions on how to deal 
with the problem. The reply was overwhelming, over eight hundred 
letters, and I take this opportunity to thank them deeply and to 
apologize for the mechanical impossibility of acknowledging them 
individually.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There is no mistaking the anger out there. It tends to focus on that 
which is most palpable: The cost imposed on the individual whose 
sexual activity is conventional, by those who proceed to produce 
children who then become, in virtue of the father's absence and 
dereliction, charges to them. One mother writes that she thinks it 
wrong, somehow, that her daughter and son-in-law are postponing a 
family until their material fortunes improve, yet find themselves 
helping to pay for the support of other mothers who do not postpone 
motherhood until after they are married.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some who complain focus on the moral dereliction of the here-today 
gone-tomorrow sire, some focus primarily on the utilitarian question: 
What to do about people who misbehave in a world in which misbehavior 
is usually not defined in a moral context. It may be legal misbehavior 
to deny an opportunity for equal treatment to a minority 18-year old, 
but it is not legal misbehavior to deny equal treatment to an infant 
born out of wedlock.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But some do focus on the quite extraordinary insouciance of the young 
generation of studs. One lawyer from South Dakota who has heard "over 
seven hundred child-support cases" sends along a transcript (the names 
of the principals are blacked out), of an illuminating example.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The situation was as follows. The young defendant is brought in to 
answer for his failure to send the required check to the mother of two 
of his children. We learn that he has sired a third child by another 
woman, and his complaint is that he simply cannot earn enough money to 
satisfy the demands being made on him, and the court simply has to 
recognize this.
<p>
REFEREE: So you're saying that you're going to hide out from the child 
support obligation?
<p>
DAD: I would if need be.<p> 
REFEREE: You know it's possible that could be a felony?
<p>
DAD: Yes, I know that.
<p>
REFEREE: You, I assume voluntarily engaged in intercourse with each of 
those women, is that much correct?
<p>
DAD: Mm-hmm.
<p>
REFEREE: And the consequence was that on at least three occasions 
these women conceived and had children?
<p>
DAD: Yeah.
<p>
REFEREE: And that certainly isn't society's fault.
<p>
DAD: I never said it was.
<p>
REFEREE: You know, society's not treating you unfairly. You weren't 
required to have any children.
<p>
DAD: Well, I don't think it's, you know, up to society to not let me 
have a living at the same time, either. . . . There's got to be a 
compromise so the State can be happy and I can be happy too.
<p> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Respondents were all but unanimous in asking the law to bear down on 
the fathers, mostly absent. Some suggest DNA tests immediately after 
birth, when more often than not the father shows up proudly, even if 
it is only for a few weeks: do a DNA on the baby and the father, to 
preserve perpetual evidence of biological responsibility. And then, 
not a few respondents ask, Why is it not criminal, the activity we 
speak of?

<title>Disability Act</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
<h2>Disability Act Cripples Small Businesses</h2> 
</center>
<hr>
<b>Michael Fumento</b>
<p>
<p>
A Harris poll shows that 90 percent of business executives surveyed support the enforcement provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).  Well, you know people who claim everything big business says is a lie?  This time they may be onto something. 
<p>
One wonders, for example, if the Coca-Cola company was polled.  Two  years ago, a Coca-Cola executive got drunk at a company party and  threatened a co-worker.  The company fired him and he sued, because  under the ADA alcoholism is a disability.  Coca-Cola claimed they didn't fire him over the "disability," but over the threatening  
behavior--there being as yet no federal protection for such people.  A  jury disagreed and handed our soft drink sot over $1 million in lost wages and $6 million in punitive damages.  He won't get it all, since the ADA limits punitive damages to $300,000 for big businesses, but it wasn't for want of trying.  
<p>
And how about Exxon, which--after a certain accident off the coast of  
Alaska--began cracking down on employees in dangerous jobs who imbibe.   
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which oversees  
enforcement of the ADA, is suing them for it. 
<p>
Yes, under the ADA, behavior which society used to condemn can now be handsomely rewarded.  
<p>
Under the ADA, which took effect in 1992, businesses with 15 or more employees are forbidden from discriminating in hiring, firing, or promotions on the basis of a disability.  In addition, businesses catering to the public such as theaters, stores, and restaurants must  make their facilities highly accessible to disabled persons in terms of getting in, using the bathroom, and getting around. 
<p>
No one yet knows how wide the definition of "disabled" will end up. It certainly is wide enough to include the obese.  But to qualify you have to be really, really fat.  If you just have a pot belly or thunder thighs you've got a lot of hard eating in front of you. 
 
Traditional disabilities are far outnumbered by this new breed.  According to the National Organization on Disability, which commissioned the business poll, there are 49 million disabled  Americans at any one time.  (And naturally it represents the wishes of  all of them.)  Of these, fewer than 2 percent are in wheelchairs. 
<p>
Of complaints filed under the ADA, as of the end of March only 7.3% had anything to do with disabilities of the extremities such as paralysis or missing limbs.  Blindness and deafness accounted for 6  percent of complaints.  Back pain, conversely, made up almost a fifth  of all cases while emotional and psychiatric impairments were 11.6  
percent. 
<p>
So much for the imagery of the Vietnam vet in a wheelchair. 
<p>
No, under the ADA, we may not all get our 15 minutes of fame, but by  golly we all get a grab at the brass ring of disability. Still, big business has learned to stop worrying and love the ADA, says the poll. 
<p>
Don't believe it.  People often tell pollsters what they think they should say rather than what they really believe.  That's why polls showed California's anti-illegal immigration Proposition 187 headed for certain defeat just days before it easily passed.  
<p>
Yet at least those were anonymous polls.  There was nothing anonymous here.  Guarantees of confidentiality notwithstanding, no CEO in his right mind would want to be listed somewhere as disapproving of an act which everybody thinks is supposed to help Stevie Wonder and Jerry's Kids. 
<p>
Had Harris polled small businesses, the response might have been more
straightforward. That's because a single lawsuit can hurt a small business so much more. 
<p>
True, under the ADA businesses with fewer than 50 employees can lose no more than $50,000 in punitive damages.  But, "the typical small business owner takes home less than $40,000 a year, so basically it means the business, the house, the car, and then some," explains Wendy Lechner of the National Federation of Independent Businesses. 
<p>
Moreover, Lechner told me, "The  litigation can cost more than the damages [settlement or award] and that is what frightens" small  businesses. For a company like Coca Cola a few hundred thousand  dollars in litigation costs doesn't amount to cola beans.  For Charlie  Chan's Chinese takeout, it means their goose could be cooked even if they win. 
<p>
The public access section of the ADA also slams small businesses particularly hard.  An article in the current issue of Reason magazine by Brian Doherty details the nightmare odyssey of a Denver restaurant owner who ended up needlessly paying over $100,000 in construction costs and fees to make his business comply.  
<p>
Fines aside, small business owners are terrified of bad publicity.  Lechner spoke of a  Tennessee woman who rented space for her business in a local mall.  A local activist group demanded she make her store more accessible to wheelchairs and she agreed but added that by contract she needed to wait until the mall owner arrived back in the country.  Not good enough.  Soon the story of this heartless
businesswoman was everywhere. "She feels she may not recover for years  because 
it was all over the papers," says Lechner. 
<p>
If our congressional representatives were to conduct an informal poll  of some of their own small-business owning constituents, they'd  probably hear something a lot different than what millionaire chief  executives told the Harris people.  They'd probably hear that the ADA needs to be scrapped--or at least severely disabled.

<title>Racial Politics Make Strange Enemies</title>

<center><h2>RACIAL POLITICS MAKE STRANGE ENEMIES </h2>
By Michael Fumento
</center>
<hr> <p>
 

Whoever said that lynch mobs are a thing of the past in this country 
hasn't seen the pack chasing Dinesh D'Souza with a rope.<p>

D'Souza is the John M. Olin fellow at the American Enterprise 
Institute (AEI) and author of the just-published book The End of 
Racism, which is the source of all the controversy.<p>

The book challenges the idea that racism is the primary cause of black 
problems, and says that the civil rights community, while once a boon 
to blacks, has become more of an albatross. D'Souza's ultimate target 
is failed liberal policies, which is why it's interesting that most of 
the early and very angry criticism of the work has come from the 
right.<p>   

Upon publication of the book, two AEI black conservative adjunct 
fellows, Glenn Loury and Robert Woodson, angrily resigned their 
positions. Loury also wrote a damning review of the book for the new 
conservative Weekly Standard.<p>

The resignations then became subject of an even more damning column by 
William Raspberry.  While not really a conservative, Raspberry has 
nonetheless shared the views of Woodson, Loury, and yes, D'Souza, that 
the liberal approach to the problems of the black community leaves 
much to be desired and that tagging all opponents as racists is 
generally counterproductive.<p>

Yet Raspberry tagged D'Souza's work as one "only racists could cheer" 
while Woodson went even further, calling D'Souza "the Mark Furhman of 
public policy."<p>

Can he really mean that? Can this be said of a writer whose book black 
conservative Thomas Sowell has called the best book on the topic in 
half a century?<p>

Would Mark Furhman have written a book former NAACP Chairman Margaret 
Bush Wilson has called "rich and provocative" or that a former 
chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said was "of  
stunning eloquence and power" with "a profound vision for transcending 
the pathology of race"?<p>

Part of the problem, no doubt, is that some people would rather attack 
a 742-page book than to bother actually reading it.<p>

Thus an article in USA Today says the book maintains "many people are 
racist for good reason." No, actually it says many people who might be 
accused of being racist are not; rather they act out of rational 
prejudice. Thus cab drivers--white, black, Hispanic, and Asian--are 
far more likely to shy away from young, black male fares because they 
know they are far more likely to be robbed and killed by them.<p>

Recall the Rev. Jesse Jackson's words about walking "down the street 
and hear[ing] footsteps and start thinking about robbery, then look 
around and see somebody white and feel relieved." <p>

Either the USA Today reporter is lying or hasn't read D'Souza's book, 
but in any case his readers will believe that D'Souza has said there 
can be a good reason for racism. Some of them repeat the charge in 
what may become a snowballing effect.<p>

Likewise, Raspberry concludes his column saying "D'Souza strives 
mightily to convince us there aren't any" racists. In fact, D'Souza 
has a whole chapter called "Bigotry in Black and White" which says 
that while the old style of racism is on the decline a new type is on 
horizon and may be on rise.<p>

As both author and book make repeatedly clear, the point isn't that 
racism is dead. Rather, D'Souza says,  "In a contemporary sense racism 
is no longer the prime obstacle raised by African-Americans or any 
other group.<p>

"If white racism ended tomorrow," D'Souza told me, "this would do 
little to improve black test scores, increase black savings rates, 
boost black rates of business formations, reduce black crime or 
strengthen black families. Those are the most serious cultural 
challenges facing black Americans, especially poor blacks. Racism is 
not the most serious challenge."<p>    

Do these sound like the ravings of a hooded skin-headed neo-Nazi Aryan 
Nation scumsucker? <p>

So why all this anger?<p>

Says D'Souza, "I think the hidden key to this thing is that I'm not 
black and that I'm discussing these things in public."<p>

That theory is certainly supported by the title of the column about 
D'Souza's book in the St. Petersburg (Florida) Times: "An Outsider's 
Arrogance." Ooh, feel the indignation!<p>

If D'Souza has been wrong about one thing it was in thinking that 
being "a person of color" would protect him from charges of messing 
with other people's business. As a native of Bombay, India, he is 
indeed a cultural and ethnic hodge-podge. He's Asian yet Caucasian 
rather than mongoloid; he's lighter than Clarence Thomas though darker 
than Whitney Houston and one hell of a lot darker than Michael 
Jackson.<p>

But black he ain't.<p>

Yet D'Souza was right in thinking that the debate over black problems 
must be open to all races and ethnic groups. It's a good thing that 
early women's rights advocates didn't have such a sectarian view. 
After all, by definition 100% of the people who gave women the right 
to vote were men.<p>

America is 88% non-black. It was white government policies that helped 
create the terrible problems so many blacks face today. Thus non-
blacks will have to play a major role in ending those problems. 
Disagree with D'Souza if you wish, but read him first. And salute one 
man with the guts to squarely confront one of our nation's most vexing 
problems.<p>

 "In California, everything is so-o-o-o touchy feeling," [sic] said 
actress and comedienne Tracey Ullman, in explaining why she was moving 
herself and her daughter back to the United Kingdom. "They are into 
this silly outcome-based education where it doesn't matter if she  
knew HOW to spell her name as long as she knew WHO she was.  And it 
didn't matter if she KNEW that two plus two was four as long as she 
had enough self-confidence to ASK how to get  to the conclusion of the 
problem.' What a crock! She was going to end up as a dumb as a 
mudflap. Had to get her out."
<p>
Europeans have long made fun of two major American products, its beer 
and its education. But we're making great progress--with our beer. 
Education, however, continues to decay, with our students routinely 
rating themselves among the highest in the world while scoring  among 
the poorest.
<p>
The latest indication came with National Assessment of  Educational 
Progress scores recently released showing that "don't know much about 
history" has gone from being the line of a song to being the American 
national anthem.  Only 11% of seniors, 14% of eighth graders and 17% 
of fourth graders are considered "proficient" in U.S. history.  
They're comparative geniuses when it comes to geography though, with 
31% of the seniors proficient.
<p>
Some defenders of the students' performance claim the questions were 
really tough. Sure, like the one that asked whether New York, 
California, Illinois, or Texas was one of the 13 original colonies.  
Thirty-two percent of fourth-graders got that right.
<p>
Of course, 200  years is a long time ago.  So another question asked 
which conflict--World War I, World War II, the Mexican-American War, 
or Vietnam--was fought to contain communism.  Even fewer fourth-
graders got that cranium-cracker.
<p>
Sadly, test scores have been in decline for decades now, and to place 
the blame entirely on anything new is somewhat unfair.  But they were 
SUPPOSED to be getting better.  Blame it on  "outcome-based 
education."
<p>
Sounds harmless, doesn't it? In fact, Ullman's summary was amazingly 
void of hyperbole. "Outcome-based education" is a stealth term.
<p>
"It was a hijacking of the idea that schools should have been made 
more accountable but it made them less," author Charles Sykes told me 
in an interview. "Some conservative reformers in the 1980s began 
saying schools should be judged on the basis of outcome instead of 
inputs. Lots of governors and legislators bought into it only later to 
find out it was holistic healing and environmental stewardship."
<p>
Sykes's newest book is a hard critique of outcome-based education 
called Dumbing Down Uur Kids: Why America's Children Feel Good About 
Themselves but Can't Read, Write, or Add.  
<p>
The book is replete with chilling "scenes from the front." Thus, 
hearing about the poor history scores is hardly shocking after reading 
that in the upscale Denver suburb of Littleton a principal freely 
admitted that it was not important for students to learn any specific 
historical fact, including the ability to define either the Holocaust 
or World War II. 
<p>
Naturally such "educators" aren't too keen on tests and grading. Many 
outcome based school districts have abolished traditional grading 
entirely, replacing it instead with such as "C" for "consistently," 
"S" for "sometimes" and "N" for "not yet."
<p>
Nationally we have seen the best indicator of the increasing dumbness 
of our children simply erased.  Last year the administrators of the 
SAT pushed up the scoring standard so that scores just above 400 would 
now be pushed up to 500. In one fell swoop, the ability to compare 
today's student scores with those of their predecessors was destroyed.
<p>
It's also now possible to get a perfect SAT score without getting all 
the answers correct.
<p>
"Recognizing they were under more scrutiny to raise academic 
standards," Sykes told me, OBE administrators "have simply decided to 
make the standards unmeasurable.  A lot of schools are abolishing them 
and others are making everyone a winner."
<p>
Thus many Colorado schools have multiple valedictorians, with Boulder 
High School producing an amazing 26. And to think poor, inner-city 
schools can only afford one.
<p>
OBE also incorporates the self-esteem movement that has been around 
for decades. In theory, since high self-esteem and doing well are 
linked, by increasing self-esteem we can increase performance.  But 
Sykes points out that they're probably putting the proverbial cart 
before the, that it's success that drives self-esteem and not the 
other way around.
<p>
The self-esteem obsession is not only a waste but probably 
detrimental, he says. "If having kids feel good is top priority, you 
will be afraid to ask too much of them. In the long run this is a 
fraud because kids eventually hit reality like a brick wall, in 
college or the work world."
<p>
But Sykes believes there will be an education revolution.
<p>
"Public opinion is pretty clear," he says. "And OBE is taking schools 
in exactly the opposite direction. Add to this that the stakes are 
higher than ever since kids need to be better educated than they used 
to be.  Old factory jobs no longer exist.  The education 
establishment's response to all this is denial, vilification of 
critics, and circling of the wagons. To me that's a description of an 
institution that's ready to collapse.
<p>
Let's just hope it happens before all our kids are dumber than 
mudflaps.

<h2>Is There a God Behind Religion?</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
<P>
Wm. F. Buckley Jr.


 

Most public discussion of religion has to do with earnest 
constitutional and political quarrels. Does the First Amendment 
prohibit the recitation of a public prayer in the public schools? The 
display of a crcche at Christmas? The display of the Ten Commandments? 
Then there are the derivative issues: Is the Christian Coalition 
dominating GOP politics? Do Pat Robertson and Ralph Reed have a 
stranglehold on the Republican Platform on the question of abortion? 
Homosexual marriages? Euthanasia?
<p>
Odd, but almost never does the discussion turn on religion itself. 
i.e., what is the excitement all about? If students heard a prayer in 
the public schools, or if religious sentiment crystallized against 
abortion, what is it all about? The public schools, for two 
generations, have proceeded without any notice taken of religion, as 
the Supreme Court has decreed. Interesting question, What about non-
public schools? Obviously one begins by excluding schools that are 
explicitly religious in orientation. One would expect that in the 
Catholic parochial schools, the Orthodox Jewish schools, the Episcopal 
schools, religion is an explicit factor. But what about others? There 
are 240 private boarding schools in America. What do they do? The 
Supreme Court isn't going to tell them what to do. They can worship 
the god Pan, if that's what the trustees decree. 
<p>
One doesn't know where to turn for an answer to that question: How 
does religion fare in the private non-denominational schools? But the 
mere inquiry provokes the curious mind to ask what is, one supposes, 
the primary question: Why?
<p>
A recent visitor remarks that attendance at her Episcopal Church has, 
in the past half-dozen years, increased by 100 per cent. Why? Is 
there, as we are here and there told, a religious "revival" in the 
offing?
<p>
Again: Why?
<p>
The anthropologists are there to tell us that it is in human nature to 
aspire for a spiritual life, even as it is in human nature to wish to 
exercise sexual appetites, and of course it is biologically necessary 
to appease hunger. The idea of the sociological set is, in effect, to 
say, There there, Mrs. Jones, we quite understand why you believe in 
God, etc., but kindly do so in a fashion that doesn't get in the way 
of public affairs, you know, like bicycle paths, or the diminishing 
supply of buffaloes. 
<p>
What surprises is the relative reticence of the religious community. 
In the United States, overwhelmingly, the Christian community. A 
politician running for office is prepared to say that he believes in 
school prayer because he insists that the Constitution does not 
prohibit school prayer. But ambient folkways prevent him from saying: 
I think Jesus Christ was divine and therefore I find the lessons He 
taught us illuminating and vital in affecting our lives.
<p>
Wow!
<p>
Does that make him an anti-Semite?
<p>
No no, Madam. He is an anti-Semite only in the sense that the patron 
of the Yankees is anti the Red Sox. Never mind the difference in the 
order of gravity, the point is that a Christian exercises his faith 
without believing that others' faiths are wrong, misled; even as, 
mutatis mutandis, the Yankee patron, always free to apostatize from 
his allegiance, nevertheless proceeds to demonstrate his loyalty. The 
Christian owes absolutely nothing more to other religions than a 
respectful toleration of them. The wonderful old saw about the inter-
religious conference in Tokyo fifty years ago is amusingly relevant. 
After the ecumenical blessing at the banquet, one participant turns to 
the pilgrim on his right. "My miserable superstition is Buddhism. What 
is your religion?"
<p>
It would be grand to hear public figures in the course of discussing 
this or that public or private question say, "Well on this matter, I 
am instructed, or try to be, by the New Testament, which, you know, 
tells us that greed is, well, you know, wrong. So is adultery. . . . I 
don't say I live up to the Christian calling, all I say is that I wish 
I did because I recognize it as truth."
<p>
There is no reason at all for the listener whose god speaks different 
tongues to object to the superordination of Christ over, say, Buddha. 
But the question before the house is: Why don't people say, more 
often, Yes, I love my country and my flag, and my God, but let me tell 
you Who my God is, and why what He has told me has for years and years 
given me comfort and fortitude and stimulated my love for -- yes, you, 
Madam. <p>

<h2>Fatheads at FDA Opposing Best Interests of Fat Americans</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><b><i> Michael Fumento</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
 
Unless you've been living in outer space or under a rock lately, 
you've noticed that our country has a serious problem with obesity. We 
are the fattest nation on earth. A recent British government report 
launched front-page headlines after it declared that if present trends 
continue 25% of British women and 18% of British men will be obese, 
meaning they are at least 20% fatter  than they should be. But in the 
United States already 35% women and 31% men are obese.  One 
contributing factor may be the faithful watchdogs of the Food and Drug 
Administration.<p>

Make no mistake, drugs are not the answer to the national problem.  
For some individuals, however, they have proven quite useful, 
especially one called dexfenfluramine. This is where our story begins.
<p>
Dexfenfluramine is no wonder drug.  Unlike the mercilessly hyped 
hormonal agent that you heard about in July, it doesn't promise that 
you can stuff your face till kingdom come and still maintain a figure 
that would put Kate Moss to shame.  On the other hand, dexfenfluramine 
works.<p>

At the September meeting, manufacturer Interneuron Pharmaceuticals 
Inc. said its drug helped 40 percent of patients in a study lose up to 
10 percent of their body weight, twice the amount lost with diet 
alone. Myriad other studies conducted over many years have shown the 
drug to be an effective weight-loss tool for those who really want and 
need it.<p>

Other studies, however, showed that when dexfenfluramine is given in 
ultra-high doses to animals, it can permanently alter their brain 
chemicals. But the level at which it causes this damage is 10 to 20 
times higher than that which humans receive.<p>

Nevertheless, in late September, an eight-member FDA panel voted 5-3 
against recommending approval of the drug for use in the United 
States. After some members left, those remaining voted 3-2 in favor of 
the drug but an FDA spokeswoman said the second vote could not be 
official and so a second meeting was ordered for November.<p>

In its caution, the FDA panel refused to weigh the slight possibility 
of harm of the drug versus the very real harm caused by obesity. It 
has been linked to heart disease, cancer, arthritis, gallbladder 
disease, gout, and a host of other nasties that includes even 
blindness.  The government estimates that 300,000 Americans will die 
prematurely from obesity this year, the second leading lifestyle-
related cause of death after cigarettes.<p>

Moreover, it's not like rats are our only guinea pigs, so to speak.  
More than a million people in more than 50 other countries are already 
using the drug. In some European countries they've had access to it 
for a decade.<p>

The refusal to approve this drug is just the latest example of the 
overweaning paternalism that characterized the FDA for many years but 
has now become quite onerous under current Commissioner David Kessler. 
It's not Kessler's fault that no new anti-obesity drug has been 
introduced in the last 22 years into this country that's splitting its 
collective seams, but it will be his fault if this amazing streak 
continues.<p>

But aren't there other drugs that can be used in the meantime? Yes, 
the second fiddle appears to be a combination of two drugs, 
phentermine and fenfluramine.  These, too, have been shown to be safe 
and effective. Like dexfenfluramine, however, they are treatments and 
not cures. The weight lost with them comes back at you like a steam 
train the day you stop taking them. But the FDA in its wisdom only 
allows doctors to prescribe them for three months.  In other words, as 
soon you get your weight down to a healthful level, as soon as you've 
glimpsed the towers of the Land of Oz, everything is taken from you.<p>

But how about those over-the-counter pills, phenylpropanolamine 
hydrochloride, mercifully shortened to "PPA." They appear to burn off 
about half a pound a week (though this amount can easily be 
overwhelmed by compensatory eating of even half a cheeseburger a day) 
but were shown much more effective when combined with caffeine.<p>

Indeed, caffeine itself has been shown repeatedly to speed up the 
metabolism and at high enough levels, especially when combined with 
ephedrine and small amounts of aspirin, to slowly induce weight loss--
again, unless the dieter ups his or her calorie intake even slightly.<p>

But amazingly, in 1991 the FDA placed caffeine on its list of 
ingredients banned from diet aids as being ineffective.<p>

What the heck is going on here? Is the FDA staffed at the highest 
levels by men who are into fat women?  Or women who are into fat men?  
Probably not.<p>

Instead, this is probably just another example of the FDA's obsessive 
paternalism and love of bureaucracy. I just happen to know about these 
abuses of authority and sanity because I happen to be writing a book 
on obesity. Were I writing a book on tennis elbow, I could probably 
rattle off for you how myriad examples of how the FDA impedes those 
seeking relief from that problem.<p>

Judith Stern of the American Obesity Association said that if the FDA 
panel recommends no on dexfenfluramine, "these doctors ought to be 
shot." That's a bit harsh.  How about we just force feed them until 
their shirt buttons pop off and they start developing that list of 
nasties that comes with obesity. A little bit of empathy never hurt 
anyone.<p>

will be published by Viking/Penguin and is scheduled for publication 
in early 1997.</i> <p>

<title>Buckley: The Problem of the Fatherless Child II -- 2/9/96</title>

<h2>
The Problem of the Fatherless Child II
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
buckley
.html">
William F. Buckley Jr.
</a>

<P>
We pursue the social problem of one million children per year born 
into fatherless homes and review some of the letters from hundreds of 
readers who wrote in to make suggestions on how to deal with a problem 
that began its steep rise approximately in 1965. And many ask, Why 
ought it not to be a crime to father a child out of wedlock?
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Indeed. It's a crime to drive when one has had too much to drink, 
though the statistical chances the driver will hurt somebody when his 
blood alcohol is 0.1 are less than that he will have hurt the child he 
sired. Two out of five black men in Washington, D.C., between the ages 
of 18 and 25 are in jail, on probation, or being prosecuted, in an 
area in which over 75 per cent of black children are born to an 
unmarried mother.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A fair question.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Several respondents remind us that there are laws against statutory 
rape. But the paradox is that if you have sex with a girl under 18 you 
can be jailed in most states, but if you have sex with a girl under 18 
who becomes pregnant, the organically required "rape" dematerializes. 
And over 30 per cent of the fatherless children are born to mothers 
under twenty.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The indignation, resentment, and scorn came in profusely, and from the 
tenor of most letters one could discern that they were not written by 
censorious temperaments. A great many wondered what has happened to 
the primary sanction against illegitimacy in the past, which has been 
shame. Shame before God, yes, but also before the community. "She has 
to feel the pain of society's anger and disapproval of her 
irresponsible, selfish act. Pain hurts, there's a recoiling reaction 
to it." "Bring back the old stocks of the Puritan times . . . 
Wrongdoers could go to work and support their families but when not at 
their places of employment spend so many hours a day on public 
exhibition."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some call for compulsory national service for the father, penal in 
character . . . Yes, deny them what most desire intensely, a driver's 
license . . . Some would make the father the legal custodian of the 
child, taking the mother for special training.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Several decry the failure of black leaders sufficiently to emphasize 
the terrible damage done by wanton sex. "If thirty years ago I were a 
Ku Klux Klan leader who would want to do major damage to blacks, I 
would invent the welfare system."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Many favor biological intervention. Norplants, vasectomies, tubal 
ligations. Many caution against the facile alternative of abortions, 
but some, including self-professed Catholics, argue that abortion 
under the circumstances is merciful . . . Why not move against the 
lubricity of the rock and roll culture, by such measures as advocated 
by Senator Dole? Or, "Establish public brothels in strategic areas 
where illegitimacy is most prevalent."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The proffered approaches depended heavily on what respondents saw as 
the primary cause of the blight. The blame is, for some, primarily 
that of the government (welfare, lax law enforcement, the improper use 
of tax revenues). For others, the culture -- the movies, TV, rap 
music, pornography, ultra-feminism, divorce. And for others the 
evanescence of the idea of -- Sin.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"There is only one solution, and you know what it is. The moral law of 
the Supreme Being." "The deterrents you outlined in your column? You 
called them the equivalent of Pentagon contingency plans to invade 
Switzerland: i.e., they're not going to happen. You're right. The sad 
fact is that the one major success the liberals have had is the 
destruction of the family during the last 30 years. What worked for 
the first 190 years in this country is no longer possible or even 
worth writing about. The family is the basic unit of our society and 
it has a cancer. And yet the components of the cancer -- illegitimacy, 
promiscuity, adultery, increased divorce, homosexuality -- are 
accepted as 'lifestyles' and even exalted. . . . "
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I reiterate my thanks to the 800 plus who wrote in. The research in 
hand will be made available to any responsible researcher or research 
organization willing to bear the cost of reproduction.

<hr>
<h2>Forbes's Rich Problem</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
<P>






Steve Forbes's campaign is revealing, challenging, and amusing. The sheer improbability, last November, that he would get anywhere tended 
to interdict any other consideration of his candidacy, yet here he is, 
running second in various states. In the debate in Iowa on Saturday 
the other candidates all consolidated as a Get Forbes posse. He 
escaped, but bruises landed, inflicted by fellow Republicans, of 
course, and, in many cases, fellow conservatives. 
<p>
He has split the conservative vote, and, accordingly, Senator Gramm 
went after him lustily. This was in part a professional obligation 
(there is no way Phil Gramm can stop Dole and share affections with 
Steve Forbes) and in part personal (Senator Gramm is smarting from 
Forbes's ads).
<p>
Forbes has of course been baiting Gramm in a television and radio 
campaign that has suffused Iowa with Forbes's agenda. His complaint is 
that Gramm's insistence on a reduction in government expenses pays 
insufficient heed to the possibilities that open up under a return to 
supply-side policies. Gramm counters that you can't have effective tax 
relief without asphyxiative government policies that would hugely 
reduce government expenditures. Without exactly saying so, Forbes 
resists this, preferring to cite the prodigality of growth when the 
yokes are removed from the taxpayers' necks. It is a nice quarrel, and 
conservatives tend to hope that both sides will win. 
<p>
Now the special vulnerabilities of Forbes on the larger political 
scene are difficult for such as Phil Gramm and Pat Buchanan and indeed 
Lamar Alexander to cope with. His company has a private airplane 
blissfully named Capitalist Tool. And his company has a gorgeous big 
yacht, which will take you around the world, if you press the right 
button. Now the Internal Revenue Service, over the years, has examined 
the expense accounts of these two amenities with ferocious attention, 
but the records absolutely establish a business purpose in maintaining 
them. The primary weight of their expense rests on the shoulders of 
the stockholders, who are the Forbes family. 
<p>
There is that, plus also the general political disability of disposing 
of great wealth. The public doesn't find this disqualifying -- FDR was 
relatively rich -- and anyway, right-wing inclinations do not go in 
lockstep with wealth. (Bill Gates voted for Clinton.) In 1958 there 
were three contenders for statewide office in New York. Averell 
Harriman was standard-bearer of the left wing of the Democratic Party; 
challenger Nelson Rockefeller was standard-bearer of the left wing of 
the Republican Party; Corliss Lamont was, pure and simple, a Communist 
fellow-traveler running on a socialist ticket. All three gentlemen 
were heirs to great fortunes. 
<p>
So that the Republican public, in a Republican primary, is not going 
to be frightened off by the documentation of Steve Forbes's wealth. It 
is a slightly different matter that he has put that wealth entirely at 
the disposal of his campaign. That understandably irritates those poor 
souls who have to spend half of every day collecting nickels and dimes 
from house to house; but there is no indication that the public is put 
off on the matter, although there may be a considerable difference 
between the cited popularity of Steve Forbes and the number of people 
who will actually turn up to vote for him. 
<p>
His primary problem has to do with the widespread belief that a flat 
tax would hurt the middle class, specifically, those who earn between 
$70,000 and $200,000. Forbes acknowledges that for the first year, 
perhaps two years, taxing families with incomes over $36,000 at 17 per 
cent, disallowing deductions, and immunizing dividend and estate 
income would mean a deficit, but one which, he vows, would soon 
disappear under the promptings of an invigorated marketplace. But of 
course the first thing done by the other candidates and their 
accomplices was to try to figure out how much less this would 
hypothetically cost Steve Forbes personally, compared with what they 
figure out he paid last year. 
<p>
The estimated saving is substantial. Forbes was justifiably inflamed 
at the preposterous suggestion that someone is going to run for 
President of the United States in order to spur on a tax reform that 
will save the new President money on his income tax. The gentle Steve 
Forbes waxed wroth on the point and retorted that he will have spent 
twenty times the hypothetical saving on his presidential campaign. A 
rather convincing point: It doesn't really make sense to spend $20 
million in a campaign in order prospectively to diminish one's tax 
payments by about $200,000. Some will remember the character in the 
Hollywood movie whom the all-powerful, manipulative gang offered 
either of two alternative posts: Commissioner of Baseball, or 
President of the United States. William Powell paused, twitched his 
moustache, then said, "Which pays more?" 
<p>
Mr. Forbes isn't playing a political part, isn't going to be 
President, but he has done an endearing thing.
<p>

<title>China is Huffing and Puffing</title>

<hr><br>

<h2>China Is Huffing And Puffing</h2><p>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"> <i><b>William F. Buckley Jr.
</center></b></i></a>
<hr><br>
We must suppose that the generals crowd around the power center in 
Peking with enticing war scenarios, as they dream of a military 
adventure against Taiwan. The Red Chinese, as one used to call them, 
have not fought a war since they took on Vietnam, a venture that ended 
in stalemate. That was twenty-odd years ago, and twenty-odd years 
before that, the Chinese army marched against the United States and 
South Korea, winning an ambiguous victory. That's a long time between 
wars, and the hunger for military action is sharp in the hearts of the 
Old Guard. They are men who stood by Mao Tse-tung during a period when 
he did more than any other man to damage China. And now the military 
sees the abandonment of Maoist ideals and, still more humiliating, an 
exactly corresponding rise in economic productivity. For that reason, 
among others, they clamor for the annexation of Taiwan.<p>

The pressure is exerted through the central figure in China, Deng 
Xiaoping, but biological decomposition is far along, and Deng must 
lean heavily on Li Peng and others. And the whole team would appear to 
speak with one voice on the matter of Taiwan. It isn't that they plan 
tomorrow to invade, but they desire that the diplomatic community 
should acknowledge, so to speak, that that is their right; they are 
dealing, after all, with a rogue province.<p>

The temperature heated almost to explosive levels when the President 
of Taiwan, Mr. Lee Teng-hui, went to Ithaca for a Cornell reunion. The 
eyes of the world were on the event because only one year earlier, 
President Lee had been denied the right to stop over in Hawaii to 
refuel his airplane. The outcry was so sharp on the Western side that 
President Clinton lifted the ban in order to permit the Cornell visit.<p>

How to handle China is a difficult question, but one shouldn't begin 
by picking a fight with Japan. Mr. Clinton pressed China in the cause 
of human rights while accomplishing nothing to further human rights, 
punctuating his Asia policy with threats to forbid the sale of 
Japanese Lexises. Peking withdrew its ambassador from Washington and 
imprisoned Harry Wu. The ambassador is coming back and Harry Wu has 
been released, but the pressure to bring this about had little to do 
with inventive U.S. diplomacy. It had to do with the congress of women 
in Peking, which China did not want to lose. After that, they covet 
the Olympics for 2004.<p>

But Taiwan does not sleep over it all. For one thing, Mr. Lee is going 
to run for a second term as president in March 1996. This will be the 
first election in which all Taiwanese participate. A free election in 
China is itself a unique event, but the Taiwanese venture especially 
galls Peking, on the quite logical grounds that Taiwan is acting like 
an independent country. Which indeed it is doing, which indeed it is. 
The historical haze that sits over the Taiwan Straits, as if Taiwan in 
an accidental moment of recent geological history had become detached 
from the mainland to float 170 miles out to sea, has become a miasma. 
Although there is fear among many Taiwanese of a mainland invasion, 
early indications are that Mr. Lee will be re-elected. He hasn't come 
out for the independence of Taiwan, but he has in recent months 
stressed that Taiwan is not receiving the kind of attention owing to 
an entity which has the most favorable balance of trade in the world 
and ranks tenth in economic power.<p>

And then Taiwan is not a military pushover. It has weapons, including 
American F-5s. Almost as a matter of definition, an island of 21 
million people would fall, in any prolonged engagement, to an army 
recruited from one billion people. But as one Taiwanese recently 
remarked in private conversation, if it looked as if military conquest 
were actually being scheduled, Taiwan could pull the diplomatic card 
from its sleeve: Declare itself an independent country, conduct a 
plebiscite that would confirm this status, and then ask for 
recognition. This would not diminish the mainland's proprietary 
rhetoric, but all the axes of diplomacy would necessarily rotate in 
the direction of recognizing an independent state.<p>

Always there is the possibility of a new regime in Peking after the 
death of Deng. But the prospect of one that is latitudinarian on the 
Taiwan question is beyond today's horizon.<p>

<i>12/28/95</i><hr><h2>Breast Cancer Goose Chase Harms Everyone</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><i>Michael Fumento</i> </a>

</center><hr>

<P> 
Question: How many studies does it take to establish that the cause of 
an illness is not pollution?  Answer: There are never enough when the 
accusers are a combined force of feminists and environmentalists.
<p>
Since the early 1990s, women in the Northeastern U.S., especially Long 
Island, New York, have been claiming that A) they are suffering an 
extraordinary rate of breast cancer, and that B) the cause most 
assuredly lies in the hand of man.  What the specific pollutant is, 
they have been at a loss to say--pesticides in general,  chlorinated 
chemicals, power lines.  The point is that some faceless, nameless 
corporation run by insensitive (no doubt cigar-chomping) white males 
has to be at fault.
<p>
Environmentalists have willingly accommodated them in this belief.  
Not long ago the left-wing magazine Mother Jones featured a cover with 
a woman wearing a gas mask as a brassiere.
<p>
Now there has appeared the latest in a series of studies showing that 
pollution isn't the cause of these higher breast cancer rates.  And 
you know what?  No one seems to care.
<p>
This study, published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute 
(JNCI), shows that women in the Northeast are indeed more likely to 
die of breast cancer than in other regions of the country.  It also 
found the risk was almost completely due to certain risk factors which 
these women have incurred, including having children later in life and 
greater rates of alcohol use and obesity.
<p>
Other lifestyle factors not looked at could probably explain the rest.
<p>
"This [study] suggests there is nothing uniquely hazardous about 
living in the Northeast," said Joseph K. McLaughlin of the 
International Epidemiology Institute in Rockville, Maryland.
<p>
But the activists don't want to hear this. Cindy Pearson, a 
spokeswoman for the Washington-based National Women's Health Network, 
told the Boston Globe the study "doesn't set my mind at ease, and it 
doesn't make me think there aren't environmental factors at work."
<p>
The federal government's chase after pollutants as a cause of breast 
cancer can be traced back to May 1992, when Long Island women began 
demanding that federal health officials find a bad guy to blame for 
what they perceived as an  extraordinary breast cancer rate in their 
area.  "Women want to know: Why me?  Why now?  Why on Long Island?" 
said one activist.<p>

More telling were the words of Francine Kritchek, co-chair of "One in 
Nine."  "Women are tired of being told that it is because of their 
educational background, their high socio-economic status, their ethnic 
background and their age that they are prone to this illness," she 
said.  In other words, bring me somebody's--ANYBODY'S-- head on a 
platter.
<p>
At the time, four state studies had failed to find connection between 
breast cancer in the state and environmental influences such as 
pesticides.  Nevertheless, with the help of the state's Republican 
U.S. Senator, Al D'Amato, the lobbying has paid off in the form of 
several lavish studies.  The JNCI study was one of them.  And despite 
its negative findings, the NCI is moving forward with a much larger 
one investigating the possible connection between environmental 
factors and breast cancer, the Long Island Breast Cancer Study 
Project. The cost?  An incredible $7 million.
<p>
Yet in 1993 still another study found that the Long Island breast 
cancer rate wasn't extraordinary.  Using a computer database, the Long 
Island-based newspaper Newsday discovered, "The highest breast cancer 
incidence rates were in the San Francisco Bay area, suburban Boston, 
and suburban Chicago, not on Long Island.  Nassau and Suffolk (the 
counties making up Long Island) ranked right in the middle of the 
group studied."
<p>
Did this mollify the Long Island activists?  Far from it. "The fact 
that Long Island isn't alone isn't a comforting thought at all--it's 
an even more disturbing message," one told Newsday.
<p>
Get it? The original problem was that Long Island's breast cancer rate 
was so extraordinarily high. When it turned out it wasn't 
extraordinarily high it was proof of an even greater problem.  Do the 
words "no-win situation" come to mind?
<p>
All of this might be a bit humorous, were in not for a couple of 
considerations. First, this fanatical quest for corporate villains to 
blame is coming at a real human cost. What incentive does a woman have 
to reduce her lifestyle risks if she's convinced that nothing she's 
doing is contributing to her chances of breast cancer?
<p>
Second, these studies are extremely expensive and are a terrific waste 
of time for our nation's top researchers.  In general, breast cancer 
spending--like that of AIDS--is completely disproportionate to its 
incidence.
<p>
Compare breast cancer with prostate cancer. Breast cancer probably 
struck about 183,000 American women in 1995, killing 46,000. Prostate 
cancer probably afflicted about 244,000 men, killing 35,000.  Breast 
cancer survivors may lose one or both breasts, a cruel maiming but one 
fixable through plastic surgery.  More and more often the disease is 
being treated by removal of the tumor only.
<p>
Prostate surgery survivors, conversely, often face permanent impotence 
and incontinence.  But while breast cancer will receive $500 million 
from the feds, prostate cancer will get less than $80 million.  There 
are no studies looking for environmental causes of prostate cancer.
<p>
There are only so many medical researchers and funds to go around.  
It's time we start using our resources based on where they can do the 
most good.  Endless efforts to satisfy paranoid activists don't meet 
that standard.

<title>Defend America?</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
<i>NEW YORK, SEPTEMBER 19</i>
<hr>
<h2>Defend America?</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
 
Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois has introduced a measure under the title, 
Defend America Act of 1995. He is joined by Rep. Martin Hoke of Ohio 
in coming up with an idea strange to the imagination, namely that the 
defense of America depends to some extent on the freedom to act, and 
that that freedom to act was substantively forfeited in 1972 in the 
ABM Treaty.<p>

We are talking about that legendary bone of contention that allegedly 
forbids certain kinds of experiments in anti-missile technology, and 
flatly forbids deployment in more than one site. For a long time, a 
technical argument engaged legislators and diplomats as to whether 
experiments focused on the "brilliant pebble" were precluded under the 
terms of the 1972 agreement. The idea has been to arm satellites with 
slingshots, in effect, to destroy atmosphere-bound missiles. But the 
interesting question became, in the first phase, Why don't we pull 
away from the 1972 treaty? When Caspar Weinberger was secretary of 
defense under President Reagan he argued the legitimacy of 
experimentation, but Congress was not convinced, and appeasers all 
over the world argued against pulling back from any treaty the Soviet 
Union had agreed to.<p>

Mr. Reagan, though the proud author of the original insight into anti-
missile missiles (the Strategic Defense Initiative), never got around 
to serving the six-month notice required by the treaty to announce its 
rescission. Out of office, Mr. Weinberger publicly argued in favor of 
rescission, but his voice and other voices were drowned out by 
appeasers and others afraid of any initiative the Soviet Union would 
frown on.<p>

But of course now, although we have a treaty, there is a question 
whether the entity with which we entered into that arrangement still 
exists. The government of "Russia" is not the legitimate heir to the 
government of the Soviet Union, any more than the government of Lenin 
was the heir to the government of Nicholas II. Still . . . (it is 
argued) it does no particular harm to proceed as though the treaty 
were alive. The thing to do is to rescind it.<p>

Now this can hardly be interpreted as a provocative act given that the 
doctrine of Mutual Assured Destruction is no longer operative, since 
Russia and America are no longer at war against each other. But the 
Senate of the United States, on September 6, reached a "bipartisan 
compromise" on the matter of missile defense. The senators who 
produced that compromise claimed to have been guided by their concern 
for missile defense. But what they proceeded to do was to authorize 
future deployment only on behalf of America's allies, and American 
forces abroad. The important question, which has to do with research 
and deployment for continental defense, is therefore skirted, leaving 
us, in the phrase of defense strategist Frank Gaffney, in a state of 
"abject vulnerability" to nuclear attack by missiles of a rogue state.<p>

The senators who framed the great evasion of September 6 acknowledge 
all the correct things. "The threat that is posed to the national 
security of the United States by the proliferation of ballistic and 
cruise missiles is significant and growing, both quantitatively and 
qualitatively. . . . There is a danger that determined countries will 
acquire intercontinental ballistic missiles in the near future and 
with little warning by means other than indigenous development." The 
senators' research even acknowledges that "the concept of mutual 
assured destruction, which was one of the major philosophical 
rationales for the ABM Treaty, is now questionable as the basis for 
stability in a multipolar world." So? So -- do nothing. That is, 
nothing that contributes to continental defense.<p>

Congressman Hyde, with his keen eye for the quick of a question, 
acknowledges that the shadow of the 1972 treaty has the effect of 
dimming strategic and tactical visibility, and should be disposed of 
once and for all. Accordingly, the Hyde -  Hoke measure would direct 
the President to notify the Russian Federation that the United States 
intends to exercise its right under the treaty's Article XV to 
withdraw from the accord.<p>

One has to hope that an enlightened debate will ensue. There aren't 
really many questions that need answering. 1) Does rescission of the 
treaty in any conceivable way endanger Russia? (No.) 2) Can research 
and deployment help us to shore up our defenses? (Yes.) 3) Are there 
other nations that might benefit from a vigorous anti-missile program? 
(Yes. All nations that wish protection from missiles.)<p>

<title>EDUCATION REFORM, TED KENNEDY-STYLE</title>

<center><h2>Education Reform, Ted Kennedy-Style</center></h2>
<p>

<center>By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html"> Phyllis Schlafly</a> 
</center><hr><p>
<p>
Here's a multiple-choice question for you.  Will the new
conservative Republican majority in Congress 
<p>
(a) terminate federal functions for which there is no
constitutional authority, e.g., education; 
<p>
(b) reduce the size of government by abolishing agencies, e.g., the
Department of Education; 
<p>
(c) reduce the power of the Federal Government to micro-manage our
lives, e.g., stop mandating school curriculum; or 
<p>
(d) adopt a Ted Kennedy blueprint to manage individual behavior
from the schoolroom to the workplace?   
<p>
If you picked (d), you are on to the plan of the "moderate" House
Republicans to use the current momentum for education reform to put
America into the harness of National Economic Planning, a.k.a.
socialism.  Their plan is to use the school system to prepare
children, individually and collectively, only for jobs that are
designated and determined by the planners. 
<p>
One bill, sponsored by two senior Republicans, Steve Gunderson (R-
WI) and Bill Goodling (R-PA), is called "A Proposal for the
Establishment of the Department of Education and Employment." 
Riding the tide of the movement to abolish the Department of
Education, their bill would simply consolidate it with the
Department of Labor and put Robert Reich in charge.
<p>
This bill would convert public schools into "Workforce Preparation"
centers "to meet the challenges of a competitive global economy in
the 21st century."  Schoolchildren would be trained, rather than
educated, and schools would become "efficient delivery systems" to
serve the global economy.
<p>
A variation of this same goal, called the "Consolidated and
Reformed Education, Employment, and Rehabilitation Systems Act"
(H.R. 1617), known by its acronym CAREERS, was introduced on May 11
and speedily passed out of committee on June 22.  Sponsored by Rep.
Howard McKeon (R-CA), it is actually modeled on a bill introduced
earlier this year by Senator Ted Kennedy (D-MA) called the
"Workforce Development Act" (S. 180).
<p>
H.R. 1617 was designed to deceive conservatives by repealing last
year's "Schools-to-Work" Act and some other cumbersome and
redundant jobs and education programs.  However, H.R. 1617's 233
pages contain much more dangerous replacements.
<p>
Three key provisions in the Republican CAREERS bill parallel the
key provisions of Kennedy's "Workforce" bill.
<p>
The first key provision is that both bills give government the
responsibility for job placement and development through a
"Workforce Development Plan."  Kennedy's "Workforce" bill would
implement this through federal, state and local boards.  McKeon's
CAREERS bill specifies that the Governor shall submit "a strategic
state workforce development and literacy plan to provide policy
guidance with respect to workforce development progress" that meets
the requirements of the U.S. Secretaries of Education and Labor.
<p>
The second key provision of both "Workforce" and CAREERS is a labor
market information system (LMIS).  "Workforce" calls for a
"comprehensive, integrated labor market [information] system to
assure that workforce development programs are related to the
demand for particular skills in a local labor market."  CAREERS
would amend the 1933 Wagner Act to enumerate the information that
will be collected, managed and shared between the private and
public sectors.
<p>
CAREERS sets up a "comprehensive and coordinated labor market
information system" that will "project employment opportunities and
trends" based on "profiles of employers" and the "education and
training of job seekers."  The data collection system will record
how well the schoolchild did on the "performance assessments" of
the state's "goals and objectives" that are part of "Goals 2000,"
and be so thorough that even the "level of satisfaction of the
participants" will be measured and recorded.
<p>
The premise of the LMIS is the assumption that government
committees know what is best for the individual and for the
economy.  This is the structure under which the Soviets managed
their planned economy for so many decades, with Five-Year and Ten-
Year Plans that always failed.
<p>
Government economic planning is an abysmal failure worldwide, and
it's hard to think of anything that would be a bigger detriment to
future economic growth.  Can you imagine, for example, that any
government planning board would have decided in the 1980s that
workers needed to be trained for the immense computer and
communications industry that has arisen since then?
<p>
The third key provision in both Kennedy's "Workforce" bill and
McKeon's CAREERS bill is "one-stop career centers" (probably
located at public schools).  This is where the individual comes in
contact with the national economic planning system.
<p>
Based on economic projections by the different tiers of boards and
the vast collection of data on individuals, the "one-stop career
center" will train individuals for designated job slots.
<p>
The bottom line of these bills is to give the Federal Government
the power over every individual's ability to earn a living.  If we
let the government decide what jobs are "needed," what jobs young
people may be trained for, what performance and "outcome" standards
may be enforced on schoolchildren, and what certificate qualifies
them to be hired, and then track each individual's performance and
behavior in school and through the workforce on a national computer
data base, we will have lost freedom in America.

<title>Anniversary of the LifeSaver Bomb</title>

<center><h2>Anniversary of the LifeSaver Bomb</h2></center>
<p>
<p>
<hr>
By Phyllis Schlafly August 10, 1995
<p>
<p>
Ever since the Smithsonian Institution earlier this year tried to
give us all a guilty conscience about the B-29 named Enola Gay,
we've been inundated with a torrent of breastbeating about the
dropping of the atom bomb on Hiroshima.  The 50th anniversary of
August 6, 1945 is supposed to make us all hang our heads in shame.
<p>
Newsweek accompanied pages of ugly pictures with a poll reporting
that Americans now think dropping the bomb on Japan was "wrong." 
But the poll demographics tell a different story.  The senior
citizens whose lives were on the line in World War II approve of
the bombing, while the younger generations that don't remember
World War II have the luxury of sanctimonious second-guessing.
<p>
For the men who fought World War II, the atom bomb was a lifesaver
in every meaning of the word.  Dropping the bomb on Hiroshima meant
the difference between life and death to hundreds of thousands of
our best and brightest young men.
<p>
Dropping the atom bomb on Hiroshima meant that those fine young
American men could come home, grow up to live normal lives, marry
and raise families, instead of dying a tortured death 5,000 miles
away.  The lucky ones would have identifiable graves.
<p>
What the Hiroshima bomb accomplished was to preempt General George
Marshall's horrendous plan to defeat Japan:  an island-by-island
invasion at a projected cost of a half million American deaths.
<p>
The first phase, called Operation Olympic, would have sent 650,000
American servicemen starting November 1, 1945 to try to capture the
island of Kyushu.  It would have been a slaughter because the
Japanese were prepared to defend Kyushu with 540,000 troops and
5,000 kamikaze planes.
<p>
The follow-up invasion, called Operation Coronet, was scheduled to
start the drive toward Tokyo on March 1, 1946.  U.S. plans
projected an invasion force of two million men.
<p>
Marshall couldn't have had any illusions about the hideous human
cost of such an island-by-island invasion.  Iwo Jima had given us
a preview.
<p>
On February 19, 1945, 30,000 Marines landed on that little five-
mile island, and five days later planted the U.S. flag, an event
immortalized in the most famous war photograph in history.  When
the Iwo Jima battle ended a month later, the price we had paid for
raising our flag was 26,000 casualties including more than 6,800
dead (including three of the six men in the photograph).
<p>
Japanese soldiers were tough fighters.  Under orders not to be
captured alive, only 1,000 were taken prisoner while 22,000 died
defending Iwo Jima.
<p>
With those kinds of casualty figures, only a reckless disregard of
American lives could cause a U.S. leader to send American troops to
invade Japanese home islands.  But that was the Marshall plan, even
though he knew from the coded messages we had intercepted that
Japan planned to defend its home islands with 2.3 million troops,
another four million Army and Navy employees, and an armed militia
of 28 million, all sworn to fight to the death.
<p>
Admiral William D. Leahy, Truman's military adviser, predicted that
30 to 35 percent of U.S. soldiers would be killed or wounded during
the first 30 days of an invasion of Japan.  The Hiroshima bomb
saved those lives, as well as those of about 400,000 Allied
prisoners of war and civilian detainees held by the Japanese, whom
Japan had planned to execute in the event of an American invasion. 
<p>
President Harry (the buck stops here) Truman didn't have any
difficulty making the atom bomb decision, and he shouldn't have. 
He told reporters in 1947 that "I didn't have any doubts at the
time" because the decision saved 250,000 to 500,000 American lives.
<p>
"I'd do it again," Truman said in 1956.  In 1962, he added, "I knew
I'd done the right thing."
<p>
Nor did other Americans at the time have any qualms about the loss
of life in the country that had started the war with a sneak attack
on Pearl Harbor.  Newsweek, for example, cheered the fact that
"perhaps one million persons were made homeless" by our firebombing
of Tokyo.
<p>
The argument is made today that we should not have dropped the bomb
because "Japan was already seeking to surrender."  In an interview
with veteran journalist Philip Clarke in 1962, Truman answered,
"The bombs were dropped after Japan had been warned that we had
discovered the greatest explosive in the history of the world and
then we asked them to surrender.  They did not do it."
<p>
Japan didn't even surrender after the Hiroshima bomb was dropped. 
It took the second atom bomb at Nagasaki, three days later, to
induce Japan to surrender.
<p>
Instead of being haunted by the ghosts of Hiroshima, Americans
today should remember the American heroes of Iwo Jima, Guadalcanal,
Midway, and Okinawa, and rejoice that the survivors of those bloody
battles lived to come home to America instead of being killed on
the beaches of Japan.

<h2>
The Great Awakening About Jobs
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Phyllis Schlafly
</a>

<P>
When Bob Dole said in New Hampshire, "I didn't realize that jobs and trade 
and what makes America work would become a big issue in the last few days 
of this campaign," he revealed the cloistered mindset of government 
officials who have relative job security backed up by a golden parachute. 
Now, the New York Times has had a similar epiphany, reporting the same 
discovery to its readers in a five-newspaper-page article starting with 
five columns on the front page. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To most families across America, it's old news that jobs are the premier 
issue. The media only discovered it when it became a factor in the 
presidential campaign. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Times now admits that nearly three quarters of all households have had 
a close encounter with layoffs since 1980. One-third of American households 
have had a family member who lost a job, and another 40 percent know a 
relative, friend or neighbor who was laid off. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Doesn't it strike you as remarkable that the elite press is just 
discovering something that is an issue with three-fourths of American 
families? Maybe the media were just snowed by President Clinton's bragging 
in his State of the Union Message that our economy is "the healthiest it 
has been in three decades." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Actually, newspaper headlines have been spelling out the news for several 
years: 123,000 laid off by AT&T, 18,800 by Delta Airlines, 16,800 by 
Eastman Kodak, 50,000 by Sears, 20,000 by DEC. It isn't just blue-collar 
manufacturing jobs that are disappearing, it's white-collar and 
middle-management jobs, too. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In an earlier generation, most people who were laid off found jobs that 
paid roughly as well as their old jobs. That doesn't happen, now. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Prior to the New Hampshire primary, the attitude of most presidential 
wannabes, politicians, pundits had been to recite the mantras "Free trade 
is wonderful; we have to complete in a global economy; and get yourself 
retrained for a new job." It's now clear that competing in a global economy 
does not improve our quality of life in America but lowers it, and buying a 
cheaper computer can't compensate for losing your job. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The politicians have been saying that the answer to layoffs, as well as to 
the fact that the median wage in America today, adjusted for inflation, is 
nearly three percent below what it was in 1979, is "training and 
education." That's become a code word for creating more taxpayer-financed 
"job-training" programs. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But many of the victims of large layoffs are fully educated and trained. 
The majority of those laid off have at least some college education. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Lockheed, Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas have been laying off aerospace 
engineers. IBM, Compaq and Apple have been laying off systems analysts and 
software programmers. The automobile industry has been laying off skilled 
machine tool operators and automotive engineers. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Many of these men and women will never find another job in their area of 
expertise or at anywhere near their past salaries. If education and 
re-training are the answer, what should they be trained for? Half of those 
who received Ph.D.'s in mathematics last year did not find fulltime 
employment within a year of graduation. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And, if these educated workers cannot find meaningful re- employment in 
their industries, prospects are even bleaker for blue-collar workers and 
others without marketable skills. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In addition to the financial setback, there is an enormous human cost of 
layoffs when there is no prospect of a new job anything on a par with the 
old one. This includes acute humiliation in front of your loved ones and 
friends, marriage breakup, withdrawal from volunteer community service, and 
being uprooted from your home town and forced to move elsewhere. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Technological progress is the cause of many of these layoffs. Of course, we 
have to progress from horse and buggies to automobiles, from kerosine lamps 
to electric appliances, and from typewriters and carbon paper to computers 
and copy machines. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But more and more people have realized that another major cause of this 
disruption and downsizing is the incessant and orchestrated demand that 
America compete in a global economy with hundreds of millions of unemployed 
and under-employed people around the world who are willing to work for 25 
cents an hour. That's what "free trade" means, and there's nothing fair 
about it.

<h2>Republicans Want Answers From  
                          Presidential Candidates</h2> 
<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a></center>
<p><hr><P>                    
  

We can debate whether or not the media really tell us what to think, 
but they surely tell us what to think about. The 1996 presidential 
election is still almost a year away, but the media have been forcing 
us to think about it since the beginning of 1995. By the time it is 
over, it will have been nearly a two-year stretch, and we are already 
tired of it. 

Despite the persistent pressures from the perennial pollsters, 
Republican voters are a stubborn lot and a big percentage simply 
refuses to make a choice. Most presidential hopefuls are still 
clustered in single digits. 
<p>
The fact that Ronald Reagan was in single digits at this point before 
his first election doesn't dissuade the media from their demands. The 
abrupt departure from the race of Pete Wilson and then Colin Powell, 
both supposedly ten-ton gorillas, didn't pry Republican voters loose 
from the category of "undecided." 
<p>
Bob Dole's substantial lead is probably the result of, as Morton 
Kondracke has pointed out, the Republican Party's preference for 
primogeniture. As the senior pol, Dole's in line; he's been in office 
so long he deserves it, or so the thinking goes. 
<p>
But political parties aren't hereditary. Voters usually select their 
candidates on the basis of their likability, their articulation of a 
mix of views on issues that voters care about, and the vision and 
leadership they manifest. 
<p>
Most of the presidential political discussion seems to be along the 
following lines. Who wins straw polls among other politicians? Who 
raises the most money? Who has held more important government jobs? 
<p>
Maybe the voters just dont care about those factors, and thats why 
they are holding back. So what issues do the voters care about? 
<p>
What are called the sovereignty questions are the preeminent issues 
that presidential candidates should talk about because they concern 
national integrity and survival. Voters want the answers to a whole 
cluster of questions like these. 
<p>
Do you support barring President Clinton from sending American troops 
to Bosnia by cutting off all taxpayers' money? Where do you stand on 
the prospective Army court-martial of a U.S. soldier for refusing to 
wear the United Nations uniform? 
<p>
Will you stop sending American money to the UN to involve us in 
foreign wars, a practice dishonestly described as "peacekeeping"? Will 
you oppose all efforts to allow the UN to grab any kind of taxing 
power, and will you cut off all money to the World Bank if it diverts 
any of its funds to the UN? 
<p>
Will you oppose the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (as Ronald 
Reagan did) and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (promoted 
by Hillary Rodham Clinton)? 
<p>
Will you candidly admit that NAFTA has cost tens of thousands of 
American jobs and take steps to remedy the manifold injuries to 
American workers and taxpayers? Will you get us out of the World Trade 
Organization? 
<p>
What are you going to do about the Mexican bailout? Do you pledge that 
you will never again allow U.S. taxpayers' money to be used to shore 
up foreign currency? 
<p>
What is your plan to stop illegal immigration and to cut off all 
taxpayer benefits to the illegal aliens who are already in this 
country? Will you support a moratorium on legal immigration until we 
deal with the illegal immigration problem? 
<p>
Do you support making English our official language? Will you cut off 
all taxpayer support of foreign language ballots and the language 
apartheid enforced on public schoolchildren in the name of "bilingual 
education"? 
<p>
What is your stand on term limits, secret pay raises for Congressmen, 
and Congressional pensions? Will ou cut off taxpayers' handout to 
wealthy organizations such as Planned Parenthood and AARP? 
<p>
Are you going to cancel all federal regulations that impose 
affirmative action quotas or set-asides? 
<p>
Education and crime are certainly two hot-button concerns, but they 
are not primarily federal issues. Most of what the Federal Government 
is doing in those areas does not address the real problems, and some 
of what the Federal Government is doing is downright detrimental. 
<p>
It's not the job of the President to reform public schools or see that 
the children are taught how to read and write, but it would be helpful 
if presidential candidates would promise to eliminate federal control 
by abolishing the Department of Education and Goals 2000. 
<p>
Likewise, crime control is and should be primarily a state and local 
matter. But it would be helpful if the Federal Government would get 
moving with prosecutions for the killings carried out by federal 
agents at Ruby Ridge and Waco. 
<p>
Voters want their candidates to address the fact that so many 
Americans feel that government is their enemy, not their protector. 
They want candidates to address specifics such as the government's 
taking of private lands at the behest of the environmental extremists 
and proposals to allow Janet Reno to wiretap the phones of every 
American. 
<p>
Many voters are likely to remain undecided as long as the candidates 
dodge the issues they really care about. <p>

<title>Rockwell: China: Trade Yes, Aid No  -- 4/22/96

<h2> China: Trade Yes, Aid No 
</h2>



<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.</a>
<p>
What's so difficult about China? The political class seems  
intent on reviving the Cold War, but every issue before us can be  
solved by a quick reflection on the basic principles of classical  
liberalism, which happen to coincide with America's traditions as  
well as common sense. The rule with China, as with every other  
country, should be this simple: trade, not aid.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The trouble with Most Favored Nation status is that it  
conflates the two categories. It gives the recipient access to  
our markets and ours to theirs, with low tariffs both ways, which  
is as it should be. However, it also makes MFN governments  
eligible for grants, loans, and guarantees from the World Bank  
and the International Monetary Fund. Those are indirectly and  
primarily funded by U.S. taxpayers.   
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Have these grants and loans ever done any good in the long  
run? There's not a single case. Rich countries have gotten along  
without them just fine. Poor countries get strapped with debt,  
and have to accept the policy terms of the lending agencies. More  
often than not, that means Keynesian-style fiscal policy, heavy  
regulation, laborious labor laws, and tax increases. That is not  
a recipe for prosperity.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
So by all means, end aid from these agencies to China, and 
everywhere else. At the same time, there is no good reason to  
impose trade sanctions. They merely restrict the rights of  
American consumers and producers to buy and sell in the most  
favorable places. If that's France and Germany, fine. If it's  
China and Cuba, that's fine too. With the Cold War over, it's  
time to separate economic policy and foreign policy.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
That the political class is suddenly ganging up on China is  
particularly ironic. Here's a communist government that has  
liberalized its economy to a striking degree. More trade will  
push the process further, and might even ensure some measure of  
political liberalization as well.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Yet the litany of reasons why China should be considered a  
"rogue state" grows ever longer. Its government squelches civil  
liberties. It doesn't enforce U.S. property rights. It encourages  
abortion. It threatens its neighbors. Bad, bad, China.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But by those standards, the U.S. government looks pretty  
roguish too. Federal police agencies are no well-known respecters  
of human rights. As for property rights, they took quite a  
beating on April 15 this year. The U.S. government routinely  
engages in land seizures in the name swamp protection, and it  
promotes abortion with tax dollars.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Is this, to use Cold War language, the horrible practice of  
seeing a "moral equivalence" between U.S. democratic and foreign 
authoritarian ones? Not at all. As Americans, we have  
a moral obligation to concentrate on the beam in our eye, not the  
splinter in someone else's.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The biggest problem is hypocrisy. We not only trade with,  
but give massive aid to, governments around the world that  
mistreat their own people, kill innocents outside their borders,  
and refuse to recognize even rudimentary liberties. Why single  
out China?  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
China may tolerate the copying of films and compact discs.  
The question is: why should American consumers be denied access  
to goods from China because American exporters are unhappy with  
Chinese copyright laws? It is the business of U.S. exporters, not  
the U.S. government, to protect overseas profits.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
All of this flows from a simple proposition, the very basis  
of the free enterprise system: economics is the business of  
business, not government. If the U.S. government has any role, it  
is to protect life, liberty, and property here at home. Forcing  
exports on others, punishing evildoers abroad, or centrally  
planning the world trading system only invites trouble.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But isn't China threatening Taiwan, and isn't that grounds  
to wage a trade war? We only started hearing about the grave  
threat to Taiwan a few weeks before the Taiwanese ruling party  
was up for reelection. The central point in its platform is that  
China is a grave threat. Is it? If holding war games off its own  
shores is a hostile act, what about U.S. war games with Japan and  
Korea off China? Indeed, on the threatening of small countries by  
big ones, Panama, Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti, and the Dominican  
Republic might have something to say.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But let's assume China is planning an invasion of Taiwan,  
highly improbable given the relative balance of military power.  
What then? As regrettable as that might be, the U.S. cannot  
guarantee every State Department-approved border in the world.  
Let Taiwan provide for its own security, as it has amply done. It  
is not up to Americans to be taxed, or die, for foreign regimes. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The last time the West tried to force its dominion and  
products on China, the issue was opium, and it led to vast  
unrest, the overthrow of the monarchy, and the eventual communist  
takeover. That brings us to another principle derived from the  
classical-liberal tradition: we cannot fully anticipate the bad  
consequences of government intervention, so we ought to prevent  
it where we can.

<title>Why You Were Right in Calling For a Line-Item Veto - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3> WHY YOU WERE RIGHT IN CALLING FOR A LINE-ITEM VETO </h3>
By Steven Schwalm<BR>
      Congressional Analyst <br>
 <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Memo to President-elect Clinton #11<BR>
January 18, 1993<br>
<hr width=50%>
</center>
<p>
I strongly support the line-item veto, because I think it's
one of the most powerful weapons we could use in our fight
against out-of-control deficit spending.
<P>

Bill Clinton, quoted in "Just Do It," The Wall Street Journal
Editorial, February 26, 1992.<P>

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

<P>Throughout the campaign, President-elect Clinton, you called on
Congress to give the President a line-item veto, characterizing
yourself as "strongly in favor" of the power. (Associated Press wire
service stories, April 29, June 8, and June 21, 1992.) An item veto
unquestionably would aid efforts to reduce wasteful spending and cut
the deficit. Using "impoundments" (an authority, since revoked, to
refuse to spend appropriated funds) Lyndon Johnson was able to cut 6.7
percent of total federal spending in 1967. That percentage today would
amount to $98.8 billion, or nearly one-third of the federal deficit
for 1993. Your commitment to "reinventing government" offers another
compelling argument for a presidential item veto. Previous
presidentially sponsored government reform efforts frequently have
been frustrated by congressional amendments to spending bills and
other "must pass" legislation. Pressing for an item veto in the face
of congressional opposition will provide an early test of your
determination to reform government and control spending.
<P>Within days of your election victory, Democratic congressional
leaders were openly opposing your call for an item veto. (Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell, "Face the Nation," November 8, 1992.)
Yet Congress's profligate, pork barrel spending and its practice of
stuffing hundreds of provisions into omnibus, "must sign" bills
provide the best arguments for a line-item veto. House Speaker Tom
Foley has proposed a compromise, known as "enhanced rescission," which
would allow the President to propose spending cuts subject to a simple
majority vote in Congress. While enhanced rescission would be a step
in the right direction, partially restoring presidential impoundment
authority lost twenty years ago, it is not an acceptable substitute
for a full-fledged line-item veto. Rescissions are easier to defeat
than vetoes (requiring a 50 percent rather than a two-thirds
majority), they apply only to spending figures in appropriations bills
(excluding the vast majority of legislation passed), and Congress
could avoid tough votes by changing rescission ground rules. Only a
genuine line-item veto will give you the tools necessary to reduce
wasteful spending and to defend against inappropriate congressional
meddling in the management of the executive branch. 

<P>To fulfil your commitment to the line-item veto, you should take
the following actions beginning immediately:
<P>Action 1: Strongly restate your desire for a line-item veto in your
    inaugural address.
<P>Action 2: Create a task force including key members of your economic
    and legislative teams to secure adoption of a line-item
    veto constitutional amendment.
<P>
Action 3: Include a line-item veto amendment in your legislative
    package for enactment in the first 100 days of your
    Administration.
<P>
Action 4: Continue discussions with congressional leaders on enhanced
    rescission, but only as an interim step toward a
    constitutional line-item veto.
<P>
Action 5: Refuse to sign a debt limit extension unless coupled with a
    package of budget reforms, including the line-item veto.
    (See Scott A.  Hodge, "How to Get Spending Under Control,"
    Heritage Foundation Memo to President-Elect Clinton, No. 
    8, January 15, 1993 and Daniel J.  Mitchell, "An Action
    Plan to Create Jobs," Heritage Foundation Memo to
    President-Elect Clinton, No.  1, December 14, 1992.)
<P>
THE NEED FOR REFORM
<P>Governors in 43 states have a line-item veto, as you did as
Governor of Arkansas. Of present and former governors who responded to
a recent survey, 93 percent describe the item veto as a useful tool
for balancing the budget. Some 92 percent of the state executives
believe that a line-item veto would help the President restrain
federal spending. ("How Governors Think Congress Should Reform the
Budget:  Results of a Survey of U.S.  Governors and Former Governors,"
Cato Institute Policy Analysis, December 9, 1992.) An item veto works
to limit spending because executive officials, representing broader
constituencies, are often willing to oppose special interest spending
inserted in legislation by powerful lawmakers or narrow coalitions.
Even when it is not used, the threat of an item veto can increase the
executive's negotiating leverage with the legislature.

<P>While the federal Constitution does not include a line-item
veto, Presidents traditionally were recognized as possessing an
inherent power to "impound" or refuse to spend unneeded funds.
Impoundments were not even subject to congressional votes or approval.
That power was stripped by Title X of the Budget Act of 1974. This and
other reforms in the 1974 Act, many of which reduced presidential
budgetary powers, were coincident with, and arguably caused, the
emergence of the permanent, structural federal deficit. The total
deficit was only $6 billion in 1974. The smallest deficit since was
$40 billion in 1979. (Historical Tables, Budget of the United States
Government.  Figures in nominal dollars.)

<P>That the budget process needs reform seems beyond argument, and
there is a remarkable consensus among the public, governors, and both
parties' presidential candidates in favor of the line-item veto as one
element of reform. Only among Congress's Democratic leaders is there
implacable, and apparently self-interested opposition to a line-item
veto. Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell spoke out against the
line-item veto just days after the election, and declared himself only
"less opposed" to Speaker Foley's compromise proposal of enhanced
rescission. ( Transcripts of CBS's "Face the Nation," November 8,
1992.) Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert C. Byrd has
vowed emphatically that he is "opposed to any legislation that would
diminish the Congress's Constitutional role with respect to the powers
of the purse." (Eric Pianin, "Byrd Opposes Line-Item Veto Proposal,"
The Washington Post, November 18, 1992.) Even Vice President-elect Al
Gore voted against every line-item veto proposal before the Senate
during his tenure, a total of six votes between 1985 and 1992. (
Senate record vote numbers:  156, 157, 158, 99th Congress, First
Session, June 18, 1985; vote #294, 101st Congress, First Session,
November 9, 1989; vote #111, 101st Congress, Second Session, July 6,
1990; vote #33, 102nd Congress, Second Session, February 27, 1992.)
The Vice President-elect also voted against an enhanced rescission
proposal similar to that now being put forward to Speaker Foley. (

<P>
HOUSING AND URBAN PORK
<P>The story of pork-barrel politicking and management interference
at the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) offers one of
the clearest case studies of the need for a line-item veto. You have
spoken highly, Mr. Clinton, of HUD Secretary Jack Kemp's approach to
better meeting housing and other urban needs. While Kemp's ideas
received too little support within the Bush Administration, it was
Congress which directly opposed and frustrated most of Kemp's
proposals.

<P>In 1989, Congress investigated allegations of influence-peddling
involving the distribution of non-competitive grants by former
Secretary Samuel Pierce and other HUD officials. Some officials were
criminally prosecuted, and an Independent Counsel investigation of the
scandal continues. Many of the questionable grants were made through
the "Secretary's Discretionary Fund," so incoming Secretary Kemp moved
to abolish the fund and end discretionary grants throughout the
Department, making all awards on a competitive basis.

<P>Rather than agreeing to Kemp's reforms, Congress assumed control
of the scandal-ridden fund and began making grants of its own. Now
known as the "Special Purpose Grants" fund, it is exclusively at the
disposal of Members of Congress. Grants from this fund are distributed
not on the basis of demonstrated need, likely effectiveness, or other
objective standards, but according to the power and political
preferences of members on the committees that fund HUD. Since Congress
seized it in 1989, the fund has grown from $10 million to $260 million
for fiscal year 1993, ( HUD summaries of Appropriation Conference
Reports, FY 1989-93.  All budget figures are in nominal dollars unless
otherwise noted.) a 2,600 percent increase in politically tainted
pork. 

<P>Kemp called it "disgraceful for politically influential
lawmakers to insist on earmarking funds for pet projects when [he had]
been trying to rid the department of favoritism and scandals.... " (
"Kemp Lashes Out at Hill's Projects, Secretary Vows to Fight
'Disgraceful' Earmarking of HUD Funds," The Washington Post, November
27, 1989.) It is doubly disgraceful to do so after prosecuting HUD
officials for doing exactly the same thing. The real scandal at HUD is
not the former officials who are being investigated and prosecuted,
but the fact that Congress acts in precisely the same manner legally
as a matter of course.

<P>Following are a few examples from the 1993 special purpose
grants fund: (For a complete listing, see House Report 102-902
(Conference Report on VA/HUD Appropriations), Amendment No.  83, pp. 
21-31.)
<P>$3 million, in part for design and planning for a western
   frontier-Oregon Territory historical center;

<P>$2.5 million for "infrastructure demolition and repair" in
   wealthy Marin County, California;

<P>$1.2 million for "continued infrastructure development" in the
   "Hawaiian Home Lands" and $1.3 million in continued assistance
   for two sugarcane mills (These have been ongoing annual HUD
   handouts);

<P>$1 million for "neighborhood improvement in the Hilltop section
   of Davenport Iowa";

<P>$2.2 million for single room occupancy housing in Portland,
   Oregon ($25,000 per room);

<P>$1.5 million to renovate each of two country courthouses in
   Alabama;

<P>$1 million each to restore two theaters in Georgia;

<P>$250,000 for a water tower at an industrial park in Joplin,
   Missouri;

<P>$1.9 to the vacation haven of Mackinac Island, Michigan, "to
   restore historic buildings and for other municipal purposes";

<P>$1.5 million for a visitor center in western New Mexico.

<P>The list goes on and on, Mr. Clinton, for a dozen pages --
hundreds of grants worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Some may
even go for worthy projects. There is really no way for the average
taxpayer to know. In one instance, an application for funding under a
$1 million report grant labeled "Housing and other purposes" was made
for tennis courts in an upscale area. (The grant was ultimately
refused by the Federal Housing Commissioner. ( Account of the former
Executive Assistant to the Federal Housing Commissioner.))

<P>There appears to be no rational basis for funding a water tower
for one industrial park, or revitalization efforts for one downtown
area absent a broader, national program for industrial or commercial
development. There is, however, an obvious explanation for why these
projects were favored over others: all of the projects listed above
and the vast majority of special purpose grant projects are in
districts or states represented by members of the appropriations
subcommittees which fund HUD or of the parent committees. For
instance, California receives the largest share of special purpose
grants funding, $25.2 million -- not surprising, as it is the largest
state. The second largest share of funding, however, $19.25 million,
went to tiny West Virginia, home of House HUD subcommittee member Alan
Mollohan, and of line-item veto foe and Senate Appropriations
Committee Chairman Robert C. Byrd. In comparison, Arkansas, a slightly
larger state with similar economic development needs received only
$1.25 million. Toledo, represented by House HUD subcommittee member
Marcie Kaptur, received $3.5 million in grants while nearby and much
larger Detroit got only $2.9 million. Cleveland, home of senior
subcommittee member Louis Stokes is targeted for $8.5 million in
funding, far more than the larger cities of Chicago and Philadelphia.
<P>
REINVENTING GOVERNMENT -- IF YOU CAN
<P>While the irrationality and waste of distributing federal funds
in this fashion presents a compelling case for the item veto, the way
in which Congress treats executive branch policy proposals presents an
even stronger argument. Within the 1993 HUD funding bill, for
instance, are no fewer than 137 specific policy instructions,
frequently referred to as "riders," having to do with the
administration and management of HUD and other agencies. Many appear
to be so reasonable as to be unnecessary and certainly
unobjectionable. Others, however, are quite obviously petty and
counterproductive. Dozens unilaterally alter contract terms or cancel
debts owed to the federal government. In two separate places, the bill
mandates that the "Office of Lead-based Paint Abatement" be located in
the office of the Secretary and staffed and funded at a designated
level. While lead poisoning is a serious problem, having a
congressional subcommittee designate the location and staffing of a
HUD office, apparently in opposition to the judgment of HUD experts,
is hardly the best way of addressing it.

<P>Saying who gets which office is just the tip of the iceberg. Far
more important to Kemp's efforts at HUD than eliminating specific
questionable grants was an overall management reform that would allow
the department to serve the needy better and more efficiently. Largely
through restrictions in earlier appropriations bills, Congress stymied
Kemp at every pass. First, Congress divided HUD into seven components
for funding purposes, specifying spending and employment levels for
each. As a result Kemp was stopped from any significant reorganization
of his department. More alarmingly, the appropriations subcommittee
stopped Kemp from establishing a department-wide database which would
have improved financial management and reduced opportunities for
fraud. Congress also prohibited Kemp from moving employees, even
temporarily, into an organization intended to help clean up the
management mess he inherited. ( See Chapter Four in The Heritage
Foundation's book, The Ruling Class by Eric Felten (Washington, D.C.: 
Regnery Gateway, 1993).)

<P>So, faced with the task of reversing criminal mismanagement, low
morale, and inefficiency, Congress told Kemp he could not reorganize
his department, he could not computerize his records, and he could not
assemble a team of agency employees to improve departmental
management. Unfortunately, Congress is likely to be no less willing to
block Clinton Administration reorganization efforts than it has been
to oppose the line-item veto proposal. A President lacking a line-item
veto who objects to a few of the hundreds of management and statutory
restrictions routinely included in appropriations bills has the
choice, in the case of HUD, of holding up funding for the entire
Veterans Administration, NASA, HUD, and several other agencies, or
swallowing hard and accepting the restrictions. This process will be
crippling to any effort to reinvent government by reforming operations
and changing employee incentives. Please note, Mr. President-elect,
that no version of enhanced rescission authority would allow you to
challenge a single one of these hundreds of policy and management
restrictions.
<P>
MORE PORK AND MORE MICROMANAGEMENT AT DEFENSE

<P>Pork-laden appropriations bills, unfortunately, are the rule
rather than the exception. The Department of Defense (DoD)
appropriations contains hundreds of millions worth of pork-barrel line
items, including:

<P>$100 million for a fisheries grant program;
 <BR>$7 million to clean up "the National Presto Industries Eau
   Claire Facility";
<BR>$10 million for a "National Guard Outreach Program in the Los
   Angeles Schools District";
<BR>$5 million for electric vehicle projects in Hawaii and
   Sacramento, California;
<BR>A laundry list of 21 grants to specified universities in amounts
   ranging from $500,000 to $15 million;
<BR>Report instructions to retain indefinitely the same number of
   podiatrists as were on active duty in 1990, despite significant
   cuts in overall personnel levels.

<P>Also like HUD, Congress uses the "must sign" appropriations bill
as an opportunity to force hundreds of programmatic, management, and
statutory instructions -- 244 in the case of the 1993 appropriation --
essentially unrelated to funding levels on the Defense Department.
Secretary-designate Les Aspin's most serious obstacle in reforming the
department will be his former colleagues on Capitol Hill. Without a
line-item veto, the hundreds of strings represented by these
appropriations "riders" will be woven into a straightjacket for
departmental management. 

<P>Congress was not always so active in dictating executive branch
management decisions. Most of those 244 defense dictates were
contained in 168 "general provisions" appended to the appropriation.
There were only 64 such instructions in 1970. Requirements for DoD
reports to Congress, another method of congressional control, grew
even more dramatically, from only 36 in 1970 to 861 in 1990, an
increase of 2,400 percent. ("White Paper on the Department of Defense
and the Congress," Report to the President by the Secretary of
Defense, January 1990.) Secretary Dick Cheney dramatically presented
mountainous piles of these reports, calling for a reduction early in
his tenure to little avail. 
<P>
Shouldn't Congress Have Its Way?
 
<P>Opponents of the line-item veto, and of enhanced rescission,
cite the congressional power of the purse. The problem with this
argument is that many troublesome pork and micromanagement provisions
would not survive open votes in the House and Senate as part of the
actual legislation. In order to enhance their power to make funding
and management decisions, congressional committees have come up with
procedures to either avoid open debate or to skirt the legislative
process in an extra-constitutional fashion.

<P>To circumvent obstacles inherent in the legislative process,
such as recorded votes, Congress often includes pork "earmarks" in
committee or conference reports. Reports are documents intended to
explain legislation and give guidance in carrying out provisions of
the law. These reports are written by staffers, often unsupervised by
elected representatives. Furthermore, they cannot be voted on or
amended by the full House or Senate. Congress insists, however, that
executive agencies give these reports the force of law, going so far
as to instruct agencies to comply with the reports through provisions
in the actual appropriations legislation.

<P>Another opportunity for unaccountable and unreviewable
legislation occurs in the conference committees which meet to iron out
differences between House and Senate versions of a bill. Only a few
Members, drawn almost exclusively from the committees that originated
the legislation, are appointed as conferees. In practice the members
of a conference committee have wide latitude to change the legislation
as they see fit, and they frequently make significant, politically
sensitive changes in legislation or add pork. Some of those changes
amount to congressional voting fraud, by removing nearly identical
provisions approved by both houses of Congress. Because the conference
takes place after the legislation is through the amending process, and
takes place in closed meetings rather than on the House and Senate
floors, all manner of objectionable provisions can be added in secret,
without votes. And when the conferees are finished, there is rarely
enough time to review the often massive bills before they are voted on
a final time. The conferees' staff then put together yet another
"report," adding additional pork and micromanagerial instructions for
the executive branch. (See the "Sleight of Hand" and "Legislating
Backwards" chapters of The Heritage Foundation's book, The Ruling
Class by Eric Felten (Washington, D.C.:  Regnery Gateway, 1993).) 

<P>This entire process, and the committee and conference reports in
particular, amount to the enactment of laws outside the constitutional
legislative process. It is the congressional insistence on
shortcutting constitutional and democratic principles, often cloaked
in a claim of congressional prerogatives, that makes an alteration in
constitutional arrangements, such as the line-item veto, essential.
The President needs a line-item veto to combat Congress's extra-
constitutional power grabs.
<P>
ENHANCED RESCISSION: IT WON'T CUT IT

<P>The enhanced rescission proposal that Speaker Foley has offered
as a compromise has several weaknesses and loopholes that make it
unacceptable as a substitute for a genuine line-item veto. Most
notably, a simple majority of either House of Congress could defeat a
rescission, as opposed to a two-thirds majority in both houses
required to override a veto. (In comparison, Congress did not have a
say at all in impoundment decisions prior to 1974.) The Foley proposal
is apparently based on H.R. 2164, which was introduced in the last
Congress by Democratic Representative Tom Carper (now Governor of
Delaware), and which passed the House on a 312-97 vote on October 3,
1992. That bill would have allowed the President to send a rescission
proposal to Congress within three days of enactment of an
appropriation act. Special procedures seek to guarantee a rapid vote
on the President's proposal without amendments.

<P>President Bush's experience with a similar provision already
included in the 1974 budget act may be instructive. In April 1992 Bush
sent four separate rescission packages to Congress under a procedure
which purportedly allowed a straight up or down vote on each proposal.
Instead the House and Senate Appropriations Committees reported
packages combining the separate rescission proposals, accepting some
of the President's cuts, and replacing others with congressional
preferences. The House concocted its own version of the President's
original proposals, somewhat different than what the President
actually sent, claiming that allowing a vote on the one combined
package met the requirement for separate consideration of the four
presidential proposals. The Senate Appropriations Committee simply
reported the President's proposals to the floor and then ignored them
in preference to its own combined package.

<P>More revealing than the procedural shenanigans were the comments
of Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Byrd in reaction to the
President's exercise of powers that Congress had explicitly granted.
"It might be the better part of wisdom not to push this thing," Byrd
noted, warning that "the farther down the road it gets the meaner it's
going to get. And its not going to do the president any good, and its
not going to do this institution any good." (Quoted in Congressional
Quarterly, "Congress Tries to Outdo Bush in Anti-Pork Campaign," by
George Hager, May 2, 1992, pp.  1148-1150.)

<P>While H.R. 2164 had several provisions which seek to prevent the
type of procedural gamesmanship which surrounded the Bush request,
those provisions are applied only as part of House and Senate rules.
Those rules can be changed by the House or Senate alone at any time,
and despite disclaimers to the contrary, they can also be ignored or
temporarily overridden at any time. Even if Congress felt compelled to
play by the rules it had set, it might effectively amend a President's
rescission package by reporting a similar but separate bill, defeating
the President's proposal and passing its own alternative.

<P>Even absent procedural curveballs, the proposed enhanced
rescission authority is very limited. It applies only to spending
amounts in appropriations bills. Changes in entitlement or tax law,
conceivably costing billions, would be off limits, as would pork
provisions in authorizing legislation. The President could offer only
one package, lumping together separate objections in one bill, and
that only immediately after the bill is signed. In this respect
enhanced rescission is far weaker than the impoundment authority which
was stripped from the President in 1974: under it, cuts could be made
separately and at any point during a fiscal year, when it might become
evident that funding initially approved was unnecessary.

<P>The greatest deficiency of the enhanced rescission approach is
that it does not reach the critical policy and managerial provisions
in appropriations bills, much less in other legislation. For an
Administration in which reforming government may be as critical as,
and even a precondition to, cutting spending, this failure is
critical. While an enhanced rescission proposal would be a step in the
right direction for spending control, it is no substitute for a line-
item veto.
<P>
CONCLUSION

<P>Mr. Clinton, your support for a presidential line-item veto was
an important element of your appeal as a fiscally responsible New
Democrat. Securing that power in office is even more critical to your
success in reducing deficit spending, and to reforming operations of
the executive branch. As long as Congress is second-guessing the
smallest decisions of your appointees, your attempt at "putting people
first" will be reduced to bureaucratic business as usual in short
order. Despite opposition among key Democrats in Congress, you must
persist in your commitment to a line-item veto. Aside from the
intrinsic merits, standing up to Washington insiders will be an
outstanding public demonstration of your determination to break with
the special interest politics of the past. While the ratification
process for a constitutional amendment would delay implementation of
the line-item veto power, the ratification process would provide a
marvelous opportunity for your Administration to take its case for
reform to the American public.

<P>Your opportunity to push this reform is now. The longer you
wait, the freer Congress will feel to resist your proposals. In
addition, several specific requirements of the budget calendar provide
irreplaceable opportunities to push a line-item veto this spring.
Securing a line-item veto will require a vigorous action plan
beginning on Inauguration Day. Key elements of this plan should
include: 
<P>
Action 1:   Strongly restate your desire for a line-item veto in
      your inaugural address. 
<P>
   Lack of a firm response in the face of outspoken congressional
opposition could lead to a public peception that you are abandoning
campaign commitments under pressure from Washington insiders.
<P>
Action 2:   Create a line-iem veto task force composed of key
      members of your economic and legislative affairs teams
      to come up with an action plan for congressional
      approval of a line-item veto constitutional amendment
      within the first 100 days of the Administration. 

<P>Creation of a specific task force is critical, as you must
communicate to your own economic and legislative advisors, many of
whom are from Washington, the importance of the line-item veto in your
efforts to control deficit spending, reinvent government, and keep
your commitments to the American people. Resistance or tepid support
from within your own Administration will be as damaging to your
efforts to secure a line-item veto as congressional opposition.
<P>
Action 3: Include a line-item veto constitutional amendment in the
    legislative program submitted to Congress for enactment
    during the first 100 days of your Administration.

<P>Failure to push the proposal immediately will allow public
support to dissipate and allow opponents to organize opposition.
<P>
Action 4: Continue discussions with congressional leaders on enhanced
    rescission authority only as an interim measure which may
    be useful during the amendment ratification process.

<P>In order to restrain government spending most effectively and to
protect your ability to reform and reorganize the government, a
constitutional amendment providing a line-item veto for all
legislation is essential. Enhanced rescission measures, limited to
appropriation figures only, exclude entitlements and (in most cases)
tax measures, which are key to deficit reduction. Neither would
enhanced rescission allow you to address the hundreds of policy and
management restrictions routinely added to appropriations and other
legislation.
<P>
Action 5: Propose a package of budget reforms, including the line-
    item veto, to be enacted as a part of the debt limit
    extension that must be enacted in March.

<P>You should announce publicly that you will not sign a debt-limit
extension made necessary by decisions of previous Administrations and
Congresses unless the extension is accompanied by acceptable budget
reforms. Promises for votes on reforms at a later date are
unacceptable. Both versions of Gramm-Rudman were enacted as a part of
debt limit increases. Forwarding your own package will head off
inevitable congressional demands to again revise budget procedures.)

<P>During the campaign, you declared "I'm a Democrat who believes
in the line-item veto and believes in cutting out wasteful government
spending." Members of Congress have promised real reforms. Now you and
Congress have an opportunity to make good on reform promises with
enactment of a line-item veto.

<title>Taxpayers Subsidize AARP -- Heritage </title>

<center><h2>TAXPAYERS SUBSIDIZE AARP</h2><br>
<b>Senior Citizens Group Receives $86 Million from Uncle Sam</b><br>

Senior Fellow in Congressional Affairs<br>
<p>
Charles P. Griffin<br>
Deputy House Liaison</center><br>
<p>

The $86 million that the American Association of Retired Persons acknowledged receiving in federal funding for 1993 through various grant programs represents approximately one-quarter of its annual expenditures. AARP's sources of funding range from programs for the elderly to millions of dollars annually to provide clerical support to the EPA. Many senior citizens groups receive almost all of their federal funding in one lump sum payment from the Senior Community Service Employment Program, but AARP also benefits from numerous smaller grants.
<p>
Following is a brief breakdown of most of AARP's federal funding from July 1993 to June 1994. Reference numbers are those contained in the <i>Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance</i>:
<p><ul>
<li>The largest single source of AARP funding is the Department of Labor/Employment Training Administration's Senior Community Service Employment Program. This one account provides about $49 million per year to AARP's bank account. More than $300 million of the $400 million appropriated for Program Year 1994 went to nine seniors organizations and the Forest Service, with the remainder going to the states. [17.235]
<p>
<li>AARP is a major beneficiary of the EPA's Senior Environmental Employment Program. The annual appropriation is $45 million, from which approximately 265 grants are made. AARP appears to receive approximately $20 million from this program. The AARP provides support to almost every regional office of the EPA, as well as to most divisions within the Washington headquarters. [66.508]
<p>
<li>AARP receives approximately $4.6 million per year under the Treasury Department/Internal Revenue Service's Tax Counseling for the Elderly Program. This represents the lion's share of the grant's annual appropriation. [21.006]
<p>
<li>AARP receives $75,000 per year from the Centers for Disease Control to develop "comprehensive breast and cervical cancer early detection programs."  The grant requirements in the <i>Catalog </i>state this money is available only to "official State health agencies of the United States" and its territories. Other groups funded in this manner include the National Education Association, the American Federation of Teachers, and the American Nurses Association (ANA). [93.919]

<TITLE>The North American Free Trade Agreement: Ronald Reagan's Vision Realized -- Heritage </TITLE>


<CENTER><H3><I>THE NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT:RONALD REAGAN'S VISION REALIZED</I></H3>
<P>
By Michael G. Wilson<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum #371<BR>
November 23, 1993<P>
</CENTER><HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>

     The approval by the Congress of the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) is a victory of engagement and competition over
withdrawal and complacency. The trade pact, which will eliminate
tariffs on goods and services between the United States, Canada, and
Mexico over a fifteen-year time span, will create the world's largest
market: some 360 million people, with an economic output of more than
$6 trillion a year. The NAFTA thus guarantees that American workers
will remain the most competitive in the world and that American
consumers will continue to have access to the world's finest goods and
services.
<P>
     The North American free trade area that the agreement creates
will produce 25 percent more goods and services than the European
Community, giving North America enough economic muscle to challenge
the emerging unified market in Europe and an East Asia market
dominated by Japan. The NAFTA also will offer Americans cheaper goods,
and increase U.S. exports by making them more affordable for the rest
of the world. Moreover, it will create an estimated 200,000 new jobs
for Americans, reduce illegal immigration from Mexico, help tackle
drug trafficking, strengthen Mexican democracy and human rights, and
serve as a model for the rest of the world.
<P>
     President Clinton has correctly described the agreement as "just
a first step," stressing that he will reach out to other Latin
American countries in an effort to spread free trade throughout the
hemisphere. In so doing, he will move even closer to the conservative
vision of a hemisphere-wide free trade area.
<P>
     Long-Standing Support for Free Trade with Mexico. Ronald Reagan
first proposed a free trade agreement between the U.S. and Mexico in
his 1980 presidential campaign. Since that time, The Heritage
Foundation is proud of the role it has played in articulating
President Reagan's vision of free trade in Latin America and around
the world. Since the mid-1980s, Heritage analysts have been stressing
that a free trade agreement with Mexico not only will stimulate
economic growth in the U.S., but will make Mexico a more stable and
prosperous country. Heritage has published over three dozen studies
stressing the benefits of free trade in North America. 
<P>
     The Foundation also has highlighted the Mexican success story.
Under the leadership of Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari,
Mexico has moved further and faster than practically any other country
in the world in promoting free market reforms and free trade. The
approval of the NAFTA by the Congress is a recognition of these
historic advances and will help ensure that the momentum in favor of
economic and political liberty throughout the Americas is maintained.
<P>
     In June 1986, then-Heritage analyst Edward L. Hudgins wrote "A
U.S. Strategy to Solve Mexico's Debt Crisis." In that Backgrounder,
Hudgins urged the Reagan Administration to "explore further special
free trade and investment arrangements" with Mexico. Said Hudgins:
"The possibility of a complete free trade and investment zone [between
the U.S. and Mexico] should be explored. Ultimately, a complete Free
Trade Area between the U.S. and Mexico should be sought, similar to
the U.S.-Canada pact [then] being negotiated." 
<P>
     Four years later, Heritage analyst Michael Wilson argued in an
Executive Memorandum entitled "Bush and Salinas Should Launch Free
Trade Talks Between the U.S. and Mexico": "What were once distant
neighbors now appear to be developing into economic and geopolitical
partners. George Bush should strengthen this cooperative relationship
not only by supporting Salinas's economic reforms, but by moving
quickly to negotiate a free trade agreement with Mexico."
<P>
     The Politics of Fear vs. the Politics of Hope. The approval of
the NAFTA not only represents a victory for the U.S. economy and the
American people, it also deals a blow to organized labor and other
protectionist forces. The agreement reaffirms the American commitment
to competition and free enterprise that other nations emulate.
<P>
     By supporting the NAFTA, the Clinton Administration and a
majority of Congress wisely rejected calls for a return to the same
protectionist policies, demonstrated by the Smoot-Hawley tariff laws,
which helped create the Great Depression. Many of these protectionist
calls were from labor unions concerned that the NAFTA would cost U.S.
jobs in older industries. Despite such concerns, though, labor will
see that, as consumers in a growing economy, they too are better off
when nations are free to trade with one another and workers are
exposed to the rigors of international competition.
<P>
     Looking to the Future. President Clinton should ride the free
trade momentum that conservatives have given him and reaffirm his
support for free trade agreements with other Latin American countries,
namely Chile, Argentina, and Venezuela. He has wisely voiced his
support for George Bush's vision of an Enterprise for the Americas,
which seeks to create a free trade area stretching from Alaska to
Antarctica. Latin America is the fastest growing market for the U.S.
and the only region where America enjoys a trade surplus. Every Latin
American leader, from Carlos Menem in Argentina to Patricio Aylwin in
Chile, has voiced support for free trade with the U.S. The Clinton
Administration should begin negotiating free trade agreements with
them.
<P>
     President Clinton should also extend the offer of free trade to
America's partners in Europe and Asia. A successful conclusion of the
Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in
December would be a welcome first step in that direction, as would the
President's disavowal of "managed trade" ideas in the wake of the
meeting of Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders last week
in Seattle. 
<P>
     The NAFTA win is a great victory for free trade conservatives. It
was they who first championed the notion of free trade with Mexico.
And it is they who will carry the banner of free trade in the future
-- a banner under which even Bill Clinton now marches.

<title>THE LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION SHOULD BE ABOLISHED</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>

<hr>
<center></h2><b>The Legal Services Corporation Should be Abolished</b></h2></center>



By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html"> Phyllis Schlafly</a>
</center><hr>
<p>
<p>
The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) is the acid test to
demonstrate whether or not the new Republican majority really
intends to reform and reduce Big Government.  If the Republicans
merely play around with smoke and mirrors, pretending to correct
abuses, but leave the money faucet turned on, they will have
betrayed their mandate from the 1994 election and left their
enemies with a gun pointed at their head.
<p>
Budget leader Rep. John Kasich (R-OH) has scheduled LSC for
termination, except for some shut-down expenses.  Sen. Phil
Gramm (R-TX) is trying to get the Senate to agree. 
Unfortunately, Rep. Bill McCollum (R-FL) is working with the
Democrats to reauthorize (i.e., to save) LSC under the euphemism
of "reform."
<p>
The ideological incompatibility of the LSC with the new
Republican regime is indicated by the fact that Hillary Rodham
Clinton used to be its chairman of the board.  LSC has continued
to be peopled with leftist activists who share her class-warfare
ideology and socialist goals.  The record of LSC shows that it
functions not to provide services to the needy, but to serve as
a pot of gold for leftwing activists to litigate and lobby for
radical causes.
<p>
LSC has spent $5 billion since 1974.  If the leftwing lawyers
had merely torched the money, that wouldn't have been nearly as
destructive as spending the money the way they did.
<p>
In fact, they spent the money to litigate and lobby to increase
entitlements (for welfare, aliens, criminals, etc.) that are the
chief cause of federal deficits.  Howard Phillips, who has been
monitoring LSC since 1970 when President Nixon appointed him to
a position that included that responsibility, asserts that LSC
activism has added $2 trillion to the national debt.
<p>
The LSC lawyers have constructed for themselves such a
Byzantine, self-perpetuating infrastructure and grant-making
mechanism that they are accountable to no one:  not to Congress,
or to the Administration, or to the people they serve, or to the
taxpayers who foot the bills.
<p>
When most people think of legal aid services for the poor, they
think of helping victims, especially women and children. 
Instead, LSC works for such causes as preventing the eviction of
drug dealers from public housing, shielding violent offenders'
criminal records from the public, getting perks for prison
inmates, and releasing mental patients (who often then join the
ranks of the homeless).
<p>
When LSC lawyers talk about conducting "research" and
facilitating "training," they are using euphemisms for political
organizing and lobbying for pro-abortion, pro-gay rights,
pro-welfare entitlement, pro-criminal, pro-drug, and pro-illegal
alien causes.
<p>
LSC's litigation deserves a large share of the blame for the
out-of-control, failed welfare crisis we have today.  LSC
initiated the case, King v. Smith, in which the
Supreme Court ruled in 1968 that the behavior of welfare
mothers, including cohabiting with wage-earning males, could not
be considered when determining eligibility for benefits.
<p>
In Shapiro v. Thompson in 1969, LSC got the Supreme Court to ban
the one-year residency requirement for welfare eligibility.  In
1970, in Goldberg v. Kelly, LSC persuaded the
Supreme Court to require a hearing process before benefits can
be cut off for any reason.  As a result, hardly anyone is ever
cut off.
<p>
The theory behind these cases, invented by LSC tax-funded
lawyers, is that welfare recipients have a property right in
their benefits, just like the rest of us have a property right
in our houses or automobiles.  This off-the-wall rationale has
become the cornerstone of the welfare rights movement, which has
changed our laws and picked the pockets of taxpayers.
<p>
Another favorite LSC constituency is incarcerated convicted
felons.  LSC's class action suit against the North Carolina
prison system resulted in a requirement that each of 13 prisons
provide softball and basketball equipment for two teams, a
piano, a set of drums, three guitars, and five frisbees. 
Another LSC victory was to establish Chicago prisoners' rights
to cable television and expensive weight rooms.
<p>
Other exotic LSC lawsuits included representing transsexuals in
an effort to overturn Georgia's prohibition on Medicaid
reimbursement for sex change operations, forcing public housing
officials to rent apartments to unemancipated minors, and trying
to define opium and alcohol addiction as a disability under the
Americans with Disabilities Act.
<p>
LSC's current president, Alexander Forger (best known as
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis's lawyer), was questioned in April by
a Congressional committee about the imposition of certain
limitations on the way LSC funds are spent.  He impudently
replied:  "There is a legal case, if we choose to assert it,
that the [House] Committee does not have the authority to make
that decision."
<p>
Radical leftwing activism is part and parcel of LSC.  It is a
fraud on the public to pretend it can be reformed.  It must be
abolished.

<h2>America Has No Business In Bosnia </h2> 

<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a></center>

<p><hr><P> 
                      
  
 
So President Clinton wants to send 20,000 American soldiers to Bosnia. 
The man who ducked out of serving in the Vietnam War now says it's our 
duty to send other men's sons to fight a foreign war. 
<P>
Clinton says he has already committed 20,000 troops and now an 
unsuspecting nation is told we must go along because "he gave his 
word." But Clinton made that rash and casual promise on his own; the 
rest of us are not a party to the deal. And since when is "his word" 
inviolate? 
<P>
Clinton is trying to tell Americans that going to Bosnia is our moral 
duty. But he is no oracle of moral law. We didn't start the war, it 
isn't our obligation to stop it, and foreign policy should not be used 
for social work. 
<P>
Unable to show any vital national interest, the Clinton spin salesmen 
have instructed all Administration spokesmen to say that troops are 
needed in Bosnia to protect our "values," although they never say what 
values they are talking about. The word has no meaning in relation to 
the Bosnia decision; its use is just a cheap attempt to paper over the 
Administration's lack of any reasonable argument. 
<P>
Clinton says we must assert American leadership in the world. But the 
kind of leadership America should assert is political leadership in 
showing the superiority of freedom over totalitarianism, and economic 
leadership in demonstrating the superiority of the free market over 
socialism and government planning. 
<P>
Clinton asserts that it is his prerogative as Commander-in-Chief to 
send troops to Bosnia. But his constitutional authority to dispatch 
troops is only for the purpose of defending Americans or vital 
American interests, not to rush out and join a war that is none of our 
business. Only Congress has the constitutional power to go to war. 
<P>
Clinton argues that we should go into Bosnia to keep the fighting from 
spreading into a bigger war. But he's got it exactly backwards. It is 
U.S. involvement and casualties that turn a local fight into a world 
event. 
<P>
Clinton says our troops will be "peacekeepers." But there is no peace 
in Bosnia; all sides hate each other and one of the warring parties 
has refused to ratify the Dayton accord. Nor can the United States 
pretend to be neutral so soon after we bombed the Serb secessionists. 
<P>
Even if there were peace, U.S. servicemen are not policemen and should 
not be forced to assume that role. Policemen and soldiers are trained 
for different missions, and those purposes should not be blurred. 
<P>
It's not at all clear that anyone can stop the fighting. Balkan 
nations have fought each other for over 500 years, and too much blood 
has been shed over little pieces of land for the enmity to disappear 
in the 12 months of our projected deployment there. 
<P>
The Dayton agreement creates a new Bosnian state with indefensible 
borders and a collective presidency with, in rotation, a Muslim, a 
Serb and a Croat as chairman. Under this inherently unstable 
arrangement, each side will have its own army! 
<P>
If it is truly in the vital interest of Europe to stop the 
bloodletting in the former Yugoslavia, let the European countries send 
whatever troops are necessary. Europe has plenty of money and manpower 
to take on the task. 
<P>
Despite the lack of a clear mission as to why we are going in, what 
good we can accomplish, and when we will get out, the entire liberal 
and internationalist establishment plus the media elite are lining up 
to support Clinton's expedition into Bosnia. Let's look at the reasons 
for this curious propaganda push. 
<P>
They want to give NATO something to do before the American people 
realize that NATO has completed its mission of stopping the Soviets 
from invading Europe and now ought to be retired. The Warsaw Pact is 
already "history," but NATO careerists want to keep their bureaucracy 
going through "mission creep." 
<P>
The internationalists remember how hard it was to get the United 
States involved in World Wars I and II. They think that, if they can 
just keep U.S. troops constantly marching around in Europe on any 
make-work project, America will be caught right in the middle if and 
when another big war starts. 
<P>
The internationalists want to get the United States in some kind of 
world government and, since the United Nations is in such disfavor, 
NATO can serve as a useful stepping stone. Using NATO instead of the 
UN will avoid the criticisms about U.S. servicemen wearing UN uniforms 
or serving under foreign commanders. 
<P>
The American people are looking for a leader who will stand up to 
Clinton and say "NO, we are not going to let you drag our nation into 
a foreign war that is none of our business." We are looking for a 
Senator and a Representative who will lead the battle in Congress to 
<P>
cut off all money for use in Bosnia, which Congress has every right 
and constitutional authority to do. 
<P>
And one more thing: "OK with conditions" is not acceptable. We want a 
leader to "just say NO."

<TITLE>WHY CONSERVATIVES SHOULD SUPPORT THE NAFTA -- Heritage </TITLE>

<CENTER><H3><I>WHY CONSERVATIVES SHOULD SUPPORT THE NAFTA</I></H3>
<P>
Douglas Seay<br>
Executive Memorandum #366<BR>
9/27/93   <P>
</CENTER><HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>


     After years of negotiation and repeated postponements, the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has been completed and now
awaits congressional consideration.  As if on cue, a torrent of
opposition has erupted.
<P>
     The most surprising aspect about the NAFTA debate is the
criticism by some conservatives.  Opposition to the NAFTA is
understandable on the part of protectionists, champions of increased
government regulation, and those who unashamedly seek to advance their
own fortunes at the expense of the national interest.  But for
conservatives, there should be little dissension.  All the existing
empirical data regarding U.S.  trade with Mexico, as well as basic
economic theory stretching back over 200 years to Adam Smith, shows
that the NAFTA is good for the U.S.  This is why Ronald Reagan,
Margaret Thatcher, and Milton Friedman, to name only some of the most
prominent conservatives, strongly support the agreement, even with its
admitted flaws.  As Thatcher told a U.S.  audience recently, America
has "nothing to fear" from the NAFTA.
<P>
     Why, then, is there such strong and growing opposition among
conservatives?  In large part, much of this opposition can be traced
to insufficient familiarity with the terms of this complex agreement. 
The hundreds of pages of dense text make it a formidable obstacle, and
most commentators have chosen to rely on general summaries of its
content, along with word of mouth, for their understanding.  Thus,
they are insufficiently prepared to counter the propaganda and
outright fabrications put forward by opponents.  As more conservatives
become familiar with the actual text of the NAFTA and its side
agreements on labor and environmental issues, they are likely to
become more supportive.  An objective reading of the text and
consideration of the evidence reveals that the NAFTA will:
<P>
Create American jobs.  <P>
     Economists are virtually unanimous in their conclusion that the
NAFTA will have a strongly positive impact on job growth throughout
the U.S., with most estimates in the hundreds of thousands. 
Opponents' predictions of a net job loss are backed by no evidence
whatsoever.
<P>
Make America more competitive abroad.<P>
     America has two choices with the NAFTA:  to become more
competitve abroad with it, or to become less competitive without it. 
With the NAFTA, American companies can become more competitive in
foreign markets by taking advantage of Mexico's lower-cost labor, much
as the Japanese have long done through co-production arrangements in
other East Asian countries.
<P>
Not endanger American sovereignty.<P>
     The NAFTA's labor and environmental commissions cannot supersede
U.S. or state laws nor do they have any power to compel any action. 
Neither do they have subpoena or independent inspection powers; they
are limited to "recommendations."  The U.S.  retains complete control
over the content and enforcement of its own laws.
<P>
Help stem the tide of illegal immigration, slow the influx of illegal
     drugs, and better secure America's border with Mexico.  
     As Mexico's economy grows, fewer Mexicans will migrate to the
U.S.  in search of employment.  Moreover, there is nothing in the
NAFTA that will exacerbate the illegal drug trade; removing tariffs on
tomatoes is not likely to endanger U.S.  security.  In fact, U.S. 
cooperation with Mexican border patrols will increase under the NAFTA.
<P>
     Many of the concerns of conservatives about the labor and
environmental side agreements stem from what the Clinton
Administration originally proposed, not what was actually negotiated. 
In that sense, many conservative critics of the NAFTA are fighting
battles that have already been won and warning against dangers which
never actually materialized.  For a close reading of the recently
released texts of the side accords reveals that the actual damage to
the NAFTA's free trade provisions was far less than feared.  This does
not mean that they are entirely harmless:  they do set bad precedents
and have the potential to be strengthened at some future date. 
Therefore, a high priority for the next free trade administration
should be to remove them.  But for now they contain little more than
empty phrases and little or no enforcement power.  If anyone has cause
to oppose the NAFTA, it is those protectionist groups who eagerly
expected a real advance toward managed trade and more government
regulation.  They did not get it, and that is why Ralph Nader and the
AFL-CIO and their lobbyists in Congress are so bitterly opposed to the
NAFTA.
<P>
     Lack of Confidence.  Unfortunately, outdated and inaccurate
information about the NAFTA and the side accords is only one of the
sources of conservative opposition.  At its core is a more serious
problem:  a lack of confidence in the U.S.  and a growing pessimism
regarding its ability to compete in the world.
<P>
     A lack of confidence in the U.S.  is nothing new for those on the
left, many of whom do not hide their distaste for American society and
whose penchant for government regulation creates a bias in favor of
barriers against the outside world.  This negative image of America,
and the accompanying national paralysis it engendered, enjoyed
increasing currency until Ronald Reagan's presidency largely dispelled
it.
<P>
     What is new is that it has now been taken up by many
conservatives, whose reading of the NAFTA is distorted by this
defeatist world-view.  Seen through their eyes, the U.S.  needs to
erect new and higher barriers to shield itself from an array of
threats.  They believe that the easy U.S.  primacy is now over, and
increasingly the U.S.  will not be able to compete in the world.
<P>
     In trade, protectionists on the left and right loudly proclaim
the need for the U.S.  to tilt the rules in its favor.  For them, a
fair contest is to be avoided at all costs because their assumption is
that the U.S.  would always lose.  The government, therefore, must
take control, not just of trade, but of an ever-widening array of
activities to ensure an equitable outcome.
<P>
     But if conservatives believe in anything, it is in human liberty
and in the workings of the free market.  Conservatives are pledged to
remove the constraints that governments seek to impose, regardless of
whether these are derived from ideological reasons or at the behest of
organized interests.  Conservatives know that there is no need for the
U.S.  to adopt a defensive crouch.  All that America needs to prevail
in global trade is open access to foreign markets.  Protectionism,
regardless of whatever imaginative rationale is put forward for it, is
an admission of defeat.
<P>
     America's Self-Image.  The NAFTA debate is not merely an argument
about a trade agreement; it is also a fight over the self-image of the
U.S. and this country's role in the world.  The result will be either
a confident embrace of the future or the beginning of what may become
an endless retreat.  Liberals and protectionists may oppose the
accord, and given their beliefs it is understandable that they should
do so.  But conservatives cannot do so without betraying their
fundamental principles.
<P>
     The U.S cannot hide from the world, and there is no reason
conservatives should want to.  Adopting a bunker mentality is the
surest way to undermine America's role in the world and to sabotage
her ability to pursue and defend her interests.  If there is anything
to fear it is those who, in the name of protecting the U.S., would
erect constraining barriers and foist upon Americans a ruinous self-
image of weakness and victimization.  The costs it would impose cannot
be measured in dollars, although these would be substantial.  Far more
damaging would be its corrosive effect on America's image of itself.
<P>
     Conservatives should heed Ronald Reagan, who wrote recently,
"When it comes to freedom and prosperity, Americans have never been
content merely with the status quo or allowed limitations to be placed
upon us. Today we must realize the competitive challenge of the global
economy and step right up to our rightful place as leader."  "The
North American Free Trade Agreement," says Reagan, "can bring us that
victory."

<title>Rockwell: "Public Sector" Racket -- 04/21/96

<h2>"Public Sector" Racket 
</h2>
Llewellyn Rockwell
<P>


The term "public sector" is highly misleading. It's supposed  
to refer to the government, that well-known public servant, in  
contrast to the "private sector," the greedy and selfish market.  

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
But the opposite is the case. In the "private sector," all  
activity is focussed on serving the public, people helping people  
get quality goods and services at the best price. A business that  
loses sight of its consumers is quickly outcompeted by one that  
serves the public better. The market is the true public sector.  
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

On the other hand, government is obsessively focussed on  
itself and its private, internal, bureaucratic interests. It  
doesn't engage in productive enterprise, there are no regular  
consumers of its "services," it is owned by no one in particular,  
and it doesn't worry about profit and loss.  
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Government's primary if not exclusive function is to  
redistribute wealth from one group to another by force. The  
people, the very ones involuntarily funding the government, are  
seen as chumps and menaces, and used as pawns in social  
experiments and power grabs. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

All this comes clear when you compare the way any private  
company works with, say, the Department of Housing and Urban  
Development. In the most recent outrage, HUD decided it should  
blow up its housing projects in downtown Baltimore and move the  
residents to pricey homes in the suburbs, at fantastic taxpayer  
expense. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This demented scheme--which will drive down property values,  
increase crime, and unsettle whole communities--is at war with  
the public interest. That's why it's generated an explosion of  
resistance among homeowners in the Baltimore area. Especially  
peeved are new suburbanites, who worked hard to get away from the  
inner city.  
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Just who benefits from this scheme? Power-mad bureaucrats  
who see their mandate as tearing up the social pea patch, and the  
contractors and social workers who live off the ensuing  
destruction. These are private, not public, interests.  
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The market, in contrast, is the peaceful and fully  
accountable public servant. Capitalists produce houses and  
apartments for every social group. If we were sticklers in our 
use of language, we would call what the market achieves "public  
housing," since its purpose is not to destroy, but to create  
housing options for everyone at the least possible expense.  
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Here's another example. Which is more anxious to serve the  
public: the government's mail operation, or the myriad of private  
delivery services? You don't have to be an expert to know. UPS 
and Fedex men toil with packages piled high, racing from place to  
place, competing to provide ever better service.  
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The U.S. Postal Service is so bad that it changed its name  
(it used to be Post Office) and logo (from a mailbox to an  
eagle's head) to avoid ridicule. The service gets worse (I'm old  
enough to remember twice-daily delivery), the price always goes  
up (especially on business), and the whining never stops. Can we 
imagine Fedex employees complaining about too much business, as  
the postal people do during the Christmas season?   
  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

No, public service is not the Postal Service's strength. But  
it has mastered the art of lobbying. That's why, despite the  
blather about being "revolutionary," this Congress hasn't even  
considered repealing the unamerican laws that prohibit  
first-class mail competition.  
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Like all government bureaucracies, the Postal Service has no  
real owners, and most of its "customers" have no choice. The  
offices are so unpleasant that one of last year's best performing  
stocks was a company that takes your letters and packages to the  
P.O. so you don't have to.  
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

So the Postal Service blows millions on ads designed to  
bamboozle. One new campaign claims it's "a very businesslike  
business." Why? Because it's so big, the 33rd largest "company"  
in the world, having moved up a notch after the Politburo was  
downsized.  
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although the government claims that its private interests  
are really the public interest, it is busy destroying private  
industries that truly do serve the public. If the Justice  
Department brings suit against a business for "discriminating"  
against some privileged group, for example, it's as good as dead.  
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Worse, Congress has called on the nation's tax-collecting  
public servants to share their jobs with non-government lawyers,  
so they can scarf up more private revenue. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Thanks to this perverse "privatization," a private-sector  
profession will be paid by a public-sector agency to loot private  
property for the private interests of phony public servants. Oh,  
for those simpler, better days before government ruined our  
language.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
President Bill Clinton will meet President Boris Yeltsin of Russia for the sixth time at the Moscow nuclear safety and security summit on April 19-20. In addition to the United States and Russia, the G-7 states and Ukraine will participate in the summit. The heads of state will discuss nuclear reactor safety, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and nuclear terrorism. Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin also will meet separately to discuss a broad range of bilateral issues. This will be their last official meeting before Russian voters cast their ballots in the June 16 presidential elections. Clinton's counterpart faces an uncertain political future, and so do U.S.-Russian relations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 The United States has a stake in the outcome of the Russian presidential elections. The most desirable result -- a pro-Western democratic reformer in the Kremlin -- is very unlikely. The worst-case scenario will be the victory of hard-line communists led by Gennady Zyuganov. In the December 1995 elections, communists, nationalists, and their allies captured over 46 percent of the popular vote for the Duma (the lower house of the Russian parliament).<sup>1</sup>  A communist takeover will turn Russia back in time, to central planning, human rights violation, re-militarization, and aggressive foreign policy. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Boris Yeltsin today draws criticism from many Russian democrats. He backtracked on the program of radical reforms he spearheaded in 1991-1993. He looks and acts increasingly authoritarian and at times, erratic. Free market and democratic reforms in Russia have stalled. Until recently, Yeltsin was trailing the most popular candidate, Communist Party leader Zyuganov, by at least 5 percentage points. According to the latest polls, Yeltsin is closing the gap, running almost neck-and-neck. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Another dangerous contender for the presidency is Vladimir Zhirinovsky, an anti-American ultra-nationalist with a penchant for political surprises and a strong track record in the elections. Victory for Zyuganov or an increase in Zhirinovsky's influence would gravely endanger any hope for democracy and market reforms surviving in Russia. A communist or a nationalist at Russia's helm could place that country, with its considerable military power, on a collision course with the United States in Central Europe or the Middle East. Thus Yeltsin increasingly looks to be the lesser of two evils, and on that basis merits qualified U.S. support.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Russian-American relations have been deteriorating for some time. Russia has been drifting away from the West, as demonstrated by disagreements over the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the START II nuclear arms treaty, and the Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty. There also have been differences over the sale of Russian nuclear reactors to Iran, the sale of weapons to rogue Third World regimes, and the continuing brutal war in the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
President Clinton should not sweep these disagreements under the rug at the Moscow Summit. Nor should he cave into Russian demands in the hopes of boosting Yeltsin's chances in the June elections. This would be seen by many Russian voters as unacceptable meddling in Russian internal affairs and a sign of American weakness or naivete. Moreover, even a modest endorsement of Yeltsin's bid for the presidency would further alienate the many Russians who dislike Yeltsin. An endorsement could backfire, providing Yeltsin's opposition with political ammunition to attack him as an "American puppet." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Therefore, at the Moscow summit, President Clinton should:
<P><ul>
<li><b>Be firm</b> in expressing American support for democracy, elections, free markets, and individual rights in Russia, discouraging both Yeltsin and the hard-liners from seeking anti-democratic solutions.
<p>
<li><b>Voice strong support</b> and American commitment for independence, sovereignty, and the territorial integrity of the New Independent States (NIS).
<p>
<li><b>Denounce</b> the atrocities in Chechnya which have led to heavy loss of civilian life. 
<p>
<li><b>Oppose</b> the sale by Russia of nuclear reactors to Iran.
<p>
<li><b>Support</b> NATO expansion, making clear that it does not threaten Russia.
<p>
<li><b>Avoid</b> negotiating on arms control issues.
</ul><p>
<b>THE UNCERTAIN FUTURE OF YELTSIN AND U.S.-RUSSIAN RELATIONS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A dark cloud hovers over President Yeltsin's election prospects. His political platform is murky. Critics say that he has abandoned democratic principles and policies in favor of populism and political survival. The war in Chechnya, severe economic difficulties, and rampant crime and corruption have drastically eroded the popularity of his administration. Polls show Yeltsin's approval ratings are barely in the 15-20 percent range. While his entourage insists that the elections will take place as scheduled, many in Russia question whether they will, or whether the vote count will be fair.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Yeltsin today is not the popular democrat the world watched in admiration as he overturned the Soviet Union in 1991. He is presiding over the return of hard-line Soviet nomenklatura to top positions of power. He has lost the support of many Russian reformers, and is pursuing a foreign policy that is increasingly confrontational with the U.S. and the West. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
President Clinton has placed personal relations with Boris Yeltsin above U.S. policy objectives. As Yeltsin's popularity plummeted, Clinton fed the flames of Russian resentment toward the U.S. by giving the Russian president unequivocal support, especially after the canonnade of the Russian Supreme Soviet in 1993 and the beginning of the Chechen war in 1994. As a result, the U.S. is now perceived by many in the Russian political elite as partisan and uncritically supportive of Yeltsin's faltering policies. The Clinton policy has endangered the ability of the U.S. to maintain a relationship with democrats in Russia who oppose President Yeltsin.
<p>
<b>ARMS CONTROL: NO COMPROMISES ON AMERICAN SECURITY</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While the announced agenda of the multilateral summit on civilian nuclear safety was not to cover arms control, Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin decided in the fall of 1995 to add a bilateral Russian-American summit during President Clinton's Moscow visit. The addition of the bilateral summit could tempt the Russians to raise issues related to arms control that were not on the agenda for the multilateral summit and which the U.S. side will be unprepared to address. These may include:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Amendments to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty.</b> The Russians may press their demands to amend the ABM Treaty so that the treaty's restrictions extend to the now-unrestricted development and deployment of defenses against short-range missiles. The Russians also may demand that Russia and other former Soviet republics be established as treaty successors to the Soviet Union. Congress has expressed its interest in amending the treaty to ease restrictions on developing and deploying defenses against long-range missiles, and Russia may inquire about these congressional plans. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Negotiations on a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).</b> Russia may inquire about the Clinton Administration's plans to conclude a CTBT this year.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Ratification of the 1993 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty II (START II).</b> The Russian Duma has yet to consent to the ratification of START II, which cuts U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear arsenals to 3,500 deliverable warheads each. Russian representatives may press the U.S. to accept either changes in START II itself or limitations on U.S. arms not covered by START II in order to gain acquiescence of the Duma.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Ratification of the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).</b> The U.S. Senate has not yet ratified the CWC. The Russians may inquire if the U.S. will ratify this treaty, which bars the development, stockpiling, and deployment, as well as the use, of chemical weapons by participating states.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration should make it very clear to the Russians that it will not negotiate on arms control issues at either the multilateral or bilateral summit in Moscow. Arms control negotiations should take place only at forums established specifically for addressing these issues. Mistakes of historic proportions can be made at <i>ad hoc</i> arms control negotiations. Therefore, arms control issues should not be raised by the U.S. delegations during the Moscow visit.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

If representatives from Russia or other states raise these arms control issues during the Moscow visit, U.S. representatives, including the President himself, should have prepared responses in the form of unilateral statements to foreclose any negotiations on the relevant subjects. U.S. representatives should state explicitly to their counterparts that the unilateral statements are not subject to further discussion in the Moscow talks.
<p>
<b>THE MOSCOW SUMMIT AGENDA: SUPPORTING U.S. INTERESTS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To support U.S. interests at the Moscow summit, President Clinton should:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Be firm in expressing American support for democracy, elections, free markets, and individual rights in Russia</b>, discouraging both Yeltsin and the hard-liners from seeking anti-democratic solutions to Russia's problems.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. should develop a Russian policy based on the support of ideas and interests, not on the fate of individual politicians. The U.S. should support democracy and free markets, as well as political forces advocating these ideas. Yeltsin is the elected president of Russia and was a key figure in bringing about the collapse of the Soviet communism. Today, however, some of his policies and his personal style are controversial, and his popularity is low. There are many other democratic reformers, including former Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar, presidential candidate Grigory Yavlinsky, and human rights activists Sergei Kovalev and Yelena Bonner, who disagree fundamentally with Yeltsin's policies on economic reform and Chechnya. Clinton would be well-advised to meet with these pro-Western reformers to demonstrate his support for the democratic and free-market path for Russia.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Voice strong support and American commitment for independence, sovereignty, and the territorial integrity of the New Independent States (NIS).</b> The President should make clear that furtive or bullish attempts to extend Russian domination in the "near abroad," especially in the Ukraine and the Baltic states, would result in American countermeasures across the spectrum of the Russian-American relationship.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. should oppose Russian attempts to impose a sphere of influence in the former Soviet Union. Moscow is attempting to re-establish its "sphere of influence" in neighboring regions that were once a part of the Soviet Union. Recent evidence of this is the customs union created with Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan on March 29, 1996, and the Commonwealth of Sovereign Republics, known by its Russian acronym SSR, signed with Belarus on April 2, 1996, in Moscow. While these agreements were largely voluntary, the Kremlin may employ a combination of economic, diplomatic, and even military means in the future to achieve integration of what Moscow calls its "near abroad" -- the Baltic States, Ukraine, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. The U.S. should not endorse the creation of a Russian sphere of influence in the CIS, as President Clinton reportedly did in a recent conversation with Boris Yeltsin.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Preventing the emergence of a Russian empire in the lands of the former Soviet Union should be a top Western priority. Yet the Clinton Administration until recently was very tolerant towards Russian assertiveness in the "near abroad."<sup>3</sup>  The Clinton Administration also has been too slow to recognize the importance of countries in the region other than Russia. For example, without Ukraine, the Russian empire cannot be recreated and will have only limited access to the heart of Europe. Ukraine's independence is an important Western interest. Azerbaijan controls vital oil and gas reserves, while Georgia is situated in a strategically crucial location in the Caucasus. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Denounce the atrocities in Chechnya which have led to heavy loss of civilian life.</b> The President should call for a cessation of hostilities in Chechnya and an Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) mediation effort in the conflict.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. should support a negotiated solution to the Chechen war that would keep Russian territorial integrity intact, but also recognize the aspirations of the Chechen people for autonomy. Overt Russian military action in Chechnya began on December 12, 1994, when the army marched on the capital city of Grozny. The city was destroyed by a brutal aerial, tank, and artillery assault. Since the start of the campaign, over 30,000 people have been killed, scores have been wounded, and more than 400,000 became refugees. Until now, the Russian army has failed to find a military solution to the Chechen problem, which resulted in a political disaster for Yeltsin. Yeltsin's critics in Moscow have said that a secret order was given to the Russian troops in Chechnya to destroy the civilian population of villages that support the rebels. The cease-fire declared in summer 1995 collapsed. On March 31, 1996, Yeltsin called for yet another new peace plan and a negotiated solution.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Oppose the sale by Russia of nuclear reactors to Iran.</b> The U.S. should offer the Russians an alternative deal that would sidetrack the reactor sale to Iran. One possibility is a modernization program to upgrade the safety of the dangerous and obsolete Russian nuclear reactors. If Yeltsin refuses, the U.S. should retaliate by cancelling the $1 billion in Export-Import Bank credits to lease civilian aircraft to Aeroflot.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Russian-Iranian nuclear reactor deal must be a higher priority at U.S.-Russian summits. The Clinton Administration did not highlight this issue sufficiently at the 1995 Clinton-Yeltsin summits, passing it to the Gore-Chernomyrdin commission, which failed to find a solution. This is a serious mistake. The Islamic regime in Tehran is buying two Russian-made nuclear reactors capable of producing plutonium that can be enriched to become weapons-grade raw material for atomic bombs. Russia is interested in selling even more reactors to Tehran. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has opposed this sale, believing it could endanger both Russian and Western security. But the sale is going through anyway, primarily because of pressure from the powerful Ministry of Atomic Industry (MinAtom), headed by Victor Mikhailov, and because of the short-sightedness of Russia's top nuclear industry officials. If Tehran wants an additional source of electricity, Russia could sell electrical power from its own ample resources.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Support NATO expansion, making clear that it does not threaten Russia.</b> Moscow should not have veto power over NATO's decisions to add new members. The U.S. should support NATO enlargement, but keep the door open for Russian participation in the European security dialogue. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration has paid lip service to the issue of NATO enlargement to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, but has done very little to make it happen. Some observers accuse the Administration of promising Russia not to expand NATO in 1996 in exchange for cooperation on peacekeeping in Bosnia. NATO enlargement is aimed at wiping the results of Yalta and the Potsdam post-World War II division of Europe from the map. If these countries do not join NATO, they will be left in a strategic gray zone which Russia may try to exploit.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. should make a political commitment to bring Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and possibly Slovakia into NATO. The 1994 Contract With America stipulated that NATO enlargement, should be a high U.S. national security priority. Russian and Western military experts need to discuss the contingencies of expansion, to make it more transparent, and if need be, to assuage Russian fears.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Russia has voiced many security concerns regarding NATO expansion. Some of these are illegitimate, such as trying to maintain Russian arms exports to the former Warsaw Pact satellites, or intimidating the Baltic States. Others are more legitimate, such as questions about where nuclear weapons will be stationed. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While Russia's security concerns should be discussed in bilateral and multilateral negotiations, Russia should not be given a veto power (<i>droit de regard</i>) to define who will be accepted into the enlarged Atlantic Alliance and under what circumstances. Moscow's worries can be allayed in protocols and memoranda of understanding. However, under no circumstances should the NATO treaty be changed or amended under Russian pressure.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Inform the Russians that further negotiations to draft a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) are fruitless.</b> Clinton should tell Yeltsin that the U.S. will withdraw its representative from the negotiations in Geneva and will resume nuclear tests as soon as preparations allow. In keeping with the recommended position that the U.S. not participate in arms control negotiations during the Moscow visit, Clinton should not raise this issue himself, but respond with a unilateral statement only if pressed by the Russians.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. should not be seeking a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing. U.S. representatives are engaged in negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva to draft a treaty on banning nuclear tests. The negotiations come at a time when the U.S. has observed a moratorium on testing that was supposed to be honored by the other four nuclear weapons states (China, France, Great Britain, and Russia). But China and France already have conducted tests in violation of the moratorium. The Clinton Administration is now trying to determine whether Russia conducted a secret test. The tests by other nuclear powers only demonstrate the necessity of further testing to maintain the reliability and effectiveness of the existing U.S. nuclear arsenal and to modernize it. Instead of negotiating a ban on testing, the U.S. should state its determination to maintain its nuclear deterrent through a prudent testing program.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Inform Russia that non-strategic missile defenses are not subject to the restriction of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty.</b> Clinton should warn Yeltsin that the U.S. Congress is likely to adopt legislation requiring that the negotiations in Geneva be expanded to include matters related to easing treaty-based restrictions on strategic missile defense systems. Again, this warning should be issued only if Russia raises the question of amending the ABM Treaty. Clinton should not raise the issue himself.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. should not be expanding the scope of the obsolete ABM Treaty to restrict theater missile defenses. There are four issues of importance relevant to the ABM Treaty. First, the U.S., Russia, and several other countries are involved in negotiations to establish a dividing line between shorter-range theater missile defenses, which are not subject to the restrictions of the ABM Treaty, and strategic missile defenses, which are subject to the treaty. Second, there is the question of designating a successor state or successor states to the Soviet Union under the ABM Treaty. Since the Soviet Union, not Russia, signed and is bound by the ABM Treaty, there is a question of which country or countries are legally bound under the treaty. Third, congressional leaders introduced a missile defense bill on March 21, 1996, which, among other things, would require the Clinton Administration to negotiate changes in the ABM Treaty to allow the deployment of an effective national missile defense system. Thus, the intent of Congress is to move beyond the ABM Treaty, not preserve it. And, finally, there is the matter of the legal form these agreements will take. It is becoming increasingly clear that Congress, and the Senate in particular, will object to agreements in these three areas if they do not take the form of formal amendments (protocols) to the ABM Treaty, which are subject to Senate advice and consent as required by Article II, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Be prepared to issue a unilateral statement on START II, if the issue arises, to the effect that the U.S. will not agree to changes to the text of the treaty, or impose limitations on military systems not subject to the treaty.</b> If the Russians do not raise the this issue, then the U.S. should remain silent on the issue of START II. However, if pressed by the Russians, Clinton should inform Yeltsin that so long as no changes in the treaty text are demanded by Russia, the U.S. will proceed to formal ratification of the START II Treaty. On January 26, 1996, the United States Senate consented to the ratification of the START II Treaty. The treaty requires both Russia and the U.S. to reduce their strategic nuclear arsenals to 3,500 deliverable warheads on each side. However, the Russian Duma has not yet consented to ratification and there is speculation that it may not do so unless the U.S. agrees to concessions. These demands could come in the form of modifications to START II itself or restrictions on U.S. military systems outside the scope of the treaty, including new ABM Treaty restrictions on U.S. missile defense systems. The U.S. should steadfastly resist these demands, if they are made.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Be prepared to issue a unilateral statement, if the issue should arise, to the effect that the U.S. may want to re-negotiate the Chemical Weapons Convention.</b> If the issue of ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) is raised during the Moscow summit, the U.S. should inform Russia that the U.S. Senate may not consent to the ratification of the CWC. Since the Russian Duma may not ratify the CWC either, the U.S. and Russia should consider drafting a joint request to the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva to re-negotiate the CWC. This unilateral statement should be issued only if the Russians raise the issue and should not be subject to further discussion.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. should be seeking an alternative to the Chemical Weapons Convention. The U.S. Senate is now considering whether to consent to the ratification of the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). The CWC requires all participating states (as of January 16, 160 states have signed the convention) not to develop, retain, deploy, or use chemical weapons. The CWC will enter into force when 65 countries ratify it. So far only 47 states have done so. Russia has signed the CWC as well.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The CWC does not serve U.S. interests. It undermines the U.S. chemical deterrent by barring America from retaining such weapons. Further, Russia has been dragging its feet on fully declaring the size of the chemical stock it inherited from the Soviet Union, as required by a 1989 understanding with the U.S. The best outcome for both the United States and Russia regarding the future of the CWC would be a new treaty modeled on the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. This would designate the U.S. and Russia as weapons states and allow them to retain a chemical deterrent.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
President Clinton must safeguard American national interests at the Russian summit and avoid compromises or concessions on important security issues. Above all, he must avoid being drawn into discussions on arms control. With the end of the Cold War and the diminished threat from the former Soviet Union, arms control need no longer occupy the central place it once held in the relationship between the two countries. There is no reason for side meetings or a bilateral engagement that goes beyond the stated purpose of the summit. If arms control issues are brought up by others, the President should limit himself to unilateral statements of the U.S. position. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There is always inherent pressure at widely publicized international meetings to produce "breakthrough" agreements or some tangible results. If the results of the Moscow summit promise to be sparse, the President may be tempted to turn to arms control for an agreement which he can bring home as proof of his foreign policy prowess. In particular he may succumb to pressure to accept new ABM Treaty limitations on theater missile defenses. If this happens, the price of other benefits from the Moscow summit -- for example, an agreement on nuclear reactor safety  -- may prove too high. The American people have seen too many summits in which the vaunted results served merely to disguise unilateral concessions on arms control that harmed the nation's security.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The President must also be careful not to justify any agreement that emerges from the summit on the grounds that it will strengthen Boris Yeltsin. In fact, the President should not under any circumstances appear to interfere in Russia's electoral politics. Clinton should support Russian market and democratic reforms, not individual presidential candidates. He should welcome continuous integration of Russia into the international economic, investment, and information networks. He can acknowledge the pain of democratic and market reform, but call upon the Russian people to join the outside world from which they were separated by communist dictatorship for 70 years. By following this agenda in Moscow, President Clinton will be able to promote both U.S. national security and Russian democracy.

INTRODUCTION
<P>
     The Clinton Administration on September 14 launched its campaign
to secure congressional ratification of the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA). (The NAFTA will be considered by Congress later
this year or early next year.  It is a trade agreement between the
United States, Canada, and Mexico that will create the world's largest
open market, with a population of 370 million and a gross domestic
product (GDP) of some $7 trillion.  It will do this by eliminating
most tariff and non-tariff barriers between the three countries over a
period of fifteen years.) Flanked by former Presidents Gerald Ford,
Jimmy Carter, and NAFTA architect George Bush, Bill Clinton used the
occasion of the signing of the side accords on environmental and labor
standards to kick off his pro-NAFTA drive. Clinton's mission: convince
the American people and members of a dubious Congress that the free
trade pact with Canada and Mexico will create new U.S. jobs, expand
exports, and improve U.S. economic competitiveness. 
   <P>  However, the White House and other NAFTA supporters are facing an
uphill struggle. Anti-NAFTA forces, led by Texas billionaire H. Ross
Perot, conservative commentator Patrick Buchanan, civil rights
activist Jesse Jackson, consumer rights advocate Ralph Nader, and a
conglomeration of radical labor and environmental groups, have made
the defeat of the NAFTA their top priority.
<P>
     Flat-Out Incorrect. At the forefront of this effort to derail the
historic free trade accord is Perot's book, Save Your Job, Save Our
Country: Why NAFTA Must be Stopped --Now!. (Ross Perot and Pat Choate,
Save Your Job, Save Our Country:  Why NAFTA Must Be Stopped--Now! 
(New York:  Hyperion, 1993).) The book, co-written with economist Pat
Choate, an ardent union supporter and long-time protectionist, alleges
throughout its 142 pages that the U.S. has been "outtraded" by Mexico
and Canada in a "secret deal" that will undermine the U.S. economy.
Perot wrongly claims that cheap Mexican wages will "suck" millions of
high-paying American jobs south of the border like a "giant vacuum"
and that the U.S. manufacturing base will be wiped out. The Perot and
Choate book, which most independent economists and trade experts
regard as simplistic and flat-out incorrect, overlooks the many
factors, other than wage levels, that actually drive business
decisions and the location of factories. (Economists or trade experts
who disagree with Perot's allegation include:  Gary Clyde Huffbauer
and Jeffrey J.  Schott of the Washington-based Institute for
International Economics; Steven Globerman and Michael Walker of the
Fraser Institute in Canada; Milton Friedman of the Hoover Institution;
Rudiger Dornbush of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Mexican
economist Rugelio Ramirez De la O, Paul Samuelson of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, and James Buchanan of George Mason
University.) Perot and Choate call the NAFTA a "drastic and unfair
scheme" that will pit American and Mexican workers "in a race to the
bottom." (Perot and Choate, p.  i.) They also promote the myth, as
does Pat Buchanan, that the agreement will "radically reduce the
sovereignty of the United States" and that the "secret" agreement has
been forced upon the American people by crafty lobbyists, all paid for
by foreign governments and multinational corporations. (This theme
permeates the Perot and Choate book.)
<P>
     Almost every independent and U.S. government study shows,
however, that Perot, Choate, and the other anti-NAFTA leaders are dead
wrong on the free trade pact. For example, it is estimated that under
the NAFTA there will be a net increase of 200,000 jobs as a result of
increased U.S. exports to Mexico. Today, trade with Mexico alone
sustains at least 700,000 jobs in the U.S. ("The NAFTA:  Expanding
U.S.  Exports, Jobs, and Growth," Clinton Administration Statement on
the North American Free Trade Agreement, July 1993, p.  3.) Moreover,
the NAFTA will help address many of the other concerns raised by NAFTA
critics. The agreement will accelerate the rate of rising Mexican
wages, it will address environmental concerns along the border and
inside Mexico, it will help lock into place Mexican President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari's free market and democratic reform programs, and
it will diminish over time the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs
across the U.S. border.
<P>
     Competing Visions.  The bipartisan gathering of NAFTA defenders
that convened at the White House on September 14 for the side accord
ceremony demonstrated that the battle lines on the trade pact are not
drawn along party lines, but rather according to two different
economic visions. Those that favor the NAFTA believe that U.S. workers
can compete and win in the global marketplace. They are also convinced
that free and expanded trade benefits all Americans. Opponents of the
free trade accord like Perot are inward-looking, favor the status quo,
and fear competing with other countries. Perot and other NAFTA
opponents believe that opening U.S. markets to foreign goods greatly
harms U.S. workers and the economy. They also argue that U.S.
sovereignty and security will be threatened if the NAFTA goes through.

<P>
     Perot and other NAFTA opponents misunderstand the economics of
the NAFTA. The bottom line is that the NAFTA is a "win-win" agreement
for America. After the NAFTA, the U.S. will eliminate an average 4
percent tariff on Mexican goods, while Mexico will drop its average 10
percent tariff on U.S. goods. As a result, it will be easier to
produce goods and services in the U.S. and sell them to Mexico.
Therefore, once the NAFTA is passed, American companies will have less
of an incentive to move south of the border to try to penetrate the
Mexican market. 
<P>

     There is another reason why the NAFTA is sound economics:
Mexicans purchase more U.S. imports per capita than do much wealthier
Japanese and Europeans. These exports to Mexico create American jobs.
As stated by Senator Bill Bradley, the Democrat from New Jersey: 
<P>      
<UL>Defeating NAFTA won't create jobs, control immigration, or
     clean the environment. Either we address the problems of
     economic transformation head on, or we bury our heads in the
     sand, blame NAFTA for situations it did not create, and
     accept a lower standard of living and a fraying social
     fabric.... NAFTA opens more than a trade door. It will
     enhance our nation in ways that are absolutely critical to
     growth, progress, and security in the 21st century." (Bill
     Bradley, "NAFTA Opens More than a Trade Door," The Wall
     Street Journal, September 16, 1993.)</UL>

     <P>
MYTHS AGAINST NAFTA: EVALUATING PEROT'S ALLEGATIONS
<P>
     In their attempts to discredit the NAFTA, Perot, Choate, and
other critics often misrepresent the facts and distort the truth about
the agreement. Their arguments, nevertheless, have greatly harmed the
NAFTA's chances in Congress. Consequently, as Congress begins its
deliberation on the pros and cons of the NAFTA, it will require clear
and concise information on the merits of the pact. Only then will it
be able to distinguish between myth and reality. The myths advanced in
Perot's book are:
<P>
Myth #1: As many as 5.9 million jobs will be lost in the U.S. as a
      result of the NAFTA. (This theme permeates the Perot and Choate
      book.)
<P>
Reality:  <P>
     Almost every independent study on the NAFTA predicts that there
will be a net gain in the number of U.S. jobs as a result of expanded
American exports to Mexico and new foreign investment in the U.S.
(See, for example:  Larry Brookhart and Robert W.  Wallace, "Potential
Impact on the U.S.  Economy and Selected Industries of the North
American Free-Trade Agreement," USITC publication #2596.  (Washington,
D.C.:  U.S.  International Trade Commission, January 1993); Rudiger
Dornbusch, "NAFTA:  Good Jobs at Good Wages," paper presented at
"NAFTA Summit:  Beyond Party Politics," a conference sponsored by The
Brookings Institution, The Center for Strategic and International
Studies, and The Fraser Institute, (Washington, D.C.:  June 28-29,
1993); Steven Globerman and Michael Walker, Assessing NAFTA:  A
Trinational Analysis (Vancouver, B.C.:  The Fraser Institute, 1993);
Edward Hudgins, Ph.D., "Myths About NAFTA," House Republican
Conference Issue Brief, 1993; Gary Clyde Hufbauer and Jeffrey J. 
Schott, NAFTA:  An Assessment (Washington, D.C.:  Institute for
International Economics, 1993); Paul A.  London and Jonathan Whittle
(The Stern Group, Inc.), "Investment, Trade, and U.S.  Gains in the
NAFTA" (Washington, D.C.:  U.S.  Council of the Mexico-U.S.  Business
Committee, 1992).  Alan Reynolds, "The Impact of NAFTA on U.S.  Wages
and Jobs," paper presented at the Cato Institute conference on The
North American Free Trade Agreement, Washington, D.C., June 8, 1993;
Lenore Sek, "North American Free Trade Agreement," Congressional
Research Service Issue Brief, June 8, 1993.) Since Mexico began to
open its economy in 1986, the number of American workers producing
merchandise exports to Mexico has risen from 274,000 to an estimated
700,000 last year. With the NAFTA, the non-partisan International
Trade Commission (ITC) predicts, 200,000 more export-related jobs will
be created by 1995. It is estimated that for every $1 billion in
increased exports, 22,800 jobs are created in the U.S. Since 1986,
American exports to Mexico have exploded from $12.6 billion to $40.6
billion last year. As U.S. exports to Mexico increase under NAFTA, so
too will the U.S. job base. Moreover, Americans working in jobs
related to exports to Mexico make 12 percent more than the national
average. (For more information see:  "Potential Impact on the U.S. 
Economy and Selected Industries of the North American Free Trade
Agreement," U.S.  International Trade Commission Report, January
1993.) 
<P>
     Even Clyde Prestowitz, the President of the Economic Strategy
Institute, a Washington-based think tank that once was strongly
against the NAFTA, now says that the pact should be ratified. Last
fall, Prestowitz claimed that the NAFTA would cost up to 222,000 jobs.
Today, however, he argues that "NAFTA will be a plus in the long run."
His reasoning: Many U.S. companies will likely shut down their
operations in Mexico and return home once Mexico lowers its trade
barriers. If U.S. companies can penetrate the Mexican market without
confronting tariffs, one of the key rationales for locating there in
the first place disappears. Moreover, it is likely that many U.S.
corporations will move their Asian manufacturing facilities to Mexico
once the NAFTA is enacted, making it almost certain that they would
import components from the U.S., thereby creating new U.S. jobs. (Bob
Davis, "Prestowitz Shifts to Support of NAFTA, Reconsiders Predictions
of Job Losses," The Wall Street Journal, September 17, 1993.) 
<P>
     According to Gary Hufbauer and Jeffrey Schott, authors of the
Institute for International Economics book NAFTA: An Assessment, "If
the NAFTA is rejected, the U.S. is likely to experience job losses.
Rejection of the NAFTA would probably cause capital to leave Mexico.
The resulting slowed Mexican growth and a potential devaluation of its
currency would contract Mexico's imports and expand its exports,
thereby slashing the U.S. trade surplus with Mexico." ("NAFTA:  A
Win-Win-Win Situation for North America," Institute for International
Economics News, February 17, 1993.) While Hufbauer's and Schott's
estimate of job increases is slightly different from those predicted
by the ITC or the Clinton Administration, they still calculate that
under the NAFTA, a gross total of 316,000 U.S. jobs will be created,
while a gross total of 145,000 U.S. jobs will be lost -- leading to a
net gain of 171,000 new jobs. (Ibid.)
<P>
Myth #2: Lower wages in Mexico will encourage U.S. companies to
      relocate their plants and factories there. (Perot and Choate,
      pp.  35 and 68.) 
<P>
Reality: <P>
     Since labor represents only between 10 percent to 20 percent of
production costs for most businesses, Perot's argument about lower
wage levels in Mexico luring U.S. plants south of the border is
greatly exaggerated and in most cases wrong. (Keith Bradsher, "Perot
Leads Attack on Trade Agreement," The New York Times, September 16,
1993, p.  A20.) If U.S. companies were going to move to Mexico, they
would have already done so. The reason: there is absolutely nothing
stopping them from relocating there today. Mexico has removed most of
its restrictions on foreign investment and ownership of manufacturing
facilities. ("NAFTA:  Summary and Analysis," House Republican
Conference Issues Brief, September 13, 1993, p.  3.) Moreover, wage
levels in Mexico are not nearly as low as many people believe and will
rise steadily under the NAFTA. It is estimated that Mexican wages have
risen by 28.7 percent since 1987. Rapidly increasing wage levels in
Mexico, combined with lower productivity levels, often erases much of
the wage advantage anyway. 
<P>
     U.S. workers earn high wages because they are the most productive
workers in the world. By contrast, Mexico's wages are low because the
economy is poor. U.S. companies wishing to relocate to Mexico must
deal with the consequences of what is essentially a Third World
economy. For example, the operating costs for U.S. firms doing
business in Mexico are raised considerably by higher levels of worker
absenteeism, lower educational standards, political instability,
limited access to raw materials, and the problems associated with long
distance management. Consequently, few companies base plant locations
on a simple calculation of wage differentials; for most U.S.
manufacturers, the cost of labor is less important than such factors
as access to technology, the skills of the local work force, and the
quality of the transportation network. If cheap labor were the sole
determinant of plant sites, then Perot and other U.S. industrialists
would be relocating their factories to countries like Haiti and
Nicaragua.
<P>
Myth #3: NAFTA will destroy America's manufacturing base. (Perot and
      Choate, page 28-40.)
<P>
Reality: <P>
     Perot and Choate clearly misrepresent the facts when making this
charge. The NAFTA benefits the U.S. economy and manufacturing base
because it levels the playing field of trade with Mexico. As far as
most imports from Mexico are concerned, the U.S. already practices
free trade. The NAFTA will mainly affect Mexican barriers against U.S.
goods. Mexico's average tariff barriers against U.S. exports are 2.5
times higher than U.S. tariffs against imports from Mexico. By
contrast, over 50 percent of U.S. imports from Mexico already enter
duty-free and the average U.S. tariff on Mexican goods is only 4
percent. Moreover, complex Mexican domestic licensing requirements
further impede U.S. exports to the Mexican market. The NAFTA, however,
will eliminate these non-tariff barriers.
<P>
     Mexico is the United States' third largest and fastest growing
export market. Only Canada and Japan purchase more U.S. goods and
services. Only Canada buys more U.S. manufactured goods than Mexico.
Since 1986, U.S. exports to Mexico have increased by 228 percent to
$40.6 billion -- 2.3 times faster than U.S. exports to the rest of the
world. Moreover, Mexicans buy more U.S. goods per capita than do much
wealthier European and Japanese consumers. (Clyde Prestowitz, "NAFTA: 
Why we Hafta," The Washington Post, September 19, 1993.) It is
estimated that 70 cents of every dollar that Mexico spends on foreign
products is spent on U.S. goods. (For more information, see "The
NAFTA:  Expanding U.S.  Exports, Jobs, and Growth," Clinton
Administration Statement on the North American Free Trade Agreement,
July 1993, pp.  4-7.)
<P>
     American exports of manufactured goods to Mexico have grown
rapidly since Mexico lowered its trade barriers in 1986. This rise in
U.S. exports to Mexico has added more than 400,000 new jobs to the
American economy. By increasing export opportunities, the free trade
accord will enable the U.S. to take advantage of its economic
strengths, which include high-wage, high-technology manufacturing.
U.S. exports to Mexico will jump by 46 percent by 1995, to $60
billion, compared with $41 billion last year. Six years ago the figure
stood at only $14.5 billion. (The Kiplinger Washington Newsletter,
September 10, 1993, p.  1.) This increase in trade, much of which is
in U.S.-manufactured goods, will undoubtedly help fortify -- not
damage -- the U.S. manufacturing base.
<P>
     As pointed out by Hufbauer and Schott, Puerto Rico has enjoyed
free trade with the U.S. for decades. While a major gap still
separates manufacturing wages in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, American
jobs have not been lost as a result of the differential. Between 1970
and 1990, employment in Puerto Rico's manufacturing sector rose only
from 132,000 to 160,000 jobs, and those numbers fell as a share of the
work force from over 17 percent to under 15 percent. If low wages were
such a magnet for manufacturing activity, Puerto Rico should have
gained far more new jobs as a result of U.S. companies relocating
there. That did not happen. Moreover, the proportion of the labor
force engaged in manufacturing activity should have risen, not fallen.
(Hufbauer and Schott, op.  cit., p.  12.)
<P>
Myth #4: NAFTA is not a free trade agreement, but an investment
      agreement. (Perot and Choate, pp.  11, 68.)
<P>
Reality:  <P>
     The protection and expansion of U.S. investments overseas has
been a cardinal principle of American foreign economic policy for
decades. American investment in foreign markets helps generate U.S.
exports, thereby creating new high-paying jobs at home. As a business
leader, Perot should understand that securing good investment
agreements are vital to reaching good trade agreements. Investment
agreements establish the legal groundrules under which U.S. companies
can invest in foreign countries. They also govern issues such as
taxation of the repatriation of profits.
<P>
     While the NAFTA prohibits arbitrary seizure and expropriation of
foreign property, one of the major purposes of the free trade pact is
to remove Mexican laws that encourage U.S. firms to relocate to
Mexico. Under the NAFTA, the Mexican government will end policies that
require U.S. companies to operate inside Mexico in order to sell to
the Mexican market. U.S. companies will be able to sell goods to
Mexico without restriction. Furthermore, the NAFTA ensures that U.S.
companies doing business in Mexico will no longer be forced to
purchase Mexican-made goods. Instead they will be able to use imported
U.S.-made equipment and components.
<P>
     The NAFTA negotiators have, in fact, produced a landmark
agreement on investment. The NAFTA commits the U.S., Canada, and
Mexico to provide national treatment to investors, meaning that U.S.
companies will be treated the same as domestic companies. ("NAFTA:  A
Win-Win-Win Situation for North America," p.  6.) Moreover, the NAFTA
also protects U.S. investors against restrictions on the repatriation
of capital, profits, and royalties. In addition, private investors,
under the rules of the NAFTA, can seek binding arbitral rulings in
trinational forums set up under the agreement directly against the
host government if these rights are infringed upon.
<P>
Myth #5: NAFTA will turn Mexico into a "platform" that Japan, Europe,
      and China can exploit to route their exports into the U.S.
      (Perot and Choate, pp.  9-10.)
<P>
Reality: <P>
     Once again, Perot and Choate are misrepresenting the facts. As
with the 1989 U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement (FTA), the NAFTA
contains rules of origin to prevent non-member countries from using
one NAFTA country as a way to evade the trade restrictions of another.
For example, most motor vehicles are required to contain 62.5 percent
of North American parts in order to qualify for duty-free treatment.
This rule of origin is meant to prevent Japanese firms from using
assembly plants in Mexico as a way to bypass normal U.S. restrictions
on U.S. imports. ("NAFTA:  Summary and Analysis," House Republican
Conference Issue Brief, September 13, 1993, pp.  2-3.)
<P>
     <UL>The International Trade Commission also states that:

     the NAFTA's rules of origin are intended to ensure that the
     benefits of tariff reductions will accrue principally to the
     NAFTA parties and to provide incentives for North American
     production and sourcing. To qualify as a North American
     product under the NAFTA, a number of industrial sectors will
     be subject to a stricter and more detailed change in tariff
     classification rules, higher and more stringent value-
     content requirements, and rules requiring that certain
     components and parts be produced in North America. (The
     International Trade Commission, op.  cit., p.  ix.) </UL>
<P>
     These sectors include automotive goods, computers and other
electronic equipment, machine tools, steel mill products, textiles and
apparel, major household appliances, and industrial machinery.
<P>
     In fact, the NAFTA's rules of origin are so strict in that some
free market economists fear that they will hinder foreign investment
and North American economic competitiveness. While rules of origin are
an integral part of all free trade pacts, they can be used as
protectionist tools to discriminate against foreign competition.
Strict rules of origin can penalize regional producers by forcing them
to buy their parts and components from less efficient suppliers
located within the free trade area. Moreover, some economists argue
that the NAFTA rules of origin could establish a protectionist
precedent for other preferential trade pacts, thereby limiting global
trade liberalization. (Hufbauer and Schott, op.  cit., pp.  5-6.)
<P>
Myth #6:The intellectual property rights provisions in NAFTA will
      "offer incentives for moving [U.S.] operations and jobs to
      Mexico." (Perot and Choate, pp.  92-93.)
<P>
Reality: <P>
     This charge is false. The NAFTA stands as a model for resolving
outstanding disputes over intellectual property. The free trade pact
will ensure a high level of protection under Canadian and Mexican law
for U.S. owners of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and
integrated circuits, as well as safeguards for computer programs,
pharmaceutical inventions, and sound recordings. The NAFTA obligates
Canada and Mexico to enforce intellectual property rights against
infringement internally and at their borders. By protecting
intellectual property rights, the NAFTA will help increase trade and
diminish losses from piracy and counterfeiting. This will lead to
economic growth, new jobs, and increased competitiveness in the U.S.
("Summary of Principal Provisions of NAFTA," U.S.  Department of State
Dispatch, Volume 4, No.  35, August 30, 1993, pp.  601-602.)
<P>
Myth #7:More U.S. companies will move to Mexico to take advantage of
      the so-called maquiladora program if the NAFTA is passed. (Perot
      and Choate, pp.  31, 48-50.)
<P>
Reality: <P>
     U.S. companies have been operating assembly plants, known as
maquiladoras, along the U.S.-Mexico border since 1965. Under this
program, components made in the U.S. are sent to Mexican plants for
assembly, utilizing Mexico's less expensive labor. The finished
product is then shipped duty-free to the U.S. or exported elsewhere. 
<P>
     Despite charges by Perot and others that the maquiladora program
has hurt the U.S. economy, it has not caused a net loss of U.S. jobs.
To the contrary, by reducing labor costs, this program has allowed
U.S. manufacturers to remain globally competitive and keep their U.S.
plants operating. (For more information see:  Wesley R.  Smith, "The
NAFTA Debate, Part I:  A Primer on Labor, Environmental, and Legal
Issues," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No.  936, April 9, 1993.)
<P>
     According to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR),
the maquiladora program will effectively end once the NAFTA is in
place; all imported parts from the U.S. will enter Mexico without
custom changes or conditions. The free trade pact, moreover, will
eliminate maquiladora rules that prevent Mexican-based U.S. companies
from selling their products in Mexico. Maquiladoras can now sell only
20 percent of their products in Mexico. (U.S.  Department of Labor,
"Economic Discussion Paper #29," August 1988, p.  17.) Under the
NAFTA, there will be no such restrictions. Instead, U.S. maquiladoras
will be allowed to sell 100 percent of their products in the Mexican
market. Perot and Choate claim that most U.S. exports to Mexico have
been funneled through the maquiladoras to the U.S. for re-export. This
is incorrect. Instead, an estimated 83 percent of U.S. export growth
to Mexico has been for Mexican consumption, and not for re-export.
(Correcting the Record:  Response of the Office of the U.S.  Trade
Representative to the Perot/Choate NAFTA Book, September 2, 1993, p. 
27.)
<P>
Myth #8:Low wages will lead U.S. automotive companies to relocate
      their plants to Mexico, thereby threatening the jobs of U.S.
      auto workers. (Perot and Choate, pp.  9-10 and 31-33.)
<P>
Reality: <P>
     A study of the NAFTA by the U.S. Office of Technology (OTA)
demonstrates that such assertions by Perot and Choate are unfounded.
The OTA reports that it costs a Mexican plant $9,180 to deliver a car
to the U.S. market, compared to $8,770 for a U.S. auto maker.
("U.S.-Mexico Trade:  Pulling Together of Pulling Apart," Congress of
the United States, Office of Technology Assessment, October 1992.)
Mexico's high shipping, parts, and inventory costs more than offset
its lower labor costs. Furthermore, the U.S. cost advantage grows as
Mexican wages rise. Under the NAFTA, moreover, U.S. exports of
automobiles to Mexico will greatly increase, thereby increasing jobs
in the American automotive industry. 
<P>
     There is another problem with Perot's and Choate's analysis. They
fail to acknowledge that the current U.S. tariff on Mexican
automobiles is only 2.5 percent. In contrast, Mexico's tariff on U.S.-
made cars is 20 percent, or eight times higher than the U.S. duty.
Under the free trade pact with Mexico, this tariff will be cut in half
almost immediately and then fully eliminated over the next nine years.
The Big Three U.S. auto producers estimate that the NAFTA will
increase annual U.S. exports to Mexico from 1,000 vehicles a year
today to over 60,000 vehicles in the first year of the free trade
accord. (The Kiplinger Washington Letter, September 10, 1993, p.  1.)
<P>
     The NAFTA also will end the requirement for U.S. automotive
companies to manufacture in Mexico in order to sell there. Moreover,
it will eliminate Mexican local content and local production
requirements that have encouraged U.S. automobile and parts
manufacturers to move production and jobs to Mexico. With NAFTA, the
U.S. will be able to increase significantly automobile and auto parts
exports to Mexico. Without the NAFTA, Mexico will almost certainly
maintain its high tariff and non-tariff barriers on U.S. cars.
(Correcting the Record, pp.  5 and 23.)
<P>
Myth #9: The NAFTA will hurt U.S. farmers and agricultural interests.
      (Perot and Choate, pp.  10-11.)
<P>
Reality: <P>
     Under the NAFTA, the U.S. and Mexico will eliminate all tariffs,
import quotas, and licenses on all agricultural products on January 1,
1994. However, according to economists Steven Globerman and Michael
Walker, "The agriculture sector is politically sensitive to [trade]
liberalization, and this was acknowledged by the longer transition
period (15 years) granted for certain products both for the U.S. and
Mexico. Special treatment was given to sugar, frozen orange juice
concentrate, peanuts, and certain fruits and vegetables (asparagus,
broccoli, cantaloupe, and cucumbers) for the U.S. and for corn, dry
beans, and milk powder for Mexico." (Globerman and Walker, op.  cit. 
p.  150.) Both the Bush and Clinton Administrations have predicted
that the U.S. agriculture sector and American farmer will be big
winners under the NAFTA. Conservative estimates show an expected
increase of $2 billion to $2.5 billion in U.S. agricultural exports
annually to Mexico by the end of the transition period. 
<P>
     The NAFTA will end decades of agricultural socialism in Mexico.
By opening up the Mexican market to U.S. agricultural products and
equipment, the U.S. economy will benefit and millions of jobs will be
created. Moreover, under the NAFTA, U.S. investment in Mexican
agriculture, which was once shunned, will now be encouraged. Finally,
American consumers will benefit under the NAFTA because they will have
a wider variety of food products at a lower cost.
<P>
Myth #10: Since the NAFTA was not submitted to Congress prior to June
      1, 1993, it is not covered under the so-called fast track trade
      authority. (Perot and Choate,  pp.  14-16.)
<P>
Reality: <P>
     Fast track trade authority, which has been used by U.S.
Presidents since 1974, is essential for negotiating and ratifying free
trade pacts. Fast track powers allow the White House to negotiate
trade accords without the threat of the many congressional amendments
that would almost certainly kill most trade agreements. Moreover, they
call for an up-or-down vote once the agreement is submitted to
Congress. Perot and Choate contend that the fast track powers no
longer apply to the NAFTA since the pact was not sent to Congress
prior to June 1, 1993, when the two-year fast track authority ended. 
<P>
     Once again Perot and Choate do not understand the facts. In a
report titled Correcting the Record, the USTR calls this passage in
the book "pure fiction." It stresses that because of the 1991 fast
track legislation, fast track procedures remain available for trade
agreements signed by the U.S. President prior to May 31, 1993.
President Bush signed the NAFTA on December 17, 1992, over five months
prior to the deadline. Consequently, the USTR correctly states that
"fast track procedures [are] still available for NAFTA; no new
legislation [is] needed."
<P>
Myth #11: The fast track authority gave President Bush the authority
      to negotiate the agreement "in complete secrecy without the
      participation of either Congress or the U.S. public." (Perot and
      Choate, p.  14.)
<P>
Reality:  <P>
     On the contrary, no trade agreement in history has been the
subject of as many consultations as the NAFTA. During the negotiation
process, the Administration held nearly 1,000 consultations or
briefings with individuals outside the executive branch. These
included public hearings at which hundreds of individuals testified,
350 meetings with official advisory committees, and repeated contacts
with key members of the House and Senate.
<P>
Myth #12: Some regions of the U.S., especially the midwestern states,
      will be hurt by the NAFTA. (Perot and Choate, pp.  34-37.)
<P>
Reality: <P>
     A June 1993 study by The Heritage Foundation demonstrates that
the NAFTA will benefit the country as a whole, not just one or two
particular regions. (Douglas Seay and Wesley Smith, "Why the Governors
Support the NAFTA (And Washington Doesn't)," Heritage Foundation
Backgrounder No.  946, June 15, 1993.) According to the study, at
least 41 of the country's fifty governors support the agreement, with
the others remaining undecided. Their confidence in the NAFTA stems
from the fact that most states already have seen sharp increases in
exports to Mexico over the last five years. The U.S. Department of
Commerce estimates that nearly every state in the nation has
benefitted from increased trade with Mexico, with every region in the
U.S. posting large increases in exports to Mexico last year.
(Statistics provided by the U.S.  Department of Commerce.) According
to their figures, 31 states doubled their exports to Mexico, while
fifteen states tripled their exports. In fact, the industrial midwest
-- home to such NAFTA opponents as Democrat Representatives David
Bonior of Michigan and Marcy Kaptur of Ohio -- posted a 90 percent
increase in exports to Mexico just since 1987. Other examples from the
same period of time: Illinois turned in a 417 percent increase;
Wisconsin, a 247 percent increase; Ohio, a 188 percent increase;
Indiana, a 30 percent increase; and Michigan, a 32 percent increase.
(Statistics provided by the U.S.  Department of Commerce.)
<P>
Myth #13: NAFTA does not sufficiently address environmental issues.
      (Perot and Choate, p.  99.)
<P>
Reality: <P>
     The NAFTA does more than any trade agreement in history to
protect the environment. The NAFTA explicitly ensures America's right
to safeguard its environment, while encouraging Canada and Mexico to
strengthen their environmental standards.
<P>
     The NAFTA side accords create a North American Commission on the
Environment which will oversee the enforcement of each country's
environmental laws. Any individual, business, independent
organization, or government will be able to file a complaint with the
commission. Disputes over one country's repeated failure to enforce
its national labor and environmental standards will be mediated by the
commission. If the matter cannot be resolved effectively, the
disagreement will be forwarded to an arbitration panel of independent
experts. If the panel finds that a signatory country has persistently
failed to comply with already agreed-upon standards, it will then be
free to impose fines. If violations persist, trade sanctions in the
form of quotas and tariffs could be placed on the violating country
with a maximum financial loss of $20 million per year. Moreover, if
the NAFTA goes through, the White House has agreed to establish a $4
billion environment fund to clean up the 2,000-mile border with
Mexico. 
<P>
     Because of the NAFTA's efforts to protect and clean the
environment, several prominent environmental groups have voiced their
support of the free trade pact. Last September 16, the leaders of six
environmental groups, including the National Audubon Society and the
National Wildlife Federation, vowed that they would help the White
House fight for congressional passage of the NAFTA. They view the
NAFTA as the only mechanism for improving environmental conditions in
Mexico and along the border. If the NAFTA is defeated and Mexico
remains a poor nation, it will not have the resources or the
motivation to take strong steps to safeguard the environment. (Keith
Schneider, "Environmental Groups are Split on Support for Free-Trade
Pact," The New York Times, September 16, 1993.) According to Kathryn
Fuller, President of the World Wildlife Fund, "Our support of NAFTA
boiled down to this: The environment in North America -- and the
global environment, for that matter -- will be better off with NAFTA
than without it." (Bob Dart, "Six National Groups on Environment
Endorse NAFTA," The Washington Times, September 21, 1993.) 
<P>
Myth #14: NAFTA will undermine U.S. food safety and health
      regulations. (Perot and Choate, pp.  82-83.)
<P>
Reality: <P>
     The NAFTA permits the U.S. or any individual state or city to set
its own health and sanitary standards as high as it wants, as long as
it shows a scientific basis for its standards and it treats domestic
products the same way as imports. (J.W.  Anderson, "Perot's Little
Book of NAFTA Nonsense," The Washington Post, September 5, 1993.)
Moreover, the supplemental agreements to the NAFTA include a
commitment by the three signatories to "harmonize standards upward"
for food and health regulations. While the NAFTA's provisions will
discourage a "downward harmonization" of health and safety standards,
it does not require the U.S. to change any particular standards.
Instead, claims the U.S.Trade Representative, "the NAFTA creates a
process by which the three countries can try to reach greater
compatibility of standards, but does not require [the U.S.] to agree
to any particular change in standard." (Correcting the Record, pp. 
48-49.)
<P>
Myth #15: The NAFTA jeopardizes the safety of American travelers by
      opening U.S. roads and highways to Mexican trucks and drivers
      that do not meet minimum U.S. safety standards. (Perot and
      Choate, pp.  3-6.)
<P>
Reality: <P>
 There is not a single provision in the NAFTA agreement that exempts
Mexican vehicles or drivers from U.S. safety and environmental
standards. All Mexican trucks entering U.S. territory will have to
comply fully with all applicable safety and emissions standards, and
these will be enforced regardless of the nationality of the operator.
All U.S. safety regulations on truck weight, size, brakes, and
servicing will be enforced against Mexican drivers. So, too, will be
U.S. regulations covering the expertise of the drivers and their
ability to read and speak English. Moreover, Mexican drivers will be
tested for licensing according to a standard that is fully compatible
with that in the U.S.
<P>
Myth #16: Under the NAFTA, smuggling drugs into the U.S will become
      much easier. (Perot and Choate, pp.  6-7.)
<P>
Reality: <P>
     Once again, Perot and Choate are misguided. Under the NAFTA,
border control will gradually be expanded. In fact, since U.S. Customs
agents will be focusing increasingly less on the assessment and
collection of tariffs, they and other officials will have more time to
inspect shipments for illegal narcotics. 
<P>
     If the free trade pact is passed, moreover, the improved ties
between the U.S. and Mexico will be cemented and cooperation in law
enforcement efforts will grow. The economic benefits that the NAFTA
will bring to Mexico will also allow it to dedicate more of its own
resources to fighting the drug trade. More important, free trade with
the U.S. will generate new and better paying jobs in Mexico, thereby
making it more likely that Mexicans will reject the temptation to
engage in the narcotics business. The use of Mexico's agricultural
land for drug crops also will likely decline over time as more acreage
of legal export crops are produced for export to the U.S. The removal
of U.S. trade barriers on Mexican fruits, vegetables, and other
agricultural products will reduce the incentive to grow such illegal
crops as marijuana and opium poppies. (See Michael G.  Wilson, "The
NAFTA Debate, Part II:  A Primer on Political, Security, and Human
Rights Issues," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No.  950, July 19,
1993, pp.  6-8.) As the U.S. Trade Representative's office argues,
"Nothing in the NAFTA limits [the U.S.] ability to stop illegal drugs"
flowing across the border.
<P>
     According to a senior anti-narcotics official in the U.S.
government, who wishes to remain unnamed, a rejection of the NAFTA
would result in "a serious setback in U.S.-Mexican cooperation in the
fight against drug trafficking." Salinas would view it as "a slap in
the face," says the official, and the Mexican government would likely
be far less willing to work closely with the U.S. to interdict drugs
and destroy drug crops in Mexico. 
<P>
Myth #17: The NAFTA will increase illegal immigration in the U.S.
      (Perot and Choate, p.  72.)
<P>
Reality:  <P>
     For many years, large numbers of Mexican workers have been coming
to the U.S., legally or illegally, in search of higher wages and a
better life. In 1990, for example, there were approximately 4.5
million Mexican-born residents in the U.S. This number, which does not
count all illegal aliens, represents about 21 percent of all foreign-
born residents. Germans, with 1.2 million residents, or 5.4 percent of
foreign-born residents, make up the second largest group.
("U.S.-Mexico Trade:  Pulling Together or Pulling Apart?," Office of
Technology Assessment, U.S.  Congress, January 1993, pp.  116-117.)
Moreover, in 1992 alone, the U.S. Border Patrol arrested 1.2 million
people attempting to cross illegally into the U.S. from Mexico.
("Mexico:  Respect Restored," The Economist, February 13, 1993, p. 
4.) 
<P>
     Many people argue that these immigrants have contributed greatly
to the U.S. economy and culture, helping businesses survive labor
shortages and making the U.S. economy more productive. Others,
however, contend that too many illegal immigrants are entering the
U.S., straining social services and taking jobs away from American
workers. 
<P>
     As economic growth in Mexico leads to gains in wages and living
standards, some of the pressure to emigrate to the U.S. will abate.
The expected increase in foreign direct investment in Mexico under a
NAFTA is estimated to range from $25 billion to $52 billion from 1992
to 2000. ("Investment, Trade, and U.S.  Gains in the NAFTA," U.S. 
Council of the Mexico-U.S.  Business Committee, The Council of the
Americas, 1992, p.  12.) As a result, economic growth rates in Mexico
under the free trade pact could reach as high as 6 percent a year over
the next decade. Such high growth rates will produce an estimated
609,000 new jobs south of the border. (Hufbauer and Schott, op.  cit.)
Finding jobs in Mexico will eliminate one of the main incentives for
Mexicans to leave their homes for the U.S.
<P>
     These new jobs in Mexico will also pay better wages. With the
NAFTA, wages in Mexico are expected to grow by as much as 16 percent
in the coming years. (Wilson, op.  cit.   pp.  8-9.) The allure of
higher- paying and better-quality jobs in Mexico will almost certainly
convince many Mexicans to stay at home and contribute to their own
economy. Polls indicate that when given a choice between staying in
Mexico and working, or illegally crossing the border to work in the
U.S., the vast majority of Mexicans surveyed said that they would
rather stay in their own country.
<P>
     By contrast, a rejection of the NAFTA could drive down wage
levels in Mexico and slow down the growth in new export-related jobs.
This would diminish the standard of living in Mexico, making it more
likely that Mexican citizens will cross the border illegally into the
U.S. seeking employment. Moreover, if new trade barriers are erected
between the U.S. and Mexico, farmers and industries in U.S. border
states like California and Texas also will see their businesses
damaged and revenues fall. It is possible then that they would be more
tempted to hire illegal aliens as a cost-cutting measure, thereby
actually increasing the number of illegal immigrants in the U.S.
(Estimates of undocumented immigration are by nature unreliable. 
However, the total number of illegal residents in the U.S.  is thought
to be in the range of 2 million to 3 million, increasing at about
200,000 a year.  Mexican are believed to make up two-thirds to
three-fourths of the undocumented population, with many of the others
from elsewhere in Latin America.) 
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
     Ross Perot and Pat Choate conclude their book by saying: "The
first action that is required of Congress is to reject NAFTA.
Congress' second action should be to reauthorize the president to
negotiate a win-win trade deal with Mexico."  (Perot and Choate, pp. 
102-103.)
<P>
     A rejection of the NAFTA would dramatically curtail trade
opportunities with America's fastest growing foreign market. It would
also result in soured U.S.-Mexico relations and a setback in President
Salinas's free market and democratic reform program. Moreover, a
failure of the free trade agreement would not only halt the spread of
free trade in the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean, but dampen
as well the prospects for reaching an agreement in the Uruguay Round
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks in Geneva. 
<P>
     Belief in America. NAFTA opponents believe that America cannot
compete in the global market. NAFTA supporters, on the other hand,
believe in America's strength and ability to compete. The choice,
therefore, is clear: does the U.S. wish to risk job loss and possibly
economic depression as the result of isolationism and protectionism?
Or does the U.S. want to take a leadership role in the global economic
community, seeking out new markets for its goods and investments,
thereby making American more competitive and creating new, higher-
paying jobs? 
<P>
     For Robert Matsui, the California Democrat, and Jim Kolbe, the
Arizona Republican, the choice is clear. As they stated in a May 28
letter to Perot, "Growing trade is an important engine of economic
growth. What greater proof of this is there than the period of
prosperity that has been enjoyed by the United States and the West
since World War II.... Circling the wagons and ignoring our trading
partners will not only hurt us competitively, but will also
disadvantage our whole region as a trading force in the international
market. We firmly believe that NAFTA will promote growth and
employment in our country... and continue our role as the dominant and
competitive force in the world."

<h2> Ending the Fed's Free Ride
</h2>
Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
<p>


Today's civics test: what Washington institution can make or  
break elections, bail out entire foreign governments, send the  
stock market to the stratosphere, or bankrupt whole industries,  
yet operates with less oversight than even the CIA?  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


One hint: the U.S. Constitution is useless as a cheat sheet  
(as it would be for any realistic civics exam these days.) The 
answer is the Federal Reserve, the most powerful yet least  
questioned any D.C. bureaucracy. Will that soon change?  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


At issue is a new report on the Fed, released by Government  
Accounting Office just as Alan Greenspan seeks Senate  
confirmation for his third term. The report pulled back the  
curtain, just a smidgen, on the Fed's notorious secrecy. Now some  
Senators and pressure groups are gearing up to give the Fed the  
what-for.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Among other revelations in the report is the Fed's  
heretofore secret "contingency fund"--that is, slush  
fund--totaling $3.7 billion. It comes from money that the Fed has  
skimmed off the revenues gained from its open-market operations.  
Everyone thought revenues were turned over to the Treasury.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


And that's far from the only slush sluicing through the  
halls of the Fed's marble temple on Constitution Ave. From 1988  
to 1994, the Fed's spending on its own lifestyle grew at twice  
the rate of inflation.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Mr. Greenspan protests the suggestion that the Fed is  
wasting taxpayer dollars. He's technically right. The Fed doesn't  
need our taxes any more than a counterfeiter needs to hold up the  
local gas station. The central bank using fancy finance to  
effectively print all the money it needs.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


In its never-ending quest to expand money and credit, the  
Fed can lower the rate it charges member banks for loans, it can  
manipulate reserve requirements, or, most notoriously, it can buy  
Treasury securities on the open market.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


It's this last action that proves so profitable. The Fed  
purchases Treasury securities--either directly or through  
favorite brokerage houses--and holds this debt as an asset.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Working through its branches and member banks, it pyramids  
loans on top of these securities. The creditworthiness of the  
U.S. government--whose balance sheet would otherwise suggest  
Chapter 7--is entirely due to this power of the Fed.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The real oddity--and this is where the power to counterfeit  
comes in--is where the Fed gets the money to purchase these debt  
securities. It creates it out of thin air, a magic trick made  
easier as the current paper money system replaced the restrictive gold 
standard.   
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


If anyone tries this at home, the Justice Department lands  
him in the pokey. When third-world countries are rumored to be  
circulating phony dollars, the military threatens to bomb them.  
To stop counterfeiting is why the Treasury says it redesigned the  
$100 bill. It could also be cracking down on the competition.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Now to the Fed's just-discovered $3.7 billion slush fund. It  
represents a small slice of the profits the Fed derives from  
exacting interest payments on the debt it holds. And who pays  
that interest? You and me, in the form of tax dollars. At the end  
of the year, the Fed gives some back and keeps the rest.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The original argument for creating the Fed is that it would  
eliminate banking crises that cause bank depositors to lose their  
money. Well, after 1913, the recessions increased in frequency,  
the government became vastly bigger, and the dollar lost about 97  
percent of its value. In one way or another, depositors have lost  
more money than ever.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The Fed's fingerprints are all over these trends. Every new  
dollar created by the Fed's operations (all else being equal)  
waters down the value of the existing dollars circulating in the  
economy. And an ever-cheaper dollar redistributes money from  
savers to debtors, and from the tax-paying middle class to the  
banks and government contractors that spend the fresh money  
before prices rise.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


We hear that inflation is low, but look at the long-term  
trends. The dollar has lost three quarters of its value since  
Richard Nixon eliminated the last vestiges of the gold standard 
in 1971. Even at the present rate of inflation--and who believes  
that will last?--overall prices will have doubled when today's  
newborns enter the workforce.   
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


If we want to know why living standards are falling, the  
curtain needs to be pulled back even more. If we want to stop the  
fall, we need a truly redesigned money: a Fed-proof gold dollar.

Reading, Writing, 'Rithmetic, and Ritalin
</h2>

<P>
Can it be a disease if no X-ray, CT scan, blood test, laboratory 
analysis, MRI, or any other medical test can confirm its existence?  
Can it be a disease if diagnosis can be made by anon-physician 
checking any 8 of 14 items on a behavior checklist such as 
inattention, impulsivity, hyperactivity, or short attention span?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yet, an estimated two million children (three times as many boys as 
girls) have been labeled with this disease and are taking a powerful 
drug to treat it.  That's four times as many as in 1990.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The disease is Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) or Attention Deficit 
Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and the most widely used drug to treat 
it is methylphenidate, known as Ritalin.  A powerful stimulant, it 
juices up the central nervous system, takes effect in 30 minutes, and 
peters out in three to four hours.  Ritalin is classified as a 
Schedule II controlled substance in the same category as cocaine, 
methadone and methamphetamine.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It may be coincidence, but in 1991 the U.S. Department of Education 
formally recognized ADHD as a handicap under the Individuals with 
Disabilities Education Act and Section 504 of the 1973 Rehabilitation 
Act.  After the Department directed all state education officers to 
ensure that local school districts establish procedures to screen and 
identify ADHD children and give them special educational and 
psychological services, generous funding suddenly began to flow.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Public schools have learned how to tap into free-flowing federal funds 
from Medicaid.  Letters sent home to parents brag that the schools 
"will use this new revenue to add more services for children who 
require specialized health care, social services, mental health care, 
speech therapy, counseling, and psychological services."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Capital Research Center has exposed how Goals 2000 is used as a 
cover to authorize programs in health care and create a system in 
which children selected by teachers are regularly tested for 
emotional, social, mental, and physical disorders (such as ADD and 
ADHD) in clinics inside the public schools.  Once children are 
diagnosed and labeled with one of these conditions, school health 
officials have the authority to treat them by prescribing and 
administering such medications as Ritalin, Valium, Lorazepam and 
Prozac.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Schools are starting to administer medical treatment to children under 
new, looser prescription-writing standards developed under Robert Wood 
Johnson Foundation initiatives.  These new rules allow nurse 
practitioners and physician assistants to prescribe drugs.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Goals 2000 proposals receive funding from the Department of Education, 
Medicaid, Maternal and Child Health (Title X) blockgrants, state 
programs, and private foundations.  Private foundations and government 
agencies have teamed up to develop, coordinate and support a variety 
of public school systems to govern the health and behavior of 
children, sometimes under the name Children's Initiative.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A Pittsburgh-based foundation that will not allow its name to be 
disclosed provided grants for two projects named "Pharmacological and 
Psychosocial Treatment of ADHD" and "Community-Based Treatment for 
ADHD: Summer Treatment Programs and School-Wide Interventions" to be 
operated by the University of Pittsburgh and the Gateway School 
District in Pennsylvania.  The grant funds were matched by taxpayers' 
money from the federal National Institutes of Mental Health.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One portion of this project, called the "Pittsburgh School Wide 
Intervention Model," uses a procedure called sociometrics, in which 
children are asked to answer a lot of nosy questions about the other 
kids in their class, such as who they do not want to befriends with.  
The children are instructed not to discuss the questions and answers 
with anyone else.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1994, the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Special Education 
Programs, under contract HS 92017001, gave the Chesapeake Institute of 
Washington, D.C. the funding to produce two slick videos:  "Facing the 
Challenges of ADD" featuring actress Rita Moreno, and "One Child in 
Every Classroom" with Frank Sesno as moderator.  Parts of the videos 
sound like an infomercial for Ritalin.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In a PBS documentary following eight months of investigation, a 
Department of Education spokesman was asked if he was aware that the 
parents who spoke so enthusiastically about Ritalin on the videos were 
board members of Children and Adults with Attention Deficit Disorder 
(CHADD), and if he knew that CHADD has received cash grants of 
$900,000 plus in-kind services from Ciba-Geigy, the manufacturer of 
Ritalin.  Obviously embarrassed, the bureaucrat denied such knowledge.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's clear that the Department of Education does not adhere to 
professional standards of disclosure.  When anything is published in 
the Journal of the American Medical Association, for example, the 
author must sign a statement in which he reveals "any affiliations 
with or financial involvement in any organization or entity with a 
direct financial interest in the subject matter or materials discussed 
in the manuscript."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
John Merrow, executive producer of the PBS documentary, reported that 
Ritalin is so plentiful that a black market has developed on the 
school playground.  Ritalin can be crushed and snorted for a cheap and 
modest buzz, and it has become a "gateway drug" in junior high school, 
the first drug a child experiments with.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Parents of a child who is diagnosed, labeled, or treated by school-
paid personnel would be well-advised to seek an independent, unbiased 
medical opinion.

The Road Map To Real Reform In Education 
</h2>

</a>

<P>  
Every now and then a book comes along, such as Rachel Carson's "Silent 
Spring" or Ralph Nader's "Unsafe At Any Speed," that dramatically alters 
the focus of an entire industry. "Teaching Our Children to Read" by Bill 
Honig can be such a book. It could change our entire educational system, 
not because the book will be a best-seller, but because of the author's 
credibility among educators. 


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Honig is no hero to conservatives, or to disaffected parents demanding 
school choice, or even to critics demanding school "standards" and 
"reform." He was State Superintendent of Public Instruction for California, 
1983-1993, where he presided over a school system that exemplified all the 
failures and abuses we've been complaining about for years. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Apparently, when he left office two years ago, Honig sincerely set about to 
find out why public schoolchildren are not learning how to read. He started 
from the reasonable assumption that "the first and foremost job of 
elementary school is to teach children to read." 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The most important point Honig makes, repeated at least a dozen times, is 
that a child absolutely must be "reading beginning books by mid-first 
grade." Honig emphasizes that those who miss out in the early first grade 
need "organized intervention" immediately, because otherwise they "almost 
never recover." 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Reading success depends on the child developing the ability to pick out the 
smallest "sound chunks" that make up words. Honig says that "the amount of 
time a student is engaged in phonics instruction is highly predictive of 
subsequent reading achievement." 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The discipline manifested in Honig's book is extraordinary. It contains no 
confessions, no mea culpas, no I-told-you-sos, no recriminations, no 
put-downs, no pejoratives, no assessing of credit or blame, no targeting of 
enemies, no sanctimonious self- righteousness. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Honig's book is just a straightforward explanation, based on voluminous 
research and empirical evidence, of how children can and should be taught 
to read. It's a fair inference that its message is a plea for the schools 
to get going on this task because, if the schools fail in this preeminent 
mission, nothing else matters. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A Great Debate has been going on for years between the advocates of phonics 
(i.e., teaching the child to sound out the syllables of the English 
language and put them together like building blocks) and the advocates of 
Whole Language (i.e., teaching the child to guess at the words by looking 
at the pictures and to substitute words that fit the context of the story). 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Honig calls the phonics-Whole Language debate a "destructive controversy," 
asserts that it should not be an "either/or" question, and recommends a 
"balanced" approach. This is a skillful way of assuring that semantics do 
not screen out the meat of his presentation. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He bows to the Whole Language movement, crediting it with introducing 
children to "good literature." But Honig reminds us that exposure to good 
literature "only works if the student actually reads the words correctly -- 
making mistakes doesn't help." 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then, Honig exposes the Whole Language myth that the child will learn 
"naturally," without explicit instruction in skills, in the same way that a 
child learns to talk. He says this false belief is far too prevalent and 
has had the "disastrous" result that 30% to 40% of urban children can't 
read at all and more than 50% can't read at their grade level. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Honig explains that "bad habits of guessing" make learning to read much 
more difficult, and these bad habits cannot be remedied by a sporadic, 
unsystematic use of phonics. He says that "beginning readers who rely too 
heavily on contextual clues, such as pictures or the connection of other 
words in the passage, are distracted from looking at the letters in a word 
and connecting those letter patterns to words in their minds." 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Honig argues for teaching children to write and to spell accurately in the 
first grade, too. "Inventive spelling" shouldn't be allowed past mid-first 
grade; children's misspellings should be corrected so erroneous patterns 
are not reinforced. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How widespread are wrong teaching methods in public schools today? Honig 
says that "very few instructional programs currently in use provide 
children with materials designed specifically to connect with systematic 
and sequenced skills development. In some cases, state, county, district, 
or university leaders are overtly or subtly antagonistic to the skills 
components and discourage phonics teaching." 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This isn't a book for parents. Honig obviously thinks that parents have no 
direct role in the mechanics of teaching children to read because that's 
the job for the public school. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Besides, most parents won't be able to cope with his endless educrat 
jargon: phonological awareness and processing, phonemic segmentation, 
explicit skill development strand, word-attack skills, alphabetic 
principle, orthographic phase, syntactic awareness, and metacognitional and 
strategic assistance. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But this highfalutin way of talking about phonics is just right for 
teachers, administrators and policymakers. It's a road map to get them back 
on the track of teaching children how to read, which should be the schools' 
number-one mission.

<TITLE>A U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement -- Heritage </TITLE>

<CENTER><H2><I>A U.S.-CHILE FREE TRADE AGREEMENT:</I></H2>
<H3><I>IGNITING ECONOMIC PROSPERITY IN THE AMERICAS</I></H3>

By Michael G. Wilson<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder #909<BR>
July 31, 1992<P></CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>




INTRODUCTION<P>
      During a May 13 to 15 visit to Washington by Chilean President
Patricio Aylwin, George Bush announced that the United States soon
will embark on free trade negotiations with Chile. (For an in depth
analysis of U.S.-Chilean relations, see: Michael G. Wilson, "A U.S.
Role in Chile's Democratic and Economic Reforms," Heritage Foundation
Backgrounder No. 837, June 20, 1991.) Although Chile's economy is
small and has relatively little impact on the U.S., a free trade
agreement (FTA) with Chile would benefit America in a number of ways.
It would advance Bush's Enterprise for the Americas Initiative (EAI),
which seeks to create a Western Hemisphere free trade zone stretching
from Alaska to Antarctica. (The EAI was first announced by Bush on
June 27, 1990, and has attracted widespread support from hemispheric
leaders. Besides creating a free trade zone stretching from Alaska to
Antarctica, the EAI seeks to spur regional prosperity and stability by
assisting Latin American countries in attracting foreign investment,
offering debt relief, and advancing free market solutions to
environmental protection.) This would benefit U.S. long-term political
and economic interests in the Americas. It also would highlight
Chile's leadership in free market reform and en- courage the spread of
free trade throughout Latin America. A U.S.-Chile FTA also would help
sustain Chile's impressive economic growth. And it would bolster
Chile's democratic reform program, while demonstrating a strong U.S.
commitment to Latin America.<P>
      Despite these benefits, the Bush Administration wants to move
slowly. The White House announced on May 13 that negotiations with
Chile would begin only after the North America Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) talks with Canada and Mexico are completed. However, Chile,
which signed an FTA with Mexico on September 22, 1991, wants to move
ahead with the free trade negotiations sooner. Chilean business and
government leaders have argued that the U.S. and Chile should launch
free trade talks as quickly as possible, rather than waiting for the
conclusion of the NAFTA talks. 
<P>
      Chileans have a right to be impatient with the Bush
Administration. Bush visited Santiago in December 1990, telling his
Chilean hosts that they soon would be the first country in South
America to strike a free trade deal with the U.S. (Leslie Crawford,
"Chile Grows Weary of U.S. Procrastination Over FTA," The Financial
Times, June 3, 1992, p. 5.) But after nineteen months, there has been
little action. To get things moving, Bush should: 
<P>
Begin free trade talks with Chile as soon as possible.<P>
      The Bush Administration should complete free trade talks with
Chile by next May, when the Administration loses its special "fast
track" negotiating authority from Congress. (Fast track authority was
granted to the Bush Administration by Congress in May 1991. Under fast
track authority, trade agreements are guaranteed an up-or-down vote by
Congress, without nuisance amendments and protectionist tinkering that
almost certainly would kill most trade negotiations.) Waiting to begin
talks until after the November presidential elections or until
Congress votes on NAFTA, probably sometime next spring, could place a
U.S.-Chile free trade pact in jeopardy. First, there is no guarantee
that Bush, the FTA's biggest champion, will be re-elected. (Democratic
Presidential candidate Bill Clinton, not a strong promoter of free
trade, has yet to announce a position with regard to the proposed
U.S.-Chile FTA. He has given only tentative support to the NAFTA.
Bush, on the other hand, is strongly committed to advancing free trade
in the Americas through bilateral agreements and the EAI.) And second,
mounting protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congress could delay
NAFTA indefinitely or even derail it, thereby torpedoing any other
free trade pact in the region. 
<P>
Make it clear that while Chile is the first country to participate in
the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative, others soon will follow.
<P>This will demonstrate a strong U.S. commitment to advancing the
EAI and will encourage continued free market reforms throughout the
region.
<P>
      Once the negotiations are underway, a U.S.-Chile FTA should:
<P>
Quickly phase out all tariff and most non-tariff barriers to trade
with Chile.
<P>
Lower all other barriers to international trade and investment. 
  <P>    This should include agreements on such issues as intellectual
property rights, fair access to natural resources, removing
restrictions on foreign ownership, strong property rights laws,
environmental regulations, labor laws, and health standards.
<P>
Provide for periods of adjustment to less competitive industries
hardest hit by an FTA. 
<P>      While it is unlikely that there will be any employment shifts or
losses in the U.S. as a result of a U.S.-Chile FTA, small adjustment
periods will help minimize not only relocation and retraining costs
for some employees, but profit losses for companies involved in the
fruit growing, textiles, and mining sectors.
<P>
Create procedures and mechanisms to resolve potential trade disputes.
   <P>   Complex environmental and labor laws in the U.S., combined with
overlapping jurisdictions of power between state and federal agencies
and judicial systems, can create barriers to trade with other
countries. These and other types of non-tariff barriers need to be
reduced. To do this, the U.S. and Chile should establish a commission
to settle rapidly trade disputes over environmental, labor, or health
laws that block free trade.
<P>
Establish "rules of origin." 
    <P>  These are rules that govern the export of goods manufactured
with items imported from a country not participating in the free trade
agreement. As in all FTAs, these rules will be necessary to prevent
other countries from taking advantage of the duty-free provisions in
the trade treaty.

<P>
CHILE: FROM SOCIALISM TO A FREE MARKET MODEL
  <P>    Chile is an ideal candidate for a free trade agreement with the
U.S. because its economic reforms have been so successful. Chile
embarked on its campaign of free market reforms in the mid-1970s. The
government of Augusto Pinochet eliminated price controls, reduced
tariffs across the board to a flat rate of approximately 10 percent,
privatized most of Chile's large state-owned companies, cut back
restrictions on foreign investment, and reduced taxes.
<P>
      This economic reform paid off. Since the mid-1980s, the economy
grew an average annual rate of 5.7 percent, inflation dropped to 18
percent from 500 percent in 1973, (James R. Whelan, Out of the Ashes:
Life, Death and Transfiguration of Democracy in Chile, 1833-1988
(Washingon, D.C.: Regnery Gateway, 1989), p. 418.) unemployment
decreased from 12 percent to approximately 4.5 percent today, average
salaries are rising, and exports climbed last year to over 30 percent
of Chile's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). (See Alejandro Foxley, "The
Future of U.S.-Chilean Relations," Heritage Lecture No. 323, May 1,
1991.) Chilean products are of high quality and compete favorably in
world markets. Because foreign investors are offered low taxes, strong
legal protection of their investments and property, and favorable
rules on taking home profits, they have invested some $6 billion in
Chile since 1985. By the mid-1990s, foreigners are expected to commit
some $10 billion in new capital to Chile's robust economy. (For more
information see John F. H. Purcell and Dirk W. Damrau, "Chile: An
Investment-Grade Credit," Salomon Brothers, May 1991.)
<P>

GROWING U.S.-CHILEAN ECONOMIC TIES  <P>
      This successful record of free market reforms and Chile's new
democratic government is behind the U.S. interest in free trade talks
with Chile. Washington and Santiago signed a free trade and investment
framework agreement on October 1, 1990, paving the way for a U.S.-
Chile FTA. The accord established a joint U.S.-Chile Council on Trade
and Investment to monitor bilateral economic ties and to further open
markets to both nations. On the Council's agenda are how to: cooperate
in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations in the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), increase access to each other's
markets, protect intellectual property rights, spur foreign
investments, and promote the EAI. 
<P>
      These trade talks come on the heels of ballooning trade between
Chile and the U.S. Trade between the two countries has grown without
interruption for eight straight years, reaching some $3.4 billion in
1991. The U.S., in fact, is Chile's principal trading partner,
accounting for about 20 percent of Chile's total imports and absorbing
17 percent of its exports. Within the past decade, U.S.-Chilean trade
doubled in volume. ("Chile Economic Trends Report," Embassy of the
United States, Santiago, Chile, November 1990, p. 19.)
<P>
      According to the Central Bank of Chile, Chilean exports to the
U.S. in 1991 reached almost $1.6 billion. The composition of these
exports, however, has changed over the past ten years. While copper
continues to be the main U.S. import, other Chilean goods such as
fresh fruit, seafood, chemical products, and wine have found their way
to the American marketplace. 
<P>
      U.S. exports to Chile, America's 35th largest market, totaled
approximately $1.8 billion in 1991. This represents an increase of 10
percent from 1990. Chile's imports from the U.S. are heavily weighted
toward high-tech equipment, such as computers, and consumer goods.
(For more information on the content and quantity of U.S.-Chile trade,
see "Trade and Investment Between Chile and the United States for
1990," Embassy of Chile, August 1991.)
<P>
      The U.S. also is the principal foreign investor in Chile's
banking, insurance, forestry, mining, light manufacturing, and
agricultural industries. As a result of the high returns on foreign
investments in Chile, a total of $1.3 billion in foreign investment
flowed into Chile in 1990 alone. This amount equaled 5 percent of
Chile's GDP, the highest rate of growth in Latin America and six times
the average rate for the region.

<P>
NINE REASONS FOR A FREE TRADE PACT WITH CHILE<P>
      Building on this legacy of expanded free trade is reason enough
to begin free trade talks with Chile. But there are other reasons as
well -- nine, in fact. They are:
<P>
Reason #1: 
Chile's economy is one of the most open and advanced in Latin America
and would be the easiest with which to negotiate an FTA. 
<P>
      Chile has moved farther and faster than virtually any other
country in Latin America in implementing free market reforms. When
Pinochet seized power from the Socialist government of Salvador
Allende in September 1973, a bold economic reform program based upon
private enterprise and an open market was launched. Following its
election in December 1990, the democratic Aylwin government has
continued this free market program with great success. For example,
Chile has reduced its government-owned enterprises from approximately
500 in the mid-1970s to about 50 today. Moreover, the average tariff
rate has dropped from about 105 percent during the Allende years to 11
percent this year. And while Chile's GDP was shrinking by some 12
percent in the early 1970s, this year it likely will grow by 7.5
percent. ("U.S. Market Access in Latin America: Recent Liberalization
Measures and Remaining Obstacles," United States International Trade
Commission Report No. 2521, June 1992, pp. 5-1 to 5-22.) Consequently,
Chile's economy is one of the fastest growing and most open in the
world. 
<P>
      Because of Chile's free market reforms, its economic success
story, and its open economy, a U.S.-Chile FTA will be relatively easy
to negotiate. Potential disputes over excessive trade barriers, high
taxes, unprotected property rights, foreign ownership limitations,
profit repatriation, and government subsidized industry will not
greatly complicate trade negotiations with Santiago.
<P>
Reason #2:
      Chile's return to democracy would be rewarded and strengthened.
<P>
      An FTA with Chile will help the Aylwin government's democratic
reforms succeed by making Chile economically prosperous and stable. A
free trade pact with the U.S., the world's largest economy, will
create new and better paying jobs in Chile, thereby lessening
political tensions caused by poverty and unemployment. An FTA also
will help sustain Chile's impressive economic growth rate.
<P>
Reason #3: 
Bush's Enterprise for the Americas Initiative would be accelerated.
<P>
      The completion of a U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement would
accelerate Bush's EAI by encouraging other bilateral and multilateral
FTAs throughout the Americas. Such free trade agreements are a major
goal of EAI, which was launched by Bush in June 1990. An FTA with
Chile would be tangible proof that the Initiative's goals are
attainable and that Washington is committed to improving trade ties
and promoting economic opportunity in the Americas. If, however, Chile
fails to obtain a free trade agreement from the U.S., other countries
in Latin America would be discouraged. As Alejandro Foxley, Chile's
Finance Minister, put it: "We are impatient to see concrete results
from the U.S. president's Enterprise for the Americas Initiative.
Middle income countries like Chile are experiencing trade negotiation
fatigue." (Crawford, op. cit., p. 5.) 
<P>
      The EAI cannot advance without a Chilean FTA because Washington
needs Santiago's leadership and example to encourage other countries
in the region to adopt similar free market economic policies. Chile,
moreover, is the only country other than Mexico that is ready today to
sign an FTA with the U.S.
<P>
Reason #4: 
Other countries in Latin America would be encouraged to follow Chile's
democratic and free market model. 
      <P>
      Rapidly concluding an FTA with Chile would encourage other
countries in Latin America to imitate Chile's successful economic and
democratic reforms. These countries are eager to sign free trade pacts
with Washington. They believe that these agreements will attract
American investment and boost exports to the U.S. If Chile's reform
program is rewarded with an FTA, other Latin American countries will
conclude that their reforms also will be rewarded. Already Argentina,
Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Uruguay, and Venezuela are
modeling much of their economic reform programs on Chile's. It is
especially important that they do so in light of the September 1991
coup in Haiti, the failed February 1992 coup attempt in Venezuela, and
the April 1992 military-backed coup in neighboring Peru by President
Alberto Fujimori. The momentum toward democracy and free market
reforms, first started by Chile, must not be allowed to slow because
of setbacks in these troubled nations.
<P>
Reason #5: 
Chile's long-term economic and political stability would be promoted.
<P>
      An FTA will help institutionalize the free market and democratic
advances made in Chile. This would be done by increasing Chilean
exports, creating new and better jobs, attracting new foreign
investment, and generating increased wealth and economic stability.
The more productive the ties between Chile and the world's largest
free market democracy, the greater the possibility of long-term
success for Chile's free market and democratic revolutions.
<P>
Reason #6: 
There is little opposition from U.S. labor unions. 
<P>
      A free trade agreement with Chile will meet little opposition
from organized labor in the U.S. In fact, the AFL-CIO is not all that
concerned about an FTA with Chile. ("U.S.-Chile FTA May be in Works,"
The News, Mexico City, Mexico, May 3, 1992, p. 19.) The reason:
Chilean sales of fruit and seafood to the U.S. require the intensive
use of American labor at ports, and thus will create new jobs there.
The obstacle in the U.S. for a FTA with Chile, therefore, is not
protectionism, but indifference.
<P>
Reason #7: 
There is little competition from Chilean farmers. 
<P>
      Chile's growing seasons are the reverse of those in the U.S.
When U.S. produce is coming to market, Chile is in the midst of winter
-- and thus is not exporting its grapes, peaches, plums, and apples to
the U.S. The result: Chile's agricultural exports do not compete
directly with American farmers. Lacking competition from Chilean
farmers, American farmers and agricultural groups will be less opposed
to a free trade pact with Chile than one with Mexico, which has the
same growing season as the U.S. (See "Trade and Investment Between
Chile and the United States," The Embassy of Chile, Washington, D.C.,
August 1991.)
<P>
Reason #8: 
New investment opportunities for U.S. companies in Chile would be
created. 
<P>
      Americans already have some $1.5 billion invested in Chile,
primarily in mining, financial services, agriculture, forestry, and
telecommunications. According to the Commerce Department, U.S. profits
on investments in Chile have been more than 40 percent per year for
the past four years. Chile offers American investors political
stability and a well-educated work force. It already is the fastest
growing market in Latin America for such U.S.-produced capital
equipment as mining and agricultural machinery. By removing trade
barriers and restrictions on investment, a free trade pact would
facilitate American investments in Chile. (See Wilson, op. cit., p.
10.)
<P>
Reason #9: 
The economic competitiveness of both countries would be increased.
<P>
      The competitiveness of U.S. and Chilean companies not only will
improve against Pacific Rim nations like Japan, South Korea, and
Taiwan, but also against the European Community. American companies
will be able to combine their advanced technology and highly skilled
labor with Chile's cheaper labor to cut prices on their exported
products. The amount of capital available for U.S. and Chilean
products will grow as global demand for their products increases and
their operations expand.

<P>
U.S.-CHILE FREE TRADE AGREEMENT: A KEY TO PROSPERITY IN THE AMERICAS 
<P>
      The Bush Administration must back up its call for free trade
negotiations with Chile with concrete and immediate actions. A U.S.-
Chile FTA will help consolidate and expand the mutually beneficial
relationship that has developed between the two countries. Today,
moreover, there is an opportunity to forge a permanent and profitable
economic bond between the U.S. and the other countries in the Western
Hemisphere. An FTA with Chile will help launch this process.
<P>
      To spur economic prosperity throughout the Americas, the Bush
Administration should: 
<P>
Begin free trade talks with Chile as soon as possible. 
      The Bush Administration wants to delay free trade talks with
Chile until after the NAFTA has been approved by Congress. This is a
mistake. It would be far easier to gain congressional approval of a
free trade treaty with Chile than one with Mexico. There is less U.S.
opposition to free trade with Chile, and American labor unions, which
oppose NAFTA, are not as worried about expanded trade with Chile.
Thus, a delay in starting negotiations with Chile would only waste
time. 
<P>
      The Bush Administration, therefore, should notify Congress
immediately of its intention to negotiate a free trade pact with
Chile. Under "fast track" rules, free trade talks cannot begin until
60 legislative days after Congress has been notified. Waiting until
after the November 3 presidential elections or until Congress votes on
NAFTA could jeopardize a U.S.-Chile FTA. For one thing, there is no
guarantee that Bush, the FTA's biggest champion, will be re-elected.
For another thing, protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congress could
delay NAFTA and ruin chances for any other free trade pact in the
region.
<P>
Make it clear that while Chile is the first country to participate in
the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative, others soon will follow. 
      A free trade agreement with Chile will give new life to the EAI
and prove to other Latin American and Caribbean leaders that the EAI
is working. Washington should signal to Argentina, Costa Rica,
Colombia, and Venezuela that they too will benefit under the EAI
program. As soon as these countries are ready, the U.S. will begin
free trade talks with them as well.
<P>
      Once negotiations are underway, a U.S.-Chile FTA should:
<P>
Quickly phase out all tariff and most non-tariff barriers to trade
with Chile. <P>
      Rapidly eliminating U.S. tariffs will greatly benefit Chilean
exporters who rely heavily on exports to the U.S. Yet a surge in
Chilean exports to the U.S. will not hurt American producers or cost
U.S. jobs. The reasons: 1) job losses in one sector will be offset by
job gains in others; and 2) there will be few if any job losses in the
most vulnerable sectors of the American economy, including mining,
textiles, and agriculture, because Chile's growing seasons are
opposite of those in the U.S. Since Chilean goods represent only 0.3
percent of overall U.S. imports, even a large increase of Chilean
imports would not greatly affect the U.S. job market. 
<P>
Lower all other barriers to international trade and investment. 
      <P>Accomplishing this entails reaching agreements on such issues as
intellectual property rights, fair access to natural resources,
lifting restictions on foreign ownership, strong property rights laws,
environmental regulations, labor laws, and health standards. For
example, Washington and Santiago should improve Chile's 1991
intellectual property rights laws. One way of doing this would be to
lengthen Chile's patent protection of U.S.-manufactured
pharmaceuticals from fifteen years to seventeen years. In addition,
Chile should follow the lead of Mexico by granting protection for
foreign pharmaceutical products that are under development abroad but
not yet marketed inside Chile. This way U.S. pharmaceutical
manufacturers can be assured that their products will not be copied
and sold inside Chile before a patent agreement has ben reached with
the government.
<P>
Provide for periods of adjustment to less competitive industries
hardest hit by an FTA. 
    <P>  After a free trade pact is signed between Washington and
Santiago, most tariffs and quotas should be eliminated immediately.
However, in certain less competitive sectors, such as fruit growing
and textiles, a schedule for phasing out tariffs will have to be
established. While it is unlikely that there will be any major
employment shifts or losses in the U.S. as a result of a U.S.-Chile
FTA, small adjustment periods of less than ten years will help
minimize relocation and retraining costs for some employees. These
adjustment periods also will reduce profit losses for some companies
involved in the fruit growing, textiles, and mining sectors of the
American economy.
<P>
Create procedures and mechanisms to resolve potential trade disputes. 
   <P>  As trade between countries expands, a number of complicated
trade issues arise. One such incident occurred in March 1989 when the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned Chilean grape imports after
two grapes tainted with cyanide were found in Philadelphia. The
discovery temporarily brought to a standstill one of Chile's most
vital industries. Complex environmental and labor laws in the U.S.,
combined with overlapping jurisdictions of power between state and
federal agencies and judicial systems, also can create barriers to
trade with other countries. A U.S.-Chile FTA should therefore
establish a commission to settle all trade disputes as rapidly as
possible.
<P>
Establish "rules of origin." 
  <P>    As with the 1989 U.S.-Canada FTA and NAFTA, a U.S.-Chilean free
trade pact likely will include rules of origin. These are laws that
govern the export of goods manufactured with items from a country not
participating in the free trade agreement. Under the U.S-Canada pact,
these content rules were set at 50 percent; rules have yet to be
determined in the NAFTA talks. These rules should be aimed at
promoting free trade and free market reforms among countries outside
of the U.S.-Chile FTA, not discouraging investment in either country
or serving as a disguise for "managed trade" between Washington and
Santiago. While it is still too early to recommend a specific
percentage for the U.S.-Chile content rules, it might be advisable to
use the same percentages negotiated under the NAFTA. This would
eliminate unnecessary confusion and regulation in linking Chile to
North American free trade.
<P>
      The debate over U.S.-Chilean rules of origin will be much less
problematic than during the NAFTA talks with Mexico. It is unlikely
that such Asian countries as Japan and South Korea will establish
bases of operations in Chile to export products duty free to the U.S.
market. The distance involved and transportation costs would be too
great and the availability of unemployed or cheap labor in Chile is
relatively low compared to other Latin American countries. The debate
over rules of origin, however, could heat up if the U.S. uses Chile as
a base of operations for re-export to Chile's neighbors, including
Argentina and Brazil.
<P>
CONCLUSION<P>
      The U.S. and Chile both will be winners under a free trade pact.
The benefits for the U.S. will be increased markets for American
goods; lower priced, better quality products for consumers; more jobs;
and a more stable and economically prosperous Latin America. For
Chile, the key benefits of an FTA will be more jobs, increased export
earnings, more U.S investment, a more competitive economy, and greater
political stability resulting from economic growth and prosperity.
<P>
      Now that countries like Argentina, Chile, Mexico, and Venezuela
have the confidence to seek free trade agreements with the U.S.,
Washington should not lack the confidence or leadership to negotiate
these agreements. The Bush Administration can fortify Chile's
impressive gains and create strong incentives for free market reform
throughout Latin America by signing a free trade pact with Chile. Bush
also should enlist Chilean President Patricio Aylwin's help to promote
the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative. A U.S.-Chile FTA will be a
first, but very important step in this direction. As a model other
Latin American countries will surely follow, it will advance President
Bush's EAI, and thus create new and vibrant markets throughout the
Western Hemisphere for U.S. products. It also will help spread
economic prosperity and political stability in the region. Not
unimportant, of course, is the fact that an FTA would represent a sign
of good faith by the U.S. in the Aylwin Administration. 
<P>
      By contrast, indifference or inaction by Washington could set
back progress toward free markets, democracy, and security in the
Americas. If the Bush Administration does not take advantage of the
current pro-free market and pro-democracy mood in the region, Latin
American countries could grow increasingly skeptical of U.S. free
trade policy. This could lead to socialist and anti-democratic
backlashes throughout the region. In the long run, therefore, Chile's
success or failure will help determine whether Latin America remains
mired in poverty, debt, drugs, and violence, or joins the U.S.,
Canada, and Mexico in creating what could become the world's most
prosperous and competitive free market -- a free trade zone spanning
the entire Western Hemisphere.

<h2>
Hillary's Revenge
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

Hillary Clinton has won a victory in the Senate. The  
Senate's health care bill, which passed unanimously, is not as  
flashy and detailed as her failed legislation. But the central  
principle is the same: the government, one way or another, should  
guarantee health care to everyone.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Recall that Mrs. Clinton found herself on the receiving end  
of a propaganda blitz. She was denounced as a Marxist who wanted  
to centrally plan the economy, destroy small business, and take  
away freedom of choice.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This was sweet music to lovers of free enterprise. Was the  
Republican Party, which in the past has backed big government  
medical reforms, at last making principled arguments? Corporate,  
medical, and insurance lobbies--also soft on government  
intervention--even joined in the attack.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
People and publications not usually prone to criticize  
statism sounded like libertarian purists. Even the New Republic  
ran a detailed, point-by-point attack on the White House plan.  
Thanks to these efforts, we were spared a nightmarish plot to  
nationalize one-seventh of the economy.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And yet, ominously, several provisions--some of the most  
socialistic ones in the Clinton plan--escaped deep criticism. For  
example, insurance companies would be forbidden from refusing, or  
charging higher premiums for, customers who would drive them to  
bankruptcy. That is, insurers could not take account of  
"preexisting conditions," as the lingo has it.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zoom forward one year. This provision ends up as the core of  
the Republican health care bill. If automotive or housing  
insurance couldn't "discriminate," costs would zoom and clients  
would have less of an incentive to care for their property. So  
too will this rule destroy the character of insurance in the  
medical industry.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Real insurance relies on actuarial tables, premiums that  
reflect risk (adjusted for any reason), and carefully grouped  
risk pools. A fat, cigar-smoking coach potato will have higher  
premiums than a member of the high-school swim team. If it is  
illegal to make a distinction, it's not business but welfare.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
So title I, section 101 of this bill calls for "Guaranteed  
Availability of Health Coverage." Group health plans "may not  
establish eligibility, continuation, enrollment, or contributions  
requirements" based on "health status, medical condition, claims  
experience, receipt of health care, medical history, evidence of  
insurability, or disability of a participants or beneficiary." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
What is an insurance company supposed to do if it can't  
assess the risk? Just dish out the big bucks. But can an insurer  
discreetly avoid certain professions based on their preponderance  
of sick employees? Nope: an insurance company "may not decline to" 
insure a person or group that demands it.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In this system, insurance companies cease to be market  
operations, working on the basis of profit and loss, and instead  
become middlemen in a socialist enterprise. But the Senate will  
take socialism only so far: pregnancy, unlike AIDS and other  
sexually transmitted diseases, is expressly excluded as a  
"pre-existing condition" (I,103,(a)).  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If people's premiums can't go up and they can't be rejected  
based on bad behavior, there is less to be gained by preventive  
care. That's how the plan eliminates some of the incentives for  
people to take care of themselves and not overuse medical  
services.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The companies doing the insuring are even restricted in  
their ability to quit providing insurance. They have to give 180  
days notice if a plan is going to be discontinued (I,110(b)2).  
Then they have to wait five years before offering the plan again.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Remember the price controls implicit in the Clinton bill?  
You'll find them here too. The Secretary of Health and Human  
Services will devise "Federal standards that limit the variation  
in health insurance premiums" so that they will be "reasonably  
priced" (I,112,(a)).  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Remember the bureaucracies in the Clinton health bill? This  
plan instructs the states, as overseen by the feds, to create  
"Health Plan Purchasing Coalitions" to determine the size and  
demographics of each risk pool (I, 131). The burden of proof is  
on the Coalition to show that it is not "discriminating."  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In fact, this bill differs from the Clinton plan in only two  
ways: it is less ambitious and less honest. The Clinton plan  
included specific provisions that tried to account for every  
possible contingency. The Senate bill asserts broad  
principles--cheap health care for all!--but doesn't bother to  
specify how it's going to come about.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Both plans are crazy, but is it wackier to wreck a sector  
with specific socialist instructions or broad socialist  
principles? Is it worse to specify the outcome or rig the game to  
ensure a certain outcome? Both are intolerable, although--as it  
turned out--only one could be enacted.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The bill's unanimous support is a measure not of merit, but  
of hypocrisy. For a year, the Republican Party dragged Hillary  
Clinton's name through the mud. Fine. She deserved it. But she  
also deserves an apology from everyone who denounced her bill and  
backed this one.

<h2>Stop Federalizing Local Crimes</h2>

<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a></center>

<p><hr><P>
                       
The hearings and report of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on Terrorism,  
Technology and Government Information prove again the importance and value  
of Congressional investigations. This function of Congress operates as the  
best, and often the only, way to expose the misdeeds of government.  
  <P>
For three years, the news of the killing of an innocent women and child on  
a remote Idaho mountaintop by an FBI sharpshooter, and the subsequent  
coverup by the FBI and Attorney General Janet Reno, had been known only to  
readers of right-wing newsletters and surfers on the Internet. Newspapers  
and TV networks didn't find those actions worth reporting.  
  <P>
Finally, Senator Arlen Specter's subcommittee, with the C-span cameras  
rolling, laid the ugly story out for all to see. The 154-page subcommittee  
report just released assessed blame on everybody involved in the shootout,  
but the part that should concern us most is the outrageous actions of  
federal law- enforcement agencies.  
  <P>
The role of the BATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms) began with  
spreading false and defamatory information about Randy Weaver and concluded  
with continuing to defend inexcusable conduct. The FBI's role included  
firing the fatal shots, lying about who was to blame, defending the  
constitutional "shoot-on-sight" actions, and promoting the bureaucrat in  
charge of the mess.  
  <P>
Specter rightfully suggests that the BATF ought to be abolished. The FBI  
should be punished, too, since Director Louis Freeh's statement that the  
Bureau is now better prepared for "volatile situations like Ruby Ridge" is  
a totally inadequate response.  
  <P>
Former Attorney General Edwin Meese points out in the current issue of  
Policy Review that the Ruby Ridge and Waco (Branch Davidian) tragedies have  
fundamentally changed the way Americans view federal law enforcement  
agencies and have jeopardized public confidence in government itself. His  
recommendation is much more fundamental than a mere transfer of agency  
functions and suspension of several agents.  
  <P>
As Meese explains, Ruby Ridge and Waco were, constitutionally speaking,  
none of the Federal government's business in the first place. Neither  
incident involved interstate activity or posed a threat to the Federal  
Government.  
  <P>
The underlying problem is that so many criminal laws and laws regulating  
firearms have been federalized. Until very recent years, everything  
involved at Ruby Ridge and Waco would have been handled under state and  
local laws (if, indeed, there were anything to handle at all, since the  
Ruby Ridge sequence of events only started when a BATF agent entrapped  
Randy Weaver into committing a minor violation of a firearms law).  
  <P>
What has happened is that so many politicians, seeking to portray  
themselves as tough on crime, have passed so many laws creating new federal  
crimes and stiffer penalties. They should know that these laws are not in  
harmony with our Constitution and that crime is most effectively fought at  
the local level, anyway.  
  <P>
Meese explains that federalizing crime contradicts constitutional  
principles. The U.S. Constitution gave Congress jurisdiction over only  
three crimes: treason, counterfeiting, and piracy on the high seas and  
offenses against the law of nations. Responsibility for public safety rests  
solely in the domain of the states.  
  <P>
Now, however, Congress has created more than 3,000 federal crimes, many of  
them redundant with state laws. Hardly any crime, no matter how local, is  
now beyond the jurisdiction of federal criminal authorities.  
  <P>
A big part of the federalizing of crime is the criminalization of  
environmental regulations. Many of these federal environmental crimes are  
local in nature, and they are often so vague that some property owners  
violate the law without realizing it.  
  <P>
Meese accurately says that federalizing crime increases "the potential for  
an oppressive and burdensome federal police state." Ruby Ridge and Waco  
prove that proposition; the spokesmen for the two federal agencies never  
admitted that the government did anything wrong.  
  <P>
Another bad result of federalizing crime is the added jurisdiction and  
power this gives to the federal courts. Activist federal judges have  
greatly expanded the rights of criminal defendants, have further burdened  
law- enforcement agencies, and have virtually taken over the operation of  
80 percent of all state prison systems.  
  <P>
Since crime usually tops the list when voters are asked what they are  
concerned about, Republicans like to pose as law-and-order spokesmen. Its  
time for them to address themselves to the real problems that are properly  
Congress's responsibility, and admit that law-and-order is a state and  
local function.

<h2>The Health Care Dilemma of Patients Who Can't Read</h2>

<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a></center>
<p><hr><P>
"Our health care system requires that patients be able to read." That 
ought to be a self-evident truth that is silly to enunciate, but it is 
actually the sensational revelation of a major problem just made 
public in the December JAMA (Journal of the American Medical 
Association). 
<p>
The JAMA article reports on the first study ever made to test literacy 
using words combined with numbers that are in common use in health 
care. It was a cross-sectional research project conducted at two urban 
hospitals, one in Georgia, the other in California. 
<p>
The massive National Adult Literacy Survey made by the U.S. government 
in 1993 concluded that 40 to 44 million adults are functionally 
illiterate and that another 50 million are only marginally literate. 
This new health literacy study specifically measured the ability of 
patients to read and understand medical instructions and health care 
information according to a test called TOFHLA (Test of Functional 
Health Literacy in Adults) and discovered that 33 percent of patients 
did not understand instructions for common procedures written at the 
fourth grade level. 
<p>
This health literacy study measured the ability of patients to perform 
such tasks as reading labels on prescription bottles, instructions 
about how often to take medication, notices about when is the next 
doctor's appointment, informed consent forms, instructions about 
diagnostic tests, and how to complete insurance forms. The depressing 
conclusion is that a high percentage of patients simply can't read 
well enough to function in our health care system. 
<p>
People with inadequate literacy skills are unable to read a 
thermometer, write down instructions by telephone, or read common 
medical terms such as "orally," "teaspoon," and "hours." <p>They can't 
access useful messages from newspaper and magazine articles, 
educational materials, posters in supermarkets, or billboards about 
the importance of screening procedures or flu shots. 
<p>
Health care standards require hospitals to provide patients with 
understandable health instructions, but do not require that the 
instructions be understood. Hospitals assume they are complying if 
they give patients a readable document, but a written instruction 
assumes that the patients can read. 
<p>
Patients who can't read informed consent forms present doctors and 
hospitals with what the researchers call "a troubling ethical issue." <p>
Even if an effort is made to simplify the forms to the sixth grade 
level, that still will not reach the many who are functionally 
illiterate. 
<p>
This health literacy project turned up other new and useful 
information not hitherto unearthed by previous literacy surveys made 
by educational institutions. 
<p>
Neither appearance nor years of schooling adequately predicts 
illiteracy. This means that illiteracy is not just a problem for 
minority dropouts or recent immigrants, but is a handicap suffered by 
all races and classes of people who have no visible signs of 
disability and have spent many years in school. 
<p>
Many illiterates do not realize that they have a problem. They are 
like myopic children who don't know that they are simply not seeing 
details that others see. 
<p>
Ronald Reagan tells in his autobiography how, as a young boy riding in 
the back seat of an automobile, he picked up someone else's glasses 
and tried them on. Suddenly he was able to see the leaves on the trees 
and other landscape details for the first time. Until that moment of 
revelation, he hadn't known that other children had been seeing so 
many things that he did not see. 
<p>
The predicament of illiterates is similar. Never having been able to 
communicate with the printed word, they have no comprehension of the 
vast world from which they are excluded. 
<p>
Even more prevalent is the pervasive problem of shame. People with 
limited literacy skills try to hide their inability to read. The large 
majority of illiterates describe themselves as reading and writing 
"well" or "very well." 
<p>
The health literacy study shows that, among patients with low literacy 
skills, 67.2 percent have never told their spouse, 53.4 percent have 
never told their own children, and 19 percent have never told anyone 
at all. 
<p>
I can confirm this from my own experience. In counseling adults, I 
frequently hear such confessions as "I can't read big words" and "I 
just discovered that my husband can't read." 
<p>
The health literacy study admits that patients' noncompliance with 
their medical instructions has been generally assumed by physicians 
and hospitals to be caused by poor motivation or different personal 
values. The study calls for a reevaluation of patients who have been 
labelled "uncooperative"; it is more likely that doctors and hospital 
personnel, to whom reading is as natural as breathing, never imagined 
that the patients just couldn't read their instructions. 
<p>
The JAMA article recognizes that illiteracy is not a disease and its 
solution cannot be medicalized. Since doctors and hospitals can't 
provide the solution, and the schools have obviously failed in the 
task, parents will have to take on the responsibility of teaching 
their children how to read.

<title>Rockwell: Oil in the Crossfire -- 4/30/96</title>

<h2>
Oil in the Crossfire
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>


Now that National Hate AT&T Month is over, it's time to  
despise the oil companies. Call them any name you want: gougers,  
extortionists, or greed merchants. Make them the national enemy.  
It's a human rights violation to raise a price.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The occasion of the newest anti-capitalist hysteria is a  
one-year, 10% increase in gasoline prices at the pump. Never mind  
the underlying economic causes. Secretary of Energy Hazel O'Leary  
is investigating the oil industry to discover who's getting rich  
at the driver's expense.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Not to be left out, Connecticut's two Democratic  
Senators--Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman--are demanding that  
Attorney General Janet Reno knock the heads of oil companies with  
a stump. Heaven knows she can do it, even without resorting to  
tanks and CS gas. Anti-trust law can be bent to make any price  
pattern appear illegal.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

For his part, President Clinton has decided to deal with the  
national emergency by dumping 12 million barrels onto the market  
from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

All this reveals profound ignorance. Prices respond  
immediately to information about future demand and supply. If a  
credible announcement of a government oil sale didn't reduce the  
price, selling the oil won't do it either.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Recall that this administration complains about foreigners  
dumping their goods on American markets at below cost. However, 
when it's our own government doing the dumping, it's not a  
vicious practice, but a responsible economic policy.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The market specializes in allocating supplies over time via  
the price system. When supply is low and demand is high, prices  
rise to induce new drilling and distribution. In light of higher 
gasoline prices, consumers are already changing some summer  
travel plans, another market response.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The market's price system works so well it doesn't need  
management at all. We don't have a strategic shoe or chicken  
reserve, yet, somehow, we walk and eat. But it's not free-market  
logic that's driving Mr. Clinton's blue light special. He's  
looking to profit politically--we might even call it vote  
gouging--at the expense of private industry.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A far better response--if highly atypical given their sorry  
record this year--comes from Republicans who are demanding a  
repeal of Mr. Clinton's 4.3 cent gas tax increase.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Democrats say the savings from a tax cut won't be "passed  
on" to the consumer. These are the same people who said a tax  
increase would be "passed on" two years ago. Not only that, they  
hoped it would be. In those days, you see, liberals agitated for  
higher gasoline prices as a way of inducing consumers to less, drive 
less, and "pollute" less.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Liberals love oil price increases, especially when they're  
caused by taxes. It's the best of both worlds: people have less  
fun and government gets to siphon off new revenue.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The last time the nation went bonkers over gas prices was  
during the Gulf War. The U.S. government jeopardized imports from  
the entire Arab world, and President Bush (A.B. economics, Yale  
University) was amazed and alarmed to see prices go up. Like Mr.  
Clinton now, he attempted to jawbone companies into cutting  
prices. Corporate executives feared for their bottom lines.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

There is always--as hard as government officials find this  
to accept--a purpose behind market-driven changes in price. If a  
good is more scarce, its price will rise so that people can know  
to use less of it. If it is more plentiful, its price will fall 
so consumers can know to live it up. Tampering with the system  
imposes unpredictable distortions.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In a country built by free enterprise, there is still mass  
ignorance on what accounts for a price increase in an industry.  
It's not greed, gouging, or illicit gas guzzling. It's either an  
increase in demand, a decrease in supply, or a response to money  
creation by the Fed. No use looking anywhere else.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Just how badly do we want prices to fall? The best and  
surest way is to have free trade in oil. And, yes, that includes  
with Iraq, a country whose people have suffered immeasurably from  
the U.S.'s cruel and unusual sanctions.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To end the war on the market before it escalates further, we  
need an end to embargoes, taxes, regulations, and inflation, all  
of which impede the right of Americans to determine their own  
strategic petroleum reserves.

<title>LET'S ABOLISH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION</title>

<center><h2>Let's Abolish The Department of Education</h2></center>
<p>
<p>
<hr>
By Phyllis Schlafly  August 17, 1995
<p>
<p>
Abolishing the Department of Education was one of Ronald Reagan's
campaign promises when he ran for President in 1980.  Fulfilling
that promise is long overdue, and the time to do it is now.
<p>
Education is not a department that has always been with us like
State, Treasury, and Justice.  The Department of Education was
created as a payoff to the National Education Association (NEA) for
its early endorsement of Jimmy Carter's presidential candidacy in
1976.
<p>
That NEA endorsement was a significant factor in giving Carter
national visibility and momentum.  At that time, the little-known
one-term Governor of a southern state was considered a long shot by
most observers.
<p>
The NEA has the same symbiotic relationship with Bill Clinton.  On
his way to the 1992 Democratic National Convention that nominated
him, he stopped off for a visit with Keith Geiger, then NEA
president, and promised to invite him to sleep in Abe Lincoln's bed
at the White House. 
<p>
Contrary to the gloom-and-doom fearmongering of the education
lobby, U.S. public schools will not collapse if the Department of
Education is abolished.  Public schools flourished before there was
any Department of Education (and academic standards were much
higher), and public schools will continue to exist if the
Department is abolished.
<p>
Federal spending in public schools amounts to only about six
percent of their total budget.  Every week we read about
corporations successfully downsizing their workforce and thereby
achieving greater efficiency, so public schools should have no
difficulty downsizing by six percent.  Their top-heavy and
redundant administrative bureaucracy is a scandal, anyway.
<p>
Congress doles out 70 billion federal tax dollars per year on what
is euphemistically called education.  The mere listing of the
programs is awesome and depressing.
<p>
The Department of Education spends $33 billion a year of this
amount administering 244 different programs.  The remainder of the
$70 billion is spent by 30 other federal agencies on 308 programs,
which the General Accounting Office says "often are duplicative and
overlapping."
<p>
More than 90 federal preschool and child care programs are
administered through eleven federal agencies and 20 offices that
target children of similar ages and provide similar services. 
There are 86 federal programs in nine federal departments that
offer teacher training.
<p>
At least 46 federal programs administered by eight federal agencies
are working on what is called youth development.  Fourteen
different programs provide food and food-related assistance.  At
least 163 federal programs, spread out among 15 departments and
agencies, say they are providing employment and training
assistance.
<p>
This federal spending imposes a costly paperwork burden on local
schools.  A 1991 survey of Ohio school districts reported that
schools must complete 173 federal reports and forms.  
<p>
We should face the fact that, like welfare, our 30 year experiment
in federal spending on education has failed.  Illiteracy has
reached epidemic levels and Scholastic Aptitude Test scores have
dropped 73 points since 1960.
<p>
Incidentally, the decline in SAT scores is now going to be
concealed from the public starting this year by the simple device
of raising every test score nearly 100 points.  They call this
"centering," but another word for it is cheating.
<p>
The 1994 election sent a strong message to Congress:  cut federal
spending, reduce government, eliminate agencies.  Unfortunately,
some Congressmen seem to think they can pretend to abolish the
Department of Education while merely shifting the functions and the
spending to other agencies.
<p>
It is a bafflement how any Congressman could think that the
constituency eager to abolish the Department of Education could be
appeased by transferring the functions and the spending to Labor
Secretary Robert Reich or Health and Human Services Secretary Donna
Shalala.  Yet those are the most discussed proposals for education
"reform." 
<p>
Out across America, the mood of the people is just the opposite.  
Three states this year actually rejected federal funding for Goals
2000, a truly remarkable reaction to the offer of goodies from the
federal treasury.
<p>
The U.S. Constitution doesn't mention education, and there is no
authority in the Constitution for the Federal Government to meddle
in local schools.  Education is not a proper federal function.
<p>
If the Federal Government has no constitutional authority to ban
guns from schools (which the Supreme Court ruled in this year's
Lopez decision), then it follows a fortiori that the Federal
Government has no authority to impose curricular requirements or
hand out funds according to the whims and the politics of federal
officials.
<p>
Public schools in America were vastly superior before the Federal
Government turned on the funding faucet.  It's time to write finis
to federal aid to education and return that $70 billion per year to
the American people in tax cuts.

<TITLE>A U.S. Strategy Toward Trade With Japan That Will Work -- Heritage </TITLE>


<CENTER><H3><I>        A U.S. STRATEGY TOWARD TRADE WITH JAPAN THAT WILL WORK</I>
</H3>

INTRODUCTION
<P>
     Behind President Bill Clinton's confrontational approach toward
trade with Japan are two controversial ideas: a government industrial
policy that subsidizes U.S. emerging technologies and government
management of the flow of U.S. exports and imports. Inspired by these
two ideas, known generally as managed trade, Clinton is using trade
negotiations with Japan to secure guaranteed shares of the Japanese
market for U.S. exporters, possibly at the expense of other American
businesses which are already successful in Japan. Moreover, Clinton
has renewed congressionally mandated "Super 301" trade authority that
allows the U.S. to impose sanctions against foreign trading partners
accused of unfair trading practices. By September 30, the Clinton
Administration will name those countries whose trade practices it
feels unfairly restrict U.S. exports and will threaten them with Super
301 trade sanctions. <P>
     Key Clinton economic advisers, including United States Trade
Representative (USTR) Mickey Kantor and Assistant USTR Charlene
Barshefsky, are threatening to retaliate against U.S. trading partners
unless they agree to increase American imports. Specifically, the
Administration wants the Japanese government to agree to specified
increases in imports of U.S. goods and services. <P>
     The Administration contends that this approach has worked before
and points to the 1991 U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement as a
successful example of "managed trade," arguing that it established
"numerical targets" by which U.S. semiconductor producers received a
guaranteed share of the Japanese market. Moreover, the Administration
argues that Japan agreed to these terms because of the threat of
retaliation by the U.S. The Administration is wrong. Although U.S.
semiconductor market share did in fact increase in Japan, this
increase had little to do with numerical targets established in the
Semiconductor Agreement. Instead, the agreement inspired U.S. firms to
negotiate their own entry into the Japanese market without relying on
government help. If the agreement can be called a success, in other
words, it is not because of "numerical targets" but because it
fostered private sector solutions undertaken because of business'
frustration with the results of years of failed government attempts to
manage the trade in semiconductors.<P>
     Because it has learned the wrong lesson from the 1991
Semiconductor Agreement, the Clinton Administration has based its
trade policy with Japan on the Agreement's anti-market principles of
guaranteed markets, threats of retaliation through tariffs and quotas,
and subsidies for U.S. industry. Rather than basing U.S. trade policy
on such self-defeating protectionism, the Administration should help
open markets overseas. Specifically, it should:
<P>
Seek rapid congressional approval of the General Agreement on Tariffs
     and Trade (GATT). This wide-ranging trade agreement between the
     U.S. and 123 other nations should be approved by Congress as soon
     as possible. Based on seven years of multilateral negotiations,
     the current GATT agreement will reduce tariffs by as much as 40
     percent worldwide and expand international trade by $235 billion
     annually.
<P>
Extend free trade agreements to other countries in Latin America,
     Asia, and Europe. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
     expanded the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement to include Mexico.
     That agreement, or separate free trade treaties, now should be
     expanded to other countries, including Chile and Argentina.
     Moreover, the President should raise the free trade ante by
     offering to negotiate free trade agreements with Hong Kong,
     Japan, Singapore, and emerging market economies in Central and
     Eastern Europe.
<P>
Pursue a pact liberalizing trade among the members of the Asia-Pacific
     Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. (APEC members include
     Australia, Brunei, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan,
     South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the
     Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United States.)
     The 17-member trade forum is a good foundation from which to
     launch a program of liberalized trade. The U.S. exports over $150
     billion in goods and services to the Pacific Rim each year. (U.S.
     Merchandise Trade: December 1993 (hereafter cited as USMT:12/93),
     U.S. Department of Commerce, February 17, 1994.) An APEC-based
     free trade area inevitably will expand that trade.
<P>
Foster private sector strategic alliances between U.S. and foreign
     firms. The best way for American companies to gain a share of the
     Japanese market is to form private joint ventures with Japanese
     companies. These joint ventures should be encouraged and made
     part of any bilateral trade agreements with Japan or any other
     U.S. trading partner.
<P>
WHAT IS MANAGED TRADE?<P>
     Managed trade is government regulation of trade and international
investments to achieve specific levels of imports and exports. Among
the tools used by governments to manage trade are: quotas and other
limits on imports, demands for guaranteed shares of sales in another
country's market, demands that other countries adopt economic policies
that favor imports, subsidies for selected industries or government-
business "partnerships," subsidies for export industries, and some
form of national industrial and trade planning.<P>
     Clinton's approach to trade with Japan reflects this philosophy.
The Administration is pursuing a two-pronged approach: 1) protecting
U.S. industries at home through trade barriers and subsidies while 2)
negotiating numerical targets and guaranteed market shares in Japan
for specific U.S. industries.<P>
     An example of the first approach is the Administration's decision
to subsidize domestic development of flat panel displays used in
laptop and notebook computers and related products. Under President
George Bush, the U.S. imposed a tariff on the import of these displays
in an attempt to give the infant American industry a chance to
establish itself. The tariff was removed in 1993 after it was
discovered that the U.S. industry was incapable of supplying quality
displays to the U.S. computer industry. (See "Certain High-Information
Content Flat Panel Displays and Display Glass From Japan," U.S.
International Trade Commission, USITC Publication 2413, August 1991,
and Bryan T. Johnson, "A Guide to Antidumping Laws: America's Unfair
Trade Practice," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 906, July 21,
1992.) Now, however, the Clinton Administration plans to spend over $1
billion in the next decade to help U.S. businesses develop the most
advanced flat panel displays in the world. (Jonathon Rauch, "The
Visible Hand," National Journal, July 7, 1994, p. 1614.)<P>
     As an example of the second approach, the Clinton Administration,
through the U.S.-Japan Framework negotiations begun in April 1993, is
pressuring the Japanese government to accept "qualitative and
quantitative" numerical targets for U.S. exports to Japan. (From
"Joint Statement on the United States-Japan Framework for a New
Economic Partnership," press statement issued by USTR, April 1993.)
The Administration is asking the Japanese to guarantee a portion of
their domestic market to U.S. automobiles, auto parts,
telecommunication services, and insurance policies. The
Administration, moreover, is seeking to increase these guaranteed
shares by a predetermined percentage each year.
<P>
GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRATS AS INVESTORS<P>
     These approaches are doomed to fail. Managed trade policies
require that the government decide which industry will perform best in
foreign markets. Government determines which products and services
receive government assistance, while other products and services not
seen as worthy are left to market forces. The assumption is that
government knows better than private investors which products to
develop and bring to market. <P>
     If this assumption were true, managed trade would have a
successful track record of picking winners and losers. But this is not
the case. In fact, governments are more apt to pick losers than
winners. The reason: government bureaucrats have a short-sighted view
of profitable products and technologies. Bureaucrats in charge of
picking which industries receive government subsidies or guaranteed
shares of foreign markets usually choose existing technologies, not
the more promising ones that may be profitable in the future. 
<P>
     There are numerous examples of failed industrial policy,
including:
<P>
In the U.S.
<P>
Sematech. <P>
     One of the most successful examples of industrial policy in the
United States is supposed to be Sematech, a jointly funded government-
business partnership aimed at developing advanced semiconductors.
(Robert S. Williams and George C. Lodge, Sematech, Harvard Business
School Case Study, 1988.) However, after seven years and nearly $1.5
billion spent, Sematech has produced few marketable products; some of
its biggest projects are failures. For example, Sematech funded
attempts by some companies to produce advanced lithography equipment
which etches the electrical circuit patterns into electronic
components. The project collapsed after consuming tens of millions of
dollars of Sematech's taxpayer-subsidized budget. ("Govt High-Tech
Boondoggles: Clinton Computer-Screen Next Failure?," Investor's
Business Daily, May 6, 1994, p. 1.) <P>
     Meanwhile, though remaining committed to Sematech's basic
mission, Sematech partners like American Telephone and Telegraph
(AT&T) and others have entered joint ventures with Japanese
semiconductor firms to gain access to advanced products and
production. AT&T has two joint ventures, one with Mitsubishi Electric
Ltd. begun in 1990, and three different arrangements with Nippon
Electric Company, also begun in 1990. While the jury is still out on
just how successful these ventures will be for AT&T, they demonstrate
how the company has chosen avenues other than government subsidies to
enter the semiconductor market. <P>
     To be sure, Sematech may have helped some companies pay for new
research and development projects. However, those "successes" came at
the expense of diverting capital from companies that lacked government
funding to others that received such funding. In fact, some of the
companies denied government funding achieved equal or greater success.
For example, California-based Cypress Semiconductor corporation is not
a member of Sematech, yet it produces one of the world's fastest
static random access memory (SRAM) chips, used in supercomputers to
store and retrieve data. It developed this product without help from
the government. Cypress Semiconductor CEO T.J. Rodgers says: "Sematech
has waged a public relations campaign to claim credit for the [U.S.
semiconductor industry] comeback. It is a preposterous claim. It is
true that Washington spent or will spend $1 billion of taxpayer money
on the Sematech boondoggle. It is true that the U.S. semiconductor
industry has experienced a resurgence. It is not true that one had
much to do with the other." (Dr. T. J. Rodgers, statement given in
testimony before the House Committee on Science, Space, and
Technology, Subcommittee on Technology, Environment, and Aviation,
March 25, 1993.)
<P>
Very High Speed Integrated Circuits (VHSIC). <P>
     Another U.S. industrial policy failure was the attempt to develop
advanced electrical circuits needed for military computers and
hardware such as shipboard computer systems, mobile computer products,
and a host of other products. From 1979 to 1990, the U.S. government
spent over $1 billion to support the building of advanced circuits to
meet the needs of future electronic equipment. What it got was
computer chips for existing equipment, despite market trends toward
production of computer chips that were far more advanced. The result:
$1 billion for no lasting marketable product. ("Govt High-Tech
Boondoggles," op. cit. See also Katie Hafner, "Does Industrial Policy
Work? Lessons from Sematech," The New York Times, November 7, 1993, p.
5.)
<P>
In Japan<P>
High Definition Television (HDTV). <P>
     HDTVs are next-generation TVs with better resolution, movie
screen dimensions, and compact disc-quality sound. Japan's HDTV
project was begun in the early 1980s and by 1985 was being funded
directly by the Japanese government. By the late 1980s, President Bush
was considering adopting a U.S. industrial policy for an HDTV project,
but he rejected it while Japan's project went forward. In the
meantime, some U.S. companies joined forces to build a system with an
emerging technology based on digital transmissions, an advanced way to
transmit data in large quantities very quickly. Japan's government-
funded project used older technology based on analog transmissions,
which is a slower way to transmit data. Thus, while Japan had the
first HDTV, the U.S. product is far more advanced and will become the
standard for HDTV systems elsewhere. Japan's industrial policy failed
where the U.S. market succeeded.<P>
     These examples show a common problem with industrial policy: it
tends to favor existing technology over emerging, often more promising
technology. While the market cannot always foresee future emerging
technology, private investors are better able to determine how much a
potential project may be worth by spending their own money than are
government bureaucrats spending someone else's money.
<P>
THE U.S.-JAPAN SEMICONDUCTOR AGREEMENT<P>
     Industrial policies fail because governments lack the knowledge,
incentives, and expertise to influence markets successfully. But
industrial policy is only one part of the President's managed trade
agenda. The other is the pursuit of guaranteed shares of foreign
markets. To justify such policies, the Clinton Administration is
relying on the 1991 U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement as a model of
effective managed trade policy. A closer analysis of this arrangement
reveals that it has not done what the Administration claims.<P>
     In 1991, President Bush signed a trade agreement with Japan
seeking to increase the U.S. share of the Japanese semiconductor
market. The Clinton Administration maintains that this agreement
guaranteed a 20 percent portion of the Japanese market to foreign-made
semiconductors, mainly U.S. products, and argues that this guarantee,
together with threats of U.S. trade retaliation, has forced the
Japanese to buy more U.S. semiconductors. The Administration is wrong.<P>
     The Clinton Administration's argument actually is based on Ronald
Reagan's 1986 U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement. This agreement,
among other things, called for incremental increases in Japanese
purchases of foreign-made semiconductors and for U.S. trade
retaliation if these targets were not met -- retaliation that was
applied in 1988 in the form of tariffs. The Clinton Administration
points to the general rise in the share of the Japanese market
captured by U.S. producers as proof of this approach's effectiveness.
     But what the Administration ignores is that in the 1991<P>
agreement, Bush eliminated all references to "guaranteed market
shares" and scrapped the Reagan tariffs imposed on Japan. As the chart
above shows, U.S. market share in Japan rose generally through the
last half of the 1980s. But it was not until well after these changes
were made that U.S. companies really gained market share in Japan. The
1991 Agreement makes no reference to guarantees, simply stating that: 
<P>
      The Government of Japan recognizes that the U.S.
     semiconductor industry expects that the foreign market share
     will grow to more than 20 percent of the Japanese market by
     the end of 1992 and considers that this can be realized. The
     Government of Japan welcomes the realization of this
     expectation. The two Governments agree that the above
     statements constitute neither a guarantee, a ceiling nor a
     floor on the foreign market share.
<P>
     If numerical targets and trade retaliation did not increase
foreign market share in the Japanese semiconductor market after 1991,
what did? A closer look at the 1991 agreement shows that market
forces, sound business planning, and other aspects propelled U.S.
firms into the Japanese market. (Industry and Trade Summary:
Semiconductors [hereafter cited as I&TS:S], United States
International Trade Commission, USITC Publication 2708, December 1993,
p. 7.)
<P>
HOW THE U.S. IS SELLING JAPAN MORE SEMICONDUCTORS<P>
     The fact that U.S. semiconductor sales in Japan increased so
dramatically about a year after the 1991 agreement had much to do with
sound business decisions made by U.S. companies in the mid-1980s and
bad business decisions made by their Japanese counterparts. Consider
the following chronology of events:
<P>
As the demand for personal computers increased during the early to
     mid-1980s, so did demand for components used in these computers.
     In the United States alone, sales of computers increased nearly
     1,000 percent from 1981 to 1988 (see chart ). The main components
     of these computers are semiconductors, used in the form of
     dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips and microprocessors.
<P>
Because the Japanese government and private semiconductor producers
     believed demand would increase throughout the 1980s, Japanese
     companies initiated a massive production schedule for DRAMs. Many
     of these Japanese companies saw the expected increase in demand
     and their newly developed DRAM production techniques as reason
     enough to increase production in this crucial product area.
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. companies like Motorola Incorporated and Intel
     Corporation saw an opportunity to increase production in an area
     being neglected by the Japanese: microprocessors. Japanese
     efforts to enter this market were stifled in part because
     Japanese firms were busy trying to out-produce one another in
     DRAMs. Faced with this increased competition and dwindling
     profits, U.S. firms walked away from DRAMs and spent their money
     producing microprocessors. According to Cypress Semiconductor CEO
     Rodgers: "Gordon Moore, the chairman of Intel, admitted that
     Intel deliberately walked out of the DRAM business to make more
     profit. Two years later they made a profit of $600 million in
     microprocessors, which is where they squirreled their money
     instead of DRAMs." (Virginia I. and Steven R. Postrel, "The New
     Mr. Chips, Speaking for Silicon Valley's Upstarts," Reason, July
     1990, p. 31.)
<P>
By 1985, the Japanese had overproduced DRAMs, and prices began to
     fall. To cut their losses, Japanese companies began to sell their
     massive inventories at cut-rate prices, prompting U.S.
     semiconductor companies and the U.S. government to charge the
     Japanese with dumping, or selling them at below market value.
     (Four Years of Experience Under the U.S.-Japan Semiconductor
     Agreement: A Deal is a Deal, Semiconductor Industry Association,
     San Jose, California, November 1990, p. 59. It must be said that
     the Japanese were selling their DRAMs at prices below their costs
     of production, which did injure U.S. companies still engaged in
     DRAM production. However, these lower prices were the result of
     cut-throat competition between Japanese DRAM producers who were
     trying to unload their bloated inventories after the demand for
     DRAMs collapsed. U.S. antidumping provisions do not take these
     issues into account. For a full description of U.S. antidumping
     laws, see Bryan T. Johnson, "A Guide to U.S. Antidumping Laws:
     America's Unfair Trade Practice," Heritage Foundation
     Backgrounder No. 906, July 21, 1992.) This led to the 1986 U.S.-
     Japan Semiconductor Agreement in which the Japanese agreed, among
     other things, to stop dumping DRAMs. The resultant cutback in
     DRAM production led to an eventual price increase and to higher
     Japanese profits, which in the end may have been all that kept
     some of these businesses from going bankrupt.
<P>
While many Japanese consumer electronics companies were losing money
     in DRAMs, companies like Intel and Motorola went on to become the
     world's largest producers of microprocessors, making billions in
     profits. In fact, Intel alone controls almost all of the world's
     supply of high-end microprocessors and nearly three-fourths of
     all microprocessors, truly a tribute to the company's foresight,
     investment strategy, and business planning (see chart below).
<P>
     In short, one reason the U.S. began gaining more market share in
Japan is that some U.S. semiconductor firms walked away from the cut-
throat competition in DRAMs and invested in microprocessors. By 1991,
Japan was virtually dependent on the U.S. for microprocessors, which
they had neglected. For example, the foreign share of the Japanese
microprocessor market is 76.6 percent, and most of this is U.S. market
share. This compares to a 23.2 percent share of Japan's DRAM market.
<P>
THE KEY TO OPEN MARKETS IN JAPAN: STRATEGIC ALLIANCES<P>
     Another reason the U.S. gained market share in Japan is that U.S.
firms took advantage of language in the 1991 agreement which called
for an increase in joint ventures between U.S. and Japanese firms.
These strategic alliances are private sector arrangements between two
or more companies seeking to increase production by taking on a
partner. They can take many forms, including direct acquisition of one
company by another, a joint venture partnership between two companies,
and the merger of two companies to form a single entity for the
desired production. These alliances are key to opening the Japanese
market because they give U.S. firms unique access to Japanese
partners. Moreover, these alliances provide U.S. firms with immediate
access to Japanese technologies -- and vice versa -- that it would
take years for them to develop on their own. (Not all strategic
alliances will be successful. Even some of those mentioned in this
study may end up as failures. The significance of these alliances is
that U.S. companies have sought private sector means to address their
desire for increased market share in Japan and access to advanced
technologies.)<P>
     The real success of the 1991 Semiconductor Agreement lies in the
degree to which it encouraged these strategic alliances between U.S.
and Japanese semiconductor firms, leading the U.S. to ease its
antitrust laws to facilitate joint production arrangements between two
or more companies. (The National Cooperative Research Act of 1984
allowed two or more companies to enter joint research projects without
the threat of extreme antitrust penalties. The law was aimed mainly at
U.S. companies. Later, in 1993, President Clinton expanded the Act to
include joint production ventures, but it was still aimed mainly at
U.S. firms; foreign firms are allowed to participate, but only as
minority members.) The 1991 Agreement specifically states: "The
Government of the United States of America will provide support for
expanded sales of foreign-based semiconductors in Japan through the
promotion of long-term relationships between Japanese producers,
including joint product development with Japanese customers, and other
actions the two Governments consider appropriate." (1991 Semiconductor
Agreement, USTR.) The Bush Department of Commerce worked closely with
American businesses, giving them information on partnership and market
opportunities in Japan. Partially as a result of these and other
efforts, U.S. semiconductor companies today are engaged in hundreds of
partnerships, alliances, joint ventures, licensing agreements, and
research and development projects with Japanese firms. (I&TS:S, p. 7.)
<P>These alliances are the result of private U.S. businesses seeking
increased market opportunities in Japan, not just of the 1991
agreement, but they demonstrate that many American companies need
little prodding from government to seize an overseas opportunity. The
1991 agreement created an atmosphere in which U.S. businesses could
begin to consider joint ventures with Japanese firms as a realistic
way to break into the Japanese semiconductor market. American
companies sought new alliances or broadened existing ones. AT&T, for
example, established an alliance with Mitsubishi Electric in October
1991; National Semiconductor Corporation started two relationships
with Toshiba Corporation in May and December 1992; and Intel
established a joint venture with Sharp Corporation in February 1992.
(Dave Webb, "Intel Pulls Plug on Flash Fab," Electronic's Buyer's
News, July 11, 1994.) All of these occurred after implementation of
the 1991 agreement. ("Progress and Achievements Under the
Semiconductor Agreement," Anderson, Hibey, & Blair and Powell Tate,
Washington, D.C., February 23, 1994.)
    <P> These and hundreds of other alliances have helped U.S. companies
to reduce research and development costs while gaining access to
Japanese customers, manufacturing and marketing techniques, and
technologies that they may not have been able to develop on their own.
U.S. companies' sales in the Japanese market tripled between 1986 and
1992, rising from 7.7 percent of their world sales in 1986 to over 10
percent in 1992. (Ibid., data quoted from Dataquest.) Thus, in
contrast to President Clinton's call for numerical targets, some U.S.
semiconductor companies want more, not fewer, U.S.-Japan alliances.
    <P> For example, William Weber, Vice President of Texas Instruments
Incorporated, told the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun that "We won't
urge the [U.S.] government to set market share goals. The government's
intervention should be held to a minimum." (Asahi Shimbun, June 5,
1993.) Weber added, "Confrontation existed between the U.S. and Japan
a year ago, but the present U.S.-Japan relationship is best
characterized by trust. Foreign semiconductor suppliers are now
integral parts of the Japanese users' Keiretsu." (Denpa, June 5,
1993.) (The Keiretsu system in Japan is an inter-linked group of
businesses, banks, producers, and suppliers that have agreed to work
together to reduce costs and maximize profits.)
    <P> In the same vein, Gilbert Amelio, President of National
Semiconductor, told the Japanese press that "There is no need to set
market share goals. The relationship between U.S. and Japanese
companies has dramatically improved. Strong trust has been established
and problems can be worked out quickly through communication. It is
necessary to strengthen our business relationships further." (Nikkei
Sangyo, August 30, 1993.)
<P>
     Examples of these private sector relationships include:
<P>
Advanced Micro Devices Inc.-- Sony Corporation. <P>
     In 1990, the U.S. company Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced
a strategic alliance with Japan's Sony Corporation, which promised to
help AMD reopen a dormant semiconductor manufacturing site in San
Antonio, Texas. When the agreement was announced, AMD Chairman W.J.
Sanders III noted that "access to [SONY's] manufacturing know-how will
significantly enhance AMD's global competitiveness." (AMD News
Release, February 20, 1990, p. 1.) As a result of this strategic
alliance, Sony gave AMD valuable technology needed to enter the
advanced computer memory chip business. Using this technology, AMD has
done more business and become more profitable, selling $1.05 billion
worth of semiconductors in 1990 and $1.64 billion worth by the end of
1993. Overall, AMD's earnings grew from a $35.9 million loss in 1990
to a $228 million profit in 1993. (The Value Line Investment Survey,
January 28, 1994.)
<P>
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. -- Fujitsu Ltd. <P>
     Newer computers need faster, higher memory, but smaller chips.
Developments in notebook and laptop computer technology have put
pressure on semiconductor manufacturers to produce more advanced
components for these computers. To meet this demand, AMD and Fujitsu
have teamed up to develop a new "flash" memory chip, which is smaller
and faster than similar components found in desktop machines and
represents one of "the fastest-growing segments of the semiconductor
market." (AMD News Release, April 14, 1993, p. 1.) These memory chips
have the ability to retain information even when the power is off.
According to Gene Conner, AMD's Vice President for Operations, such
"collaboration between premier players on a global scale is the wave
of the future" for the semiconductor industry. (Ibid., p. 3.)
American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&T) -- Nippon Electric Company
(NEC). <P>
     Many U.S. companies are breaking into new markets, especially in
Japan, yet research and development costs for new technologies are
extremely high. By emphasizing joint venture partnerships, these cost
can be shared. AT&T, for example, teamed up with NEC of Japan in
January 1992 to manufacture advanced static random access memory
(SRAM) chips for computers and other products. NEC has provided AT&T
with access to advanced SRAM technology, allowing it to introduce a
new product line more quickly than it could have on its own because of
the shared research and development costs.
<P>
LSI Logic Corporation -- Sanyo Corporation. <P>
     Digital high definition television promises to be a profitable
new technology. HDTV has better resolution, digital sound, and a wider
screen; but few companies, Japanese or American, have a competitive
advantage in the many components necessary for this new technology. In
August 1991, LSI and Sanyo announced a strategic alliance in which the
two companies would manufacture semiconductors jointly for HDTV. LSI
specializes in semiconductors tailored to its partners' needs, while
Sanyo has designed some of the most advanced semiconductors available.
Thus, LSI can take advantage of its sophisticated production
techniques and develop Sanyo's advanced semiconductor designs, making
both companies more competitive. LSI also has entered similar
alliances with Nippon Electric Company, Mitsubishi, and Japan Victor
Corporation (JVC).
<P>
Sun Microsystems Inc. -- Fujitsu, Ltd. <P>
     In the mid-1980s, Sun Microsystems had designed an advanced
microprocessor called Sparc, but was unable to develop the chip on its
own because its production techniques were not sufficiently advanced.
Sun Microsystems eventually turned to Fujitsu, one of Japan's largest
computer makers, for design and manufacturing assistance. Fujitsu soon
became the largest Japanese supplier of Sparc microprocessors for sale
in Japan and elsewhere. Today, Fujitsu sells computers built by Sun
Microsytems in Japan under the Fujitsu label. Not only has this
alliance helped an American company bring to market a product stuck in
its design stages; according to Sun Microsytems, it also is helping
the company sell more computers in Japan than it could have sold on
its own. The joint venture has provided the U.S. firm with access and
expertise on how to market and sell products in Japan. The alliance
also has provided Sun with advanced components made by Fujitsu, which
in turn have made Sun's workstations more competitive. Fujitsu now
accounts for about 25 percent of Sun's Japanese sales of $700 million
a year.<P>
     Because U.S. firms have joined hands with Japan's largest
semiconductor manufacturers, access to Japan's market continues to
grow, and U.S. market share continues to increase. Thus, the success
of the U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement is not due to a guaranteed
20 percent of the Japanese market, but to the fact that private
companies have reached across international borders to develop
business relationships on their own without government threats of
trade retaliation.<P>
     Instead of trying to manage trade with Japan and other partners,
the Clinton Administration should expand access to foreign markets for
U.S. businesses. Specifically, it should:<P>

Seek rapid congressional approval of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT). <P>
     After seven years of multilateral negotiations, this wide-ranging
agreement between the U.S. and 123 other nations should be implemented
as soon as possible. The current GATT agreement will reduce tariffs by
as much as 40 percent worldwide and expand international trade by $235
billion a year by the year 2005.
<P>
     There already is some debate in Congress that the current GATT
round will sacrifice U.S. sovereignty and that lower tariffs will
drain government revenues, causing higher taxes or spending cuts.
Accusations of lost sovereignty, however, are unfounded. No
international trade rule, whether emanating from GATT or from some
other multilateral institution like the proposed World Trade
Organization, can be binding on the U.S. Any such rule would have to
be written into law and signed by the President to be binding on U.S.
citizens. (See Joe Cobb, "A Guide to the New GATT Agreement," Heritage
Foundation Backgrounder No. 985, May 5, 1994. See also Joe Cobb, "The
Real Threat to U.S. Sovereignty," Heritage Lecture No. 497, August 1,
1994.)<P>
     In order to maintain the momentum resulting from the conclusion
of seven years of debate and negotiations, the Clinton Administration
should press for quick passage of GATT implementing legislation this
year.
<P>
Extend free trade agreements to other countries in Latin America,
Asia, and Europe. <P>
     The North American Free Trade Agreement expanded the U.S.-Canada
Free Trade Agreement to include Mexico. It now should be expanded to
include other countries like Chile and opened up to countries in Asia,
such as Hong Kong, Japan, and Singapore, and to the new democracies of
Central and Eastern Europe. As an alternative, the U.S. could offer
free trade agreements to these countries separately. This would allow
for the global expansion of free trade while avoiding the diversion of
trade between blocs that occurs when regional agreements such as the
NAFTA and the European Union erect trade barriers to outsiders.
    <P> The Clinton Administration has promised that Chile will be the
next candidate for a free trade agreement. Chile has earned this
opportunity because of economic reforms, begun in the mid-1970s, which
have made it one of the fastest-growing economies in the Western
Hemisphere. Since the mid-1980s, for example, the Chilean economy has
grown at a rate of 5.7 percent a year. With inflation rates stabilized
at around 11 percent, unemployment near 4 percent, and average
salaries rising, Chile makes a good candidate for free trade with the
U.S. (See Michael G. Wilson, "Building on the NAFTA: Forging A Free
Trade Agreement With Chile," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 991,
June 27, 1994.)<P>
<P>     The Clinton Administration should not stop with Chile. It should
begin to prepare for negotiations with other Latin American countries
once negotiations with Chile are complete. The next likely candidates
are Argentina, Colombia, and Costa Rica. The Administration also
should consider offering free trade agreements to the Czech Republic,
Poland, Hungary, and even Russia. Clinton's fiscal year 1995 foreign
aid budget request for Eastern and Central Europe and the newly
independent states of the former Soviet Union is over $1 billion,
(Congressional Presentation Fiscal Year 1995, U.S. Agency for
International Development, 1994.) but the U.S. does almost $10 billion
in trade with that region each year. (USMT:12/93.) Bringing these
countries into free trade areas could expand that trade significantly.
The economic growth created by more foreign trade would improve the
lives of Czechs, Hungarians, and Russians far more than foreign aid.
Moreover, such a move would provide many Eastern European and Eurasian
countries with the economic foundation necessary for continued and
sustained growth.
<P>
Pursue a pact liberalizing trade among the members of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. <P>
     If liberalizing trade with Latin America and Eastern Europe is a
good idea, it is a great idea for Asia. The 17-member forum for Asia-
Pacific Economic Cooperation is a good foundation on which to build a
free trade area in Asia. While offering FTAs to specific Asian
countries, the U.S. should work within APEC to reduce trade barriers
on a regional basis, while seeking to expand the APEC from an informal
forum to a free trade region between the U.S. and APEC's members.
Specifically, President Clinton should use the forum to pursue an
aggressive strategy of reduced tariffs and non-tariff barriers.
 <P>    In this forum, Clinton could urge countries like Japan to work
harder to integrate their economies into the international economy.
Pursuing such a multilateral approach among APEC members could result
in real trade liberalization. Moreover, President Clinton should seek
bilateral free trade areas with specific APEC members with the
eventual goal of including all its members in a free trade area with
the U.S. Clinton should start the process by pursuing a free trade
area with Japan. Such a move would allow both U.S. and Japanese trade
negotiators to eliminate tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade, much
like the U.S. and Mexico have done through the NAFTA. Through this
process, both countries would benefit. For example, U.S. automobile
and auto parts companies could seek reforms in Japan's safety and
inspection laws which restrict the import of American motor vehicles
into Japan by making it difficult for them to get through the
inspection process and into the showroom. Likewise, Japanese
automobile companies could lobby for an end to the American Automobile
Labeling Act and tariff reclassification of minivans, which raise the
cost of Japanese automobiles sold in the U.S. The American Automobile
Labeling Act requires all automobiles sold in the U.S. to specify the
amount of domestic and foreign content of the automobile. The
information must appear next to the sticker price information. This
Act is a protectionist move by the domestic auto industry to portray
automobiles with foreign names as "un-American" products even though
many are built in the U.S.
<P>
Similarly, the tariff reclassification of minivans will raise the
price of imported minivans sold in the U.S. by several thousand
dollars. <P>
     Both of these policies are protectionist maneuvers by U.S.
industry to keep out imports. They would be targets for Japanese
negotiators in free trade negotiations.
Foster private sector strategic alliances between U.S. and foreign
firms. Joint ventures, or "strategic alliances," between U.S. and
foreign firms are far more successful in opening foreign markets than
are such managed trade practices as guaranteeing a fixed share of a
foreign market. They also introduce U.S. companies to technologies far
more advanced than any that have been developed by government-
sponsored industrial policies. These initiatives should be encouraged
and made part of any bilateral trade agreements with U.S. trading
partners.<P>
     As demonstrated by the 1991 Semiconductor Agreement, strategic
alliances expand U.S. business's access to foreign markets,
technology, marketing, management techniques, and capital. With these
assets, American companies can become more competitive. The Clinton
Administration should use the current U.S.-Japan Framework
negotiations to develop language in any forthcoming agreement that
encourages U.S. and Japanese companies to work together when they find
it profitable and useful. For example, a new framework agreement
should incorporate language similar to that found in the 1991
Agreement, which states that "long-term relationships between Japanese
semiconductor purchasers and foreign-affiliated producers, including
joint product development with Japanese customers," should be
promoted. (1991 Semiconductor Agreement, USTR.) While strategic
alliances may not always be successful, they remain America's best
hope for breaking into closed foreign markets.
<P>
CONCLUSION<P>
     President Clinton has brought the U.S. down a dangerous path. By
pursuing managed trade policies whereby the U.S. tries to strong-arm
foreign governments into guaranteeing a fixed share of their market,
Clinton not only raises the risk of a trade war with Japan and other
trading partners, but also misses the boat on how best to open foreign
markets to U.S. goods.<P>
     Much of Clinton's confusion on managed trade stems from a
misreading of the 1991 Semiconductor Agreement. The President believes
this agreement was successful because it guaranteed foreign firms 20
percent of the Japanese semiconductor market. He is mistaken. The real
reason the agreement was a success is that U.S. companies took
advantage of provisions which encouraged the growth of strategic
alliances between private U.S. and Japanese companies.<P>
     Clinton would do well to re-examine the impact of this agreement.
He will discover that successful U.S. companies gained access to
overseas markets on their own, with no help from the U.S. government.
     Instead of trying to manage trade, Clinton should try to remove<P>
barriers to it. He should seek implementation of the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade as quickly as possible and follow up on the North
American Free Trade Agreement by negotiating other agreements with
countries in Latin America, Eastern Europe, and Asia. These would do
far more to open foreign markets to U.S. goods than would any threat
of trade retaliation or guaranteed shares for foreign markets. Free
trade will benefit U.S. businesses and consumers while expanding
economic growth to all corners of the globe.

<h2>
The Tide Is Turning Against Federal Education Bills 
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Phyllis Schlafly
</a>

<P>
 
 
We've heard a lot about Republican plans to return power to the states. 
Bob Dole, in his stump speech, ostentatiously pulls a copy of the Tenth 
Amendment from his pocket, reminding us about the powers that are 
"reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Nothing in the Tenth Amendment, however, authorizes the devolution of 
power to the Governors of the various states. Yet, under the bipartisan 
education bills now moving through Congress, the Federal Government 
would collect taxes, issue new federal regulations about the public 
schools (an area that should be "reserved to the states"), and then 
give the money and the power to the Governors, bypassing state 
legislatures altogether.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This massive legislation, which seeks to restructure public schools 
throughout all 50 states, builds on the Goals 2000 Act and the School-
to-Work Act, both passed in 1994 and signed by President Clinton. 
H.R.1617 (known as the CAREERS bill) passed the House last September by 
a vote of 345 to 79, and its companion S.143 (the Workforce Development 
Act) passed the Senate in October by 95 to 2.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

One might think that such large majorities would mean that the bills 
are not controversial. Actually they've stirred up a hornet's nest.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Speaker Gingrich has just received a letter signed by 63 Republican 
members of the Missouri House objecting to the fact that H.R.1617 
"centralizes unprecedented powers at the federal level" and "supersedes 
state laws and further takes us, the local elected officials of the 
people of this state, out of the process of education." These 
legislators specifically object to the way that the CAREERS act "amends 
out the state legislature, replacing it with the Governor."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Since Missouri has a liberal Democratic Governor, Mel Carnahan, it's 
easy to see why Republican legislators think this is a very bad idea. A 
similar letter was signed by 13 Republican Missouri State Senators.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The letter from the 63 Missouri State Representatives asserts that 
"this practice of avoiding the Legislature is unacceptable and flies in 
the face of the principle of local control of education."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Missouri letter also describes the devious additional ways that 
real power over school curriculum is being gathered into the hands of 
unelected bureaucrats, bypassing all elected officials such as state 
legislators and school boards. This is accomplished through the grant 
application which each Governor must submit in order to access federal 
money under the 1994 laws, as well as under the new legislation.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

These grant applications bind the states to conform to "standards" and 
"assessments" that are written by unelected federal or state 
bureaucrats and over which no elected representative or parent had any 
authority. In addition, the grant applications bind the states to spend 
money that the legislature had not appropriated.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Republican Congressmen who voted for H.R.1617 have made a strenuous 
effort to allay the fears of their constituents by asserting that these 
are "Republican" bills. That's not true.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The fact is that the Senate bill was largely written by a Senator Ted 
Kennedy staffer, the late Steve Spinner, who worked on it for three 
years. On the floor of the U.S. Senate, both Kennedy and Senator Nancy 
Kassebaum paid tribute to Spinner as the principal author of the bill 
and of the whole concept of using the public schools to carry out "work 
force education and employment functions" and turn schools into "a 
comprehensive one-stop delivery system."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The micromanaging of public school curricula that will be exercised by 
the federal bureaucrats is evident from a letter in which the U.S. 
Departments of Labor and Education rejected the State of California's 
grant application for funds from the School to Work Law. The letter 
charged that California showed "a lack of systemic methods within the 
State to integrate vocational and academic curricula" and that 
California had failed to develop "Certificates for Foundations Skills 
and Career Entry."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A letter signed by 14 California State Senators called on Congress to 
"kill" H.R.1617. Among the many reasons cited were the awesome 
provision that would strike "a State" from certain federal laws and 
substitute "the Governor of the State," the extraordinary powers given 
to all Governors, and the setting up of a "National Electronic Data 
Base."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Rep. Henry Hyde (R-IL), who voted for the CAREERS bill last year, has 
changed his mind and recently circulated a "Dear Colleague" letter 
urging the repeal of Goals 2000 and the School to Work Act, as well as 
the defeat of H.R.1617 and S.143. He pointed out that they are all 
designed to implement the plan laid out in an 18-page letter written by 
Marc Tucker to Hillary Clinton on November 11, 1992, to make 
schoolchildren "guinea pigs who will become the human resources for the 
global labor market."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

It is clear from the writings of Marc Tucker, Ira Magaziner, Hillary 
Clinton, Robert Reich, and the legislative history of H.R.1617 and 
S.143 that the goal is to transform public school curricula into 
specific workforce tracks determined by local workforce development 
boards. The proper name for this is National Economic Planning, a.k.a. 
Socialism, a system that has failed all over the world.

INTRODUCTION
<P>
     With the signing of supplemental agreements on labor and
environmental issues on September 14, the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) has now been completed and awaits congressional
consideration. These side agreements had been proposed by President
Bill Clinton during his presidential campaign last year to address
concerns raised by organized labor and environmental groups. Although
they were originally aimed at bolstering NAFTA's fortunes by
persuading reluctant Democrats to support the agreement, they have had
an opposite effect: alienating free market Republicans and Democrats
while failing to win over any protectionists.
<P>
     The Clinton Administration is largely to blame for this result.
By proposing a vast array of regulatory powers for the international
commissions to be established under these side agreements, the
Administration frightened supporters of free trade, who feared that
the NAFTA would be turned into a powerful protectionist device that
would impose significant new burdens on U.S. businesses and greatly
expand government regulation of the economy. Also understandable were
concerns for the effect these international commissions would have on
U.S. federal and state sovereignty.
<P>
     Despite its efforts, the Clinton Administration was unable to
persuade Mexico and Canada to agree to provisions that, they realized,
would reduce their sovereignty. As a result, the U.S. negotiating team
had to settle for face-saving agreements that contained little more
than vague language, including monitoring commissions with little or
no power of enforcement. Although, for political reasons, the
Administration has tried to portray these agreements as substantial
additions to government regulation, they have won no converts among
the protectionists, who correctly see the commissions created under
the accords as largely powerless to raise protectionist trade
barriers. But, ironically, they have managed to convince a sizeable
portion of conservatives and supporters of the free market that the
free trade provisions of the NAFTA have been significantly eroded and
that U.S. sovereignty has been surrendered to the supranational
bureaucracies.
<P>
     In truth, although these side agreements are troublesome and
establish worrisome precedents, the protectionists are correct: they
are largely meaningless. However, that message has yet to be
understood by many conservative and free market critics of the NAFTA,
most of whom continue to base their critique on the Clinton
Administration's original proposals. A close reading should be
sufficient to dispel most of the remaining objections, especially
those regarding sovereignty. Among the most common are:
<P>
Objection #1: The side agreements undermine U.S. sovereignty by
      creating trinational commissions that can force the federal,
      state, and local governments to change their health, safety,
      environmental, and labor laws. In addition, the dispute panels
      created by the councils can force national, state and local
      governments to adopt "action plans" the council has created.
      These plans can supersede federal, state, and local government
      laws. 
<P>
Facts: 
     The side accords establish a Commission for Environmental
Cooperation (CEC) and a Commission for Labor Cooperation (CLC). Each
commission would be run by a council made up of representatives of the
U.S., Mexico, and Canada. Under the CEC, a Secretariat and a Joint
Advisory Group (JAG) made up of non-governmental organizations assists
the council in its activities. A Secretariat and a National
Administrative Office (NAO) in each country performs a similar
function under the CLC.
<P>
     These organizations have no legal power to compel the U.S.
government or the states to do anything. Under no circumstances can
the commissions or councils override U.S. or state laws. Their
function is restricted to serving as a public forum for discussing
environmental and labor issues of mutual concern, monitoring the
enforcement of existing national laws, investigating complaints, and
recommending fines or sanctions. A long and cumbersome process must be
followed before either fines or sanctions can be resorted to, with
many safeguards limiting any potential action.
<P>
     If requested by a member country, the environmental and labor
councils can appoint a panel made up of representatives from the three
countries. This panel will be responsible for investigating complaints
regarding a "persistent pattern of failure... to effectively enforce
[a country's] environmental law [and occupational safety and health,
child labor or minimum wage technical labor standards]." (North
American Agreement On Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC), Final Draft,
Article 22; North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation (NAALC),
Final Draft, Article 33 (The NAFTA:  Supplemental Agreements,
September 13, 1993).) If a panel decides that such a complaint is
valid, it can issue fines and ultimately allow an offended country to
impose sanctions in the form of tariffs. The fines are levied against
the national governments -- not against businesses or individuals --
while sanctions are imposed against the specific industry sector
concerned.
<P>
     However, neither fines nor sanctions can be imposed until after a
long and arduous process of consultations between the countries has
failed to resolve the dispute. More important, any country is free to
reject the decision of the tribunals along with the fine, and the
panel has no power to collect it. If a country chooses not to pay the
fine, the other member countries can impose sanctions in the form of
tariffs, but those tariffs are limited to levels currently in
existence. In other words, even in the worst case, no country would be
worse off than it is now. 
<P>
     It is true that the labor and environmental councils can
authorize the creation of an action plan, but only if such a plan is
"consistent with the law of the Party complained against." This action
plan is established only after a panel has decided there has been
consistent nonenforcement of an environmental or labor law. However,
this action plan is not enforceable. If the country or state decides
to reject the plan, the panel can issue a fine against the federal
government, but not against a state, business, or individual. If it so
wishes, the federal government can choose to ignore the fine, in which
case the offended country can levy tariffs to compensate for the
alleged damage resulting from non-enforcement, but only up to pre-
NAFTA tariff levels. 

<P>
Objection #2: The side agreements mandate ever-increasing government
      regulation regarding labor and environmental issues.
<P>
     Some free market organizations, such as the Washington-based
Competitive Enterprise Institute, oppose the NAFTA, and especially its
side agreements, because they believe these will require increasingly
restrictive environmental and labor standards. According to the CEI,
"the NAFTA side agreements mandating the 'upward harmonization' of
domestic regulations between the signatories will impose foreign
regulations on the United States, and heap costly new regulations on
the impoverished citizens of Mexico, thereby lessening free trade."
("A Declaration of Independence on NAFTA," Competitive Enterprise
Institute, August 1993.) According to Llewellyn Rockwell, Jr., of the
Auburn, Alabama-based Ludwig von Mises Institute, the accords will
"please regulators, union bosses, and environmentalists, but prevent
future Republican presidents from enacting free-market reforms."
(Llewellyn Rockwell, Jr., "Risk of the Side Deals," The Washington
Times, September 7, 1993, p.  E3.) And commentator and former
presidential candidate Patrick Buchanan has said, "If NAFTA passes,
the dream of a conservative-libertarian counterrevolution, to roll
back Big Labor's special interest laws, and to reverse Congress'
capitulations to the Greens, is gone -- forever." (Patrick Buchanan,
"GOP's Drift," The Washington Times, September 10, 1993, p.  F1.)<P>
Facts: <P>
 Free market critics of the NAFTA vastly exaggerate the power of the
commissions to bring about such "upward harmonization" to the point of
invention. Despite its ritual incantation by critics, nowhere in the
text of the NAFTA or the side agreements does the phrase "upward
harmonization" appear. Article 756 of the NAFTA does recommend that
the three countries "pursue equivalence of their respective sanitary
and phytosanitary standards." In other words, to avoid disputes from
arising between countries regarding the preparation and processing of
food products that are traded, the three countries pledge to harmonize
these processes "to the extent feasible." However, neither the NAFTA
nor the side agreements provides an enforcement mechanism for this
commitment if a country chooses not to abide by it. 
<P>
     Article 1114 of the NAFTA text says it is "inappropriate" for a
country to relax standards to encourage foreign investment from
another North American country. Again, there is no enforcement
mechanism for this provision, the countries being encouraged to pursue
"consultations" if a violation of this article occurs. Articles 1114
and 756 are non-binding recommendations, intended to encourage
cooperation between governments, and cannot reasonably be interpreted
as an infringement on national or state sovereignty.
<P>
     Part of the confusion regarding these provisions stems from the
rhetoric of the Clinton Administration, which is keen to portray the
NAFTA side agreements as more substantive than they really are. For
example, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor has said on several
occasions that the side accords will guarantee that no country or
state lowers its standards. Most recently, Kantor wrote in the Wall
Street Journal, "the supplemental agreements will help ensure... that
no nation will lower labor or environmental standards, only raise
them. Of course, all states or provinces can enact more stringent
standards." (Mickey Kantor, "At Long Last, A Trade Pact To Be Proud
Of," The Wall Street Journal, August 17, 1993, p.  A14.) 
<P>
     Kantor is speaking more as an advocate of the agreement than an
objective observer. Although the agreements encourage each country to
maintain high standards, there is absolutely no enforcement provision
if a country fails to do so. Fines and sanctions are applicable only
for countries that do not enforce the laws they themselves have chosen
to enact, a process over which they retain complete control.

<P>
Objection #3: The side accords promote a radical environmental and
      labor agenda that is anti-business. Murray Rothbard of the
      Ludwig von Mises Institute calls the side accords "international
      socialism camouflaged in the fair clothing of freedom and free
      markets. Populists are right to view it with deep suspicion."
      (Murray Rothbard, "Rothbard-Rockwell Report," unpublished draft,
      Center for Liberal Studies, September 1993, p.  14.) 
<P>
 Facts: <P>
 In the labor and environmental side agreements, there is a call for
each government to "promote sustainable development,... promote
education in environmental matters... prepare... reports on the state
of the environment," and "assess environmental impacts." However,
these are all nonbinding recommendations and carry no enforcement
mechanism. Usually unnoticed by critics is the obligation "to promote
the use of economic instruments for the efficient achievement of
environmental goals." In other words, the market is to be used to
address environmental problems -- a far cry from a single-minded
effort to increase government environmental regulation. 
<P>
     Article 3 of the environmental accord does call for each member
country to ensure that its "laws and regulations provide for high
levels of environmental protection." But this nonbinding
recommendation carries no provision for enforcement, including either
fines or sanctions. In fact, it is preceded by a declaration that
explicitly reaffirms each country's sovereignty and freedom of action
by recognizing "the right of each Party [member country] to establish
its own levels of domestic and environmental protection... and to
adopt or modify accordingly its environmental laws and regulations."
(NAAEC, Article 3.)

<P>
Objection #4: The NAFTA and the side accords will force state and
      local governments to lower their standards in order to harmonize
      standards among the three countries. 
<P>
     Groups like Ralph Nader's Public Citizen believe that provisions
like Article 756, requiring countries to "pursue equivalence of their
respective sanitary and phytosanitary standards," could force federal,
state, and local governments to lower standards in order to make them
equivalent to lower Mexican or Canadian standards. Ross Perot has
conjured up images of local authorities being compelled to lower
health and safety standards under the NAFTA in order to allow for the
entry of pesticide-laden Mexican produce.

     <P>
Facts: <P>
This fear is misplaced. The commissions are restricted to monitoring
the enforcement of whatever laws a country chooses to pass; it has no
power to override existing laws or impose new ones.
<P>
     Article 756 is intended to help the U.S., Mexico, and Canada
avoid trade-related disputes that might arise concerning the
preparation and processing of food products. In the past, the U.S. and
state governments have sometimes attempted to protect industries from
outside competition by creating sanitary laws that had placed heavy
costs on foreign and out-of-state producers. These laws usually had
little relationship to consumer safety or health. They are, in fact,
protectionist measures and it would be best if they were done away
with altogether, but Article 756 allows for states and the federal
government to continue these practices, if they wish. 
<P>
     There is an added protection in Article 756 that directs
countries to harmonize standards only "to the extent practicable," and
if it is possible to do so "without reducing the level of protection
of human, animal, or plant life or health."

<P>
Objection #5: With the side accords, the NAFTA package closely
      resembles the European Community's Maastricht Treaty which
      empowers an unelected, international bureaucracy and severely
      limits its member countries's sovereignty over issues such as
      labor relations, the welfare of its citizens, tax policy, and
      immigration. According to NAFTA critics like Samuel Francis,
      "NAFTA really is 'the first vital step' toward the political
      ratification of a global politico-economic regime that would
      swallow national sovereignty." (Samuel Francis, "NAFTA and the
      Sovereign Issues," The Washington Times, August 31, 1993, p. 
      F1.)
<P>
Facts: <P>
The trading arrangement the NAFTA creates within North America is
entirely different from the economic, social, and political
integration Europeans set forth under the Maastricht Treaty. Under the
NAFTA, the U.S., Canada, and Mexico will remove virtually all of their
tariffs and other barriers to imports from one another and also give
added protection to each other's investments. That arrangement is a
far cry from the Maastricht Treaty and European integration in
general. For example: <P>
 Maastricht creates a uniform immigration and foreign policy, and a
common monetary system. The NAFTA does not even mention these.
<P>
In the EC, labor can move freely between member countries. Under the
NAFTA, the U.S. will allow only 5,500 Mexican professionals temporary
entry into the U.S. on trade-related business. In addition, the NAFTA
does not establish a common labor policy in North America.
<P>
The harmonizing of the EC's economic regulations, as well as its
health and welfare laws, is being done by an international bureaucracy
in Brussels. The NAFTA side agreements reaffirm each country's
sovereign right to determine the laws it will create and enforce.
<P>
The EC's bureaucratic directives are enforced through a supranational
judicial system that encroaches on the sovereignty of each member
country. The NAFTA will have no effect on the independence of national
or state judicial systems. In addition, no private rights of action
are allowed under the agreement.
     There is no greater advocate of free trade, nor strenuous
opponent of the EC and its international bureaucracy, than the former
Prime Minister of Britain, Margaret Thatcher. Thatcher said recently
in a speech to Americans: 
<P>
      I<UL> agree with the North American Free Trade Area.... I think
     Mexico is scared stiff that their people will buy from you,
     and you're scared stiff that you'll lose jobs to them.
     You'll both do well. You must have free trade, in fact, to
     get a very enterprising economy. Anyway, if you're good, you
     don't fear competition. Let's face it: America is the most
     scientific, most technologically advanced, most enterprising
     country inthe world. And you have nothing to fear. </UL>
<P>
     
Objection #6: Canada has exempted itself from the sanctions that the
      U.S. and Mexico agreed to. Patrick Buchanan asks, "Can
      Republicans support a treaty that leaves their own country
      subject to trade sanctions that Prime Minister Kim Campbell
      found intolerable for hers?" (Patrick Buchanan, "GOP's NAFTA
      Divide," The Washington Times, August 30, 1993, p.  E1.)
      According to Jim Sheehan of the Competitive Enterprise
      Institute, "NAFTA subjects the U.S. and Mexico to the same trade
      sanctions that Canada utterly rejected as an infringement on its
      autonomy." (James Sheehan, "NAFTA -- Free Trade in Name Only,"
      The Wall Street Journal, September 9, 1993, p.  A21.) 
<P>
 Facts: <P>
     It is true that Canada refused to accept sanctions as a means of
enforcing fines levied by the commissions. The effect, however, is to
deny the Canadian government the right to refuse to pay any fines
levied against it. In the place of sanctions, Canada proposed that
fines become automatically enforceable by Canadian courts, without the
right of appeal. In other words, Canada voluntarily signed away its
right to refuse to pay fines. As a result, Canadian courts will be
required to enforce decisions made by international panels, an
infringement of sovereignty neither the U.S. nor Mexico was willing to
tolerate.
<P>

Objection #7: "Right to Work" states -- those which do not allow union
      membership to be a prerequisite for holding a job -- will be
      forced to rescind their laws because the North American
      Agreement on Labor Cooperation promotes "to the maximum extent
      possible, the labor principles... the right of organized workers
      to freely engaged in collective bargaining," and "the right of
      workers to strike in order to defend their collective
      interests." (NAALC, Article 1.)
<P>
Facts: <P>
These provisions, like most others in the side agreements, are
nonbinding recommendations without enforcement mechanisms. The council
can decide only whether or not a country shows a "persistent pattern
of failure... to effectively enforce its occupational safety and
health, child labor or minimum wage technical labor standards."
(NAALC, Article 33.) This language does not preclude states from
adopting Right to Work laws but merely recognizes the right to
organize and strike, rights already embodied in U.S. federal labor
law. In addition, these provisions only promote the protection of
unions, and do not in any way discourage the creation of Right to Work
laws. 
<P>

Objection #8: The side agreements threaten the U.S. Constitution by
      failing to respect federal and state prosecutorial discretion in
      the enforcement of labor and environmental laws.
<P>
Facts: <P>
     The councils cannot impose fines for persistent nonenforcement of
labor and environmental laws in the U.S. if the government's
nonenforcement (1) is based on reasonable prioirities as to what
violations they will investigate and prosecute, and how they will
enforce compliance generally; or (2) results from legitimate decisions
to spend resources on environmental and labor matters determined to
have higher priorities. (NAAEC, Article 45; NAALC, Article 49.) 
<P>
     Under the side agreements prosecutorial discretion is an
exemption to nonenforcement of labor or environmental laws, and thus
cannot be a basis for assessing fines or sanctions.
<P>

Objection #9: The side agreements will allow private parties, like the
      Sierra Club or industries seeking protection from foreign
      competition, to sue U.S. companies based on a commission finding
      or decision. This will lead to more, not less, litigation under
      the NAFTA.
<P>
Facts: <P>
     Article 38 of the environmental agreement and Article 43 of the
labor agreement bar private groups from suing in federal or state
courts based on any findings or decisions by the commissions. (Under
Article 38 "No Party may provide for a right of action under its law
against any other Party on the ground that another Party has acted in
a manner inconsistent with this Agreement.") In addition, no private
parties can petition the councils to create a dispute panel for
alleged nonenforcement of environmental or labor laws. Only the
governments of each country can petition the council to create a panel
to resolve a dispute arising under the agreement. Even in this
process, a member country must cross many hurdles before being able to
impose sanctions against another member country. The process is
intended to promote consultations and cooperative efforts between the
member countries, not confrontation and litigation. 
<P>

Objection #10: Private companies can be fined or sanctioned under the
      agreement, thus exposing U.S. companies to decisions by
      international bodies.
<P>
Facts: <P>
     Only the national governments of each country can be fined, and
only entire sectors -- and not individual businesses -- are subject to
sanctions, and only then after
<P>
     a panel created by a council has determined that they have
     persistently failed to enforce their own laws; and 
<P>
     they have failed to create an "action plan" to remedy the
     nonenforcement, or have failed to implement an "action plan"
     which they have created themselves, or which was proposed by the
     council.
<P>
     If a national government chooses not to pay the fine, then the
country offended against can impose sanctions in the form of tariffs.
However, tariffs cannot exceed pre-NAFTA levels, which U.S. companies
will continue to face without the NAFTA. 
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
     Fears that the NAFTA side agreements will infringe on U.S.
sovereignty and impose restrictions on state and local authorities are
unfounded. Despite the Clinton Administration's original proposals,
the erosion of free trade and expansion of government regulation
feared by NAFTA supporters did not occur. The economic benefits that
the U.S. will enjoy under the NAFTA will far outweigh any potential
problems under the side agreements, a conclusion arrived at by none
other than Nobel laureate economist Milton Friedman. Protectionist
members of Congress still oppose this agreement because they know that
it is fundamentally a free trade agreement. 
<P>
     Neither should there be any great concern that these side
agreements will interfere with federal, state, and local law
enforcement activities. Federal sovereignty is not threatened under
the side agreements, and state sovereignty issues can be addressed
through the implementing legislation Congress must begin drafting and
which the Administration has promised to support.
<P>
     The public debate over the NAFTA would be better served if facts
took precedence over unfounded fears. A close reading of the side
agreements will show that, despite the best efforts of the Clinton
Administration, the free trade provisions of the NAFTA remain intact
and that the feared erosion of sovereignty never came to pass.
<P>

<title>Schlafly: MSAs Are The Republicans' Best Issue  -- 4/18/96</title>

<h2>
MSAs Are The Republicans' Best Issue
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Phyllis Schlafly
</a>

<P>
What are Republicans going to do about the top election-year issue, 
which is jobs, wages and income?  Real (inflation-adjusted) weekly 
wages have dropped almost 5 percent since 1979.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Business spokesmen are trying to downplay this data by arguing that 
employee fringe benefits have risen from 17 percent of total 
compensation in 1955 to 40 percent in 1994.  Total compensation equals 
take-home pay plus fringe benefits, of which health care is a large 
component.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Workers aren't buying this argument because, while the employer's cost 
to provide the health-care benefit has risen, the value of the health 
care benefit to the employee has declined.  Whereas in 1979, the 
employee's health-care package allowed him to go to any doctor or 
hospital of his choice, now employees are being herded into HMOs where 
they are at the mercy of gatekeepers.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
HMOs suffer from a built-in conflict of interest; the gatekeepers and 
the CEOs make more money if they deny your right to see a specialist.  
That's why opposition to the tactics of the HMOs,and to the windfall 
profits these tactics produce for CEOs and stockholders, is bubbling 
over, and an anti-managed care march is planned for Washington in May.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congressional Republicans have a good answer to these problems, if 
they will only use it.  It could put extra money in the pockets of 
workers whose real wages have declined, and it could ease the strain 
of downsizing by allowing them to take some of their benefits with 
them when they leave the company.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This solution is Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs), which most House 
Republicans campaigned on in 1994.  The Congress passed Rep. Bill 
Archer's excellent MSA bill in the Balanced Budget Act, which Clinton 
vetoed; and then the House passed it again in its health care reform 
bill, now pending.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But President Clinton and the Washington press corps are trying to 
bamboozle the Dole-Gingrich Congress into passing the Kennedy-
Kassebaum bill without MSAs, which would take us a long way into the 
Clintoncare system we thought we had buried in 1994.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Medical Savings Accounts are the best solution to all the problems 
connected with health care:  the high cost, preserving your right to 
choose your own doctor, portability, pre-existing conditions, job 
lock, uninsured Americans, gatekeepers, capitation, deductibles, co-
payments, paperwork, long-term care, Medicare going bankrupt, and even 
the decline in real wages. Here is how MSAs would work.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For those who are in a company plan, the employer would buy you a 
high-deductible policy and pre-pay your deductible (up to $2,000 per 
year for singles and $4,000 for families) by putting it each year into 
your individual Medical Savings Account.  You can use this ready cash 
for your medical costs with the doctors, hospitals and clinics you 
choose, and the high-deductible policy covers you for additional 
expenses.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
You would own your own MSA (just as you now own your automobile 
insurance).  That means you can take it with you when you change jobs, 
thus solving the problems of portability, pre-existing conditions, and 
job lock.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What if you are self-employed, a part-timer, or are not in an 
employer-paid health plan?  In those cases, you can set up your MSA 
and your high-deductible policy with your own money.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Archer bill would give MSAs pretty much the same tax-deductibility 
that is now enjoyed exclusively by company-paid plans.  Our present 
system is unjust, unfair and intolerable because it grants tax-
deductibility only to plans owned by employers, but not to plans that 
allow individual employees to own their own health insurance, control 
their own health care spending, or set up their own plan.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
That is probably the most discriminatory feature of the entire federal 
legal system.  The officers of big corporations enjoy gold-plated 
health insurance paid for with tax-deductible dollars, but the 
waitress, the part-timers and the self-employed can buy health 
insurance only with after-tax dollars (which means it costs double).
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The sweetest part of MSAs is that whatever you don't spend will stay 
in your MSA and build up as a tax-free, interest-bearing savings 
account (only 11 percent of all insured individual Americans spend 
more than $2,000 a year on health care).  That will bring down health 
care costs dramatically because MSAs will put consumer discipline into 
the marketplace and provide incentives to save.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Your MSA will grow as you or your employer puts in a new payment every 
year.  MSAs will be available now and in the future for many medical 
expenses often not covered by company plans (such as eye glasses, 
dental care, or preventive care) or by Medicare (prescriptions and 
long-term care).
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress should reject the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill, ignore the HMO 
lobbyists, and instead give workers the MSAs that the Republican 
majority in Congress promised.

<P>
INTRODUCTION
<P>
     With the passage last November of the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA), the Clinton Administration has the opportunity to
set in motion a free trade revolution throughout the Western
Hemisphere. By expanding the NAFTA beyond the United States, Mexico,
and Canada, and pursuing an aggressive free trade agenda with Latin
America, the Clinton Administration can help create vast new markets
for U.S. exports and solidify free-market democracy in a region that
only 15 years ago was dominated by dictators and was beset by
diminishing hopes of prosperity. 
<P>
     Today, Latin America is the fastest growing region in the world
for U.S. trade and the only region where the U.S. enjoys a trade
surplus. Free trade with Chile and other reform-minded countries in
the Western Hemisphere such as Argentina and Colombia, makes sense
just like the NAFTA makes sense. Trade deals are a good way to lock
into place free market reforms and expand global trade. They also are
the key to boosting U.S. economic competitiveness and job creation at
home. Despite this, the Clinton Administration seems to be moving in
slow motion on advancing free trade in the Americas. The
Administration did request on June 16 fast-track negotiating authority
from Congress. Fast-track authority guarantees that any future trade
deal will receive an up-or-down vote from Congress, without amendment.
But the Administration's request was for seven years with no single
country identified as a top priority. (Peter Behr, "White House Floats
Trade Talks Plan," The Washington Post, June 17, 1994, p. F1. )In
spite of these mixed signals from the Clinton Administration regarding
its Latin American trade agenda, leaders in the region are wasting no
time. For example, already more than 20 free trade agreements have
been signed among these nations, with intra-regional trade increasing
in value by over 135 percent between 1986 and 1992. (Representative
Jim Kolbe, "Principles for the Creation of a Western Hemisphere Free
Trade Area," an address given before the Association of American
Chambers of Commerce in Latin America, Washington, D. C., May 5, 1994.
) 
<P>
     The next step in this process should be to extend the free trade
benefits of the NAFTA to Chile. In doing so, President Clinton would
be honoring a pledge made by former President George Bush to then-
Chilean President Patricio Aylwin in 1992 that free trade negotiations
would begin as soon as possible after the NAFTA was passed. In his
annual trade report, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor
acknowledged Bush's pledge when he noted on May 4 that Chile is the
only country with which the U.S. is "committed to [negotiate] a free
trade agreement. " ("Report to the President and the Congress on
Significant Market Opening," Office of the United States Trade
Representative, Washington, D. C., May 1994. ) 
<P>
     The focus on Chile makes economic sense. Chile is a free market
and democratic success story. No country in the developing world has
moved farther and faster in adopting free market democratic reforms.
In 1973, Chilean military leader Augusto Pinochet embarked on a
program to privatize state-owned industries, liberalize investment
rules, retire Chile's debt burden, lower taxes, and reduce trade
barriers. With the election of Patricio Aylwin in December 1990,
Chile's "economic miracle" was followed by a democratically elected
government. The transition to democracy in Chile was completed in
March 1994, when leadership was transferred from Aylwin to newly
elected President Eduardo Frei. Frei took office stressing that his
country would remain on the free market path and that Chile would
continue to push for a free trade pact with the United States. 
<P>
     The White House can acknowledge Chile's embrace of democratic
capitalism and advance its own hemispheric trade policy on June 27 and
28, when Frei visits Washington for a "working visit" with Clinton and
senior U.S. officials. By inviting Chile to enter negotiations for its
participation in the NAFTA, President Clinton will signal such
countries as Argentina, Colombia, Brazil, and Venezuela that the U.S.
sees NAFTA as just the first step in a process that might one day
include the entire hemisphere. 
<P>
     To instill confidence in the U.S. as a world economic leader,
boost U.S. exports and job growth through free trade, as well as live
up to the commitments made to the Chilean government and people, the
Clinton Administration should:
<P>
Seek multilateral fast-track authority and inform Congress that it
    intends to begin negotiations with Chile. Fast-track authority
    shields trade agreements from congressional amendments and
    protectionist tinkering that almost certainly would kill most
    trade negotiations. Without it, serious free trade talks cannot
    begin. 
<P>
Announce at the June 27-28 Clinton-Frei meeting that negotiations
    between the two countries will commence once fast-track authority
    is approved. <P>
Bring Chile into the NAFTA, rather than negotiating a bilateral free
    trade pact. While this could be more complicated because of
Mexican and Canadian participation, future NAFTA accession by additional
    countries will be easier once the first new member is accepted. 
<P>
Refrain from seeking far-reaching labor, environmental, and social
    "side accords" in the negotiations with Chile. Sufficient
    protection in these areas already exists in the current NAFTA
    agreement and additional provisions and bureaucracy only will
    undermine the free trade components of the pact with Chile. 
<P>
Make free trade with Chile and other hemispheric countries a top
    priority at the Summit of the Americas. The heads of state of the
    34 Latin American democracies will meet in Miami in December 1994.
<P>
Link the expansion of NAFTA to Chile with a broader commitment to free
    trade throughout the Western Hemisphere. In 1990 George Bush
    launched his Enterprise for the Americas Initiative (EAI) to 
    spread free trade throughout the Western Hemisphere. It has
    attracted widespread support from hemispheric leaders. Clinton now
    should create his own EAI. Besides creating a free trade zone
    stretching from Alaska to Antarctica, the EAI would spur regional
    prosperity and stability by assisting Latin American countries to
    attract foreign investment, find debt relief, and apply free
    market solutions to environmental protection. 
<P>
CHILE'S LEADERSHIP IN THE LATIN AMERICAN FREE MARKET REVOLUTION
<P>
     Chile has earned the opportunity to be a free trade partner
because of a campaign of free market reforms that began in the mid-
1970s. The government of Augusto Pinochet in 1973 eliminated price
controls, reduced tariffs across the board to a flat rate of
approximately 10 percent, privatized most of Chile's large state-owned
companies, cut back restrictions on foreign investment, and reduced
taxes. <P>
     This economic reform paid off. Since the mid-1980s, the economy
has grown at an average annual rate of 5. 7 percent, inflation has
been reduced to 11 percent from 21 percent in 1989, unemployment has
decreased to approximately 4. 5 percent last year from 12 percent in
the late 1980s, average salaries are rising, and exports have
increased to over 30 percent of Chile's Gross Domestic Product.
("Chile:Exports, Investment, and Economy," Chilean Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, No. 47, January 1994, p. 17. )Chilean products are of a high
quality and compete well in world markets. Because foreign investors
are offered favorable terms regarding taxation, expatriation of
profits, legal protection, and respect for property rights, some $6
billion in foreign investment has been attracted to Chile since 1985.
By the mid-1990s, foreigners are expected to commit some $20 billion
in new capital to Chile's robust economy. (For more information see
John F. H. Purcell and Dirk W. Damrau, "Chile:An Investment-Grade
Credit," Salomon Brothers, May 1991. ) 
<P>
 U.S. -CHILEAN ECONOMIC TIES<P>
     This record of free market reforms and the transition to
democracy has spurred the U.S. to consider free trade talks with
Chile. Washington and Santiago signed a free trade and investment
framework agreement on October 1, 1990, paving the way for an eventual
U.S. -Chile free trade agreement. The accord established a joint
U.S. -Chile Council on Trade and Investment to monitor bilateral
economic ties and to further open markets to both nations. Agenda
items for the Council have included cooperation in the Uruguay Round
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), increasing
market access for goods and services, protecting intellectual property
rights, improving investment policy, promoting the EAI, and reducing
tariffs. <P>
     U.S. -Chilean economic ties have been expanding rapidly for
several years. Trade between the two countries has grown for seven
straight years, reaching some $4. 2 billion in 1993. ("NAFTA Accord
Back on Chile's Agenda," The Financial Times, May 5, 1994. )The U.S.
is Chile's principal trading partner, accounting for about 23 percent
of Chile's total imports and absorbing 20 percent of its exports.
Within the past decade, U.S. -Chilean trade doubled in volume.
("Chile-Economic Trends," Embassy of the United States, Santiago,
Chile, January 1994, p. 1. ) <P>
     According to the Central Bank of Chile, Chilean exports to the
U.S. in 1993 exceeded $1. 6 billion. The composition of these exports,
however, has changed over the past ten years. While copper continues
to be the main U.S. import, Chilean fresh fruit, seafood, chemical
products, and wine also have found their way to the American
marketplace. <P>
     U.S. exports to Chile, one of America's fastest growing markets,
totaled approximately $2. 4 billion in 1993 and have grown by 200
percent since 1986. Chile's imports from the U.S. are heavily weighted
toward high-tech equipment, such as computers, and consumer goods.
(For more information on the content and quantity of U.S. -Chile
trade, see "Trade and Investment Between Chile and the United States
for 1993," Embassy of Chile, August 1991. )<P>
     The U.S. also is the principal foreign investor in Chile's
banking, insurance, forestry, mining, light manufacturing, and
agricultural industries. As a result of the high returns on foreign
investments, a total of some $3 billion in foreign investment flowed
into Chile last year alone. Total investments in Chile surpassed 27
percent of GDP last year, six times the average rate for the region.
("Chile Lights Way for its Neighbors," The Financial Times, February
17, 1994. )<P>

THE CASE FOR A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT WITH CHILE<P>
     There are many Latin American countries that could be candidates
for a free trade agreement with the U.S. However, Chile's economic
promise puts it at the head of the list. In fact, there are six
reasons why the U.S. and its NAFTA partners should begin free trade
negotiations with Chile. 
<P>
REASON #1: Chile's economy is one of the most open and advanced in
    Latin America. Since the mid-1970s, Chile has reduced the number
    of its government-owned enterprises from approximately 500 in the
    mid-1970s to about 50 today. Moreover, the average tariff rate has
    dropped from about 105 percent during the two years of the Marxist
    government of Salvador Allende prior to 1973 to 11 percent in
    1993. And while in 1973 Chile's GDP shrank by some 12 percent, it
    grew by over 10 percent in 1992 and a still impressive 7 percent
    last year. ("U.S. Market Access in Latin America:Recent
    Liberalization Measures and Remaining Obstacles," United States 
    International Trade Commission Report No. 2521, June 1992, pp. 5-1
    to 5-22. )Chile's economy is one of the fastest growing and most
    open in the world. With much of this growth fueled by trade,
    accession to the NAFTA is sure to further boost the economic
    performance of all signatories. 
REASON #2:Other countries in Latin America would be encouraged to
    follow Chile's democratic and free market model, thus advancing
    the prospects for hemisphere-wide free trade. Rapidly concluding
    an agreement with Chile will encourage other countries in Latin
    America to imitate Chile's unsurpassed economic and democratic
    successes. These countries are eager to sign free trade pacts with
    Washington or to join NAFTA directly, in order to attract American
    investment and to boost exports to the U.S. If Chile joins NAFTA
    quickly, they will conclude that their reforms might lead to
    similar results. Already Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica,
    El Salvador, Uruguay, and Venezuela are modeling much of their
    economic reform program on Chile's. The hemisphere-wide momentum
    toward democracy and free market reforms must not be allowed to
    slow. Acknowledging the country that has reformed the most will
    undermine populist and nationalist opponents of free market
    reforms that still exist throughout the region. <P>
REASON #3:There is little opposition to free trade with Chile from
    U.S. labor unions. A free trade agreement with Chile will meet
    little opposition from organized labor in the U.S., unlike the
    NAFTA. The reasons:Chilean sales of fruit and seafood to the U.S.
    require the intensive use of American labor at ports of entry, and
    thus will create new jobs here. More important, Chile exports much
    less to the U.S. than Mexico and Chilean imports do not affect
    economic sectors in the U.S. that are heavily unionized.
    Moreover, the AFL-CIO, America's leading labor union, and Texas
    billionaire Ross Perot, both strong NAFTA foes, have not made much
    effort to undermine an agreement with Chile. In fact, a number of
    unions are now looking into ways that they can benefit from NAFTA
    and other trade pacts. ("NAFTA Success May Aid New Trade Accords,"
    The Wall Street Journal, June 13, 1994, P. A1. )The obstacle in
    the U.S. to free trade with Chile, therefore, is not
    protectionism, but indifference. <P>
REASON #5: U.S. agricultural interests have no reason to oppose an
    FTA with Chile. Chile's growing seasons are the reverse of those
    in the U.S. When U.S. produce is coming to market, Chile is in
    the midst of winter -- and thus is not exporting agricultural
    goods to the U.S. The result:Chilean grapes, kiwi fruit, peaches,
    plums, and apples do not compete directly with crops grown by
    American farmers. Lacking competition from Chilean farmers,
    American farmers and agricultural groups will be less opposed to a
    free trade pact with Chile than they were in the case of Mexico,
    which has the same growing season as the U.S. (See: "Chile:
    Exports, Investment, and the Economy," No. 47, The Chilean
    Ministry of Foreign Affairs, January 1994. )
<P>
REASON #6: Chile has already demonstrated that it is a safe climate
    for U.S. investors. Americans already have over $1. 5 billion
    invested in Chile, primarily in the mining, financial services,
    agriculture, forestry, and telecommunications industries.
    According to the Commerce Department, U.S. profits on investments
    in Chile have been more than 40 percent per year for the past four
    years. Chile offers American investors political stability and a
    well-educated work force. It also is the fastest growing market in
    Latin America for such U.S. -produced capital equipment as mining
    and agricultural machinery. By removing trade barriers and
    restrictions on investment, a free trade pact would facilitate
    American investments in Chile. (For more information on Chile's
    investment climate, see: "Chile :Foreign Investment Report,"
    Chilean Foreign Investment Committee, February 1994. )
<P>
CLINTON'S SLOW MOTION ON U.S.-LATIN TRADE <P>
     Despite the preponderance of evidence in favor of early free
trade negotiations with Chile, the Clinton Administration has sent
mixed signals about its Latin American trade strategy. Senior trade
and economic advisors at the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and
State privately acknowledge that they have been nudging Clinton and
Trade Representative Kantor to be more aggressive in spreading free
trade in the Western Hemisphere. These officials stress that a free
trade agenda needs to be established no later than this fall so that
it can be unveiled in Miami next December at the so-called Summit of
the Americas. (The Clinton Administration announced last December 1 in
Mexico City its intentions to host a 34-nation Western Hemisphere
summit in Miami, Florida, this December. During the announcement, Vice
President Al Gore called for greater hemispheric coordination on
economic, environmental, political, and cultural issues, and referred
to the NAFTA "as a starting point for dealing with the common
challenges of the Americas. "The Heritage Foundation has been urging
the Administration to make free trade and economic reform the top
issues at the historic summit. )They understand that failure to do so
will be seen as a lack of leadership by the U.S. But other than
rhetoric about expanding free trade in the Western hemisphere, there
has been little movement by the White House and USTR on enlarging the
NAFTA. ("USTR Foot-Dragging on Post-NAFTA Policy Leads to New
Initiatives," Inside NAFTA, from the publishers of Inside U.S. Trade,
Washington, D. C., Vol. 1, No. 8 (April 20, 1994), p. 1. )<P>
     To be sure, the USTR has been distracted with finishing the
Uruguay Round of GATT talks. In addition, there is a growing sense in
Washington that additional trade negotiations will take a back seat to
other issues important to the Administration, like health care reform.
The coming mid-term congressional elections, combined with the need to
obtain congressional passage of implementing legislation for the GATT
agreement by August, has cooled interests in pushing vigorously ahead
with Chile and other Latin American countries. Moreover, the
Administration has yet to develop a concrete plan on how to spread
free trade throughout the hemisphere and on what types of agreements
it will negotiate. The NAFTA implementing legislation, however,
mandates that the President deliver to Congress by July 1 precisely
such a plan on U.S. trade policy. <P>
     There also are mounting cries from the protectionist wing of the
Democratic party to go slow -- or scuttle entirely -- trade expansion
in the Americas. While House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt
introduced a bill in Congress on May 9 calling for the start of free
trade negotiations with Chile, the bill is seen by free traders to be
largely a smokescreen for protectionist interference. (The Chile Free
Trade Agreement Negotiating Act of 1994 was co-sponsored by
Representatives Bill Richardson (D-NM), Robert Torricelli (D-NJ), and
Senator Harris Wofford (D-PA), all strong opponents of the NAFTA and
free trade. )The reason:The Gephardt bill ties free trade talks with
Chile to rigid labor and environmental conditions, and attempts to
codify trade regulation that can be used in all trade talks in the
region. Many leading Republican members of both the House and the
Senate, who swallowed the environmental and labor side-accords in the
NAFTA, seem less willing to do the same in future trade deals.
Moreover, Chile has even hinted that it would not negotiate an
agreement that contained such strict non-trade regulations and that it
would seek new trade opportunities in the rest of Latin America and
Asia. <P>
     Consequently, the Administration is playing down the expectations
of Latin American countries on free trade. For example, James Jones,
the U.S. Ambassador to Mexico, stated on May 10 that no new members
are likely to be admitted to the NAFTA during 1994 because "the U.S.
congressional calendar is full" and because there is a "shortage of
time. " ("Kevin G. Hall, "Ex-NAFTA Advisors Discourage Separate
Bilateral Accords," The Journal of Commerce, June 1, 1994. )Given
these confusing signals from the President, the Congress, and the
USTR, supporters of free trade in the Americas doubt the White House's
philosophical and political commitment to advancing the NAFTA beyond
Mexico. 
<P>
CHILE AND THE POST-NAFTA AGENDA FOR THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION
<P>
     In his "Report to the President and the Congress on Significant
Market Opening," Kantor lauded Chile as a "leader [throughout Latin
America] in long-term macroeconomic stabilization" and stressed that
Chile's record of "sustained economic growth and efforts to alleviate
poverty are also unsurpassed. " ("Chile Singled Out for Trade Pact,"
The Journal of Commerce, May 5, 1994. )The report states unequivocally
that "The Administration intends to work with the Congress towards
[the goal of a U.S. -Chile FTA]. "<P>
     The Clinton Administration must back up its rhetoric with
concrete actions. Free trade with Chile will help consolidate and
expand the mutually beneficial relationship that has developed between
the two countries in recent years. To spur economic prosperity
throughout the Americas by extending the benefits of the NAFTA to
Chile, the Clinton Administration should: 
<P>
Obtain broad-based, multilateral fast-track authority and inform
     Congress that the President intends to begin negotiations with
     Chile. <P>
     "Fast-track" negotiating authority allows the Administration to
negotiate a comprehensive agreement and present it to Congress for
approval or rejection as a whole. (For a full discussion of the
process, see Wesley R. Smith, "Why Bush Needs the Fast Track for Trade
Negotiations," Heritage Foundation Issue Bulletin No. 163, April 30,
1991. )This process frees the trade negotiators from concerns that
what they agree to at the bargaining table will be amended by
Congress. Congress approved fast-track authority for President Bush's
NAFTA negotiations with Mexico; this authority was extended through
last December 15 to cover final negotiations of the Uruguay Round of
the GATT, but has now expired. <P>
     Under fast-track rules, free trade talks with a given country
cannot begin until 60 legislative days after Congress has been
notified. Therefore, time is running out for negotiations to begin
this year. If the Administration hopes to begin negotiations with
Chile this year, it must obtain fast track authority before the
traditional August congressional recess and the start of the fall
campaign season. Once the campaigns begin, it will be virtually
impossible to conduct sober debate over such a potentially divisive
issue as free trade. <P>
Announce at the June 27-28 Clinton-Frei meeting that negotiations
     between the two countries will commence once fast track authority
     is approved. <P>
     The upcoming visit to Washington by Chilean President Frei gives
President Clinton the opportunity to reclaim the free trade high
ground and end the drift in U.S. trade policy since the conclusion of
GATT last December. The visit will give Clinton a platform on which to
declare his commitment to early free trade negotiations with Chile,
and to restate the vision for free trade throughout the hemisphere.
Soon after he was elected, Clinton told the American people:"I think
that a major part of our economic future rests in building up a strong
two-way trade with Latin America. . . . I hope that we can get a trade
agreement with Chile. I'm also very encouraged by what's going on in
Argentina now. " (Remarks by then-Governor Bill Clinton before the
Bipartisan Congressional Leadership Press Conference, November 19,
1992. )The Frei visit will give Clinton the chance to recall that
message. 
<P>
Refrain from seeking far-reaching labor, environmental, and social
     "side accords" in the negotiations with Chile. 
     Issues not directly related to trade issues should not be made an
integral part of future free trade agreements, whether they be in
Latin America, Europe, or Asia. Labor standards, environmental
enforcement, human rights, anti-drug efforts, or even levels of
democratic development should not be tied directly to whether or not
the U.S. decides to enter into a free trade agreement with a specific
country. Free trade is a goal that should be pursued on its own merit.
(For more information, see Kolbe, op. cit., pp. 7-10. )It is important
to remember that as countries become more developed economically, they
also tend to improve labor standards, protect the environment, observe
human rights, promote the rule of law, and advance democratic
governance. A heavy dose of labor and environmental regulation will
only serve to destroy the bi-partisan, pro-free trade coalition that
has grown in the U.S. and diminish interest in free trade in the
developing world. <P>
     Senate Republicans have already warned Clinton that there is
"lack of consensus . . . with regard to . . . your proposal [to] link
trade to labor and environmental issues. " (Letter from Senator Robert
Dole, et al. to President Clinton, June 21, 1994. )In a letter signed
by all 44 GOP Senators regarding the Administration's request for
fast-track negotiating authority, Republicans pointed out that "the
relationship between trade and labor and environmental matters raises
important questions," an examination of which would be denied if the
Administration negotiates them under fast-track rules that require an
up-or-down vote with no changes to the agreement. 
<P>
Bring Chile into the NAFTA, rather than negotiating a bilateral free
      trade pact. <P>
     The Chilean Finance Minister, Eduardo Aninat, stated last month
that the Frei government would rather join the NAFTA than negotiate a
bilateral pact. ("NAFTA Accord Back on Chile's Agenda," The Financial
Times, May 27, 1994. )For its part, the Clinton Administration has yet
to decide which countries will qualify for free trade negotiations,
and whether these countries will join the NAFTA, negotiate bilateral
pacts, or seek free trade status with the U.S. as blocs. U.S. Trade
Representative Kantor, however, has stressed that direct accession to
NAFTA should be possible for Latin American nations like Chile which
"seem to be in a position to be able to take on NAFTA obligations. "
("Kantor Signals the need for Interim Trade Pacts in Latin America,"
Inside U.S. Trade, January 28, 1994. )Kantor was referring to the fact
that Chile has moved farther and faster than practically any other
developing country in its free market reform program. <P>
     The Clinton Administration would be wise not to adopt a rigid
"cookie cutter" approach to expanding trade throughout the region. The
multilateral negotiations needed to expand NAFTA will be more
difficult than reaching bilateral agreement on a country-by-country
basis. But Chile's advanced economy makes it an excellent candidate
for inclusion in the NAFTA. Examples:its tariffs are low, it has a
deregulated economy, it has liberal investment laws, and its labor
standards are advanced. A bilateral approach could be used by
protectionists who feel that the labor and environmental side accords
to the NAFTA do not go far enough. They would use bilateral
negotiations as an opportunity to essentially renegotiate the NAFTA or
as a wedge to inflict cumbersome regulations on new trade partners.
(The author is indebted to former Deputy U.S. Trade Representative
Julius Katz for his views on this issue, which he presented during a
Heritage Foundation Panel Discussion "The Kantor Report And What It
Means For Free Trade In Latin America," June 8, 1994. ) <P>
     As Representative Jim Kolbe (R-AZ) recently stated:"Countries who
want to join the NAFTA should agree to undertake the obligations
outlined in each chapter and then negotiate phase-in periods and
exceptions in the annexes of each chapter. But the overarching
principle must be eventual assumption of NAFTA's obligations.
Exceptions should be kept to a minimum. " (Kolbe, op. cit., p. 5.
)Moreover, the NAFTA provides a trade standard that will make it
easier for importers and exporters to conduct business unencumbered by
the requirements of a plethora of country-specific agreements. The
NAFTA is viewed as the best trade expansion model by such groups as
the U.S. Chamber to Commerce, the Council of the Americas, most Latin
American governments, and almost all pro-free trade Members of
Congress. <P>

Make free trade with Chile and other hemispheric countries a top
     priority at the Summit of the Americas. <P>
     The Clinton Administration should be congratulated for its
decision to hold a summit of 34 democratic nations from the Western
Hemisphere in Miami this December. Such a meeting has not been held
since a 1967 meeting in Punta del Este, Uruguay. Administration
officials have suggested that the summit agenda will include many
issues besides trade, including democracy, the environment, human
rights, and "sustainable development. " (Assistant USTR Carmen
Suro-Bredie discussed the summit at a Heritage Foundation Panel
Discussion, "The Kantor Report and What It Means for Free Trade in
Latin America," June 8, 1994. )<P>
     This broad array of issues, however, would dilute the summit
agenda. Progress in trade, investment, and market reforms will bring
the economic wealth needed to address these other compelling issues.
In preparing the summit agenda, the Administration should make it
clear to its summit partners that trade will be the top priority. This
message will be well appreciated by Latin leaders who understand the
importance of trade. The Administration should also establish the year
2000 as a target date for the creation of a Western Hemisphere free
trade community. This admittedly ambitious deadline will provide the
governments and negotiators impetus to proceed aggressively with free
market reforms and free trade talks. <P>

Link the expansion of NAFTA to Chile with a broader commitment to free
     trade throughout the hemisphere. <P>
     Clinton should create his own EAI-style program that would build
a free trade zone spanning the entire hemisphere. The 1990 EAI concept
has attracted widespread support from hemispheric leaders from Frei in
Chile to Salinas in Mexico. The goals of such a program should be to
1) create a free trade zone in the Americas, 2) stimulate foreign
investment in the region, 3) cancel U.S. government loans to countries
that pursue free market reforms, 4) wean countries away from the
reliance on foreign assistance programs, and 5) find free market
solutions to protecting the environment. <P>
     The EAI offered a vision for democratic capitalism that went
beyond the narrow objectives of trade. Clinton should adopt this
vision explicitly as his own and use free trade negotiations with
Chile to give new life to the EAI. Doing so would signal to other free
market democracies in the region, such as Argentina, Costa Rica,
Colombia, and Venezuela that U.S. relations throughout the hemisphere
will be inclusive and comprehensive. 
<P>
CONCLUSION<P>
     The U.S. and Chile both will be winners under a free trade pact.
The benefits for the U.S. will be increased markets for American
goods, lower priced and better quality products for consumers, more
jobs, and a more stable and economically prosperous Latin America. For
Chile, the key benefits of an FTA will be more jobs, increased export
earnings, more U. S investment, a more competitive economy, and
greater political stability resulting from economic growth and
prosperity. <P>
     Now that countries like Chile have the confidence to seek free
trade agreements with the U.S., Washington should not lack the
confidence or leadership to negotiate these agreements. The Clinton
Administration can fortify Chile's impressive gains and create strong
incentives for free market reform throughout Latin America by signing
a free trade pact with Chile. Clinton also should enlist Chilean
President Eduardo Frei's help to promote a trade agenda linking the
hemisphere. A U.S. -Chile FTA will be a first, but very important step
in this direction. An FTA with Chile, as well as the EAI-style
program, will create new and vibrant markets throughout the Western
Hemisphere for U.S. products. It also will help spread economic
prosperity and political stability in the region. <P>
     By contrast, indifference or inaction by Washington could result
in a setback for free markets, democracy, and security in the
Americas. If the Clinton Administration does not take advantage of the
current pro-free market and pro-democracy mood in the region, Latin
American countries could grow increasingly skeptical of U.S. free
trade policy. This could lead to socialist and anti-democratic
backlashes throughout the region. In the long run, therefore, Chile's
success or failure will help determine whether Latin America remains
mired in poverty, debt, drugs, and violence, or joins the U.S.,
Canada, and Mexico in creating what could become the world's most
prosperous and competitive free market -- a free trade zone spanning
the entire Western Hemisphere. <P>

<h2> The Standard Bearer Returns
</h2>
Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
<p>

Taxpayers, it's no time to despair. The anti-government   
revolt that swept the Democrats out of power in Congress is still   
on. But in the newest twist, the revolt has exposed the   
Republican establishment's own compromises with government power.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The evidence comes from a dramatic political contest in the  
14th district of Texas. Former Congressman and intellectual  
firebrand Ron Paul won the Republican runoff for the House seat  
currently held by party switcher Greg Laughlin. The results have  
sent shock waves through Republican ruling circles.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Though a Democrat only yesterday, Mr. Laughlin had money,  
media access, the endorsement of the Republican elite, and the  
use of the party's biggest guns. Dr. Paul, in contrast, was the  
outsider who gained a stunning 9-point victory by stressing his  
independence, ideals, and pristine record.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


In Washington, the race became a loyalty test. The House  
leadership prevailed upon 53 high-ranking Congressmen to send  
contributions to the Laughlin campaign. The party dispatched its  
own ample funds, along with Newt Gingrich and Tom DeLay, the two  
George Bushes, and even Reagan-era leftover Ed Meese.  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


But bigshots couldn't muscle the voters in this largely   
rural district. The endorsements only confirmed Dr. Paul's claim   
not to be part of any machine. In fact, Phil Gramm's ads for the   
Laughlin campaign had to be pulled when they began to backfire.   
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 
The Laughlin strategy assumed, without evidence, that voters   
trust the Republican leadership to tell them how to vote. But the   
bloom was already off that rose. Republicans have run Congress   
for more than a year, and taxes are still high, spending is   
higher, living standards continue to fall, and our liberties are   
just as imperiled.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


When Mr. Laughlin switched from the Democrat Party, the   
Republican leadership put him on the Ways and Means Committee,  
the best seat in the House for buying and selling special favors.   
But an insider deal couldn't erase Mr. Laughlin's voting record,   
which was Clintonesque to the core. His switch was not   
ideological, of course, but political. Throw in the  Roll Call    
scoop that he is Washington's number one junket taker, and he   
became the personification of double-dealing politics.   
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

  
The party claimed to support Mr. Laughlin because it wanted   
to show that converts can win elections. But that doesn't explain   
the timing. The switch occurred only after Dr. Paul told the   
House leadership of his intention to run. The deeper truth is   
that the leadership wanted to keep Dr. Paul and his   
uncompromising approach at bay.     
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Dr. Paul's voting record is a portrait of courage and of   
unshakable devotion to liberty. He worked against taxes,   
spending, foreign wars, and pork-barrel projects, even in his own   
district. In the ratings of the National Taxpayers Union, he   
holds the all-time highest score.   
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 
When he was in Congress before, Dr. Paul never hesitated to   
buck the party leadership and vote against its hidden tax   
increases and unbalanced budgets. He tossed special interest   
groups out of his office. And he resisted personal pressure from   
Ronald Reagan to vote for IMF subsidies and military pork.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Dr. Paul was the first politician in this century to   
introduce term-limits legislation, not just for politicians, but   
also for federal judges and bureaucrats. He was the first to call   
for the abolition of Congressional pensions, and refused to take   
part in that giveaway. He was the first to call for the BATF to   
be abolished. And thanks to his efforts on behalf of the gold   
standard, the U.S. now mints the best-looking gold coins in the   
world.   
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 
He is an eloquent spokesman for states rights and individual   
liberties against federal intrusion, for sound money against   
inflation and other Fed manipulations, and for self government   
against centralized power. His foreign policy views are those of   
George Washington: trade with all and belligerence toward none.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Dr. Paul combines his idealistic political philosophy with   
an impressive technical knowledge of economics. He is an exponent   
of the Austrian School, and knows more about such subjects as   
business cycles and central banking than most working economists   
and any sitting member of Congress.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


As a physician who has brought more than 4,000 babies into   
the world, he also knows that the biggest enemy the family has is   
our declining economy, thanks to excessive taxes and regulations.   
He knows that the government is also to blame for our failing   
educational system.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


In his fight, Dr. Paul forged a coalition that included the   
religious right, economic libertarians, home schoolers, gun   
owners, land owners, businessmen, and anti-war isolationists.   
That is, people who want to be left alone by the government.  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Ron Paul faces another hurdle in the general election. But   
if he makes it, he will once again be big government's biggest   
enemy in Washington. No wonder Republican power elites,   
especially those whose actions belie their rhetoric, are worried.

<title>National Council of Senior Citizens Feeds Mostly at Public Trough -- Heritage </title>

<CENTER><H2>NATIONAL COUNCIL OF 
SENIOR CITIZENS FEEDS 
MOSTLY AT PUBLIC TROUGH</H2>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/wittmann.htm">Marshall Wittmann</a><br>
Senior Fellow in Congressional Affairs<br>
<p>
Charles P. Griffin<br>
Deputy House Liaison</CENTER><br>
<p>
The National Council of Senior Citizens (NCSC) is an exclusive organization; that is to say, it feeds almost exclusively at the public trough.  According to its 1993 filing with the Internal Revenue Service, $72,910,930 of $75,956,825 in revenue (96 percent) for the year came from "government contributions."1<P>	The American taxpayers provide funds to the NCSC through a variety of federal programs.  Foremost among these is the Senior Community Service Employment Program operated by the Employment and Training Administration in the U.S. Department of Labor.  Between June 1993 and July 1994, NCSC received $61 million from that grant program.  Another $10 million came from the Senior Environmental Employment Program in the Environmental Protection Agency.  The SEE program provides NCSC with cash and the EPA with unofficial workers (over 55) to carry out the agency's environmental aims. These grants thus help subsidize the political advocacy activities of the National Council of Senior Citizens and prevent Congress from obtaining an accurate picture of the size of the EPA workforce and the amount of federal dollars spent on the agency's agenda.
<P>
	From July 1993 to June 1994, smaller amounts of taxpayer funds flowed to the Council from the Dislocated Worker Assistance program ($6,000) and the Section 8 Housing Rehabilitation Program that assists NCSC in operating senior citizen housing complexes.
<P>
	During the 1994 election cycle, the National Council of Senior Citizens actively endorsed candidates and contributed funds for the election of Democratic candidates for Congress.  In fact, the NCSC PAC provided at least $81,5002 to Democratic congressional candidates and $0 to Republican candidates.  Therefore, in addition to being deeply involved in campaign activity, the Council is overtly partisan.<P>	This summer, the NCSC has participated actively in the public campaign to oppose Medicare reform.  From the national 30th anniversary ceremony for Medicare in the Capitol to local congressional town meetings, the Council has been a major part of the effort to scare senior citizens into believing that their health care safety net is about to be yanked from underneath them.

<P>
	An account of a recent Rhode Island town meeting attended by Senator Claiborne Pell (D) and Representatives Jack Reed (D) and Patrick Kennedy (D) reported that many seniors in the audience "wore the blue-and-white 'Senior Power' buttons distributed by the meeting's sponsor, the National Council of Senior Citizens."  The same news article went on to state that "the council contends that the GOP proposal would cost the typical Rhode Island beneficiary about $3650 a year in additional premiums, deductibles and co-payments"3all this despite the fact that no "GOP proposal" has been introduced.<P>	Across the country, on the same day, NCSC regional director Howard Owens stated, "Can anyone believe we can take a ($270 billion) hit and maintain the quality and quantity of health care?  If so, I have a bridge I want to sell you."4  The Council also hosted events for Democratic members of Congress in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (August 18), and Waterloo, Iowa (August 24), to promote the anti-reform message.<P>	Other political activities undertaken by the NCSC include an annual congressional voting scorecard.  In 1993, one issue in this analysis was the tax increase on Social Security benefits, which was scored as a "pro-senior" vote.5  The Council also was a proponent of the Clinton Administration's big government health care plan, which failed in 1994.<P>	  It is clear that the National Council of Senior Citizens engages in substantial advocacy activitiesdespite the fact that it is 96 percent taxpayer-funded.  In essence, the NCSC functions almost as a <i>de facto</i> federal agency, but without the normal restrictions on political activity.<P><i>The Government Integrity Project examines the practice of permitting tax-exempt organizations that engage in political or legislative advocacy to receive funds from the federal government.</i>

<title>Stand for Children or Last Stand For Big Government -- Heritage</title>

<h2><i>STAND FOR CHILDREN OR LAST STAND FOR BIG GOVERNMENT?</I></h2>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
On June 1, 1996, national attention will be focused on the "Stand for Children" march on the Mall in Washington, D.C. The ostensible purpose of this march is one that all Americans would support: "to celebrate children and those who struggle every day to raise them. Organizers claim that between 200,000 and one million people will gather at the Lincoln Memorial in a non-partisan call to action. Unfortunately, however, the principal action likely to be called for is an increase in federal spending. One reason is that at least 102 of the sponsoring organizations are federal grant recipients, receiving an aggregate of over $392 million annually. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A slick public relations campaign has generated dozens of news stories hailing the Stand for Children's call to affirm our responsibility as families, individuals, communities, and as a national community for improving the quality of life of children. But the camera-ready banners and young families with children expected on the Mall are not the entire story. An examination of organizations endorsing the event makes it clear that the Stand for Children rally is not a nonpartisan, pro-children march; it might better be dubbed the "Last Stand for Big Government.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The event is being convened by the Children's Defense Fund (CDF), once chaired by no less a proponent of big government than Hillary Rodham Clinton. The president of the CDF is Marian Wright Edelman, a long-time friend of Mrs. Clinton, and chief opponent of efforts in the 104th Congress to reform welfare. In 1973, Edelman frankly admitted that because she could no longer stir up interest in government programs by speaking of poor people, she had decided to emphasize children in her rhetoric. Children, after all, might be a very effective way to broaden the base of change.<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Many other groups apparently have decided that Edelman was talking about more than just pocket change. The list of 426 organizations endorsing the Stand for Children looks like a Who's Who of federally funded organizations. Over one hundred of the endorsing groups received a total of at least $392 million in FY 1993-1994 alone. The total government subsidy to these organizations is actually higher, since this $392 million excludes grants to some affiliates as well as all funds received from state or local governments. Each of these organizations has a clear interest in assuring that it can continue to rely on money from the American taxpayer. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
One government agency, the Agriculture Department's Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service (CSREES), a $931,784,000 federal program in FY 1995, has signed on as a national endorser of the program under the guise of its outreach program, Families 4H and Nutrition. The Freddie Mac Foundation, an arm of the federally chartered Freddie Mac Corporation, also is sponsoring the march.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Lobbyists appear to be another big constituency of the Stand for Children. Lobbying arms for federal programs costing over $7 billion annually have endorsed the march. Among these are the National and Community Service Coalition (chief lobbyist for President Clinton's $400 million national service program, AmeriCorps), the National Head Start Center (lobbyist for the $2.2 billion Head Start program), and the National Association of WIC Directors (the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children, a $3.6 billion federal program in FY 1995). Families U.S.A., the key lobbyist in the effort to support Bill Clinton's government-run health care plan, is also a march endorser. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In addition to grant recipients, lobbyists, and government agencies, at least 20 national organizations comprised of government employees, such as the U.S. Conference of City Human Services Officials and the National Association of School Psychologists, will be participating in the march. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Further proof of the partisan character of the march is the fact that the AFL-CIO, which is spending $35 million in mandatory union dues to defeat conservative Members of Congress in the 1996 elections, is actively promoting it. The AFL-CIO and 33 of its affiliated unions serve as national endorsing organizations for the Stand for Children. At this past February's meeting of the AFL-CIO Executive Committee, when union leaders decided to launch their efforts to take back the Congress, two special guests were invited to speak: Steve Protulis of the National Council of Senior Citizens, fresh from the MediScare campaign on Capitol Hill, and Marian Wright Edelman, who spoke about the Stand for Children rally. The June 1 March obviously embodies the AFL-CIO's determination to defend the welfare state.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
More evidence that the Stand is another attempt to broaden the base of support for big government is the fact that at least 50 liberal and activist left organizations with no special focus on children, including Americans for Democratic Action, Women Strike for Peace, the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund, Greenpeace, the National Rainbow Coalition, and Zero Population Growth, serve as co-sponsors.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The groups behind the Stand for Children march seek to present their rally as a spontaneous, nonpartisan, grassroots expression of altruism towards America's youth. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Stand for Children rally offers a continuation of a calculated strategy launched in the early 1970s to expand the welfare state, a strategy used effectively to oppose efforts by the 104th Congress to balance the federal budget.  While many participating in the march no doubt have the best interests of children at heart, many of the sponsoring organizations have a clear self-interest in promoting government spending as the best way to Stand for Children.

<h2>
 Buchanan Knows Where the Votes Are
</h2>

<P>  
The Inside the Beltway pundits and others who think they are movers and
shakers of the establishment are wracking their brains to try to figure out
why Pat Buchanan has such an enthusiastic following. His social
conservatism is part of the reason, but there is another part they don't
understand.


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The day after the Iowa caucuses, I received a subscription appeal from the
Wall Street Journal. Let me share it with you.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"On a beautiful late spring afternoon, 25 years ago, two young men
graduated from the same college. They were very much alike, these two young
men. Both had been better than average students, both were personable, and
both were filled with ambitious dreams for the future.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Recently, these men returned to their college for their 25th reunion. They
were still very much alike. Both were happily married. Both had three
children. Both had gone to work for the same midwestern manufacturing
company after graduation, and were still there.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"But there was a difference. One of the men was manager of a small
department of that company. The other was its president.''
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The letter's sales talk conveyed the impression (although it didn't say so)
that the difference between the one man's mediocre job and the other man's
rise to the top was that he had the benefit of the information in the Wall
Street Journal.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The president of the company reads the Wall Street Journal for all the
business news he needs on technology, competition and marketing around the
world. He can track his investments on easy-to-scan market quotations.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Wall Street Journal speaks to and for those successful businessmen, and
it should. Entrepreneurs are great people; they make America prosperous by
investing their savings in plant expansion and in creating new jobs.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It may be that the guy who didn't rise any higher than middle management,
or who is a blue-collar worker, had less smarts or opportunity or energy or
perseverance, but he is an American, too, and he expected to share in the
American dream of a rising standard of living. But his real wages haven't
risen in ten years, and now he lives in fear and dread of losing his job
altogether if his manufacturing plant is relocated overseas.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There are tens of thousands more of these guys than there are of the
bosses. The Wall Street Journal doesn't speak for them, but Pat Buchanan
does.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In fact, he is the only presidential candidate of either party who speaks
for them (Bill Clinton, who never had any contact with real life in the
working world, is bragging about the rise in the stock market), and that's
why Buchanan's campaign is rising like a rocket. He is changing the
Republican Party from Wall Street to Main Street.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Before the Iowa caucuses, the other presidential candidates never appeared
to care about or want this immense constituency of working Americans.
Chanting the mantra "free trade,'' their attitude toward displaced workers
was, "Tough! That's the breaks in a free market. We live in a global
economy, and you need to look for another job.''
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The other Presidential candidates, as well as the Republican leadership in
Congress, all backed Clinton on NAFTA, GATT, the Mexican bailout, and
sending American troops to Bosnia. It is ridiculous to think that any
Republican who agrees with Bill Clinton on those gut issues about jobs and
American sovereignty can defeat him in November.<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Whoever advised the 
Republican leadership in Congress to make "a balanced
budget in seven years with CBO numbers'' and government- regulated HMOs for
Medicare the 1995-96 Republican legislative goals must have been a
double-agent for Bill Clinton. The former is unintelligible to the voters
and the latter is unacceptable to seniors, so adopting those as goals
served up an immense public relations victory to Clinton.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Wall Street Journal and conservative publications that like to give
advice to Republicans are saying that the Party must "integrate the views''
of the two blocs in the conservative movement, the social and the economic
(a.k.a. the balanced budget bloc). They have it all wrong; the balanced
budget is irrelevant at the grass roots.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To win against Clinton, the Republican candidate must get the votes of the
Reagan Democrats, those pro-life, pro-family, working-class Democrats who
voted for Reagan, whom George Bush kicked away. To win against Clinton, the
Republican candidate must get the votes of the Perot voters, the
independent voters who oppose NAFTA and GATT and favor term limits and
campaign reform.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The conservative publications that supported NAFTA, GATT, the failed
balanced-budget strategy, and Clinton-lite health care "reform,'' feel
threatened by Buchanan's success. That's why they have started a campaign
of invective and epithets on a scale unseen in American politics since the
Barry Goldwater campaign of 1964.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When Bob Dole got to New Hampshire, he ran negative TV ads attacking
Buchanan at the same time that he adopted Buchanan's winning rhetoric when
talking to the voters. Dole attacked the reduction in real average hourly
wages and tax increases on family income and said, "Corporate profits are
setting records and so are corporate layoffs.''
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Buchanan knows where the votes are. The others are just starting to find
out, but they are hopelessly compromised by their long record of supporting
Clinton's disastrous foreign and domestic policies.

INTRODUCTION<P>
      George Bush signed the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) last December 17.  If approved by Congress, this trade pact
will link the United States, Mexico, and Canada into the world's
largest free trade zone.  Bill Clinton has expressed support for the
agreement, but he faces considerable opposition in the Congress,
primarily from his own Democratic Party.  NAFTA will face an up-or-
down vote in the Congress, probably this fall, but certainly no later
than the end of this year.
<P>
      Passage of the NAFTA will be a significant foreign policy test
of the Clinton Administration.  Senator Bill Bradley, the Democrat
from New Jersey, noted last February that the pact will be "the most
important foreign policy decision that Clinton will make in his first
six months in office."  There is more at stake, however, than simply
enhanced trade with Mexico.  The NAFTA will be an important factor in
ensuring that U.S.  businesses remain internationally competitive and
that free trade continues to advance around the world. 
<P>
      Despite the agreement's acknowledged benefits to the U.S. 
economy, many groups oppose free trade in general, and freer trade
with Mexico in particular.  Among these are several labor unions,
environmental organizations, and some industries which favor
protectionism.  Believing that their interests will be harmed by freer
trade with Mexico, these groups try to portray the NAFTA as harmful to
the U.S.  economy as a whole.  They allege that the NAFTA will
increase pollution of the environment, reduce worker safety and wages
in both the U.S.  and Mexico, and cause the loss of U.S.  jobs.
<P>
      In response to these and other criticisms, Clinton has made U.S. 
approval of the NAFTA conditional on the negotiation of additional
"parallel accords" concerning labor and the environment.  Far from
being low-cost remedies to these concerns, however, these agreements
have the potential to undo much of the good created by NAFTA. 
Opponents of free trade have seized upon these parallel agreements as
vehicles by which to reintroduce the trade restrictions NAFTA is
intended to eliminate.
<P>
      The strategy of anti-NAFTA groups is to make increased trade
with Mexico appear to the American public as threatening.  Because
Americans are unlikely to be swayed by appeals for protecting such
special interests as labor unions, environmental groups, and
uncompetitive industries, opponents of NAFTA's free trade provisions
have targeted labor and environmental issues in a campaign to broaden
the appeal of their cause.
<P>
      In their attempts to discredit the NAFTA, trade protectionists
exaggerate the potential harm of the accord while rejecting many of
its benefits.  The disintegration and distortions advanced by these
groups have clouded the NAFTA debate in Congress.  As Congress begins
its consideration of the agreement in the coming months, it will
require clear and concise information on the results of approving the
NAFTA.  Only then can it put aside the pleas for protection by special
interest groups and ideological opponents of free trade and decide
whether NAFTA benefits the country as a whole.
<P>

A PRIMER ON NAFTA:  QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
<P>
      Opposition to the NAFTA focuses on its alleged negative effects
on jobs and the environment.  Labor unions worry that freer trade with
Mexico will cause the loss of jobs among their members, and lead to
relaxed worker safety laws.  Environmentalists maintain that
commercial integration between the two countries will lower U.S. 
environmental standards, prompt polluting U.S.  companies to move to
Mexico to avoid strict standards, and lead to massive pollution in
Mexico.  In addition, opponents charge that the agreement was
negotiated in secret, without input from labor, business, and
environmental groups.
<P>

THE NAFTA, JOBS, AND THE ECONOMY
<P>
      Among the most commonly expressed questions raised about the
NAFTA and its impact on North America are: 
<P>
Q:    With Mexico so much poorer than the U.S., will expanded trade
      with that country reduce the standard of living of Americans?
<P>
      The reduction of trade barriers around the world since the end
of World War II has brought about enormous increases in trade and
economic activity among the participating countries.  In constructing
this international trading system at the 1948 Bretton Woods
Conference, Democrats and Republicans understood that free trade would
benefit most working Americans.
<P>
      Despite the clear connection between free trade and general
economic prosperity, there will always be groups who believe their
individual interests to be threatened by competition from abroad.  The
traditional free trade opponents were those industries such as
shipping and textiles that profited from government subsidies and
tariffs that protected them against foreign competition.  In addition
to these protected, uncompetitive industries, the opponents of free
trade now include labor unions and organizations whose self-interest
makes them hostile to free trade and market economics in general and
whose message is that, contrary to all evidence, free trade will lead
to a reduction in living standards.
<P>
      These critics are wrong.  The NAFTA will benefit the whole U.S. 
economy.  It will lower costs for consumers on such basic products as
food, clothing, electronics, appliances, and automobiles.  Since these
products require a high labor content in their production, lowering
labor costs will lower the retail price of these goods.  Reducing the
costs of consumer goods not only dampens inflation but also improves
the standard of living of all Americans and makes businesses more
competitive.
<P>
      The NAFTA also will expand U.S.  exports to Mexico, which will
greatly benefit the American economy.  Mexico already is America's
third largest trading partner, after Japan and Canada, and is growing
rapidly.  U.S.  exports to Mexico are heavily weighted toward the
high-value, high-technology products that are the foundation of future
U.S.  growth.  Growth in exports has been one of the major factors in
U.S.  economic growth over the past decade and a source of much of the
past and future job creation.  The U.S.  Department of Commerce
estimates 19,100 U.S.  jobs are created for every $1.0 billion
increase in U.S.  merchandise exports.  The NAFTA will lower Mexico's
trade barriers even further, ensuring that U.S.  exports to that
country will continue to increase.
<P>
Q:    Since the Mexican economy is so small, how can it become a
      sizeable market for U.S.  products?
<P>
      Although the Mexican economy is small compared to that of the
U.S., total U.S.-Mexico trade in 1992 was $73 billion (compared to
U.S.-German trade with $50 billion and U.S.-China trade with $33
billion), with $40.6 billion in U.S.  exports producing a surplus of
$6.8 billion.y (Gary Clyde Hufbauer and Jeffrey J.  Schott, NAFTA:  An
Assessment (Washington, D.C.:  Institute for International Economics,
1993), p.  14.)  By comparison, the U.S.  had a trade deficit with
China of $17.1 billion.
<P>
      U.S.  merchandise exports to Mexico support 611,000 American
jobs.  The Institute for International Economics, a non-partisan
research group that studies the effects of trade on the U.S.  economy,
projects that by 1995, over 1 million U.S.  jobs will be dependent on
U.S.  exports to Mexico.  The NAFTA is expected to spur growth in the
Mexican economy from between 3.5 percent and 6 percent annually during
the next ten years.
<P>
      Because Mexico will continue to buy most of its imports from the
U.S., opportunities for U.S.  business will grow as Mexico's economy
grows.  Currently, 73 percent of Mexico's imports come from the United
States.  In contrast, Hong Kong buys only 8.1 percent of its imports
from the U.S., Japan 22.9 percent, and Germany only 7.5 percent.  Each
Mexican purchases $300 worth of products every year from the U.S.,
compared to $30 of European imports.  The NAFTA will only add to the
advantages enjoyed by U.S.  businesses in Mexico.  Because the NAFTA
will reduce tariffs and restrictions on U.S.  and Canadian imports
into Mexico, while retaining them on imports from countries outside
the free trade zone, U.S.  businesses will see their competitive
advantage enhanced by the agreement.
<P>
Q:    How can an economy as underdeveloped as Mexico's help U.S. 
      businesses become more globally competitive, especially against
      East Asia?  Will a free trade pact with Mexico slow down the
      U.S.  economy?
<P>
      Far from being a threat to U.S.  prosperity, the disparity in
wage rates with Mexico (Mexican unskilled and semi-skilled wages are
seven times lower than in the U.S.) affords an important opportunity
for U.S.  businesses to become more competitive internationally by
emulating some of the successful practices of their East Asian
competitors.  Given the relatively high U.S.  wages, U.S.  industries
cannot adequately compete with foreign companies which use cheap
unskilled labor.  Unlike the U.S., such advanced industrial countries
in Asia as Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan have adjusted to competition
from labor-intensive, unskilled manufacturers in developing countries
like Mexico and Malaysia through a scheme known as "co-production."
<P>
      The manufacturing process is split between highly skilled
workers in the advanced countries and low-skilled workers in
developing countries, such as the People's Republic of China, the
Philippines, and Singapore.  This arrangement has allowed the advanced
East Asian countries to dominate global markets and rapidly expand
their own economies by lowering labor costs in the production of
goods.  Much of these countries' often-alleged "unfair advantage"
comes from their intelligent use of these resources to adapt to the
highly competitive environment of the international market.
<P>
      The U.S.  has been less successful than Japan and Taiwan at co-
production, mainly because there have been few developing countries
close to home whose economies complemented that of the U.S.  and which
were sufficiently open to allow easy operations.  The NAFTA will help
U.S.  companies co-produce more efficiently by combining operations in
the U.S.  and Mexico.  This will occur because of the more stable
business environment the NAFTA will create for U.S.  business
operating in Mexico.
<P>
      Those who oppose expanding such operations in Mexico, saying
they "export jobs," ignore a simple fact:  U.S.  operations will move
somewhere else if Mexico is closed to them, principally to East Asia,
with far less positive results for the U.S.  economy. 
<P>
      When American companies transfer part of their operations to
Mexico, most of their work force stays in the U.S., particularly in
administration, sales, warehousing, and components manufacturing.  For
instance, Ford Motor Company operates an assembly plant in Hermosillo,
Mexico, which produces small cars and engines for the U.S.  and
Mexican markets.  Over 75 percent of the components used at that plant
are produced in the U.S.y (Paul A.  London and Jonathan Whittle,
"Investment, Trade, and U.S.  Gains in the NAFTA" (Washington, D.C.: 
U.S.  Council of the Mexico-U.S.  Business Committee, 1992), p.  24.) 
Without this plant, Ford would be forced to produce these cars in Asia
or Europe, with practically no materials or services used in their
production coming from the U.S. 
<P>
      Investment by U.S.  companies in Mexico also increases U.S. 
exports.  For example, U.S.-Mexican joint ventures on average buy 51
percent of their materials and services from the U.S.  By contrast,
when U.S.  industries locate their operations in Pacific Rim countries
or in Europe, U.S.  firms supply only an average of 13 percent of the
materials and services to those companies.
<P>
      By making Mexico a more attractive investment opportunity than
East Asia, the NAFTA will encourage U.S.  companies that have already
moved assembly plants to faraway countries like Malaysia to relocate
to Mexico.  Once in Mexico, most of these assembly plants will benefit
the U.S.  economy by buying their components from U.S.  companies
instead of from East Asian suppliers, thereby providing more jobs for
U.S.  parts manufacturers, research and development, transportation
and shipping firms, and marketing companies.
<P>
Q:    Should not the U.S.  government be protecting workers from
      losing their jobs as a result of the NAFTA?  
<P>
      Like other industrialized nations, the U.S.  is confronted with
ever-increasing global economic competition.  Since World War II, the
wages of U.S.  workers have increased dramatically compared to those
of workers in the developing world.  Given this wage disparity for
unskilled labor, the U.S.  is faced with two choices:  It can
encourage American companies to focus on higher technology production
where the U.S.  has a comparative advantage, or it can provide
government protection in the form of higher tariffs and import quotas
for industries that employ large numbers of unskilled workers.  If the
U.S.  government chooses the second alternative, it will: 
<P>
1)    raise costs to U.S.  consumers; 
<P>
2)    encourage retaliation by other countries against U.S.  exports; 
<P>
3)    increase costs for U.S.  companies that use imports in their
      manufacturingprocesses and render them less globally
      competitive; and 
<P>
4)    ensure that the protected industries become ever more
      uncompetitive. 
<P>
      The temptation to use the government to protect inefficient
industries from competition should be resisted because for every
uncompetitive sector that is protected, the economy as a whole
suffers.  Government protection of threatened industries may help
small groups of people temporarily, but the costs, ultimately born by
the American consumer and the unprotected workers, are quite large.
<P>
      During the 1980s, for example, the steel industry received
government protection from foreign competition in the form of tariffs
and import quotas, ostensibly to protect an estimated 18,000 jobs
threatened by less expensive imported steel.  This protectionism
raised the cost of domestic and imported steel.  Many U.S. 
manufacturers that used steel in their production could not buy cheap
raw steel from abroad, raising the final cost of their products. 
These U.S.  manufacturers lost sales, costing 52,400 jobs in U.S. 
steel-related industries during the 1980s.y (Arthur T.  Denzau, "Can
Trade Protectionism Save Jobs," Center for the Study of American
Business, April 1987, p.  5.)  The U.S.  International Trade
Commission estimates quotas and tariffs on textiles and steel cost
consumers an additional $168,700 in 1988 dollars for every U.S.  job
saved by the protectionist measures.y (International Trade Commission,
"Economic Effects on U.S.  Imports Restraints:  Phase 1: 
Manufacturing," Pub.  2222, October 1989, p.  8.)  According to the
U.S.  General Accounting Office, the system of "voluntary" quotas the
U.S.  imposes on the Japanese automobiles costs American consumers
over $190,000 for every U.S.  job saved.  Clearly, the costs of
protectionism to the economy as a whole far outweigh any benefits to
individuals. 
<P>
      In contrast, the NAFTA, by facilitating co-production, will help
U.S.  companies to remain competitive in what they do best:  producing
high-technology goods and services for export and domestic use.  With
a more stable business environment in Mexico, U.S.  companies can have
many of their products assembled in Mexico for export abroad.  Those
who would erect artificial barriers in an attempt to protect
uncompetitive industries in the U.S.  would succeed only in reducing
the prospects for economic growth for everyone.
<P>
Q:    Will there be a massive loss of jobs as U.S.  companies move
      south in search of cheaper labor?
<P>
      During the presidential campaign, Ross Perot referred to a
"great sucking sound" being made as companies were pulled into Mexico,
attracted by cheaper labor.y (The Wall Street Journal, January 15,
1993, p.  A16.)  Nevertheless, in spite of dire warnings by Perot and
other opponents of the NAFTA, virtually all economists agree the NAFTA
will produce a net increase of U.S.  jobs over the next decade.y (For
the most recent study on job growth under the NAFTA, see Hufbauer and
Schott, op.  cit.)  By increasing opportunities for exports to Mexico,
the NAFTA will generate jobs throughout the entire economy.  And, as
more U.S.  companies engage in co-production, more U.S.  jobs will be
created as the American companies become more competitive in the
international market. 
<P>
      To be sure, some U.S.  companies will move a portion of labor-
intensive operations like the assembly of components to Mexico to take
advantage of the unskilled and semi-skilled labor.  The labor needed
to manufacture textiles, shoes, some glassware, and other labor-
intensive industries is too expensive in the U.S.  for them to remain
competitive.  But for most U.S.  industries, especially those upon
which the future growth and competitiveness of the U.S.  economy rest,
and which require highly skilled and trained workers, Mexican labor
will hold few attractions.
<P>
Q:    Will Mexico's lower labor costs depress wages in the United
      States?  
<P>
      If the NAFTA is approved, Mexico's economic modernization will
accelerate.  Since approximately 80 percent of all the capital
equipment Mexico buys is made in the U.S., U.S.  export industries are
likely to expand production and hire more U.S.  workers.  These
companies will not be tempted to relocate to Mexico because that
country's work force and infrastructure are not capable of supporting
high-technology production.  As Mexico grows, the demand for skilled
manufacturing in the U.S.  will grow, placing upward pressure on U.S. 
wages.
<P>
      Mexico is one of the fastest growing markets for U.S.  goods. 
The NAFTA will increase that market by forcing Mexico to lower trade
barriers that are on average 2.5 times higher than those in the U.S. 
The reduction in barriers by Mexico over the last several years has
resulted in a $6.8 billion trade surplus for the U.S.  in 1992.  That
surplus is projected to continue for the next fifteen to twenty years
as Mexico requires capital equipment to modernize, which will create
U.S.  jobs in export industries.
<P>
      President Clinton promised repeatedly in his campaign to expand
high-wage jobs for U.S.  workers.  Without a NAFTA, those high-wage
jobs will be more difficult to create because U.S.  businesses will
not be able to export to Mexico as easily as before.  Neither will
they be able to increase their efficiency through co-production
schemes in Mexico.  Japan's business sector not only has maintained
its generous wage levels but actually increased them through its high-
technology exports and its relocation of low-technology, low-paying
manufacturing jobs to developing countries like Malaysia and
Singapore.  This strategy has allowed Japanese companies to stay
competitive and reinvest in research and development and high-
technology production at home.
<P>
      Trade between the U.S.  and Mexico, up 200 percent since 1987,
will increase even more under the NAFTA, providing more U.S.  jobs in
such businesses as shipping, trucking, warehousing, and retailing that
will service the growing commercial base.  Increased sales to Mexico,
in turn, will cause U.S.  wages to rise. 
<P>
      For instance, the advanced countries of the European Economic
Community did not experience lower wages when the far less developed
economies of Greece, Portugal, and Spain joined the Community.y
(Michael Porter, The Competitive Advantage of Nations (New York:  The
Free Press, 1990), p.  50.)  Japan's co-production with Malaysia and
Singapore has not slowed the rapidly increasing prosperity of Japanese
workers.
<P>
      Opponents of free trade view international commerce as a fixed
economic pie:  job growth in manufacturing industries in country A
must mean job losses in manufacturing industries in country B. 
Opponents also believe that less expensive labor in one country will
depress wages in a country with more expensive labor, if they are
allowed to trade freely. 
<P>
      These views are mistaken.  Market economies are far more
sophisticated and dynamic than free trade opponents seem to realize. 
Jobs are created when economic activity increases and are lost when it
shrinks; wages respond to the demand for labor.  No modern economy is
static; only by adapting to changing conditions and making use of
opportunities can economies avoid stagnation.  Therefore, the NAFTA
will not only stimulate business activity across the U.S.  economy,
but also offer new business opportunities that will create jobs. 
Economic growth in Mexico will create jobs in export industries in the
U.S.
<P>
Q:    Will the abundant, unskilled labor in Mexico hurt unskilled,
      poorer workers in the U.S.?  
<P>
      In some cases, industries such as apparel and shoe manufacturing
that use high-cost, unskilled or semi-skilled labor will relocate
their assembly operations to Mexico.  However, most unskilled U.S. 
workers are located in the services sector; it employs 80 million
Americans, compared to 19 million in manufacturing.  The poorest
American workers are concentrated in service industries like
restaurants and retail stores.  These industries will not be
threatened by lower Mexican wages.  In fact, since low-wage Mexican
workers will tend to produce cheaper agricultural and consumer goods,
the services industries in the U.S.  that sell these goods will
benefit.
<P>
      In addition, the NAFTA will help reduce competition for
unskilled jobs by illegal immigrants.  Economic growth in Mexico will
remove much of the economic incentive for Mexicans to migrate to the
U.S.  in search of employment.  An estimated 2.5 million to 4 million
illegal immigrants from Mexico now work in the U.S.,y (Telephone
interview with Bureau of Labor Statistics, March 9, 1993.) almost
exclusively in the service sector in areas such as construction, food
services, and agriculture.
<P>
Q:    Why do labor unions oppose the NAFTA so adamantly?
<P>
      United Auto Workers Union President Owen Beiber expressed the
general sentiment of other labor unions about the NAFTA when he said
it was time to "stop tinkering with the damn thing and just say no." 
The Executive Council of the AFL-CIO issued a statement on February 17
calling for rejection of the NAFTA, saying it "would be a disaster for
millions of working people in the United States."y (Statement by the
AFL-CIO Executive Council on The North American Free Trade Agreement,
Bal Harbour, Florida, February 17, 1993.) 
<P>
      Although most labor unions resoundingly oppose the NAFTA, most
union workers stand to benefit from the agreement.  For example, while
the International Trade Commission estimates a 5 percent decrease in
automobile manufacturing in the next ten to fifteen years under the
NAFTA, the same study estimates a growth of 6 percent to 15 percent in
automotive parts exports during that period.y (International Trade
Commission, "Potential Impact on the U.S.  Economy and Selected
Industries of the North American Free Trade Agreement," Report to the
Committee on Ways and Means of the United States House of
Representative and the Committee on Finance of the United States
Senate, U.S.I.T.C Publication 2596, January 1993, p.  2-8.)
<P>
      Certain apparel industries may move south, but the textile
industry is projected to increase exports by 13 percent under NAFTA. 
Unions in the service sector, such as the Teamsters, will benefit from
the agreement because of increases in cross-border trucking and
warehousing.  Even in the areas that will experience job loss, the
loss is minor, such as 6 percent to 15 percent loss in flat glass and
major household appliance manufacturing, and less than 5 percent over
the long term in the U.S.  automotive industry.y (Ibid.)   
<P>
      Most surprising is labor union opposition to an agreement that
will spur growth in export industries where most high-wage jobs are
located.  The International Trade Commission estimates that workers in
export manufacturing industries earn wages 17 percent higher than
workers in non-export related manufacturing.  Estimates are the U.S. 
will have a $7 billion to $9 billion trade surplus with Mexico by
1995.  That means an estimated 200,000 to 350,000 additional jobs in
U.S.  export industries.y ("Guide to the North American Free Trade
Agreement:  What It Means for U.S.  Business," U.S.  Chamber of
Commerce, International Division, 1992, p.  25.)
<P>
      Of larger concern to the unions should be U.S.  economic
competitiveness.  Union jobs in uncompetitive industries cannot long
survive without government assistance, which eventually dooms an
industry to hopeless inefficiency.  Job security, as well as standards
of living, rest directly upon finding ways of enhancing the
competitiveness of U.S.  business.  Without a NAFTA, however, U.S. 
industries will have difficulty co-producing like the Japanese and
Europeans.  This could lead to much larger losses of jobs in the
medium to long term, as foreign businesses gain a larger share of the
U.S.  market at the expense of inefficient U.S.  producers. 
Industries will also have a harder time exporting to countries like
Mexico if those countries maintain high trade barriers.
<P>
Q:    Will NAFTA expand maquiladora industries, causing greater loss
      of U.S.  jobs?
<P>
      U.S.  companies have been operating assembly co-production or
maquiladora -- plants along the U.S.-Mexico border since 1965.  Under
the maquiladora program, components made in the U.S.  are sent to
Mexico for assembly, utilizing Mexico's less expensive labor.  The
finished products are then sent back to the U.S.  or exported abroad. 
Despite frequent charges that the maquiladora program has hurt the
U.S.  economy, it has not caused a net loss of U.S.  jobs.  To the
contrary, by reducing labor costs, this program has allowed
manufacturers to remain globally competitive and keep their U.S. 
plants operating.
<P>
      During the early 1970s, U.S.  corporations faced stiff
competition from foreign companies exporting cheaper goods to the U.S. 
With the U.S.  paying relatively high wages for unskilled labor, U.S. 
companies that used high percentages of unskilled labor in their
production processes found it hard to compete against these foreign
providers.  To stay in business U.S.  companies were forced to move
the labor-intensive part of their production to countries where labor
was less expensive.  Most of this co-production in Mexico takes place
in the maquiladora program.
<P>
      Co-production with Mexico has helped many U.S.  companies face
international competition and increase exports.  For instance, the
Mexico-based Trasgo Group is working with U.S.-based Tyson Foods
Company in the growing and packaging of poultry products, 50 percent
of which is being sold in Japan.  General Motors' Packard Electric
Division assembles sophisticated components that are produced in its
Ohio and Mississippi plants and assembled in plants throughout Mexico. 
The Company has remained internationally competitive only by lowering
labor costs on the unskilled portion of its manufacturing.  AT&T has
several facilities in Mexico for manufacturing and phone equipment
repair.  AT&T plans to shift its Asian supply base to Mexico,
providing components manufacturing jobs in the U.S.  Moving facilities
to Mexico will help AT&T produce for the U.S./Mexico market and
beyond.y (London and Whittle, op.  cit., p.  24.)
<P>
      The NAFTA will eliminate maquiladora rules that prevent U.S. 
companies from selling in Mexico the products they assemble there. 
Formerly, maquiladoras could sell only 20 percent of their products in
Mexico.y (U.S.  Department of Labor, "Economic Discussion Paper #29,"
August 1988, p.  17.)  Under the NAFTA, U.S.  companies with
maquiladoras can sell 100 percent of their products in the Mexican
market. 
<P>
Q:    Will NAFTA make it easier for Mexico to flood the U.S.  with
      goods? 
<P>
      NAFTA opponents paint a grim picture of truckloads of cheap
Mexican products heading north, flooding U.S.  markets and putting
U.S.  producers of similar goods out of work.  Freer trade with Mexico
in the past four years, however, has demonstrated the reverse to be
true.  As barriers to trade have been removed, the U.S.  has exported
more to Mexico than it imported.  Under the NAFTA, these barriers will
fall even farther and U.S.  exports will continue to grow.  Because
Mexican tariffs to U.S.  goods are 2.5 times greater than U.S. 
tariffs on Mexican goods, U.S.  exporters will benefit from trade more
than their Mexican counterparts.  The majority of U.S.  exports to
Mexico are in automotive parts, telecommunications equipment,
electronic components, processed foods, and basic grains, which
currently are subjected to Mexican import quotas and tariffs that
raise the costs of these goods from 10 percent to 20 percent.
<P>
      Currently, only 17.9 percent of U.S.  goods enter Mexico without
tariffs.  Once NAFTA becomes law, half of U.S.  exports will enter
Mexico duty-free.  After five years, under the NAFTA, 67 percent of
U.S.  exports will be duty-free.  That percentage rises to 80 after
ten years.y (International Trade Commission, "Potential Impact," p. 
104.)  The apocalyptic scenarios by opponents seem especially
exaggerated because the U.S.  has had trade surpluses with Mexico for
the past three years.  Those surpluses are widely projected to
continue as Mexico imports U.S.  capital equipment needed to modernize
its economy.  Although Mexico has in the past attempted to restrict
such imports, it will be forbidden to do so under the NAFTA. 
<P>
      The NAFTA also removes non-tariff barriers to U.S.  exports. 
For instance, today U.S.  auto makers need import licenses to sell
U.S.-produced cars in Mexico.  U.S.  auto makers with auto assembly
plants in Mexico have also been under restrictions, known as export
quotas, that require U.S.  automobile companies with plants in Mexico
to export $2 of automotive products for every $1 of U.S.  automotive
products imported into Mexico.y (Hufbauer and Schott, op.  cit., p. 
39.)  These restrictions are also eliminated under the NAFTA, giving
U.S.  auto makers greater flexibility to export to Mexico from U.S. 
plants.
<P>
Q:    Will freer trade with Mexico benefit only the Southeastern
      states while hurting the industrial states of the Northeast and
      Midwest?
<P>
      Almost all fifty states have substantially increased their
exports to Mexico in the last five years as Mexican barriers to trade
have dropped.  In Arkansas, exports to Mexico grew 154 percent from
1987 to 1991.  In Michigan 31,000 jobs depend on exports to Mexico;
from 1987 to 1991 exports to Mexico rose 51 percent.y (U.S.  Exports
to Mexico:  A State-by-State Overview 1987-1991 (U.S.  Department of
Commerce, International Trade Administration, July 1992), p.  32.) 
Surprisingly, many Members of Congress who oppose the NAFTA, such as
Congressman Donald Pease of Ohio, and Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell of Maine, come from states which have experienced net gains
in employment because of growing U.S.  exports to Mexico.  For
example, Ohio Senator Howard Metzenbaum is opposed to the NAFTA; but
between 1987 and 1991 his state's exports to Mexico increased 137
percent to $582 million.  Over the same period, New York's exports to
Mexico increased 73 percent, providing new jobs for thousands of
workers.  Mexico represents the third largest export market for
Illinois, Michigan, New York, and Pennsylvania, and the second largest
market for Maine, New Hampshire, and Ohio.  Mexico is the largest
export market for California and Texas.  Pennsylvania Senator Harris
Wofford's election platform included an anti-NAFTA stance; yet
Pennsylvania's exports to Mexico have climbed 283 percent since 1987
to $694 million in 1991, creating approximately 9,000 additional jobs
for Pennsylvania workers.y (For a more comprehensive state-by-state
analysis on exports to Mexico, see ibid.)
<P>
PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT UNDER THE NAFTA
<P>
Q:    Will American companies move to Mexico to avoid strict
      environmental laws in the U.S.?
<P>
      Almost all environmental and labor groups argue that lax
environmental enforcement and lower standards in Mexico give an unfair
advantage to companies based there.  Lower standards, they say, will
encourage U.S.  companies to reduce environmental compliance costs by
moving their factories to Mexico.
<P>
      Such criticism, however, overlooks a number of facts. 
<P>
1)    Mexico's environmental laws and regulations are roughly equal to
      those in the U.S.  In fact, the Mexican environmental agency,
      Secretaria del Desarrollo Urbano y Ecologia (SEDUE), is adopting
      Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards wholesale; 
<P>
2)    Most multinational companies already follow U.S.  environmental
      standards when operating in Mexico; and 
<P>
3)    For most industries, the difference in environmental compliance
      costs between Mexico and the U.S.  is not substantial.
<P>
      For example, Mexican laws regulating the transportation of
cross-border toxic waste are equivalent to those in the U.S.  Mexican
regulations require any U.S.  company locating within 62 miles (100
kilometers) of the U.S.-Mexico border to comply with all EPA standards
on the disposal of toxic wastes.  Under new Mexican environmental
laws, any U.S.  company using toxic materials in Mexican plants must
dispose of these materials and their waste by-products by shipping
them back to the U.S.
<P>
      SEDUE's civil penalties for violations include plant closure, up
to $80,000 in fines for first-time violators, and administrative
arrest of company officials for up to 36 hours; criminal penalties
include up to six years in prison.  Mexican environmental regulators
also have policing powers that their U.S.  counterparts regulators do
not.  Although enforcement of Mexico's environmental laws has not been
perfect, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has shown a strong
commitment to environmental protection since taking office. 
Government expenditures for environmental enforcement have increased
1,800 percent to $1.8 billion in 1991. 
<P>
      In some specific cases, U.S.  companies have relocated to Mexico
for environmental reasons.  However, this has usually been in response
to draconian environmental regulations on air emissions in U.S. 
cities rather than lax standards in Mexico.  For instance, several
furniture makers based in the Los Angeles area basin moved their
facilities to Tijuana, Mexico, when new rules by the state and local
governments placed extremely low limits on the use of solvent-based
paint and stain emissions.  Although many of those companies moved to
Tijuana, some relocated to neighboring states like Arizona and Nevada. 
According to a study by the U.S.  Trade Representative's Inter-Agency
Task Force, this relocation was not part of a general flight of U.S. 
industry to Mexico to avoid general environmental standards.y ("Review
of U.S.-Mexico Environmental Issues," Prepared by an Inter-Agency Task
Force Coordinated by the Office of the United States Trade
Representative, Draft, October 1991, p.  194.  (The Trade Policy Staff
of the Inter-Agency Task Force, during six public hearings held from
August 20 to September 11, 1991, gathered data on the alleged movement
of U.S.  companies to Mexico for environmental reasons.  They found
these allegations to be untrue, except in the specific case of
furniture refinishing companies relocating from Los Angeles to Mexico
and other U.S.  states.))
<P>
      Most U.S.  companies have little incentive to move south to
avoid strict U.S.  environmental standards because Mexico operates by
those same standards.  According to this Task Force study, "U.S. 
firms, particularly the larger multinational firms most likely to
undertake large process industry investments [in Mexico], often hold
subsidiaries to a worldwide standard, usually at least as high as
standards with which they must comply in the U.S."y (Ibid., p.  195.) 
An example is Ford Motor Company, which has a policy of applying U.S. 
environmental practices in its automotive manufacturing plants in
Mexico.
<P>
Q:    Will economic growth in Mexico lead to more environmental
      degradation in that country, and North America generally?
<P>
      Some environmental groups oppose the NAFTA because it will
promote economic growth in Mexico.  These critics are against economic
development because of the increase of pollution that development
brings.  Thus, they believe the best way of improving the environment
is to prevent economic growth from taking place. 
<P>
      Environmental critics of the NAFTA misunderstand the
relationship between economic development and a clean environment. 
Without economic growth, Mexico can never adequately address its
environmental problems.  As countries become wealthier, the priorities
of their people change from subsistence living to such quality of life
concerns as environmental protection.  That is why every
industrialized country spends a far greater percentage of its GDP on
environmental protection than any underdeveloped country.  When the
choice is between jobs and stricter environmental standards, poorer
countries choose jobs.
<P>
      When Mexican companies were heavily debt-ridden and on the verge
of bankruptcy during the 1980s, it was difficult for the government to
force compliance with environmental regulations.  The reason:  the
government feared throwing people out of work by closing polluting
factories.  Only with economic growth does sustained environmental
improvement become possible.
<P>
      Of 42 countries analyzed in a recent Princeton University study,
pollution levels began to decrease in those with per capita GDP rising
above $4,000 to $5,000.  Mexico, with a current per capita GDP of
$3,700, already is beginning to devote larger resources toward
environmental purposes.  Example:  a 200 percent increase in
environmental inspectors since 1989.  This process will continue as
the economy grows.  Unfortunately, Mexico's growth would be stalled
without the NAFTA, postponing future environmental protection.
<P>
Q:    Is extensive government regulation necessary to protect the
      North American environment?  
<P>
      Economic growth is not inherently harmful to the environment;
pervasive government intervention in industry and commerce is. 
Surprisingly, some U.S.  labor and environmental groups are promoting
traditional protectionism as the best way to avert further
environmental degradation in Mexico.  For instance, labor groups are
advocating placing tariffs on goods produced in Mexican factories that
have lower environmental standards than those in the U.S.
<P>
      Mexico, like many socialist countries in Eastern Europe, has
learned that planned economies and authoritarian governments have
created far more seriously degraded environments than their free
market, democratic counterparts.  For most of the period since the
1930s, Mexico has been ruled by an authoritarian, quasi-socialist
government.  The economy was subjected to central planning and
control, and the Mexican government protected domestic industries
through high import tariffs, quotas, and licensing.  The government
also created an enormously burdensome system of rules and regulations
to shield workers from exploitation, control production, and direct
resources to government priorities.
<P>
      The result of this legacy was not only economic ruin but
environmental degradation.  Protectionism and overregulation made
domestic industries inefficient and wasteful, impoverished the country
as a whole, and discouraged private investment.  Without new capital,
antiquated polluting factories could not be replaced with more modern,
cleaner ones.  Nationalized or heavily regulated industries also had
little reason to obey existing environmental laws, since the
government was loath to punish its own companies or companies it so
closely directed.
<P>
      Inefficient production eventually led to excessive pollution in
Mexico.  For example, 76 percent of the air pollution in Mexico City
comes from automobiles using low-grade leaded gasoline refined by the
inefficiently run, government-owned oil monopoly PEMEX.  Most of the
remaining 24 percent of the air pollution in Mexico City comes from
factories, two-thirds of which were controlled or owned by the
government before privatization began five years ago.
<P>
      Now environmentalists and labor unions wish to create a complex
set of regulations as part of the NAFTA.  They argue that only the
government has the detached interest and expertise needed to set
priorities, direct private funds, and mandate industry practices and
procedures in order to protect the environment.  There is no evidence,
however, that new central planning of North America's production and
commerce will protect the environment.  In fact, the U.S.  government
has a lackluster record of protecting the environment through complex
regulations.  For example, the environmental Superfund, designed to
assist in toxic waste cleanups has produced steady employment for
lawyers, accountants, and consultants, while failing to adequately
address environmental cleanup.  Additional government intervention is
most likely to lead to further wasteful spending without a
commensurate improvement in the environment. 
<P>
Q:    Will the maquiladora industry simply expand under the NAFTA,
      causing more pollution along the U.S.-Mexico border?
<P>
      Some environmentalists charge that the maquiladora industry has
ruined the environment along the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexican border.  They
argue that NAFTA would spread this problem throughout Mexico by
encouraging maquiladora-type operations throughout the entire country.
<P>
      There are two main environmental problems plaguing the border
region:  a lack of sewage systems and other infrastructure to service
the population, and facilities and resources to dispose of and clean
up contaminants dumped into the environment by industry.  Both of
these problems result from the tax codes under which the maquiladora
program operates, not the development resulting from the maquiladora
program.
<P>
      For example, under existing laws, local authorities have little
power to tax industry involved in maquiladora operations.  American
companies can locate in a Mexican state along the border, but are
required to pay taxes only in the U.S.  state where the company is
incorporated.  This has effectively impoverished the Mexican side of
the border region, denying it essential tax revenues from its major
industry with which to build infrastructure, monitor compliance of
environmental regulations, and dispose of industrial waste.
<P>
      Under the NAFTA, however, the preferences that maquiladora
industries in the border region now enjoy relative to other areas in
Mexico will be eliminated.  The Mexican federal system and the states
in the U.S.  will be able to set their own taxes.  This will provide
municipalities and regional governments with the funds to build the
sewage systems, waste dumps, and water purification systems they need.

<P>
RULE OF LAW, SOVEREIGNTY, AND PARTICIPATION UNDER THE AGREEMENT
<P>

Q:    Will cross-border commercial disputes under the NAFTA be decided
      in a way that infringes on U.S.  sovereignty?  
<P>
      Liberal and conservative critics of the NAFTA charge that the
agreement infringes on national sovereignty and limits local power to
control laws, enforce environmental standards, and uphold health and
safety regulations.  For instance, Ralph Nader's Public Citizen group
alleges that the NAFTA will prevent local governments from setting
limits on pesticide use or regulations on how milk is processed.
<P>
      However, NAFTA dispute mechanisms will give U.S.  citizens and
businesses more direct participation in resolving commercial,
environmental, and investment disputes between the three countries, by
allowing them their day in court.
<P>
      The NAFTA rules for settling commercial disputes arising under
the agreement are similar to those of the U.S.-Canada Free Trade
Agreement (FTA) of 1988.  Under the FTA, regular cross-border
commercial disputes are settled by either country's domestic courts. 
The free trade agreement with Canada does not limit domestic control
over these types of commercial disputes.  The same is true of the
NAFTA.  Under the NAFTA, traditional commercial disputes will be
handled by the courts that would naturally have jurisdiction in such
cases -- depending on the type of commercial activity and the
jurisdiction the parties had agreed to in advance.
<P>
      The U.S.-Canada agreement mandates the creation of expert panels
to determine whether a government's laws, regulations, and policies
violate its rules.  These panels are made up of experts appointed by
each country.  The NAFTA also requires the creation of similar panels
to decide NAFTA-related disputes.  However, as with the FTA, the NAFTA
panels do not have the power to force a country to abide by its
decisions.  For instance, in the case of countervailing duty and anti-
dumping disputes, a party can challenge a panel decision by requesting
a special review panel.  If the party's government objects to the
finding of the review panel, it can suspend the binational panel
system entirely.  Despite this lack of enforcement power, these panels
have worked smoothly and effectively to resolve trade disputes.
<P>
      State, local, and national governments are free to set higher
environmental, health, and safety standards of their own under the
NAFTA.  Such standards can only be challenged through NAFTA panels if
they are based on political rather than scientific considerations or
discriminate against imports.  Thus, the power to enforce U.S.  laws,
regulations, and standards through domestic courts ultimately remains
in the hands of domestic national, state, and local governments. 
<P>
      The dispute panels, in turn, will help U.S.  companies seek
redress for violations of the law in Mexico and Canada that
traditionally have been difficult to obtain.  For instance, conflicts
arising over lax enforcement in protecting such intellectual property
as patents will be decided by panels created under the NAFTA.  This
will help U.S.  companies recoup the approximately $900 million they
lose annually because of non-existent or lax enforcement of
intellectual property rights in Canada and Mexico.y (Exact figures on
past losses are unavailable.  However, the International Trade
Commission estimates that in 1986 U.S.  companies lost $533 million to
Mexico and $367 million in Canada due to non-enforcement of
intellectual property rights.)
<P>
Q:    Will citizens be prohibited from participating in the judicial
      process in disputes that arise under the NAFTA?
<P>
      Ideological opponents of the NAFTA, such as the Alliance for
Responsible Trade and the Citizen Trade Campaign, have called the
dispute resolution mechanisms in the NAFTA undemocratic and secretive
because these allegedly do not provide the "broadest possible
participation by workers, consumers, environmentalists, and human
rights organizations."y (Letter to Members of Congress from the
Alliance For Responsible Trade/Citizen Trade Campaign, December 15,
1992.)
<P>
      However, NAFTA commissions and panels review only disputes
arising out of interpretations of the agreement itself.  NAFTA
commissions will not review regular commercial disputes between
companies.  The vast majority of commercial disputes will be decided
by the domestic courts of the country which have jurisdiction over the
dispute.  The NAFTA will not change the long-standing tradition of
commercial law.  Both legal systems (America's common law and Mexico's
civil or code-based law) allow only those parties whose involvement
gave rise to the dispute to be directly involved in the judicial
process.  If numerous parties, each with separate grievances, were
allowed to participate in the same judicial proceeding, the government
could not narrow the issues being adjudicated or ever come to a final
decision based in law.  Since the NAFTA dispute panels will have the
right to assess penalties against a company, the issues in a dispute
need to be narrowly defined by law.  So, too, should the parties that
can participate in the dispute.     
<P>
      Balancing the grievances of numerous groups is a challenge more
appropriately addressed by legislatures, not courts.  To allow an
open-ended participation "for cases involving challenges to social
legislation"y (Ibid.) would turn the judicial process into a purely
political one.  Although parties not directly involved in a judicial
proceeding may be harmed by a court's decision, using the judicial
process to address their grievances would weaken the rule of law in
commercial disputes, and make a mockery of stable commercial
transactions.  This, in turn, would reduce commercial activity between
the two countries. 
<P>
Q:    Was the NAFTA negotiated hastily, in secret, with little or
      noparticipation by citizens groups, unions, or Congress?
<P>
      The NAFTA was negotiated by the Bush Administration under "fast
track" authority given it by Congress.  In giving the President fast
track authority, Congress agrees in advance to either approve or
reject the negotiated agreement as a whole, without amendments.  Fast
track negotiating procedures, authorized in the 1974 Trade Act, have
given several Presidents the power to conclude trade agreements that
would not later be unravelled by the Congress.
<P>
      Some special interest groups, however, oppose fast track
authority because it limits their ability to influence Congress. 
Thus, apparel and shoe manufacturers, and many unions which seek
protection from foreign competition, argue that the NAFTA was
negotiated in secret with little participation by groups affected by
the accord.
<P>
      In fact, fast track procedures required the Administration to
work closely with Congress, labor, business, and environmental groups
during the course of the negotiations.  Months before formal
negotiations began between the U.S.  and Mexico in July 1991, Congress
held a series of hearings on the NAFTA where all issues were presented
by groups opposing and supporting the agreement.  Congressional
opponents of the agreement like Congressman Richard Gephardt, the
Democrat from Missouri, made their preferences known to the
Administration at that time. 
<P>
      Fast track procedures do not produce secret negotiations. 
Because they are rules that Congress has imposed on itself, fast track
procedures do not limit congressional power to control trade issues,
and can be overridden at any time.  These procedures simply limit the
ability of special interest groups with well-financed lobbying efforts
to undermine an agreement that would be acceptable to Congress as a
whole.
<P>
Q:    Should the agreement be renegotiated since a new President will
      have to implement the agreement?
<P>
      Now that the White House is occupied by a new President, NAFTA
opponents are portraying the agreement as a Republican accord that
must be renegotiated to accommodate the new policies of Bill Clinton. 
However, free trade in general and the NAFTA in particular are not
partisan issues.  The NAFTA was not planned, debated, or negotiated
along partisan lines.  Some of the strongest NAFTA supporters, such as
former Texas Senator and now Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and New
Mexico Congressman Bill Richardson, are Democrats.  In addition,
President Clinton himself has long supported the agreement.  The U.S. 
needs to demonstrate continuity and reliability in its dealings with
foreign countries on trade issues if its interests are to be
effectively advanced.
<P>
Q:    Should NAFTA incorporate a "social charter" similar to the model
      the European Community has adopted?
<P>
      Some groups opposing free trade are demanding that the Clinton
Administration adopt a European-style social charter through the
parallel negotiations on labor and environmental issues.  A NAFTA that
heavily regulates labor and environmental issues would be an albatross
for U.S.  competitiveness and significantly reduce the level of
potential exports to Mexico from small and medium-sized U.S. 
businesses.  A regulated commercial accord, modeled after Europe's
Social Charter, would also set a bad precedent for future regional
accords and multilateral trade agreements like the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), leading to an overall reduction in global
trade. 
<P>
      Including non-commercial issues into a trade accord provides
protectionists and others who oppose free trade in principle with
endless excuses to raise trade barriers.  Labor relations,
environmental protection, and political reform are far more
complicated for governments to manage than traditional commercial
activities.  The result is usually a trade arrangement that increases
government intervention, regulation, and bureaucracy and decreases the
amount of trade the agreement was intended to encourage.
<P>
      The example of the European Community is instructive.  Although
the European Community set out to create a single market by removing
barriers to trade, the economic benefits of this opening have been
more than offset by the imposition of a heavy regulatory burden in a
wide-ranging social charter that mandates costly standards for labor,
wages, and the environment.  A vast and unelected bureaucracy has
arisen to administer these regulations, armed with extensive
regulatory and enforcement powers.
<P>
      Groups calling for a social charter speak of the virtues of
global environmentalism and worker safety.  Creating enforcement
commissions, citizen's courts, and sanctions for divergent
environmental and labor standards -- the wish list of groups seeking a
social charter -- may appear to be cost-free.  Unfortunately, an
environmental and social charter imposed on North American commerce
will take on a regulatory life of its own, forcing U.S.  business to
waste time and money dealing with expanding regulatory bureaucracies
-- money which would be better spent on investment.  Companies with
little political clout and few Washington lobbyists, especially small
and medium-sized businesses, would be the principal victims.
<P>
      Recent federal overregulation of U.S.  small and medium-sized
businesses provides an illustrative example.  Between 1989 and 1992,
increased environmental, labor, and health regulations imposed by
Congress cost U.S.  business an additional $130 billion.  Small
businesses were hit with a 34 percent increase in government
regulations that significantly slowed job growth in the small business
sector after 1990.  The Congressional Joint Economic Committee called
this federal regulatory intrusiveness "economic crib death." 
Increasing these burdens on U.S.  exporters by imposition of an
ambitious social charter would only further damage U.S. 
competitiveness.
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
      The U.S.  and Mexico have had a long and often difficult history
as neighbors.  For the last 150 years, cooperation between the two
countries has been more the exception than the rule.  Today, however,
America and Mexico are entering a new era, one characterized by
increasing cooperation.  By removing the barriers to trade and
investment that limit the growth of both countries, NAFTA will
contribute not only to a cementing of good bilateral relations, but
also to expanding economic opportunity throughout North America.
<P>
      Fortunately, Mexico's modernization coincides with America's
need to remain internationally competitive as it enters the 21st
century.  The world's largest exporter, the U.S.  will rely
increasingly upon international trade for its prosperity, which will
require reducing barriers to trade world-wide.  By creating a free
trade area in North America, the NAFTA will help American industry
grow at home and remain competitive abroad, while also giving a major
boost to global free trade.
<P>
      Despite the fact that all objective studies of the effects of
the NAFTA clearly indicate that it will benefit all three countries,
there is significant political opposition to the agreement in the U.S. 
Although many of the concerns raised are real, much of the opposition
is based upon a desire to protect the special interests of politically
powerful constituencies who are opposed to free trade.
<P>
      There are indeed many problems in both Mexico and the U.S.  that
the agreement does not solve, such as environmental pollution.  But
the best method of addressing these is not through the creation of yet
another regulatory bureaucracy that will inevitably limit economic
growth, but through the increased prosperity that free trade will
bring.
<P>
      While not perfect, the NAFTA is a major step forward from the
existing relationship between Mexico and the U.S.  A rejection of the
NAFTA, or a renegotiation of it to produce more governmental control
of trade, would do little to protect U.S.  jobs or promote
environmental protection.  In fact, a managed North American free
trade zone could be worse than the existing trading system with
Mexico.  It would raise the costs for small and medium-size U.S. 
businesses and limit private resources available for environmental
protection.  Under a managed trade system, power would flow to the
numerous government bureaucrats and industry lawyers that would result
from increases in regulations in order to "manage" trade.
<P>
      The NAFTA is a culmination of two years of close cooperation
between the U.S., Mexican and Canadian governments.  The NAFTA
represents decades of increased trade among the three countries.  Its
creation will put the U.S.  firmly on a more competitive footing with
other industrialized nations into the 21st century.  This will be good
for U.S.  businesses and U.S.  workers alike.

<h2>
Look Out For Union Politicking In Congressional Campaigns
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Phyllis Schlafly 
</a>

<P>  
The theater of the presidential primaries is tending to obscure the fact 
that the fight is already on in earnest for control of the next Congress. 
The victory of a liberal Democrat for U.S. Senator from Oregon to fill the 
seat vacated by Bob Packwood may prove anew the truth of the old adage that 
&quot;Coming events cast their shadows before them.&quot; 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The political director of the AFL-CIO bragged that his union had sent 37 
full-time campaign workers to Oregon to work for Democrat Ron Wyden and to 
attack the Republican on key issues such as Medicare. The union made more 
than 230,000 phone calls and sent out more than 350,000 pieces of mail on 
behalf of the Democratic candidate. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It wasn't just the AFL-CIO. At least eleven other individual unions joined 
forces to bring in $183,000 in political action committee donations. That 
made a mighty big presence in one targeted campaign. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
PAC spending is only part of what the unions are doing in Congressional 
races. The unions' phone banks, direct mail, paid advertising, and 
grassroots organizing are worth hundreds of thousands of dollars more than 
the direct donations reported to the Federal Election Committee. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Much of this union politicking is financed through mandatory worker dues, 
and much is unreported and unregulated by federal election laws. To use a 
favorite political metaphor, union support is a ten-ton gorilla in 
Congressional elections. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Oregon race is the start of a massive campaign to use leftwing, liberal 
political muscle in targeted races in order to undo the Republican 
victories of 1994. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The AFL-CIO has announced plans to spend $35 million to defeat 75 
Republican Congressmen in the 1996 November elections. This is seven times 
more than the union usually spends in federal elections and does not even 
include the millions more spent by individual unions, or the so-called 
&quot;soft money&quot; and the &quot;volunteer&quot; political campaigning done by union 
members. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The unions have suffered many years of declining influence. John Sweeney 
won election as AFL-CIO President last year by promising not only an 
aggressive campaign to increase union membership, but also a vocal 
political campaign to promote the union's liberal agenda. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The National Education Association (NEA), one of the most powerful of all 
the individual unions, has targeted 42 Republican Congressmen for defeat. 
According to the NEA's own press release, the NEA will run &quot;a grassroots 
organizing drive&quot; and a media ad campaign accusing these Congressmen of 
&quot;cutting off our children's future.&quot; 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The NEA has already spent $4.75 million on a multi-media ad campaign 
designed to scare voters about Medicare and Goals 2000 reductions. This 
lavish campaign was targeted in 55 Congressional districts and included 
press conferences, leafleting, and phone banks. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's unfortunate that Congress, by a slight margin, failed to abolish the 
preferential property tax exemption enjoyed exclusively by the National 
Education Association. No other union has this unique financial advantage. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The polls indicate that the public is blaming the Republican Congress for 
not getting much of anything done last year. In fact, President Clinton 
deserves most of the blame because he vetoed a perfectly reasonable 
Balanced Budget Act and also a perfectly reasonable compromise welfare 
reform bill. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The members of Congress most at risk from the AFL-CIO assault are the 
freshmen who came to Washington determined to cut government down to size. 
They are our hope for a conservative Congress in the future. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is a freshman Congressman who is leading the battle to abolish the 
Department of Education. It is a freshman Congressman who is championing 
the cause of the brave U.S. soldier (Michael New) who refused to wear a 
United Nations uniform. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It was a freshman Congressman who dared to push for a vote on the Mexican 
bailout. It was a freshman Congressman who stopped the totalitarian 
anti-terrorism bill (to give Janet Reno the power to wiretap all our 
telephones.) 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It was freshmen Congressmen who voted against Clinton's unconstitutional 
sending of U.S. troops into the war in Bosnia. It is freshmen Congressmen 
who are working for campaign spending reform and term limits. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These are the Congressmen you will hear the media complaining about as 
&quot;obstructionists&quot; and &quot;extremists.&quot; That's because they are daring to 
challenge business as usual and have a real dedication to doing what the 
voters sent them to Washington to do. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
You can bet that the freshmen members of Congress will be the ones targeted 
for defeat by the big money and organizational muscle of the liberal 
unions.

<title>Rockwell: Beltway Bandits All -- 8/1/96</title>
</head>

Beltway Bandits All
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conservative pundits are having the time of their lives 
blasting Bob Dole, with several calling on him to drop out before 
the convention. The stated reason: his lifetime of politicking 
and state-building has put him hopelessly out of touch with the 
public's desire for real change in Washington. If he becomes the 
nominee, they say, Republicans will lose. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Perhaps so. At the same time, it's not fair to single out 
Mr. Dole for such scrutiny, while the leaders of the current 
Congress get off scot-free. After all, Newt Gingrich, Richard 
Armey, and Trent Lott are as much creatures of Washington as Mr. 
Dole. Their reluctance to upset the system that created them and 
sustains their power is what dashed the early hopes that this 
Congress would do something extraordinary. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sensing that the public has not been impressed, the 
Republican leadership is at last getting defensive about its 
record. Mr. Armey, the House Majority Leader, was particularly 
incensed when a news story from the <i>New York Times</i> suggested, 
without further elaboration, that this Congress "has not 
accomplished much else despite its grand early promises" other
than welfare reform.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While hardly anyone would dispute this (even if the welfare 
reform looks piddling), Mr. Armey has taken grave offense. In 
thinking this way, he says, we are ignoring "the truth about the 
accomplishments of this Congress." He proceeds with a strange 
list of items that merely remind us of the extent that this 
Congress has indeed squandered the opportunity of a century. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mr. Armey says "we achieved more than $53 billion in 
discretionary savings." But this is only an "accomplishment" if 
you keep track of the new additions to Congress's Dictionary of 
Budgetary Wordplay. The term "savings" here does not mean cuts, 
which Congress promised, or even cuts in the normal rate of 
increase. It refers to the difference between two artificial 
forecasts that Congress itself controls. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
You can try this technique at home. List all the purchases 
you have made this month, no matter how frivolous or how much you 
had to borrow to make them. Measure that against how much you 
would spend if you had  really  splurged. The difference between 
the two is how much you "saved" last month. This budgetary device 
can make your savings rate skyrocket--at least in your own mind. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The term "savings" is smoke and mirrors, while the official 
record will show that this Congress increased total government 
spending at the usual rate. The Congressional leadership has 
accepted and reinforced the Washington rule that spending must 
always increase at the rate of inflation, plus the rate of 
growth, for a total of 5 to 6 percent per year.
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sensing that some people may be on to this game, Mr. Armey 
turns to a page in the Art of Political Dissembling. He says 
Congress has balanced, by the year 2002, that "part of the budget 
that Congress controls." Let's say a three-pack-a-day smoker 
tries the same trick. If he announces "I have quit smoking by 
2002, at least the part I control," do you believe him?
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When Ronald Reagan was president, Republicans heaped scorn 
on the Democratic Congress when it claimed that it only 
controlled a portion of the budget. Now the Republican Congress 
uses the same implausible defense of its profligacy. If the 
Congress doesn't control the purse strings, who does?  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While claiming not to control the budget, the Congressional 
leadership is also trying to evade other responsibilities. It 
passed an unconstitutional "line-item veto" which not only 
tramples on the separation of powers, but also vastly enhances
the political power of the next president, who will likely be 
Congress's supposed opponent. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In other ways, Congress has stepped up government power, 
even over matters that should remain within its own internal 
purview. For example, in the words of Mr. Armey, the Congress 
made itself "subject to the same workplace standards and 
practices as the private sector." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sound good? In fact, there was a reason why Congress has 
never been subject to such laws. They are enforced by executive 
branch agencies like the Department of Labor, the Justice 
Department, and the EEOC. Private business knows how menacing 
these agencies can be, even to the point of determining workplace
composition with class-action lawsuits. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Already, individual Congressional offices are feeling the 
pressure to hire a "diverse" office, complete with quotas and 
affirmative action. This not only wrecks staff morale and 
cripples efforts to repeal these laws. It subjects Congressional 
offices to a subtle and corrupt domination by the president 
himself. Already, some offices have been pressured to end morning 
prayers for fear of violating the first amendment. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Since the New Deal, we have lived under an imperial 
executive that contradicts both the letter and spirit of the 
original Constitution (which instituted Congressional supremacy).
With these two acts--the line-item veto and regulation of 
legislative offices--executive-branch control is enhanced to 
dangerous new levels. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mr. Armey claims that the agricultural bill represents 
revolutionary change, but here again is more bluster than 
substance. The farm bill merely changed the regulations to ensure 
agribusiness subsidies continue to flow in times when price 
supports has ceased to be profitable. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition, there are the actions that Mr. Armey has pretended to 
forget about: tacitly approving the bailout of Mexico, a budget and 
power expansion for the BATF, and the authorization of privatized tax 
collection (tax farming, it was once called). Each case represents an 
increase in the degree and scope of federal government power, exactly 
the opposite of what this Congress promised. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Now it appears that the leadership is accepting the newest 
conventional wisdom of media-land: Congress needs to pass some 
more legislation before the election to impress voters. Thus the 
leadership is conspiring to give us Hillary-lite in the form of 
new health insurance mandates and regulations, as well as an 
egregious increase in the minimum wage, guaranteed to raise the 
unemployment rate after this session closes. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If Bob Dole deserves the aspersions being cast upon him, so 
does the entire Congressional leadership. If voters give them a 
whop on the nose this November, it won't be undeserved. It's time 
for men like Mr. Armey to 'fess up, so their coming political 
losses won't be interpreted as a verdict on the public's view 
that most of what the federal government does has outlived its 
usefulness.

<h2>
Games and Tricks of the New World Order
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
schlafly
.html">
Phyllis Schlafly
</a>

<P>
It's becoming clear that "New World Order" is not just a fantasy of 
conspiracy-minded rightwingers. President George Bush popularized its use 
in 1990 in order to legitimize the Gulf War by resuscitating the 
then-moribund United Nations. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Like Saddam Hussein, the New World Order concept survived the Gulf War 
intact, and now we're seeing the unintended consequences. New World Order 
is a handy label to describe the various policies that are challenging our 
sovereignty, trying to bore into our bank account, and turning over U.S. 
service personnel to the U.N. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The World Trade Organization (WTO), which the United States officially 
joined when Congress ratified the GATT treaty in its lame-duck session in 
December 1994, recently ruled against the United States in its first case. 
Why is anybody surprised! This result was widely predicted. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The adverse WTO ruling is embarrassing to President Clinton and his U.S. 
Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, who had promised the liberals that the 
WTO would never diminish our environmental regulations. It's just as 
embarrassing to the Republican leadership in Congress who promised 
conservatives that such an attack on our sovereign right to make our own 
laws would never happen. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
At issue was the Clean Air Act's strict limits on pollutants in gasoline, 
which Venezuela and Brazil were unable to meet. In the name of "free 
trade," they took their complaint to the WTO and won. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Since the United States does not export gasoline to Venezuela or Brazil, in 
the name of "free trade" the WTO can now order "cross- retaliation" trade 
sanctions against other U.S. industries that are wholly unrelated to the 
gasoline industry or the EPA regulations. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
It was the 1994 GATT treaty that made this adverse ruling and unfair 
punishment possible. The old GATT did not allow it. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The second New World Order item is the announcement by UN Secretary-General 
Boutros Boutros-Ghali in London that he wants to finance the nearly 
bankrupt United Nations by imposing a global tax on foreign exchange 
transactions. A tiny rate of 0.5 percent would produce an incredible $1.5 
trillion, while a minuscule rate of 0.05 percent would produce $150 
billion. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Another global tax he is toying with that would produce billions of dollars 
is a surcharge of $1.50 on all international airline tickets. It turns out 
that one of the chief promoters of these far-out notions is the 
Clinton-appointed administrator of the UN Development Program, James 
Gustave Speth. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Some claim that Boutros-Ghali is floating the global tax in order to shame 
the United States into paying the $1.4 billion the U.N. claims we owe. Some 
are suggesting that, if we don't pay up, the U.N. should cut off our U.N. 
voting rights, hit us with late- payment charges, and impose a ban on 
hiring U.S. citizens for U.N. jobs. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But Americans don't think they are getting their money's worth from our 
payments to the U.N. Our assessments are 25 percent of the regular U.N. 
budget and 31 percent of the peacekeeping costs. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The third New World Order item is the court-martial and conviction of an 
American soldier, Army Specialist Michael New, for refusing to wear the UN 
uniform on a so-called "peacekeeping" expedition to Macedonia. The other 
550 servicemen in his unit donned UN helmets, replaced their U.S. I.D. card 
with a U.N. I.D. card, and dutifully marched off to Macedonia, where 
Americans have no business being in the first place. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
When Specialist New's commander gave the U.N.-uniform order to the 550 
troops on October 2, 1995 in Schweinfurt, Germany, the only authority he 
cited consisted of "UN guidelines," "National Command Authority," "UN 
Charter," "Domestic Law," "Commander in Chief," and "UN Security Council 
Resolutions." He mocked objections to the U.N. baby-blue helmets by saying, 
"They look fabulous." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Actually, the baby-blue UN helmets don't look either military or masculine. 
Maybe that's why they have been seen only very fleetingly on American 
television. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
New argued that the order to alter his uniform was a violation of the 
Army's regulation against wearing any unauthorized insignia, decoration, 
medal or uniform. He said, "I am not a U.N. soldier. I am an American 
soldier." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
You have to wonder why the Clinton Administration didn't simply reassign 
New to some other duty, since the twice-decorated soldier has an exemplary 
record and was willing to obey any order to go anywhere in the world so 
long as he could wear a U.S. uniform. But no, Clinton was determined to 
carry out this first step in transforming American soldiers into U.N. 
soldiers and wouldn't let one soldier stand in his way. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Congressman Roscoe Bartlett (R-MD) calls Specialist New an American hero 
and has been joined by at least 60 other Congressmen in co- sponsoring a 
bill to declare it unlawful to require a member of the U.S. Armed Services 
to wear insignia, indicia or headgear indicating any allegiance to or 
affiliation with the United Nations. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
All the Republican Presidential candidates should be addressing these New 
World Order issues.

<title>F.Y.I. #70 - Exports to Aisa Leads to US Job Creation -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">

<h3><I><center>As U.S. Exports to Asia Boom, So Does Creation of American Jobs
</h3></i>
By John T. Dori<br>
Research Assistant <p>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I.#70<br>
November 15, 1995<br>
</center><p>
<hr size=3 width=50%>
<p>
Trade with Asia is vitally important to the American economy. U.S. exports to East Asia and the 
Pacific Rim in 1994 grew at a healthy 16.2 percent to more than $153 billion. This is the steepest 
increase since 1988. The prosperous nations of the Asia-Pacific region purchased over $45 billion 
more from U.S. exporters than did the 15 nations of the European Union, and almost $30 billion 
more than Europe as a whole.<P>
More exports to Asia means more jobs for Americans. The U.S. Department of Commerce 
estimates that 20,000 American jobs are created for each $1 billion in exports. Thus, in 1994, more 
than 3 million Americans owed their jobs to U.S. exports to Asia. And of these 3 million jobs, more 
than 428,000 were created in 1994 alone.
<P>
The job-creating benefits of these exports were spread liberally across the United States in 1994, 
with 42 of the 50 states exporting more to Asia than in the previous year. California is noteworthy 
in this regard. Its aggressive export promotion program aimed at Asia and the Pacific Rim helped 
the Golden State increase its total 1994 exports to the region by almost $7 billion, creating jobs for 
more than 126,000 Californians. Other noteworthy performances were turned in by Arizona (21.9 
percent growth), Georgia (32.0 percent), Florida (26.6 percent), Illinois (22.8 percent), Oregon 
(21.9 percent), and Texas (19.6 percent).
<P>
Trade with Asia is increasingly important to the health and growth of the American economy. In 
order to create more American jobs and a higher standard of living for the American people, the 
U.S. must expand its access to the increasingly prosperous markets of the Asia-Pacific region. 
Washington can do this by continuing to promote lower trade barriers throughout the region. As the 
U.S. export figures show, America cannot afford trade wars with Asian countries.
<P>
The following chart provides a graphic indication of how much this country stands to benefit or 
lose in trade with Asia. Continuing on the path toward liberalized trade with this lucrative region is 
the road to continued American prosperity. The path toward protectionism and increased U.S. 
barriers to trade, on the other hand, will lead to America's being cut out of Asia's growing markets, 
and thus to fewer jobs and a lower standard of living for all Americans.

<h2>Bilingualism Is The Wrong Way To Go</h2> 

<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 
For the last five years, Political Correctness has forced the academic (and  
much of the political) world to pay homage to the new sacred cows called  
multiculturalism and diversity. Those are usually used as code words to  
challenge the assumption that Western Civilization is the basis of what we  
call the American system, and to pretend that all cultures are equal and  
contributed equally to the America we know.  
 <p> 
This fad seems to be trying to get us to change our national identity from  
E pluribus unum (From the many, one) to E uno plures (From the one, many).  <p>
Indeed, Vice President Al Gore's goof last year indicates that he has  
already made that transition.  
 <p> 
But cultures are not so easily rationalized. Cultures are grounded in  
deeply held emotions, history and relationships that defy logical analysis.  
The separatist movement in Quebec and the fighting in Bosnia are two recent  
evidences of how inherited cultures cause bitter, current problems.  
  <p>
The United States is the world's most stunning example of a nation that has  
peaceably and successfully assimilated people from many disparate cultures.  <p>
So why are some people trying to separate us into factions, emphasizing  
what divides us instead of what unites us?  
  <p>
The $8 billion bureaucratic failure called "bilingual education" keeps more  
than two million immigrant children in a three-to-five year program where  
as much as 90 percent of their school day is spent in their native  
language. Sometimes their teachers speak almost no English.  
  <p>
New York City students are taught in 82 languages, including Kpelle,  
Nyanja, Twi, Gurma, Ewe, Cham, and others most Americans have never heard  
of. The bureaucrats try to put all children with Hispanic-sounding names in  
bilingual education programs even though they may be fully English-speaking  
and come from English- speaking homes.  
  <p>
The term bilingual education is a complete misnomer because there is no  
requirement that children in bilingual programs ever become fluent in  
English. Our tax dollars are used to promote unilingual education in the  
immigrant's native tongue, and this is nurturing a permanent,  
non-English-speaking subculture.  
  <p>
Without any proof that bilingual classes promote their announced purpose,  
and despite the opposition of the majority of those the program is supposed  
to serve, the bilingual education lobby has shifted its objective. It is  
now trying to make foreign language and culture an integral component of  
American society.  
  <p>
Some advocates see bilingual education as the first step in a radical  
transformation of the United States into a nation without one common  
language or fixed borders. Josue Gonzales, director of bilingual education  
during the Carter Administration and now a professor at Columbia University  
Teachers College, says that Spanish "should no longer be regarded as a  
foreign language" but should be considered "a second national language."  
  <p>
Some in the bilingual lobby have even more extreme views. At the annual  
conference of the National Association for Bilingual Education in Phoenix  
in February 1995, several speakers challenged the very idea of U.S.  
sovereignty and promoted the notion that the Southwest and northern Mexico  
are really one cultural region, which they call La Frontera.  
  <p>
Eugene Garcia, head of bilingual education at the U.S. Department of  
Education in the Clinton Administration, told the conferees that "the  
border for many is nonexistent. For me, for intellectual reasons, that  
border shall be nonexistent." His rhetoric was greeted by thunderous  
applause.  <p>
  
The November 1994 meeting of the Texas Association for Bilingual Education  
in Austin featured both the Mexican and American flags on the stage. The  
teachers and school personnel in attendance stood for the singing of the  
national anthems of both countries. The political battle over California's  
Proposition 187 in 1994 featured a huge demonstration of people marching  
with Mexican, not U.S., flags.  
  <p>
The bilingual movement should be stopped before it causes any more damage  
to our national fabric. At least it should be stopped insofar as this lobby  
is financed by the taxpayers, and those who work for separatist causes  
should do so on their own dollar, not ours.  
  <p>
Rep. Toby Roth (R-WI), with 91 co-sponsors, has introduced a bill to make  
English our official language. It would end the government's multilingual  
policies, including bilingual education, voting ballots in languages other  
than English, and foreign language citizenship ceremonies.  
  <p>
You can't be an American if you don't speak English. Our public schools  
should be mandated to teach all children in English.  
  <p>
President Theodore Roosevelt said it best: "The one absolute certain way of  
bringing this nation to ruin would be to permit it to become a tangle of  
squabbling nationalities. We have but one flag. We must also have but one  
language, and that language is English."

<title>Rockwell: The Farm Trick Reform -- 04/17/96
</title>

<h2> The Farm Trick Reform
</h2>



Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
<p>

Hillary Clinton should have called her medical bill "Freedom 
To Heal." Then Congress might have passed it as restoring the 
free market in medicine. If you don't believe such a trick would 
have worked, take a look at the "Freedom To Farm" bill now 
sailing into law. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Official propaganda says this bill restores a free market in 
agriculture, ending 60 years of subsidies and planning. But ask 
yourself: if this were really true, wouldn't farmers on the dole, 
and the media, be in hysterics? 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Of course, and a close examination of the bill backs up this 
suspicion. The existing scheme, based on New Deal programs in 
turn modeled on the old Russian system, is retained in all its 
essentials. After this bill expires in seven years, the 1949 law 
that presently oppresses us will again be the law of the land. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Not that the new bill is salt peanuts. With a $47 billion 
price tag, it allocates even more money to subsidies initially, 
and to crazy new liberal programs. But in seven years, we're 
told, price supports and subsidies will be "phased out." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This farm bill is typical of a Congress that can't bring 
itself to cut a dime of federal spending, yet passes reams of 
"revolutionary" laws promising to cut, slash, abolish, and 
otherwise establish a libertarian Heaven on Earth...sometime in 
the next millennium. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But in the here and now, the bill retains price supports for 
peanuts and sugar, as well as price-fixing for milk. It renews a 
program locking up 36 million acres. And it throws away $1.4 
billion on more regulations, $200 million on a Florida swamp, and 
$300 million on "rural development." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

All in all, this bill could have been written by Bill 
Clinton, which is why he's glad to sign it. The Democrats 
particularly like the food stamp and school lunch provisions. 
Why, you may ask, are these part of a farm bill? Because those
who benefit, along with the "poor," are wealthy agribusinessmen.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Why this bill? Why now? Crop prices are at a ten-year high, 
and under the current subsidy formula, payments would be low. So, 
by merest happenstance, this bill changes the price-based system 
into a flat subsidy. Three to four billion dollars more will be 
spent for farm welfare immediately. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The bill's supporters say it eliminates many set asides, 
acreage controls, and crop mandates. But that would only be a 
glorious thing if the industry weren't subsidized and protected 
from competition. "Freedom to farm"--with other people's money.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The farm program is one of the oldest federal scandals. The troubles
began a century and half ago, when U.S. tariffs were set 
to favor industry at the expense of agriculture. The policy 
culminated in an invasion of the agricultural South by former 
industrial lobbyist Abe Lincoln. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Then, in the first world war, the federal government pumped 
up the price of wheat and other products, and after the war, 
tried to keep them that way. That effort failed, and after two 
devastating post-war downturns, officials sought more 
protectionism and outright planning. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

By the time of the Great Depression, the Jeffersonian ideal 
of the independent yeoman farmer was banished. As president, 
Herbert Hoover set out to keep prices high by subsidies, trade 
restrictions, and planting controls at the very time when market 
pressures were forcing them to fall. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But Mr. Hoover was small potatoes compared to farm dictator 
Franklin D. Roosevelt. As he forced farmers to slaughter their 
hogs and plow under their crops in order to raise prices, he was 
also flooding some of the world's best farm land for the 
Tennessee Valley Authority. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The "brain trust" that gave us those policies still runs 
agriculture. The sector has become a virtual ward of the state, 
with the feds holding more than half of all farm debt. There are 
still independent farmers, and they avoid Washington like the 
boll weevil. Agriculture is dominated by subsidized agribusiness, 
its lobbyists, and its pet politicians. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The victims of food socialism are consumers and taxpayers, 
who shell out billions directly and in the form of artificially 
high prices every year. Also harmed are the remaining independent 
farmers, whose livelihoods are threatened by subsidized 
competition. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

That's why Congress should pass a real Freedom To Farm Act. 
It would abolish the whole of the existing system, and subject 
the sector to the same competition and price dictates that free 
industries face. Congress should also stop concocting tricky new 
ways to prop up big government with misnamed bills.

<title>The Caribbean Basin Trade Bill -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3><i>THE CARIBBEAN BASIN TRADE BILL: <br>
GOOD ECONOMIC POLICY AND GOOD NEIGHBOR POLICY</i></h3>
By Joe Cobb<br>
John M. Olin Senior Fellow in Political Economy<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 430<br>
October 12, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
Congress is considering legislation to reduce tariffs on some products from countries in the Caribbean Basin and could include this measure in the FY 1996 budget reconciliation package. This would be a wise action. The legislation is important to the economies of the Caribbean Basin and to the American companies that built factories there in the past decade under the incentives of President Reagan's 1983 Caribbean Basin Initiative.
<p>
The adoption of NAFTA in 1993 reduced tariffs on products from Mexico and created a tariff disadvantage for Caribbean countries. Many American companies with facilities currently located there are considering whether to shift production to Mexico. Diverting trade from Caribbean nations to Mexico because of the tariff differential certainly would benefit Mexico, but only at the expense of the smaller economies the Reagan Administration sought to help. Extending free trade to include imports from the Caribbean nations will prevent this distortion of the market.
<p>
The Caribbean Basin Trade Security Act (H.R. 553 and S. 529), introduced in January by Representative Phil Crane (R-IL) and Senator Bob Graham (D-FL), preserves the Reagan Administration's initiative to build up the economy of the Caribbean Basin and continues the United States commitment to open trade and economic development through free-market incentives. It would do this by reducing tariff barriers equivalent to NAFTA. A modified version of this bill is being considered by both the House and Senate.
<P>
<b>Competitive Disadvantage.</b> Many American companies, particularly in the apparel industry, have invested in Caribbean Basin countries during the past 10 years. During 1994, some $4.6 billion in textile and apparel products was shipped to the United States from the region. Because of NAFTA, however, goods shipped from Mexico are becoming less expensive relative to products shipped from the Caribbean, where tariffs are higher. Mexico shipped $2.4 billion in textiles and apparel to the United States in 1994, and the amount is expected to increase in 1995. Companies now operating in the Caribbean Basin are considering relocating to Mexico because of the less costly trade restrictions. The bill would provide that the rules of  origin for component parts of goods imported from the Caribbean are the same as those that apply to goods from Mexico. It also would set equal tariff rates.
<P>
Industry groups, including the American Apparel Manufacturers Association, American Textile Manufacturers Institute, United States Apparel Industry Council, American Yarn Spinners Association, American Fiber Manufacturers Association, and National Cotton Council, as well as the Association of American Chambers of Commerce in Latin America, have urged the Senate Finance Committee to include the Caribbean Basin Trade Security provision in the FY 1996 budget reconciliation legislation to stop the investment diversion caused by Mexico's more favorable trade situation. The industry groups say approximately 275,000 American jobs depend on current Caribbean trade because of the way production has been diversified in the past decade. 
<p>
<b>Protectionism vs. Free Trade.</b> The Caribbean Basin legislation may become the first battle in the 104th  Congress between advocates of protectionism and supporters of freer trade. The bill enjoys bipartisan support. H.R. 553, introduced by a Republican, was co-sponsored by the top-ranking Democratic members on the House Ways and Means Committee, and all subsequent co-sponsors have been Democrats. S. 529, introduced by a Democrat, is co-sponsored by Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA), chairman of the Senate Trade Subcommittee. But opponents blocked the addition of this legislation to the FY 1996 budget reconciliation during the Ways and Means Committee markup on September 12-13. Opponents of the bill are predominantly Members of Congress who also opposed NAFTA and GATT in the last Congress. Unfortunately, they have been joined by several  otherwise free-market freshmen.
<p>
Regrettably, H.R. 553 and S. 529 have become symbols of the populist debate over trade policy. Those who opposed NAFTA and GATT in 1993 and 1994 now see the Caribbean Basin Trade Security bill as another chance to argue against international trade. They claim that American jobs will be lost and that further reducing tariffs on imports from the Caribbean Basin will cost $1.1 billion in lost tariff revenue over the next five years. But the reality is that tariff revenue from the Caribbean already is being lost from the diversion of trade to   Mexico. The legislation actually would preserve tariff revenue that otherwise would be lost over time.
<p>
Certainly there may be some U.S. jobs at risk under NAFTA as other textile apparel manufacturers establish production in Mexico. But the argument that U.S. jobs will be lost due to the Caribbean Basin Trade Security Act is flawed. Reducing Caribbean tariffs to NAFTA levels will facilitate ongoing production in joint U.S.-   Caribbean factories. NAFTA created those incentives for investment two years ago. Moving factories and jobs to Mexico from the Caribbean and reducing tariffs for Caribbean countries so that existing production facilities can remain profitable will not cost U.S. jobs but will preserve Caribbean jobs and a flow of tariff revenues to the United States. Because of generally higher transportation costs and tariffs under current law, any jobs at risk are in the Caribbean.
<p>
The Senate Finance Committee should include the Caribbean Basin Trade Security Act in its FY 1996 budget reconciliation bill, and the House of Representatives should reconsider last month's Ways and Means Committee decision. American companies have made substantial investments in the Caribbean region in response to the trade incentives Congress established after 1983. The promise of improved economic growth in Mexico following the implementation of NAFTA should not come at the expense of small, developing countries of the Caribbean Basin. Free trade fosters production and investment by allowing consumer demand to set the terms of  profitability and by getting government-imposed trade barriers and tariffs out of the way. The Caribbean Basin Initiative in the 1980s started this process in the Caribbean, and NAFTA has opened Mexico even more to    market forces. Eliminating the remaining barriers to Caribbean trade will level the playing field.
<p>
Supporters of deregulation and the free market should continue the program started by the Reagan Administration to build up the economy of the Caribbean Basin and reinforce the message of United States commitment to open trade and worldwide economic growth through free-market incentives.

<h2>Don't Turn the Clock Back to Rockefeller Republicanism</h2> 
<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 
Ever since the four-term phenomenon of Franklin D. Roosevelt, two very 
different factions have wrestled for control of the Republican Party. 
On the one hand are the grassroots Republicans, Main Street Americans, 
who labor in the precincts to elect candidates they hope will be 
faithful after election.
<p> 
On the other hand are the powerful people who fancy themselves as 
kingmakers, the wheelers and dealers of the proverbial smoke- filled 
rooms, also known as the New York or Wall Street or eastern liberal 
establishment. They include the multinational corporations (whose most 
recent accomplishment was the Mexican bailout) and the Business 
Roundtable types, whose fingers of control slither through what is 
called the media elite. 
<p>
These kingmakers are Big Government Republicans. They seek to maintain 
the current high level of federal spending, and they want to control 
how the money is spent. They are liberals, but their favorite word to 
identify themselves is "moderate." 
<p>
In 1940 the New York kingmakers created the 60-day wonder named 
Wendell Willkie. He was a registered Democrat, but the kingmakers 
manufactured a new image for him through a media blitz and made him 
the Republican nominee for President. 
<p>
In 1944 and 1948, the kingmakers forced the Republican Party to 
nominate the man who brought the expression "me too" into the 
political lexicon. Voters opted for the real Democrat in 1944 and 
1948, not the carbon copy. 
<p>
In 1952 the New York kingmakers felt threatened by the rise of the 
conservative movement led by Senator Bob Taft. The issue was clear: 
Taft had pledged to reduce the level of federal spending 
significantly, so the liberal Republicans set out to defeat him at all 
costs. By the narrowest of margins, the New York kingmakers stole the 
1952 Republican National Convention for a military hero, Dwight 
Eisenhower. 
<p>
During Ike's two terms, the liberals initiated all kinds of big 
federal spending programs that have plagued us ever since, such as 
federal aid to education. It was no surprise that Republican seats in 
Congress steadily declined. 
<p>
In 1964, the New York kingmakers tried to force Republicans to 
nominate Nelson Rockefeller, a Big Government, internationalist 
Republican Governor who raised taxes, engaged in profligate spending 
of the taxpayers' money, and me-tooed the liberal Democratic policies. 
They failed; grassroots conservatives asserted their majority position 
in the Republican Party by nominating Barry Goldwater and repudiating 
Rockefeller Republicanism. 
<p>
The Rockefeller cabal then cooperated with the media moguls in a 
campaign to defeat Goldwater that was marked by unprecedented hysteria 
and vicious smears. The result was Lyndon B. Johnson and the 
exponential expansion of Big Government under the Great Society. 
<p>
In the following years, conservatives were cowed by a constant 
refrain. "You conservatives had your chance with Barry Goldwater. His 
defeat proves America will never elect a conservative, so the best you 
can hope for is Richard Nixon." 
<p>
The Nixon regime proved that conservatives are fools to accept half a 
loaf. In foreign policy, his appointee Henry Kissinger continued the 
disastrous McNamara policies of abandoning our strategic superiority 
to the Soviets. In domestic policy, Nixon admitted he was a Keynesian 
and even inflicted price controls on us. 
<p>
In 1976 the fainthearted persuaded a scant majority of Republicans to 
stick with the "moderate," Gerald Ford. However, even that "moderate" 
Republican National Convention was unwilling to take Rockefeller as 
Ford's running mate. 
<p>
Finally, in 1980, Ronald Reagan mainstreamed conservatism as the 
vision and the values of Middle America. He drew conservative and pro-
family Democrats and independents into the Republican Party. 
<p>
Reagan's vision of conservatism consists of four specific elements: 
limited government with lower taxes; personal responsibility with a 
disdain for taxpayer handouts for personal or social causes; military 
superiority so our armed forces can protect our independence 
(specifically including SDI); and respect for life and family values. 
<p>
Each of these four elements of Reagan's conservatism has a large 
constituency among the American people. The coalition produced the 
greatest Presidency and the biggest Republican victories of our times. 
This Reagan coalition is the model for the future of the Republican 
Party, and casting off any of them would spell defeat for Republicans. 
<p>
It is a puzzlement why Colin Powell identified himself as a 
"Rockefeller Republican," when Nelson Rockefeller was the 
quintessential representative of the eastern liberal establishment. To 
the grassroots conservatives who are now the dominant majority in the 
Republican Party, Rockefeller Republicanism means "in your face" Big 
Government liberalism. 
<p>
To nominate a Rockefeller Republican in 1996 would be turning the 
clock back to 1964 when that crowd lost the watershed battle between 
grassroots conservatives vs. the establishment. It would be as foolish 
as refighting the Civil Rights Act, the other defining battle of 1964. 
<p>
The Reagan model teaches us that authentic conservatism is the road to
 victory. Conservative Republicans don't have to settle for a me-tooer 
or a liberal or a "moderate" masquerading as a conservative because 
conservatives have the votes to demand the real thing. <p>

<title>Schlafly: Why Do They Call It "Free Trade"?  -- 3/28/96</title>

<h2>
Why Do They Call It "Free Trade"?
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

</a>

<P>
Why do some people persist in mouthing the mantra "free trade" when foreign 
countries can and do engage in all sorts of dishonest tactics that 
interfere with trade, such as devaluation or other manipulation of the 
value of their money, confiscation (or nationalization) of U.S. property, 
refusing to live up to the contracts and agreements they sign, stealing our 
patents and copyrights, and counterfeiting our money? 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Chinese government is engaging in massive piracy of American patented, 
copyrighted and trademarked materials. The U.S. intellectual property 
stolen by the Chinese includes a wide array of products including computer 
programs, pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals, musical recordings, 
videos, and automotive designs. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Collectively, these products are one of the greatest strengths of the U.S. 
economy and are the envy of the world. The United States exports many 
billions of dollars worth of these products each year. China simply finds 
it easier to illegally copy these products than to buy them from us or 
build competitive products, so China steals them on a gigantic scale. Some 
30 Chinese factories daily turn out thousands of illegal compact discs and 
sell them all over the world, and illegally copied recordings, films and 
computer programs are widely available all over China. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Experts estimate that China's piracy in intellectual property amounts to $1 
billion per year in lost U.S. exports. According to the Commerce 
Departments rule-of-thumb, this means that 20,000 American jobs have been 
displaced by the $1 billion in lost U.S. exports. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Just a year ago, U.S. and Chinese negotiators signed a second agreement to 
end this piracy of intellectual property, but these agreements have had no 
effect on the Chinese. China has failed to comply with every major trade 
agreement it has signed with the United States in recent years. The United 
States has threatened China with trade sanctions a half-dozen times, but 
such threats have no effect on China's stealing. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
McDonnell Douglas's dealings with the Communist Chinese offer a good 
example of how they deceive American businessmen in order to steal U.S. 
technology and equipment. By dangling the prospect of a large order for 
passenger planes which was later largely cancelled, the Chinese acquired at 
bargain-basement prices a tremendous quantity of U.S. equipment that is 
building up Chinese military power to threaten other countries. China is 
even sharing our technology with Iran. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The General Accounting Office told Congress on February 27 that Middle East 
counterfeiters are flooding overseas markets with "the highest quality of 
counterfeit $100 U.S. bills Treasury officials have ever seen." Our 
government is sure that a foreign government supports the printers. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
This situation is not new. The House Republican Research Committee's Task 
Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare declared four years ago that 
billions of "superdollars" are being produced on "high-tech, state-owned 
presses with paper only acquired by governments." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
On March 2, U.S. negotiator Ira Shapiro said that Japan has failed to carry 
out an agreement it signed in October 1994 to open up its insurance market 
to us. Shapiro said that other areas where Japan remains unwilling to open 
its markets are semiconductors, photographic film, and civil aviation. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Foreign countries impose all kinds of tariffs as well as an endless variety 
of tariff- alternatives, such as limiting the number and kinds of U.S. 
products that may enter their country and forcing U.S. products to meet 
unreasonable requirements. Just ask any of the many companies that have 
tried to sell their products in Japan and have run into one bureaucratic or 
regulatory roadblock after another. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Many foreign countries have governments that are totally corrupt. 
Corruption and bribery are accepted ways of doing business in many foreign 
countries. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Far from being the "free trade" that the NAFTA and GATT treaties promised, 
they have subjected the American economy to new international 
bureaucracies. After Sprint closed a telemarketing plant in San Francisco 
because it was losing money, it not only faced a challenge from the union, 
but on February 27 was subjected to a NAFTA challenge from tri-national 
representatives of Mexico, Canada and the United States. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
It is dishonest to eliminate U.S. tariffs and call it "free trade" when any 
or all of the above tactics are used against us. We are fools to seek "free 
trade" with countries that engage in organized theft of our property and 
counterfeiting of our money, or which renege on their agreements and 
contracts. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
When the Clinton Administration calls NAFTA and GATT "free trade," we 
should remember that those were the same people who called taxes 
"contributions," and who called government social spending "investments." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But aren't low-tariffs or no-tariffs a good thing? That depends -- on the 
industry, on the source country, on the timing, on the reciprocity. Tariffs 
should be individually determined, and all tariff-alternatives and other 
government restrictions used by other countries should be on the table 
during the negotiations. The guiding principle should be the overall best 
interests of the American people -- not the rulings of foreign bureaucrats.

<h2>Is the Government Planning Your Child's Career?</h2> <P>
<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a></center><P>

<hr><P> 
Republican Presidential candidates criss-crossing the country have 
discovered that one of their best hot-button applause lines is "I 
promise to abolish the Department of Education." Out in the byways of 
America, parents know that public schools are a disaster area and that 
Federal Government spending has hurt, not helped, the situation. 
 <p>
So it is a puzzlement why the Republican House just passed an 
education bill that increases federal control and involvement in the 
public schools rather than reducing it. Called the "CAREERS" bill, it 
uses federal dollars to expand and institutionalize one of the worst 
Clinton bills passed last year, the School-to-Work Opportunities Act. 
 <p>
Republican Congressmen who voted for this bill are sending six-page 
handouts to their constituents purporting to show how amendments have 
"answered parents' concerns." But opponents of CAREERS didn't merely 
have "concerns" about the CAREERS bill; they recognize it as the 
philosophy we thought we defeated in the 1994 election. 
 <p>
When one takes time to read the CAREERS bill, it is obvious that it is 
the legislative implementation of an 18-page letter written by Marc 
Tucker, president of the National Center on Education and the Economy, 
to Hillary Clinton on November 11, 1992, just after the Presidential 
election. This letter states that it was the result of a meeting in 
David Rockefeller's office, at which those present were "literally 
radiating happiness" at Clinton's victory. 
 <p>
They were celebrating their plans for what "you [Hillary] and Bill 
should do now about education, training and labor market policy." 
Tucker's letter laid out their master plan to "remold" the public 
schools into a "national human resources development system," which 
would be "guided by clear standards that define the stages of the 
system for the people who progress through it, and regulated on the 
basis of outcomes that providers produce for their clients." 
 <p>
Tucker's vision is aggressively ambitious. His letter called for "a 
seamless web" that "literally extends from cradle to grave and is the 
same system for everyone -- young and old, poor and rich, worker and 
full-time student." 
 <p>
Tucker's "seamless web" includes a national employment service in 
which "all available front-line jobs, whether public or private, must 
be listed in it by law." Then, "a system of labor market boards is 
established at the local, state and federal levels to coordinate the 
systems for job training, postsecondary professional and technical 
education, adult basic education, job matching and counseling." 
 <p>
Tucker's "seamless web" calls for government to be in the drivers' 
seat at every stage of the "human resources development system." The 
"labor market boards" will decide what jobs may be allowed, and the 
schools will "train" students (the human resources) for jobs selected 
by the "labor market boards." 
 <p>
The "new general education standard" (i.e., a state-certified 
"certificate of mastery" rather than a diploma) will become a 
"prerequisite for enrollment in all professional and technical degree 
programs," as well as for all hiring. Tucker's letter lays out how, 
under his system, schools will be required to provide information "to 
government agencies in a uniform format." 
 <p>
Tucker's letter makes it clear why so much of the discussion about 
Congressional appropriations for education includes references to the 
Department of Labor. Tucker and his friends have been planning to meld 
Labor and Education functions ever since Lynn Martin, Secretary of 
Labor in the Bush Administration, published the SCANS report. 
 <p>
Much of Marc Tucker's ambitious plan is already in place. Last year, 
Clinton signed the Goals 2000 Act, which requires schools to adopt 
"standards," and the School-to-Work law, which lays the groundwork for 
using high schools to train students for occupations selected by the 
local labor market boards. 
 <p>
The CAREERS bill expands on School-to-Work and perfectly tracks the 
Tucker letter. The CAREERS text states that the Governor of each state 
(if he wants the funds) shall "designate" the establishment of "a 
local workforce development board" in each local area. In the House 
debate on CAREERS on September 19, Education Opportunities Committee 
Chairman William Goodling (R-PA) stated that the bill requires that 
"training be tied to occupations in demand in the local community." 
 <p>
CAREERS makes it clear that government will now assume the power to 
set up workforce development plans, with a comprehensive and 
coordinated labor market computer system, and that students will be 
trained only to work in the occupations prescribed by the government. 
<p> 
In the House debate, Goodling boasted that the White House is pleased 
with this legislation. He admitted that the CAREERS bill has been in 
preparation "for 2 years," which places the date at long before 
Republicans became a majority in the House. 
 <p>
When you combine this workforce system with the schools' obvious 
failure to teach children to read and the dumbing down process called 
Outcome-Based Education, the result will be a Third World education to 
accustom Americans to Third World wages. The "powers that be" want 
public school graduates to be content to compete with workers in 
foreign countries who work for 1/40th of American wages. 
<p> 
Think about that every time you hear politicians, businessmen, 
educators and bureaucrats talking on television about "competing in 
the global economy" and becoming "citizens of the world."

<h2>Beware of Global Taxes for Global Entitlements </h2> 
<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a></center>
<p><hr><P>
"It's not sustainable for member states to enjoy representation 
without taxation," Prime Minister John Major told the United Nations 
at its birthday celebration. He thought he was demonstrating British 
wit in making a play on the great slogan of the American Revolution. 
We are not amused. 
<p> 
The United Nations has a big problem: the tax-cutting Republican 
Congress is disinclined to continue financing those overpaid foreign 
bureaucrats in the lavish style to which they have become accustomed. 
So their solution is to impose a global tax that would produce 
billions or even trillions of dollars without any Congressional 
action. 
 <p>
The so-called Independent Commission on Population and Quality of Life 
has issued a report listing dozens of innovative global devices to tax 
people, corporations, and international business activities. These 
include taxes on aviation traffic and freight, ocean freight and 
cruises, aviation fuel, telecommunications frequencies, communications 
satellites, international postal items, and trade in goods and 
services. 
 <p>
The global tax idea was first publicly launched at the UN World Summit 
for Social Development, held in Copenhagen, Denmark, in March 1995. 
James G. Speth, the Clinton-appointed head of the UN Development 
Program, called for a global tax on speculative movements of 
international funds, the consumption of non-renewable energy, 
environmental permits, and the arms trade. 
 <p>
James Tobin, 1981 Nobel Prize winner in Economics, has called for a 
tax on spot transactions in foreign exchange. The UN bureaucrats are 
licking their chops at Tobin's prediction that "the revenue potential 
is immense, over $1.5 trillion a year," and they are now 
enthusiastically using Tobin's prestige to advocate what they call the 
"Tobin tax." 
 <p>
The Commission on Global Governance, a "private" group with government 
and foundation funding, published a volume this year entitled "Our 
Global Neighborhood." Stating that "it is time for a consensus on 
global taxation for servicing the needs of the global neighborhood," 
this report calls for taxes on flight-lanes, sea lanes, and ocean 
fishing areas. 
 <p>
This report also brags that "the idea of safeguarding and managing the 
global commons, particularly those related to the physical 
environment, is now widely accepted. And the notion of expanding the 
role of the United Nations is now accepted in relation to military 
security." 
 <p>
Another model for a global tax is hidden in the UN Convention on the 
Law of the Sea, a UN treaty the Clinton Administration is trying to 
get the Senate to ratify. This treaty sets up a global taxing 
authority called the International Seabed Authority to collect fees 
and royalties imposed on American mining firms. 
 <p>
An outfit called Worldwatch Institute issued a report this year called 
"Partnership for the Planet." It calls for a global tax to finance 
"the transition to a sustainable society -- including environmental 
programs, social initiatives, and peacekeeping efforts." 
 <p>
Just as the new Republican Congress is trying to put a lid on welfare 
and Medicare entitlements, the UN is planning to saddle U.S. taxpayers 
with global entitlements. The Oxfam Poverty Report proclaims that 
"international aid should be seen as a financial entitlement, and as 
part of a compact between citizens in the industrial and developing 
worlds." 
 <p>
UN bureaucrats and advocates must be having lots of fun dreaming up 
ways to tax Americans to support their notions of "global 
neighborhood" and "sustainable human development." The Ford Foundation 
produced a study last year called "Renewing the United Nations 
System," which advocates an annual "United Nations lottery, 
administered by a special authority under the Secretary-General." 
 <p>
The Ford Foundation also financed a report called "The United Nations 
in Its Second Half-Century," which calls for allowing the UN to have 
Special Drawing Rights from the International Monetary Fund. 
Rationalized as a "levy on the utilization of the global commons," 
this proposal would enable the UN to bypass Congress in accessing U.S. 
taxpayers' money. 
 <p>
Other wealthy liberal foundations that have helped orchestrate the 
demand for a global tax include the MacArthur and Carnegie 
Foundations. The World Federalist Association, now headed by former 
presidential candidate John B. Anderson, weighs in with a 
recommendation for UN taxes on international travel and postal 
service. 
 <p>
Bella Abzug, who was so visible in the recent UN Women's Conference in 
Beijing, also serves as a member of the advisory council of the Global 
Commission to Fund the United Nations. It comes as no surprise that 
she endorses global taxes as a way to finance and enforce the radical 
feminist agenda that she presented at the UN conferences on population 
and women's issues. 
 <p>
Americans had better wake up and expel the UN before it succeeds in 
any of its arrogant global taxing plans. Congress should hold hearings 
on the outrageous global tax schemes exposed by researcher Cliff 
Kincaid for Americans for Tax Reform.

INTRODUCTION<P>
     Seen from the perspective of Washington D.C., the prospects for
the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) appear
gloomy. According to Leon Panetta, President Bill Clinton's Director
of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the agreement is "dead."
Many others in the Administration who also support the NAFTA -- most
notably Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, Labor Secretary Robert
Reich, and Clinton himself -- are equally concerned because
congressional opposition is widespread and growing, most notably among
Democrats but with a sizeable Republican contingent as well. A well-
financed and -organized effort to derail the agreement is underway by
a coalition of interest groups, most prominently labor and
environmental lobbying organizations. The opponents' strategy is to
portray the NAFTA as leading to a massive loss of jobs, the de-
industrialization of the U.S., and a lowering of labor and
environmental standards to those of the Third World.
<P>
          In sharp contrast to this intense hostility and feverish
activity in the nation's capital is the view from the statehouses.
There, the political atmosphere is far more supportive of increased
trade with Mexico, the NAFTA in particular being regarded as almost
self-evidently good for the states. Even as the ranks of those in
Washington opposed to NAFTA swell, the governors of the fifty states
line up almost unanimously in support of the agreement. 
<P>
           The reason cited universally by the governors for their
support is NAFTA's expected positive impact on their states,
especially on job growth. This surprising consensus among the nation's
governors has gone largely unnoticed in the debate over NAFTA, and the
agreement's supporters have overlooked a valuable set of allies. More
important, however, this difference in outlook reveals much about the
difference in decision-making in Washington and the states. Whereas
Washington is overrun by special interest groups, the governors have
become champions not only of their states' interests but of the
general welfare of the nation. On the issue of NAFTA, the governors
better represent the interests of the American people than their
elected officials in Washington.
<P>

NAFTA'S TORTUOUS PATH
<P>
     NAFTA's path to congressional consideration has been a long and
difficult one. First advanced as an idea by Ronald Reagan in his
presidential campaign of 1980, and promoted in the mid-1980s by The
Heritage Foundation, negotiations for a free trade zone among the
U.S., Canada, and Mexico did not get underway until proposed by
Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari in 1990. Although
Salinas's original proposal was for a bilateral U.S.-Mexican
agreement, Canada soon requested participation to safeguard its gains
from the 1988 U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement.
<P>
          The trilateral negotiations which began in 1991 proved much
more difficult than anticipated, largely because of Mexico's desire to
delay the opening of many of its most sensitive and politically
powerful sectors, such as financial services. The resulting agreement,
although not perfect, did provide for the removal of most barriers to
trade among the three countries. Substantially completed by May 1992,
delays in the negotiations shelved congressional action on the
agreement until after the 1992 national elections.
<P>
          George Bush's defeat in November removed the agreement's key
proponent in the U.S. Although Bill Clinton repeatedly expressed his
support for the NAFTA in the campaign, he conditioned his approval on
the negotiation of additional and unspecified "side agreements" on
labor and environmental issues. Ross Perot, by contrast, denounced the
agreement, predicting its implementation would result in a "giant
sucking sound" of U.S. jobs being drawn south to Mexico. In one of his
last acts as President, Bush signed the completed agreement on
December 17, 1992, and forwarded it to Congress, where it awaited the
new President.
<P>
          Since assuming office, Clinton's policy has been to postpone
congressional consideration of the NAFTA until the side agreements
were completed. Negotiation of them began only in March. Since then,
further delays have emerged, most importantly, Mexico's and Canada's
opposition to the Clinton Administtration's attempts to turn the side
agreements into vehicles for protectionism. As a result, Treasury
Secretary Bentsen announced in April that the Administration's focus
on its domestic economic package would delay a vote on the trade pact
until the fall.

<P>
ENEMIES ORGANIZE
<P>
     These repeated delays have given the agreement's enemies time to
organize. Among the first to lobby the new Administration were
representatives of the flat glass and sugar growing industries, each
of which sought to reopen the NAFTA text for modifications in their
favor. Much more serious, however, are the efforts of organized labor
and other groups, such as environmental organizations, whose economic
and ideological interests pit them against free trade.
<P>
          The AFL-CIO makes no secret of its opposition to the
agreement. The defeat of the NAFTA was proclaimed as the "number one
objective" of the organization by Secretary/Treasurer Tom Donohue. A
coalition of environmental and leftist organizations opposed to free
trade in principle, such as the Citizen Trade Campaign, Greenpeace,
and Public Citizen, have given added weight to this opposition. A
well-financed and broad propaganda campaign has been launched which
prominently features provocative allegations against Mexico, such as
the employment of child labor, indiscriminate use of dangerous
pesticides, and the abuse of human rights.
<P>
          The most important issue, however, is jobs. According to the
Clinton Administration, 700,000 jobs have already been created in the
U.S. as a result of increased exports to Mexico. Several hundred
thousand more jobs will be added by the NAFTA. Every serious study of
the effects of the NAFTA (For more information see:  Clopper Almond,
Alberto Ruis-Moncayo, "Industrial Effects of a Mexico-U.S.  Free Trade
Agreement," Interindustry Economic Research Fund, 1991; KPMG Peat
Marwick, Policy Economics Group, "The Effects of a Free Trade
Agreement between the U.S.  and Mexico," 1991; "Review of Trade and
Investment Liberalization Measures by Mexico and Prospects for Future
United States-Mexican Relations," United States International Trade
Commission, Pub.  No.  332-282, October 1990.  Gary Clyde Hufbauer,
Jeffrey J.  Schott, "NAFTA:  And Assessment" (Washington, D.C: 
Institute for International Economics, February 1993); Steven
Globerman and Michael Walker eds.  "Assessing NAFTA:  A Trinational
Analysis" (Vancouver, B.C.:  The Freaser Institute, October 1992). )
shows the U.S. with a net gain in employment, the sole exceptions
being a condemnatory brief produced by the AFL-CIO, and a 1992 study
conducted by the leftist Economic Policy Institute. (Jeff Faux and
Thea M.  Lee, "The Effect of George Bush's NAFTA on American Workers: 
Ladder Up or Ladder Down?"  (Washington, D.C.:  The Economic Policy
Institute, 1992)) Nevertheless, despite the overwhelming empirical
evidence to the contrary, organized labor continues to charge that
there will be a net loss of jobs. This charge resonates in the slow-
growing U.S. economy, where fears of job security among the population
have provided fertile soil.
<P>
          As a result of the intense lobbying by anti-NAFTA forces,
what was once commonly regarded as a done deal now shows signs of
unravelling. Although two-thirds of the Republicans in Congress
support the NAFTA, only one-quarter of Democrats do, according to
informal congressional surveys. The situation is worse among the newly
elected members, where one-third of the freshmen Republicans in the
House oppose or are leaning against the NAFTA. According to Democrat
Representative Robert Matsui of California, a NAFTA supporter, only
five of 63 freshman Democrat Congressmen openly support the trade
pact. The leaders of both houses of Congress, Senator George Mitchell
and Speaker Tom Foley, stated in April that, although they themselves
support the agreement, a vote on NAFTA would lose in both the Senate
and the House of Representatives. Among congressional opponents, the
most commonly cited reason for their position is fear of a loss of
U.S. jobs, especially in the manufacturing sector of the economy.
<P>

NAFTA SUPPORT FROM THE STATES
<P>
     Yet, even as support for the NAFTA erodes in Washington, it
remains solid among the nation's governors. The overwhelming majority
of governors actively support the NAFTA; none has come out against the
agreement. (This information was gathered by Heritage Foundation staff
from March 1 to June 9, 1993, through telephone surveys to the offices
of the governors of the fifty states.) Of the 50 governors offices
contacted by the Heritage Foundation, at least 40 -- 20 of the 29
Democrats, one of two Independents, and all nineteen of the
Republicans -- reported active support for the agreement, with the
others having yet to go beyond their signing of the February 1993
National Governors Association statement backing NAFTA.
<P>
          Their confidence stems from the fact that most states
already have seen sharp increases in exports to Mexico over the last
five years. During that time Mexico removed many of its most egregious
trade barriers against U.S. goods. The NAFTA will simply accelerate
the process of opening Mexico to U.S. businesses and exports. Contrary
to popular belief, the principal effect of the NAFTA will not come
from its elimination of already low U.S. tariffs on Mexican goods --
now averaging 3 percent -- but rather from its dismantling of Mexico's
still-formidable barriers to trade, with tariffs currently averaging
11 percent and quotas limiting or excluing altogether many U.S.
products. Thus, the governors and U.S. business leaders understand
that with the NAFTA in place, the competitive positions of American
companies will be even better than they are now.<P>
SUPPORT FROM THE BORDER STATES

<P>

California
<P>
     California's experience is illustrative of the growing importance
of the Mexican market. Last year, the state's businesses exported $6.6
billion to Mexico, an increase of 190 percent over five years. More
than 110,000 Californians' jobs depend on exports to Mexico, and an
additional 106,000 jobs are supported by U.S. companies operating in
Mexico that draw upon the services of California's trucking,
management, warehousing, and service industries. (International Trade
Administration, U.S.  Exports to Mexico:  A State-by-State Overview
(Washington, D.C.:  U.S.  Department of Commerce, April 1993), p. 
34.) The NAFTA is projected to directly generate nearly 50,000 new
jobs in California over the next ten years and to support tens of
thousands more.
<P>
          The opportunities of the Mexican market extend across the
business spectrum. Over the past five years, California's exports have
increased 489 percent in the food products sector, 382 percent in
transportation equipment, 248 percent in electric and electronic
equipment, 244 percent in chemical products, 169 percent in industrial
machinery and computers, and 548 percent in apparel.
<P>
          Specific examples are even more revealing. Cal-State Lumber
Sales' business in Mexico has increased by 700 percent in recent
years, allowing the company to increase its work force in California
by 30 percent. (U.S.  Council of the Mexico-U.S.  Business Committee,
The Impact of the NAFTA on California, prepared for The Trade
Partnership, Washington, D.C., September, 1992, p.  5.) The positive
impact on jobs extends beyond the company's own payroll. According to
the company's Director of International Relations, Mary Alice Acevedo,
"We buy lumber from several mills; our purchases have helped the mills
keep U.S. workers on the job."
<P>
          Another example is SJS Products, which distributes U.S.
manufactured electro-mechanical products. This company faced sizeable
layoffs beginning in 1990 because of the economic recession. SJS at
that time turned to Mexico to expand its sales and, according to
William McGillivray, Director of Sales for the Company, "We have not
had to lay off one person since our involvement in Mexico. And all the
products we export to Mexico are 100 percent U.S. manufactured."
(Ibid.) 
<P>
           Free trade with Mexico has economic benefits that go beyond
job creation. One of the most important is allowing U.S. companies to
remain internationally competitive through an arrangement in which
some of their production is shifted to Mexico. Called co-production,
this technique is criticized for losing jobs to Mexico. However, co-
production arrangements actually create jobs in those U.S. branches
which supply the components and services for a company's Mexican
operations. As important, such measures save existing U.S. jobs by
making American companies more efficient and better able to face
increasing international competition, especially from the Japanese who
also use co-production in Southeast Asia and elsewhere.
<P>
          Businessmen typically are more far-sighted about Mexico's
opportunities than are NAFTA critics. Especially important is the
realization that, given that 70 percent of Mexico's imports come from
the United States, increasing prosperity there quickly translates into
increased sales for U.S. companies. Leonard Rabinowitz, the co-
Chairman of Carole Little Inc., an apparel manufacturer in Los
Angeles, says: "People's fear that this trade agreement is a license
to give away American jobs is ludicrous. They're not looking at the
big picture. By providing jobs in Mexico, we can create a better
marketplace there for American-made products." ("Thumbs Up for NAFTA,"
Women's Wear Daily, August 19, 1992.)
<P>
          Given the strong backing of the trade agreement by the
state's business community, it is not surprising that California
Governor Pete Wilson is a committed supporter of the NAFTA. He has
worked closely with the state's many businesses, and the California
trade promotion office is one of the nation's most aggressive.
Wilson's reasons for backing the agreement are straightforward:
"Commerce between the United States and Mexico freed of the
constraints of tariff and non-tariff barriers means increased trade,
and increased trade translates into vitally needed jobs on both side
of the border." Because of Mexico's recent trade liberalization,
"between 1987 and 1990, California's exports to Mexico more than
doubled -- creating tens of thousands of new jobs."
<P>
          California's two Senators, however, do not share these
views. Barbara Boxer campaigned on an anti-NAFTA platform, giving as
her principal reason the loss of jobs that the agreement supposedly
would produce. Similarly, Dianne Feinstein has voiced serious
reservations about the agreement, again largely related to the feared
negative effects on employment. And in California's House delegation,
several representatives have taken an anti-NAFTA stance, most
justifying their position as a defense of jobs. Among them: Republican
Duncan Hunter and Democrats Bob Filner, Dan Hamburg, and George
Miller.

<P>
Texas
<P>
     Governor Ann Richards is one of the strongest supporters of the
North American Free Trade Agreement, because the Texas economy is so
strongly connected to Mexico's economy. In 1992 Texas exported over
$18 billion worth of goods to Mexico. According to the United States
Trade Representative's office, 148,000 jobs in Texas are directly
dependent on exports to Mexico, and another 23,510 jobs are supported
by co-production operations in Mexico. ("Production-sharing" includes
maquiladoras as well as other businesses that use U.S.  parts and
components in production in Mexico. )
<P>
          Texas exports range from consumer goods to capital
equipment. Tecnol Medical Products, Inc., a Fort Worth-based
manufacturer of disposable medical products, employs 850 people with
annual sales of $75 million. Tecnol expects its sales to Mexico to
grow by 100 percent in 1993 to $150 million. Omnitrition
International, Inc., of Carrollton, Texas, sold over $5 million in
nutritional and personal care products last year in Mexico through its
40,000 distributors there. (Statement from the State of Texas
Department of Commerce, April 28, 1993.)
<P>
          Service companies based in Texas are also taking advantage
of increased business activity in Mexico. According to Robert L.
Herchert, President and CEO of Freese & Nichols, a consulting
engineering company from Fort Worth, "Mexico has become a very good
market for engineering services and environmental-related operations.
Mexico is currently our fastest growing export market. We believe this
trade agreement will not only enhance but also sustain our domestic
economic growth. Specifically, NAFTA will create new jobs for the U.S.
economy and achieve real liberalization in services and intellectual
property rights protection." (Ibid.)
<P>
          Small Texas businesses will benefit the most from a NAFTA.
The reason: the trade agreement will reduce the costs of transacting
business across the U.S.-Mexican border. For example, CEO Eusebio
Compian of American Ice Machines Inc., based in Houston, believes that
"traditional cumbersome bureaucracy on both sides of the border
hampers the completion of business transactions." According to
Compian, "passage of the NAFTA is a necessary tool to simplify,
enhance, and increase future business between our two countries. A
small firm like ours [over $1.5 million in sales per year] would
benefit greatly from the passage of this legislation." (Ibid.)
<P>NAFTA SUPPORT IN AMERICA'S HEARTLAND
 <P>    The opposition to the NAFTA within California's congressional
delegation is unusual among the border states. In the others --
Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas -- the governors' support for the NAFTA
is matched by that of their congressional delegations. Governor Ann
Richards, an especially vocal supporter of the NAFTA, captures the
pro-NAFTA spirit of the border states well: "For Texans, the
successful conclusion of the Free Trade Agreement cannot be
overestimated. NAFTA will have an enormous impact on our economy,
putting us literally in the geographic center of a hemispheric trade
zone, one that is 25 percent larger than the European Economic
Community." (Statement by Governor Ann W.  Richards of Texas on the
signing of the NAFTA, August 12, 1992.)
<P>
          Strong bipartisan support for NAFTA in such border states as
Texas is often dismissed by critics as being the result of regional
self-interest because this area generally is considered as having the
most to gain from increased trade with Mexico.
<P>
          However, some of the strongest supporters of the NAFTA are
located in the Midwest, the very heartland of U.S. manufacturing that
NAFTA opponents allege will be devastated by Mexican competition. The
governors of the industrial states of Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana,
Michigan, and Ohio all are strong supporters of the NAFTA.

<P>
Michigan
<P>
     Of these, Michigan is the most interesting case, for the state is
depicted routinely as a certain loser from the NAFTA, and its
congressional delegation leads the opposition to the agreement.
However, according to the Michigan Department of Commerce, by 1992 the
state's rapidly increasing exports to Mexico had actually generated
31,000 jobs, double the amount of Mexico-related jobs that existed in
Michigan only five years ago. And those exports were largely
manufactured products, most prominently fabricated metal products,
transportation equipment, industrial machinery, and other capital
goods.
<P>
          The opening of the Mexican market has had a strongly
positive impact across the range of Michigan's manufacturing
industries. For example, Detroit Diesel Corporation of Lansing
increased exports to Mexico by 80 percent from 1991 to 1992.
Employment directly related to Diesel's Mexican sales increased 46
percent, representing 26 percent of all new hiring in Diesel's
Michigan operations. (J.  Nancy Martin, Detroit Diesel Corporation, in
letter to Export Development Authority, February, 18, 1993.)
<P>
          Haworth Corporation is a furniture manufacturer in Holland,
Michigan, that employs 4,000 U.S. workers, 3,500 of them in Michigan.
Haworth President and CEO Richard Haworth claims that he supports
NAFTA because his shipments to Mexico have increased tenfold in the
last two years. The reason: Business growth in Mexico increased demand
for office furniture. Says Haworth, "With Mexican tariff rates of 15
to 20 percent for U.S. office furniture products being phased out
[under NAFTA] we anticipate significant progress and growth for the
next several years." ("Haworth Inc., Voices Support for North American
Free Trade Agreement," press release, Haworth Corporation, March
1993.)
<P>
          In addition to manufactured products, the reduction of
Mexican trade barriers has also led to dramatic increases sales of
consumer products by Michigan companies. Steelcase Inc., Amway
Corporation, Gerber Products Corp., Kitchenaid, and Vlasic Foods are
only a few of the Michigan businesses which have found new markets in
Mexico's rapidly expanding middle class. 
<P>
           As in California, the business community's enthusiasm for
NAFTA is reflected in the governor's outspoken support for the
agreement. According to Governor John Engler, although Michigan "is
more than a thousand miles from the border, only California and Texas
export more goods to Mexico than does Michigan. Among the foreign
nations with which we trade, Mexico is our second largest export
customer." (Statement by Governor John Engler on NAFTA, May 27, 1993.)
And the benefits are concrete. Says Engler: "31,000 jobs depend
directly on trade with Mexico. In 1991, Michigan companies sold their
products to Mexican customers at the rate of $180,000 an hour -- and
that added up to $1.6 billion by the end of the year. Today [1993]
Michigan exports to Mexico are fast approaching $2 billion a year."
(Statement by Governor John Engler on NAFTA, May 20, 1993.)U.S.
Department of Commerce figures and analysis conducted by the
Governor's own state economic development agency back him up: Over the
past five years food product exports are up by 3,719 percent; textiles
up by 2,975 percent; furniture and fixtures up by 1,509 percent;
electric and electronic equipment up by 363 percent.
<P>
          Engler also challenges organized labor's opposition to the
NAFTA, saying that they "should understand that if cheap labor were
the key to company location, then Vietnam or Somalia would be
manufacturing meccas. They are not. Our location, knowledge
infrastructure, and workers' skill level give us what I believe is the
'Michigan Advantage' -- and NAFTA will strengthen our advantages even
more. We in Michigan should be concerned about union opposition
because if NAFTA is not ratified, it will cost us jobs here in
Michigan."
<P>
          Governor Engler's strong advocacy is in sharp contrast to
Michigan's congressional delegation. Although Michigan will be a big
winner under the NAFTA, most of the Michigan delegation remains
opposed to it. In particular, Senator Donald Riegle and Congressman
John Dingell and strong allies of organized labor vocally oppose the
NAFTA. Senator Carl Levin voted in May 1991 against giving the
President the "fast-track" authority to negotiate trade agreements
such as the NAFTA, and has expressed serious misgivings about the
pact. Levin, who receives considerable financial support from
organized labor, also opposed the 1988 U.S.-Canada Free Trade
Agreement, the precursor to the NAFTA. Today, however, his state
employs 234,000 people in jobs directly dependent on exports to
Canada.
<P>
          The industry most closely associated with Michigan is
automobiles, one which it shares with a number of states. Critics of
the NAFTA charge that Mexico's cheap labor will devastate employment
in the U.S. automobile industry. U.S. companies supposedly will now
move their plants south to take advantage of cheaper Mexican labor. 
<P>
           However, far from devastating the industry in the U.S., the
NAFTA will open a range of new opportunities. It is the Mexican
automobile and auto parts market, not that of the U.S., which has long
been shut tight against foreign competition. As Governor Engler noted
in meetings with Mexican officials last March, an American-made
Oldsmobile now costs $50,000 in Mexico because of import restrictions.
Any opening of the Mexican market would only increase the potential
for U.S. exports to that country. In fact, the reduction of Mexican
trade barriers since 1986 has increased the number of U.S. jobs
directly supported by exports of automobiles and automobile parts to
Mexico from around 12,000 to 75,000.
<P>
          As impressive as that number is, it is much smaller than it
could be because of Mexico's remaining protectionist policies on
automobiles. For example, last year fewer than 20,000 of the 300,000
automobiles sold in Mexico were manufactured in the U.S. However, the
NAFTA could raise that total to one million in sales annually by
forcing Mexico to eliminate its export performance laws, remove the
domestic content rules that require U.S. car manufacturers to use
Mexican parts for cars made in Mexico and cut in half tariffs on U.S.
cars and light trucks. (Alan Reynolds, "Opposition to Free Trade Hurts
U.S.  Industry," Detroit News, April 7, 1992, p.  3B.)
<P>
          Although the U.S. automobile companies likely will continue
relocating some of their existing operations to Mexico, the jobs lost
will be more than offset by a net gain in employment from the export
of automobiles and parts. Engler adds that U.S. automobile exports to
Mexico easily could double once Mexican barriers are removed. His
estimate is supported by General Motors Executive Vice President
William Hoglund who notes that the U.S. Department of Commerce
projects that the Big Three U.S. auto makers -- General Motors, Ford,
and Chrysler -- should increase their exports to Mexico by $1 billion
the first year after NAFTA is implemented, meaning 15,000 new jobs.
<P>
          As in other industries, the benefits of the NAFTA to the car
companies stem not only from increased exports, but also from
efficiency to be gained through co-production. Although Ford and its
U.S. workers will benefit from the increased sale of U.S.-manufactured
cars in Mexico, Ford also will be able to use its Mexican operations
to remain competitive against European and Asian rivals. Through
existing "production-sharing" arrangements, Ford makes most of the
components for its small cars and trucks in Michigan. These include
brakes, fuel tanks, and electronic components for instrument panels.
For every car Ford produces in Mexico, three-fourths of the components
originate from U.S. plants. Without its co-production facilities in
Mexico, Ford could not remain competitive with Japanese small car and
truck imports and those jobs in Michigan would be lost. Similarly, for
GM, 15,000 of its U.S. jobs are due to its current exports to Mexico.
In Michigan alone, 72,000 jobs in a range of industries are connected
to this type of "production-sharing" with Mexico, which the NAFTA will
increase to over 75,000. (Border Trade Alliance, op.  cit.)
<P>

Ohio
<P>
     Ohio's two Senators strongly oppose the NAFTA. According to
Howard Metzenbaum, if the NAFTA is adopted, "thousands more American
manufacturers will flee the U.S. to exploit Mexico's lax labor and
environmental protections." Metzenbaum's opposition to the NAFTA is
consistent with his earlier opposition to the U.S.-Canada Free Trade
Agreement. Yet, according to the U.S. Trade Representative's office,
exports from Ohio to Canada and Mexico have created an estimated
170,000 jobs in the state.
<P>
          Senator John Glenn also has expressed similar concerns about
massive job loss. Yet, exports to Mexico over the past five years have
risen dramatically: 1,622 percent in paper products, 412 percent in
rubber and plastic products, 186 percent in industrial machinery and
computers, and 181 percent in fabricated metal products. These have
already created 15,000 jobs in Ohio. (U.S.  Council of the Mexico-U.S. 
Business Committee, The Impact of the North American Free Trade
Agreement on Ohio, prepared for The Trade Partnership, Washington,
D.C., September, 1992, p.  2.) The Border Trade Alliance estimates the
total will quickly jump to over 60,000 under the NAFTA. (Ibid.) Well-
known companies like the Mead Corporation, Procter & Gamble, and
Anchor Tool & Die -- all operating from Ohio -- have already
benefitted from liberalized trade with Mexico over the last five
years. Procter & Gamble says their exports to Mexico alone support
1,500 jobs in the U.S., and estimates the NAFTA will create an
additional 2,000. (Ibid., p.  5.)
<P>
          The automobile industry is important in Ohio as well. As
with Ford, General Motors' Mexican operations will allow the company
to compete against low-cost Asian imports and will increase employment
in those U.S. plants which supply components. GM's Packard Electric
Division has been able to add component manufacturing jobs at its
Warren, Ohio, plant because of exports to its subassembly facilities
in Mexico. Of less interest to Ohio's citizens, but nevertheless
significant, is the fact that Packard Electric has also opened a
components manufacturing plant in Mississippi to service its Mexican
operations.
<P>
          Despite the predictions of doom from the congressional
delegation, Ohio Governor George Voinovich is a strong supporter of
NAFTA because he has traced one in seven manufacturing jobs in Ohio to
exports, many of those to Mexico.

<P>
Illinois
<P>
     Governor Jim Edgar of Illinois also supports the NAFTA. Says
Edgar: Passage of the NAFTA will mean "thousands of jobs for Illinois
and an economic boost for our state, particularly in the long term.
Illinois exports to Mexico have more than tripled in the last five
years, and the elimination of trade barriers will mean our businesses
and their workers can continue to prosper from that trend." (Governor
Jim Edgar, "Remarks on Free Trade, 1992 Republican National
Convention," August 17, 1992.)
<P>
          Edgar's support is well-founded. Since he took office in
1990, Illinois' exports to Mexico have grown 137 percent, and Mexico
is now its second-largest export market. Exports have increased
enormously over the past five years: in food products by 2,080
percent, in fabricated metal products, 1,133 percent, in primary
metals, 966 percent, and in transportation equipment, 638 percent.
(U.S.  Exports to Mexico:  A State-by-State Overview, op.  cit.) In
1992, 30,000 Illinois jobs were directly attributable to exports to
Mexico, over 15,000 of those being added during Edgar's tenure.
Another 84,000 jobs in Illinois are linked with production-sharing
operations in Mexico in industrial machinery and computers, electric
and transportation equipment, and chemicals. Chicago-based Sears,
Roebuck & Company has opened several stores in Mexico in anticipation
of the growing consumer market under NAFTA; also in Chicago, Baxter
International's exports of medical equipment have increased 60 percent
since 1988 as Mexico's tariffs on medical products have come down.
<P>
          In testimony before the U.S. International Trade Commission,
William Lane of Peoria-based Caterpillar explained the multiplier
effect on employment in exporting Caterpillar equipment to Mexico:
"Cat's 1990 exports to Mexico generated work for about 900 U.S.
Caterpillar employees and 1,800 employees at the company's American
suppliers. I should point out that most of this work was performed at
Cat facilities in Illinois, Indiana, and Pennsylvania." (William G. 
Lane, International Governmental Affairs Representative for
Caterpillar Inc.,"Probable Economic Effects on U.S.  Industries and
Consumers of a Free Trade Agreement Between the United States and
Mexico."  Statement before the International Trade Commission,
Chicago, Illinois, April 10, 1991.) Estimates are that over 10,000 new
jobs will be created over the next ten years in Illinois, directly
connected to exports to Mexico. (Border Trade Alliance, op.  cit.)
<P>
          Illinois will also benefit from the NAFTA because of its
location along the Mississippi River. As North-South commerce
increases, towns like Granite City will benefit. According to Bob
Wydra, General Manager of the Tri-City Regional Port District in
Granite City, their three million tons of annual shipments to Mexico
have created approximately 5,000 jobs in Illinois. Throughout the next
decade, Tri-City officials expect increased trade with Mexico to
create and sustain thousands of jobs as cost-effective modes of
transportation and development. (Statement from Bob Wydra, General
Manager of Tri-City Regional Port District, May 4, 1993.)
<P>
          U.S. financial services and insurance firms, formerly
excluded from the Mexican market, will be allowed to operate freely
there under the NAFTA. The financial services industry is a sector in
which Illinois companies have an enormous competitive advantage.
Chicago-based Allstate and State Farm Life Insurance companies, along
with Kemper Corporation, will be able to participate in what is a $3.5
billion and rapidly growing market in Mexico. Continental Bank
Corporation Vice-Chairman Richard Huber expects his $1 billion trade-
related financings to double two years after NAFTA is implemented. 
(State of Illinois, Washington office.)
<P>
          Navistar International, a Chicago based truck manufacturer,
entered into a long-term cooperative agreement with Dina Camiones
S.A., the largest Mexican manufacturer of medium and heavy duty
trucks. According to Navistar, in 1989 Dina bought $6 million worth of
components. In 1990, that figure swelled to $30 million, and in 1992,
the Mexican company purchased $100 million from its U.S. partner. Paul
Roseland, the Vice President of Manufacturing for Navistar asserts
that "As the Mexican economy continues to improve and investment in
industrial infrastructure moves ahead, Mexican business will require a
growing number of trucks -- that means good business for us." 
<P>
           Despite this broadly positive economic impact on Illinois,
both Illinois Senators -- Carol Mosely-Braun and Paul Simon -- are
lukewarm on the NAFTA and several Congressmen oppose the accord. They
have focused on predictions by opponents that companies such as Zenith
will move their operations to Mexico, thereby displacing U.S. workers.
However, Zenith Chairman Jerry Pearlman predicts new jobs will be
created for Zenith's television-tube producing plants. Co-production
between Zenith's U.S. and Mexican operations will reduce costs and
make Zenith's televisions less expensive than Asian ones which are
currently assembled in Mexico with Asian components and sold in the
U.S. <P>
 SUPPORT IN OTHER STATES<P>
     Beyond the industrial Midwest, governors from states as
economically and geographically diverse as Arkansas, Colorado,
Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, North Dakota, Rhode Island, and
Washington are as supportive of the NAFTA. And yet opposition to the
agreement often features prominently in their congressional
delegations.<P>
North Carolina and South Carolina<P>
     North Carolina and South Carolina are a case in point. North
Carolina Democratic Governor Jim Hunt and South Carolina Republican
Governor Carroll Campbell both support the agreement. Both governors
work closely with their state development offices to spur exports from
such diverse industries as textiles, chemicals, industrial machinery,
and transportation equipment. Companies across the range of industry,
such as Tyson Foods, Northern Telecom, Kimberly-Clark, Mount Vernon
Mills, and Monsanto have increased exports to Mexico and hope to
improve that record under the NAFTA.
<P>
          But the three Republicans and one Democrat that comprise the
Senate delegation from those states oppose the agreement. Their
political antennae have been oriented toward the politically powerful
apparel industry in both states that may experience minor losses in
employment because of Mexican competition under the NAFTA. But a focus
on this sector to the exclusion of the statewide benefits to be gained
by other industries ignores the fact that exports to Mexico have
already grown 249 percent in North Carolina and 191 percent in South
Carolina since 1987. Exports to Mexico already have created 8,500 jobs
in North Carolina and 2,500 in South Carolina. North Carolina's
furniture exports are up by 6,813 percent and transportation equipment
by 1,359 percent over the past five years.. Over the same period South
Carolina's fabricated metal exports rose by 1,222 percent, paper
products by 844 percent, and electric and electronic equipment by 476
percent.
<P>
          Surprisingly, the Senators' opposition also overlooks
NAFTA's benefits to the textile industry. Many in the industry fear
Mexican competition, but in reality Mexico's market would be more
closed without the NAFTA. As Kin Cobb of Stonecutter Mills Corporation
of Spindale, North Carolina, says, "I'm in the yarn department, and we
haven't done much business with Mexico because we are unable to be
competitive with [their] high barriers. When barriers go down, the
yarn portion of our company can then do business in Mexico."
(Statement from Kin Cobb, Stonecutter Mills Corporation, May 1, 1993.)
In fact, Mexican government figures show that imports of U.S. textiles
have risen 26 percent in the past two years, reaching $1.6 billion in
1992, with an $81 million U.S. surplus. (Estadsticas Anuales,
Direccin General de Inversin Extranjera (SECOFI), 1992.) North
Carolina's textile and apparel exports rose 946 percent and 524
percent respectively since 1987 and South Carolina's by similar
amounts. Far from planning to ravage the U.S. market, the Mexican
textile industry is in a deep recession, and its owners and workers
alike fear being swept away by U.S. competitors once the market is
opened by the NAFTA.

<P>
Wisconsin
<P>
     Of all the states to support a free trade agreement with Mexico,
Wisconsin is one of the most unlikely. Located far from Mexico's
borders, it has few long-standing historical, political, and
commercial ties to that country. Nonetheless, Governor Tommy Thompson
has been quick to recognize the commercial opportunities for his state
under a NAFTA and outspoken in his support of the agreement. Governor
Thompson led a delegation of Wisconsin businessmen to Mexico toward
the end of last year. Said Thompson: "In the five short days of the
mission, Wisconsin companies were able to lay the groundwork for
promising business deals... in everything from milking and farm
equipment to Christmas trees."
<P>
          According to Carlos O. Rioja, Export Director for Wisconsin-
based Oshkosh Truck Corporation, the NAFTA would provide both added
job security and better relations with his company's trading partners.
"If the Mexican and Canadian economies improve [as a result of the
NAFTA], they will be capable of buying more Oshkosh Truck products."
This business was a result of a November 1989 trade mission to Mexico
led by Governor Thompson. At that time, Oshkosh Truck Corporation was
able to identify and conclude their first-ever contract with a Mexican
company, worth approximately $1.2 million. (Statement from Carlos O. 
Rioja, Export Director, Oshkosh Truck Corporation, May 3, 1993.) The
Paper Converting Machine Company of Green Bay also has experienced
significant growth in its business with Mexico. In 1989 paper
shipments to Mexico totaled $2,600,000. By 1992 shipments to Mexico
reached $14,400,000. (Statement from Paul DeCaster, Manager of
Marketing, Paper Converting Machine Company, April 30, 1993.)
<P>
          Elizabeth Dubman, Manager of Market Development for Polar
Ware Company in Sheboygan states that Polar Ware exports to Mexico
grew 200 percent in the last eighteen months alone. Dubman has
concluded that "there are significant growth opportunities and we are
continuing to aggressively focus to expand distribution in Mexico."
(Statement from Elizabeth Dunman, May 7, 1993.)

<P>
Maryland
<P>
     Maryland Governor William Donald Schaefer has been a strong
supporter of the NAFTA, regarding it as essential if his state's
businesses are to remain internationally competitive. Maryland's
exports to Mexico have increased at an average annual rate of 44
percent since 1987.  (U.S.  Council of the Mexico-U.S.  Business
Committee, The Impact of the NAFTA on Maryland, prepared for The Trade
Partnership, Washington, D.C., September, 1992, p.  1.)Under the
NAFTA, Maryland-based insurers GEICO Corporation and USF&G will have
access to Mexico's insurance industry, which previously was closed to
foreigners. The NAFTA will also benefit Maryland companies like GSM
Industries that produce oil and gasfield equipment, because the
agreement forces Mexico's state-owned electricity and petroleum
monopolies to adopt competitive bidding practices and accept bids from
U.S. companies on an equal basis. Mexico's $6 billion
telecommunications industry will be fully opened to U.S.
telecommunications manufacturers and services companies when the NAFTA
becomes law, expanding opportunities for Maryland's Bendix Corp.
Microlog Corp.,and Western Electric Company. (Directory of American
Firms Operating in Foreign Countries, Vol.  3, 12th ed.  (New York: 
World Trade Academy Press, 1991); Greater Cleveland Growth
Association, The Greater Cleveland International Trade Directory,
1992-93. ) To spur Maryland exports to Mexico, Schaefer's department
of commerce has sent several successful delegations of businesses to
Mexico in recent years. In an April 21 speech to the Southern
Governors Association, Schaefer called for passage of the NAFTA and
advocated extending the NAFTA to include countries in Central and
South America.
<P>
          Contrasted to Schaefer's support for the NAFTA is the
opposition by Maryland's two Senators: Barbara Mikulski and Paul
Sarbanes. Once again, the principal reason given for their opposition
is the feared negative impact on employment; but unlike Schaefer,
neither has visited Mexico with businesses from the state. Nor do
these Senators fully appreciate the NAFTA will create jobs for
Maryland's insurance, oil equipment, and telecommunications
industries.<P>
Colorado<P>
     Democrat Governor Roy Romer is a strong supporter of the NAFTA.
Since Mexico began opening its economy in 1987, Colorado's exports to
it have increased by 118 percent, from $69 million to $151 million.
(U.S.  Exports to Mexico, op.  cit., p.  36.) As in many other Western
states, the NAFTA will stimulate jobs in services industries in
Colorado that will grow with the expansion of North-South commercial
activity. According to Eric Miller, Executive Vice President of
Blackfox Investment Group in Denver, Colorado, "With Denver on the
Rocky Mountain Ridge, we should focus on North-South trade instead of
East-West. That is the future of this area. Denver becomes a
distribution base for Mexican companies wanting access to U.S. markets
and similarly for Canada." ("Selling South of the Border:  Some
Colorado Businesses Already Have Made the Move to Mexico, but Others
May Need to Hustle for a Piece of the Action," Colorado Business, Vol. 
19, No.  11, p.  43.) Other Western states like Utah, Arizona, and New
Mexico also are looking to develop more sophisticated transportation,
warehousing, and delivery systems along several corridors connecting
Mexico with Canada.
<P>
           Governor Romer is working with Colorado's mining,
agricultural, and high-tech industries to locate markets in Mexico.
According to Nat Bostwick, a former official with the Colorado state
development office who now works for John Clark Inc., a mining
equipment manufacturer in Colorado which does business in Mexico,
"Mexico is one of the largest mining countries in the world. All of
the [U.S. mining] companies are doing business through joint ventures.
Mexico has gone from one of the most protected markets to virtually
free trade."  (Ibid.)
<P>
          Another area for U.S. markets is Mexico's growing consumer
base. Gerry Baby Products Corporation has been taking advantage of
this market by selling since 1988 the car seats, strollers, carriers,
and cribs it manufactures in Colorado to Mexico. Gerry expects annual
sales to grow by 15 percent in the coming years because of Mexico's
insatiable demand for U.S. consumer products among its growing middle
class. (U.S.  Council of the Mexico-U.S.  Business Committee, The
Impact of the NAFTA on Colorado, prepared for The Trade Partnership,
Washington, D.C., September, 1992, p.  5.) Jerry Busto, President of
Jerry's Discount Auto Repair and Emission Testing Corporation, also
sees a growing market for auto piston seals it manufactures in Denver
and is now exporting to Mexico. According to Busto, "Many people in
Mexico need our product because they drive cars with worn-out diesel-
powered engines that use greater than normal amounts of fuel." (Linda
Walker, "Local Firm Develops Ties With Mexico," Rocky Mountain News,
March 1, 1992.)
<P>
          In states like Colorado, jobs created under production-
sharing operations between U.S. manufacturers and Mexican assembly
operations are growing. Denver-based Samsonite Corporation, which
employs 1,100 workers in Colorado, is a typical example of how U.S.
companies are using Mexico to remain internationally competitive while
keeping jobs in the U.S. According to Tom Leonard, President of
Samsonite USA, its luggage assembly operations in Nogales, Mexico,
support 100 jobs at the Samsonite's Tucson Arizona facility, another
187 jobs employed by Samsonite's 64 domestic suppliers located in
eighteen states. Says Leonard, "Samsonite's production-sharing
operation in Nogales is essential to our competitive position, giving
us an advantage over competitors, whose operations are in Southeast
Asia, both in terms of quality and design protection." (The Impact of
the NAFTA on Colorado, op.  cit., p.9.)

<P>
THE ROLE OF THE SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS
<P>
     Environmental organizations opposed to the NAFTA have been
especially active in Congress, but the most powerful anti-NAFTA
lobbyists in Washington are those of organized labor. The reason for
organized labor's opposition to the NAFTA is that, although virtually
every study indicates that overall U.S. employment will expand from
freer trade with Mexico, there will inevitably be some job
dislocations, particularly in those industries which are the most
heavily protected and often the most heavily unionized. Thus,
organized labor's opposition stems not from a concern for the general
welfare of the American people, but for the interests of its own
members.
<P>
          The most vocal opponents of the NAFTA in the Congress are
those most closely associated with organized labor, which is quick to
reward those it favors with generous campaign financing. For example,
Ohio's Senator Metzenbaum received $602,000 in direct contributions
from labor PACs in the 1986-1992 period. ("Federal Election Campaign
Reports," Almanac of American Politics (Washington, D.C.:  The
National Journal), pp.  2-3.) During the same period, Senators Riegle
and Levin from Michigan netted over $470,000 and $678,000
respectively. (Ibid., p.  2.) These figures include only direct
payments and do not include the often much larger indirect
contributions and support operations. Although he faces a primary
challenge in 1994, Senator Riegle has already been endorsed by the
AFL-CIO, with the union's Michigan President Frank Garrison saying
that the organization "is going to make damn sure Don Riegle is re-
elected." ("Survivor Riegle gets labor backing as Dem.," The Observer,
February 11, 1993, p.  17A.)
<P>
          A cross-referencing of the most active anti-NAFTA Senators
and Congressmen with a list of the recipients of large campaign
contributions from organized labor reveals a remarkable overlap. Of
the top forty recipients of labor campaign contributions, for example,
90 percent oppose the NAFTA. To be sure, ideological affinity accounts
for most of this, as those most closely associated with organized
labor usually are also philosophically opposed to free trade. But it
also clearly demonstrates that there are more material incentives at
work to help the representatives toe the line. This understandable
attentiveness to the concerns of their most important backers,
however, does put these members of Congress at odds with the interests
of their states. In fact, an unusually high proportion of the funding
for Metzenbaum's 1988 record-setting campaign came from out-of-state
contributions. (Paul Furiga, "Most Metzenbaum Funds Are From Non-
Ohioans," The Repository (Canton), August 25, 1988, p.  H6.)
<P>
          Because of the NAFTA's demonstrably positive impact on the
general welfare and strong support throughout the local economy,
organized labor's clout at the state level has not been sufficient to
force a governor into open opposition to the NAFTA. But it has
persuaded some governors to temporize their endorsements. Such is the
case of New York's Governor Mario Cuomo. Exports to Mexico of
manufactured goods have created over 23,000 jobs for New Yorkers over
the past five years, and they are growing rapidly. (Border Trade
Alliance, op.  cit.) In addition, New York's enormous financial
community will be among the biggest beneficiaries of the NAFTA as the
trade pact forces Mexico's formerly closed financial sector to open to
American competition. Exports are up in all categories. Even such
unlikely exporters as New York's apple growers, which formerly were
effectively excluded from Mexico's market because of tariff walls,
have benefitted from Mexico's opening and see the NAFTA as the only
way to ensure their long-term access to that growing market.
<P>
          Despite the agreement's beneficial impact on New York,
however, the normally outspoken Cuomo has been surprisingly reticent
regarding the NAFTA. His silence is not attributable to a lack of
information, as his own state development agency has been quite active
in promoting business in Mexico and has kept his office informed
regarding the strong support for the NAFTA among the state's
businesses. Nor is he opposed to free trade: He has repeatedly
protested against "Japan-bashing," being fully aware of the importance
of Japan's market for New York's businesses. Instead, the reason for
his reluctance to openly support the NAFTA presumably lies in Cuomo's
close relations with organized labor, which has long been generous to
his campaigns. 
<P>
           Mario Cuomo is not the only governor whose national
political ambitions have produced an equivocal attitude toward the
NAFTA. Their impact on positions toward the NAFTA can be seen in
President Clinton's own evolving views. As governor of Arkansas, Bill
Clinton was a strong supporter of free trade with Mexico. However, in
his presidential campaign, Clinton's interests shifted to a national
audience, leading him to pursue the votes and financial resources of
the Democratic Party's core constituencies, especially organized
labor. As a result, he conditioned his support of the NAFTA on the
negotiation of supplemental agreements on environmental and labor
issues.

<P>
NAFTA: AN ENGINE FOR SMALL BUSINESS GROWTH
<P>
     Small and medium-sized businesses are critically important for
generating new jobs in America. Over 80 percent of new job growth
during the 1980s was seen among small and medium-sized businesses.
Moreover, Mexico is a very important market for small businesses
because its proximity and its existing trade relations with the U.S.
make doing business in Mexico less costly for small businesses. 
<P>
           Saniserve Corporation is a typical example of the
importance of Mexico for small and medium-sized businesses. Based in
Indianapolis, Saniserve is an ice cream machine manufacturer that
employs 130 people. Last year Saniserve sold $490,000 worth of
equipment to Mexico, and expects sales to grow to $650,000 this year.
According to Saniserve's CEO Gabriel Aguirre, seventeen of his
employees would lose their jobs if not for exports to Mexico. Says
Aguirre, "If this continues I know I'll have to hire more people."
(Statement from Gabriel Aguirre, April 21, 1993.) Aguirre plans to
increase plant capacity in Indianapolis to keep up with rising exports
to Mexico.
<P>
          On a smaller scale, Air Hydraulics Incorporated, based in
Jackson, Michigan, employs seventeen workers in the manufacture of
presses and impact machines. President Michael Clark has worked
closely with the Michigan state development office to boost his
exports to Mexico. Says Clark, "NAFTA will make it possible for the
average Mexican-owned facility to purchase machines and industrial
products from the United States. Without NAFTA, only the large Mexican
multinational corporations would be real prospects." Within three
years Clark expects sales to Mexico to comprise 25 percent of his
output. "Without NAFTA we will not have a strong export program into
Mexico or Latin America. Without NAFTA we stay domestic and stagnate."
(Statement from Michael Clark, April 29, 1993.. )
<P>
          Chicago-based Summit Industries, a small producer of x-ray
machines, has expanded exports to Mexico by 500 percent since 1987.
Another small business dependent on exports to Mexico is Snider Mold
Company of Mequon, Wisconsin. Snider Mold employs 45 people in high-
paying jobs manufacturing moldings. It has tripled in size in the last
six years, largely because of its increases in exports to Mexico
(today 25 percent of their products are sold in Mexico). (Statement
from James Meinert, Director of International Marketing, Snider Mold
Company, April 30, 1993.) At present, Snider faces a 20 percent
Mexican tariff, which will be eliminated by the NAFTA. Thus, the free
trade pact will be a boon for this small company's sales to Mexico.

<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
     Senator Bill Bradley has termed the passage of the NAFTA
President Clinton's most important foreign policy priority. This
centerpiece of U.S. policy toward Latin America and international
trade, however, has encountered tough and increasing opposition on
Capitol Hill. A panoply of interest groups opposed to free trade --
labor unions, environmental organizations, and leftist activists --
have mounted an aggressive, no-holds-barred campaign to defeat the
agreement or so radically alter it as to erect new and imposing
barriers to U.S.-Mexico trade.
<P>
          The climate of fear which has been successfully and
skillfully cultivated in the Congress, now constitutes the single
greatest obstacle to congressional approval of the NAFTA. The
individual legislator faces political pressures from environmental,
labor, and other interest groups. This pressure is distracting
Congress from its duty to protect the general welfare not only of the
nation, but if pro-NAFTA sentiments are to be believed, the individual
states as well. The undoing of what was once regarded as virtually a
done deal would represent a triumph of special interests over the
general welfare of the American people.
<P>
          As far as the NAFTA's impact on the economy, the facts speak
for themselves: No independent study supports the endlessly varied
contentions of NAFTA's opponents that the removal of the artificial
and cumbersome trade barriers with Mexico will harm the U.S. All of
the non-partisan public and private studies agree that the benefits
will be overwhelmingly positive and that not armies of unemployed
workers but hundreds of thousands of new jobs will be created.
<P>
          This is why nearly all of America's governors endorse the
NAFTA. Democrat as well as Republican governors have experienced first
hand the powerful impact of Mexico's opening markets on their state's
economy. Moreover, having seen the results, they want more of the same
as soon as possible. More attentive to and informed about their
states' welfare than any member of Congress could be, America's
governors are frustrated and mystified by Congress's opposition to the
NAFTA. 
<P>
           In a very real sense, NAFTA is a victim of the continuing
erosion of federalism -- of the steady transfer of power from the
states to Washington. How else to explain the precariousness of an
agreement which the states solidly support? How else to account for
the astonishing influence of lobbyists who represent a collection of
marginal interests?
<P>
          The NAFTA has not yet been defeated. But to save it, members
of Congress must begin listening not only to their lobbyists, but to
the people of their states and the governors who speak for them.

<h3>WHY ARE REPUBLICANS PROMOTING MANAGED CARE?</h3>
By <a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
Republicans spent two years attacking the totalitarian Clinton
Health Plan because it would put all Americans into Managed Care,
allow medical care only as permitted by Gatekeepers, deny our right
to choose our own doctor, limit access to specialists, and force us
to enroll in Regional Alliances with more government control and
price fixing.  Republicans won the argument, defeated all versions
of Clintoncare, and used Clinton's Health Plan as a central issue
in winning a Republican majority in Congress.<p>
Now, it's hard to believe, but the Republican Congressional
leadership has warmed over the same bad ideas and is touting them
as Medicare reform.  If Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole think they can
sell the same bad product that Bill Clinton failed to sell, they
are out of touch with the real world.<p>
Drafts of the Republican Medicare reform that have leaked out 
indicate that it is based on herding seniors into Managed Care
(HMOs).  The Managed Care lobby reputedly has $9 billion (not
million) in cash reserves to soft-sell its propaganda, so it's not
surprising that Republican spokesmen are suddenly praising Managed
Care.<p>
Sen. Judd Gregg (R-NH) is appearing on television as a spokesman
for the Republican Medicare plan.  Using data provided by the Group
Health Association of America, the HMO trade group, he claims that
people just love HMOs.<p>
The Managed Care lobby has succeeded in making Rep. Bill Thomas (R-
CA), chairman of the Ways and Means subcommittee on health, their
chief Managed Care advocate in the House.  His statements on
managed care on a PBS special to be aired in September are truly
incredible, according to one reporter who has previewed it.<p>
Thomas was asked to address the complaint of a person who can no
longer choose his doctor because his company switched to an HMO. 
Thomas repled, "I'd ask you a couple of questions.  How did you
find your first doctor?  Well, the answer is that it was probably
a friend of a friend, or you looked in the Yellow Pages."<p>
"And this," he exclaimed, "is the sacred system that someone wants
to defend! Now, you created a personal relationship, which you
don't want to change.  There's no reason in the world why that
personal relationship couldn't be recreated."<p>
Sorry, Bill, seniors are not going to let you "recreate" personal
relationships with their doctors.  Seniors are not dumb and they
vote, so they may decide to "recreate" their relationship with
their Congressman and elect one who will stand up for the right to
choose your own doctor.<p>
Republicans claim that their Medicare plan would offer seniors more
"options" among "plans."  That's an illusion.  The only option that
matters is the option to choose your specialist and your treatment
when you are sick.  HMOs put those choices in the hands of
Gatekeepers who receive increased pay for limiting access.<p>
Republicans made a terrible blunder in letting Medicare become the
number-one issue of the 1995-1996 campaign.  It's a losing issue
for Republicans, and their arguments are not selling at the
grassroots.<p>
The Gephardt line is powerful:  "Republicans are cutting the
benefits and raising taxes on the elderly in order to give tax
breaks to the rich."  As top Democratic pollster Mark Mellman said: 
"Linking Medicare reforms to tax cuts is a potent line of attack. 
Hurting beneficiaries is what matters."<p>
The Republican leadership must change its strategy and make Medical
Savings Accounts for today's workers (i.e., H.R. 1818) the
centerpiece of health care reform.  Go for the votes of the 30-55
year old age group and tell the truth:<p>
"Medicare as we know it is not going to be there when you are
age65.  We Republicans are going to make sure you have health care
by allowing you to set up your personal tax-deductible Medical
Savings Account (MSA) so that you will have your own money to
provide your health care needs.  With MSAs, you can choose your own
doctor, save for health care in retirement and long-term care, and
avoid HMO gatekeepers."<p>
Medicare was the crown jewel of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society. 
The underlying premise is that today's workers should be taxed to
pay for the health care of the elderly.  It's a Ponzi scheme that
only works as long as more people are paying into the system than
are receiving benefits.  When the baby boomers reach 65, the Ponzi
scheme will totally collapse, with or without Medicare HMOs.<p>
Liberal Democrats know that MSAs represent a direct challenge to
their generation-transfer scheme.  They hope that Republicans
continue to expend their political capital in politically fatal
Medicare ""reform'' rather than giving baby boomers a personal
medical savings account, which would liberate them from socialized
medicine in retirement.<p>
Medical Savings Accounts are not only smart politics, but they are
the best long-term solution for financing our health care system. <p>

<i>January 25, 1996

</i>
<h2>The Fraud and the Failure Called Welfare </h2>

<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a>

<p><P>
The disaster called welfare was probably the biggest single issue that 
ousted the Democratic majority in Congress in the landmark election of 
1994. Even President Clinton said he wanted to "end welfare as we know it." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;True to their Contract with America, the Republican Congress passed welfare 
reform. It wasn't a perfect piece of legislation, of course. There is no 
way this $5 trillion fraud and failure, with so many vested interests, 
could be perfected by one law in one year. But it was a giant step in the 
right direction. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Clinton vetoed the welfare reform bill, so we're back to square one. 
The federal taxpayers will have to go on spending $234 billion annually, 
plus another $100 billion in state welfare spending.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lyndon Johnson's Great Society set up a grossly unjust and immoral system 
in the mid-1960s whereby millions of people were taught that they had an 
"entitlement." They became "entitled" to pick the pockets of lawabiding, 
taxpaying families if they met two conditions: they didn't work, and they 
were not married to someone who does work. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The major problem is that welfare pays better than jobs that welfare 
recipients can hope to get. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A recent Cato Institute study laid out comparative figures based on the 
cash payments and non-cash benefits paid by our welfare system to a single 
mother with two children. There are 77 different sources of welfare money, 
but the principal pipelines are AFDC, food stamps, medicaid, housing, 
utilities, WIC, and commodities. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In eight states, the average welfare mother receives cash and benefits 
amounting to $20,000 a year. In medium-level welfare states, she gets 
$17,500 per year. And it's all tax-free! 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 39 states, welfare benefits are equivalent to an $8 per hour job. In New 
York and Washington, D.C., welfare benefits are equivalent to a $12 an hour 
job, two and a half times the minimum wage. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In eight states, welfare benefits are equivalent to the salary of a 
first-year teacher. In 28 states, welfare benefits are equivalent to the 
pay of a starting secretary. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of course, all welfare recipients don't receive this much, but some get 
more. The conclusion is that it pays to be on welfare and there is no real 
hope of getting people off welfare until the benefits are less than a 
minimum wage job. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When LBJ started the current welfare system, it was called the "war on 
poverty." Indeed, it was a war against families, taxpayers, and even 
against the people it was supposed to help. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It's bad enough that the war on poverty took so much spendable income out 
of the pockets of hard-working Americans. It's worse that it is a no-win 
war, initiated by the same Administration that gave us the Vietnam War. We 
are waiting for its perpetrators to admit, like Robert S. McNamara, that 
they were "wrong, terribly wrong." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the worst of it is that the liberal welfare system has perpetrated such 
horrendous damage on our society. It has broken up millions of families, 
prevented more millions of families from forming, produced seven million 
illegitimate children, created a pathetic underclass that will never 
achieve what we like to call the American Dream, virtually destroyed our 
great cities, and spawned the social problems that flow from illegitimacy 
such as drugs, delinquency, and dropouts. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The welfare system tells a teenage girl, who is doing poorly in school, 
doesn't know who her father is, isn't getting along with her mother, and 
hates her surroundings, "We'll take you out of all this, set you up in an 
apartment of your own, send you a check every month, and give you your own 
food stamps, housing allotment, health care, and commodities. All you have 
to do to get all these goodies is have an illegitimate baby." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Surprise, surprise, more illegitimate babies were born to teenagers. So the liberals offered another government "solution": "family planning." That's a 
euphemism for the massive distribution of contraceptives.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Title X taxpayer funding started in 1970 for the purpose of reducing 
unmarried teen pregnancies. After 25 years, the result is total disaster; 
every measure of teenage health is dramatically worse. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Illegitimate births to teenagers have doubled, the teenage abortion rate 
has more than doubled, sexual activity rates are far higher and at a 
younger age, and sexually transmitted diseases have skyrocketed. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When the liberals whine about how the so-called Religious Right is 
"imposing its morals" on the rest of society, remember that they are like 
the thief who cries "stop, thief" to distract from his own thievery. 
Welfare is the prime example of the Irreligious Left imposing its lack of 
morals on the rest of society.

<title>Federal Budget Targets Nine Seniors' Groups for Subsidies -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<b>Government Integrity Project Report #6<br>
September 29, 1995</b><p>
<center><H2><I>FEDERAL BUDGET TARGETS 
NINE SENIORS' GROUPS FOR SUBSIDIES</I></H2>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/wittmann.htm">Marshall Wittmann</a><br>
Senior Fellow in Congressional Affairs<br>
<P>
Charles P. Griffin<br>
Deputy House Liaison<p>
<p>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a></center><p>
The Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSCEP) is operated by the U.S. Department of Labor and provides more than $400 million annually for senior citizen employment.  The stated purpose of this program, authorized by Title V of the Older Americans Act of 1965, is
<p><blockquote>
To provide, foster, and promote part-time work opportunities (usually 20 hours per week) in community service activities for low income persons who are 55 years of age and older.  To the extent feasible, the program assists and promotes the transition of program enrollees into unsubsidized employment.1</blockquote><p>	States, national nonprofits, and territories are eligible to receive grants.  In reality, however, 78 percent of this money (more than $320 million) is segregated from state funding to subsidize "nine national nonprofit organizations."  In fact, the <i>Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance</i> explicitly states <p>
"The Department [of Labor] annually renews grant agreements.  There are no plans to add additional organizations."  Moreover, "Awards are not on a competitive basis."
<p>
	Between July 1993 and June 1994, the following nine national organizations received the designated funding:
<p><ul>
<li>American Association of Retired Persons...................$48,000,000<br>
<li>Asociation Nacional Pro Personas Mayores................$12,000,000<br>
<li>Green Thumb, Inc.2.....................................................$102,000,000<br>
<li>National Caucus and Center on Black Aged, Inc.........$12,000,000<br>
<li>National Council of Senior Citizens.............................$61,000,000<br>
<li>National Council on Aging...........................................$38,000,000<br>
<li>National Indian Council on Aging................................$2,000,000<br>
<li>National Pacific/Asian Resource Center.......................$2,000,000<br>
<li>National Urban League.................................................$4,000,000<br>
</ul><p>
	The President's original FY 1996 budget request separates the two parts of this account to differentiate between the states and the "Gang of Nine."  These national nonprofits are able to act as government contractors and subgrant the money they receive to other organizations.
<p>
	The FY 1995 Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Act included House committee report language that stated, "It is the intent of the Committee that the current sponsors continue to build upon their past accomplishments."  This language clearly indicates that the committee was aware of the grantees under this program and had absolutely no problem with the fact that most of them engage in political advocacy.
<p>
	Fortunately, the FY 1996 committee report begins to address this problem.  Although the program's funding has been reduced by only $50 million, the report states that "The Committee has funded the program under the basic law rather than continuing the past practice of earmarking 78% of the funds for national contractors and 22% for the states."
<p>
	However, even with this reform, the nine seniors' organizations are simply thrown into the same pot as the states.  They are not prohibited from receiving funds, and it is not clear that federal bureaucrats could not simply award the grants in the same manner.  Moreover, the SCSEP joins the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) as a privileged federal program that is forward-funded.  None of these reforms will take effect until next July (as opposed to this October, as is the case with "normal" programs).
<p>
	Real reform of this program -- short of outright elimination -- would require both that earmarks be ended and that advocacy organizations be prohibited explicitly from becoming grantees.
<p>
	Congress has an obligation to end these noncompetitive subsidies to nonprofit advocacy organizations.  At the very least, if the House and Senate cannot resolve to eliminate this program, they should agree to redirect the funds to the states so that they directly benefit needy seniors and no longer subsidize legislative or political advocacy.
<p>
<b>Siphoning Grant Funds to Pay for Advocacy</b>
<p>
The Senior Community Service Employment Program permits grantees to allocate up to 13.5 percent of their award to "administration," or overhead, expenses. These funds directly subsidize the organization's non-grant-related activities, including lobbying, by paying utilities, building maintenance, and other common expenses.
<p>
For the period between July 1993 and June 1994, the grantees were permitted to "skim" the following amounts off their check from the taxpayers to subsidize other activities.
<p><ul>
<li>American Assn. of Retired Persons....................................$6,480,000<br>
<li>As'n of Nacional Pro Personas Mayores............................$1,620,000<br>
<li>Green Thumb, Inc...............................................................$13,770,000<br>
<li>Nat'l Caucus & Ctr. on Black Aged....................................$1,620,000<br>
<li>Nat'l Council of Senior Citizens.........................................$8,235,000<br>
<li>Nat'l Council on Aging.......................................................$5,130,000<br>
<li>Nat'l Indian Council on Aging............................................$270,000<br>
<li>Nat'l Pacific/Asian Resource Center...................................$270,000<br>
<li>Nat'l Urban League.............................................................$540,000<br>

<h2>
The Feminists Seek Unfair and Unattainable Goals
</h2>

<P>
The aging feminist leaders gathered in Washington earlier this month amid
self-doubts about whether they are relevant any more. "We want to end this
discussion about the death of feminism," proclaimed the organizer of this
Feminist Expo '96 and its most voluble spokesperson, Eleanor Smeal.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Feminism is in its death throes because it seeks unattainable goals at
variance with reality, common sense, and fairness. In the 1970s and 1980s,
the feminists sought a "gender-neutral" society; their goal was to be
treated exactly like men.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The feminist "party line" today is obsessed with victimology as the problem
and affirmative action as the solution: they see the world as one gigantic
male conspiracy against women. The feminists' goal is reverse
discrimination quotas for women in hiring and promotions.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
We hear endless whining about "equal pay for equal work," but that's been
the law of the land for 33 years. What they really want is reverse
discrimination quotas to give women equal pay for unequal work.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The feminists use "Glass Ceiling" as a code word for quotas for
professional and executive women, and "comparable worth" as the code word
for quotas for skilled white and blue collar jobs. (Unskilled jobs are
never on the feminists' radar screen.)
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The feminists' mantra is, "a woman earns only 72 cents for every dollar a
man earns." That statement is false on its face, first, because of the
dishonest use of the word "every." It might be correct if the sentence
read, "The average woman earns 72 percent of the earnings of the average
man," but that would be meaningless because it's unrelated to how much work
the average man or woman does.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Americans don't believe in equal pay for everyone (that's a Marxist
notion). We believe in equal pay for equal work.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When you relate earnings to work performed, male and female gender profiles
are very different. A recent research paper by the Pacific Research
Institute of San Francisco provides overwhelmingly persuasive
documentation.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The slogans "wives have to work" and "it takes two incomes to support a
family today" obscure public understanding of the powerful effect that
marriage has on workforce earnings, and 81 percent of women do marry. As
the scholar Thomas Sowell has shown, marriage has exactly the opposite
effect on the earnings of men and women.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Married men with children earn the most, while married women with children
earn the least. As the number of children increases, a married man works
more hours in the workforce and a married woman works fewer hours.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1994 only 55% of women worked 40 or more hours a week compared to 75% of
men. While 16% of men worked 55 or more hours a week, only 6% of women did.
It's ridiculous to compare earnings without relating them to whether
produced by full-time or part-time employment.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For the benefit of feminists who need to have the obvious stated: people
who work more earn more, and they should. The principal income gap is not
between women and men, but between married women and everyone else, and
that is primarily the result of a voluntary domestic division of labor, not
labor-force discrimination by a conspiracy of men. Women who remain single,
invest in education, stay in the labor force, and work long hours fare
about as well as men in the labor market.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The feminists' next line of attack is to assert that, even when you compare
levels of education, or highest college level attained, Bureau of Labor
Statistics figures show a sizeable differential (they call it
discrimination) between men's and women's earnings. But comparing incomes
by the highest degree earned reveals individual choices made by women, and
correlation does not prove cause.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1992, one out of four women who earned Ph.D.s did so in education,
whereas one out of five men earned a Ph.D. in engineering. The mean monthly
income of education majors is $3,048, and of engineering graduates is
$4,049 (a third higher). Personal choices produced those results; no
gestapo forced women to major in fields that pay less.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Looking at master's and doctor's degrees conferred in 1992, we find that
women earned 75% of the advanced degrees in education, 65% in English
literature, and 63% in ethnic and cultural studies. Men earned 85% of the
advanced degrees in engineering, 75% in physical sciences and science
technologies, and 60% in mathematics.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As of 1990, women held 73% of all college degrees in education, 61% of
degrees in liberal arts and humanities, and 81% of degrees in nursing and
pharmacy. Men held 91% of degrees in engineering, 74% in physical and earth
sciences, and 67% of degrees in mathematics and statistics.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
All professions have costs and benefits, pluses and minuses. Investment
bankers make more money than school teachers, but teachers have frequent
and much longer vacations.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The proper role of government is to provide equal protection of the laws
and opportunity, not preferential treatment based on warped social theory,
especially when that theory is so demonstrably false.

<title>Schlafly: Political Slush Funds -- 3/21/96</title>

<h2>
Political Slush Funds
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Phyllis Schlafly
</a>

<P>
The media are persistently presenting us with reports that voters are 
"angry," usually with the implication that this condition is the voters' 
fault and is some kind of a national problem like a social disease. The 
Heritage Foundation, in a document called "Top Ten Political Slush Funds," 
has now given us chapter and verse to justify plenty of anger on the part 
of the voters. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This Heritage document sets forth dozens upon dozens of private groups that 
are on the federal dole for millions of dollars of our taxpayers' money, 
part of which they use to lobby and politic for their own special-interest 
causes. Just to call the roll makes anybody angry at the way Congress, over 
the years of one-party Democratic rule, has extorted our hard-earned money 
through income taxes and distributed it among their liberal friends. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Efforts to restrict this welfare for lobbyists last year through the 
Istook-McIntosh Amendment were drowned under the hysterical lobbying of 
these corporate welfare recipients. Their advocacy of bigger government, 
higher spending, and increased government regulation has continued 
unabated. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) has been giving away our 
money for many years to a long list of liberal and feminist outfits, of 
which the most egregious was NEH Chair Lynne Cheney's $2 million grant to 
UCLA that produced the notorious leftwing revisionist National History 
Standards. The NEH has given other taxpayer grants to such special-interest 
groups as the American Bar Association, the American Library Association, 
and the National Council on Aging. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The current NEH Chair, Sheldon Hackney, has started a stream of tax dollars 
flowing to something called "National Conversation." Only an ivory-tower 
liberal could, with a straight face, argue that Americans need federal 
funding and intervention in order to engage in "conversation," so you can 
bet in what political direction this conversation will be led. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Market Promotion Program gives taxpayer handouts to trade organizations 
to advertise U.S. products in foreign countries. Of course, parts of their 
grants are used to lobby against reductions in agricultural subsidies, all the while they are mouthing the mantra "free trade." 
Here is a tiny sampling of these taxpayer grants: $7 million to the Meat 
Export Federation, $6 million to Cotton Council International, $5 million 
each to the Poultry and Egg Export Council and to the Wine Institute, $4 
million to Florida Citrus, $3 million to the California Almond Board, $2 
million each to the Pillsbury Company and the Mink Export Council. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) funnels 400 million federal tax 
dollars to 323 private groups around the country, most of which engage in 
political and lobbying activities. These tax-paid lawyers file lawsuits, 
engage in political advocacy, and work in referendum campaigns to prevent 
welfare reform, to promote racial preferences, to provide tax benefits to 
illegal immigrants and felons, and even to prevent the eviction of drug 
dealers from public housing. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The taxpayers are forced to fund Planned Parenthood to the tune of at least 
$189 million. Much of this money goes in direct grants to state chapters of 
Planned Parenthood that typically deal with abortion and engage in 
legislative and political advocacy. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Numerous liberal lobbying organizations that pretend to advocate the 
interests of seniors have figured out to get themselves on the dole for 
large amounts of taxpayers money. These include $69 million to American 
Association of Retired Persons (AARP), $61 million to the National Council 
of Senior Citizens, and $38 million to the National Council on Aging. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
AARP is one of the country's largest and wealthiest private lobbying 
organizations and doesn't need tax-funded charity. It lobbied actively for 
Clinton's socialized health care bill in 1994, even though AARP's internal 
surveys showed that most seniors opposed it. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Grants to an endless list of private organizations are concealed in the 
fine print of the federal budget under such high sounding titles as Senior 
Environmental Employment Program ($45 million), Superfund Worker Training 
Program ($32 million), HHS Discretionary Aging Projects ($26 million), and 
Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance ($25 million). 
These political slush funds include handouts to some of the richest 
advocacy organizations in the country, including the American Bar 
Association and the American Medical Association. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Some of the wealthiest national unions are on the gravy train, too. The 
Laborers Union gets $8 million, the Carpenters $4 million, the Chemical 
Workers $3 million, the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers $3 million, the 
Operating Engineers and the Teamsters each get $2 million, and the Auto 
Workers $1 million. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Americans are tired of hearing talk about the goal of "a balanced budget in 
seven years," and tired of the bleeding-heart Democratic rhetoric 
complaining that "budget cuts hurt seniors and children." It is an outrage 
that Congress has failed to eliminate all welfare to private advocacy 
groups of all kinds.

INTRODUCTION
<P>
     "The patent system has added the fuel of interest to the
     fire of genius." 
<P>
                    Abraham Lincoln

<P>
     "A country without a patent office and good patent laws is
     just a crab  and can't travel any way but sideways and
     backwards." 
<P>
                    Mark Twain

<P>
     The past few decades have seen the United States move from an
economy propelled by traditional manufacturing to one in which
services and high technology are pre-eminent. This shift underscores
the degree to which specialized knowledge and ideas have become the
basis for America's comparative advantage in trade. For America to
keep its enviable lead in high technology manufacturing and hi-tech
services, the U.S. vigorously must defend the ideas and inventions
produced by its citizens from foreign commercial theft. 
<P>
     Since 1790 the U.S. has protected its innovative ideas from being
copied by giving an inventor exclusive property rights to his new
ideas by granting patents. (The U.S.  Constitution also provides for
copyright protection in Article I, section 8, clause 8, the same
clause that provides patent protection.  For the sake of brevity, this
study will focus on the need for additional patent protection in the
current trade talks.  Many of the arguments made with respect to
patents also would be applicable to copyrights.) But patent protection
and other forms of intellectual property rights such as copyrights and
trademarks frequently are violated in foreign countries, particularly
in the Third World. A 1988 report by the U.S. International Trade
Commission (ITC), a U.S. government agency that investigates and
reports on international trade issues, estimated that in 1986
worldwide losses to American industry due to infringement upon all
forms of American intellectual property were between $43 billion and
$61 billion. (United States International Trade Commission, "Foreign
Protection of Intellectual Property Rights and the Effect on U.S. 
Industry and Trade," Report to the United States Trade Representative,
Investigation No.  332-245, Under Section 332(g) of the Tariff Act of
1930, Washington, D.C., February 1988, p.  H-3.)
<P>
     Rewarding Risk. Patents are critical in maintaining the cycle of
scientific discovery, practical engineering, and production. Without
the potential for exclusive financial reward that patents provide
there would be little reason for firms and individuals to expend the
energy, invest the capital, and take the risks required of those who
wish to discover new products and bring them to market. Although many
developing nations are among the worst pirates of patents and other
forms of intellectual property, they would prosper from a strong
regime protecting patents because these protections promote invention
and industriousness and because they promote closer commercial ties
with foreigners who will see their willingness to safeguard
intellectual property as a sign of commercial sophistication and
trustworthiness. The U.S. was not a developed country in 1790 when it
enacted its first patent law, yet it prospered greatly due to the
property rights afforded to inventors for their ideas. 
<P>
     The total research, development, and safety testing costs for a
single new pharmaceutical product exceed $230 million on average. With
the average time it takes to bring a new drug to market now exceeding
ten years, the absence of patent protection would permit other firms
to copy and reproduce the drugs at a fraction of the cost,
undercutting years of research and development. Were there no patent
protection, the result would not be lower priced goods; the result
would be far fewer new goods, in this case new medicines.
<P>
     The current round of multilateral trade talks, the Uruguay Round
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), is attempting to
address the issue of patents, copyrights, and other intellectual
property rights. The White House should instruct the U.S. trade
negotiators to push GATT to offer new intellectual property
protection. The Congress, meanwhile, should declare that it will not
ratify a new GATT accord without significant gains on intellectual
property. U.S. negotiators should not make concessions at GATT in the
hope that they can be won back at the World Intellectual Property
Organization (WIPO), a feckless United Nations body based in Geneva.
WIPO often embraces the economic ideas of the so-called Group of 77
(G-77), a bloc of Third World countries that advocates state
domination of the economy.
<P>
     In instructing the U.S. negotiators, the White House should
insist that:
<P>
**   The GATT agreement should grant patent protection for products
     and processes for at least twenty years. This is the accepted
     standard period for patents to extend protection.
<P>
**   The GATT agreement should establish reasonable "working
     requirements," and imports must be allowed to meet these
     requirements. Patents are given by many countries with the
     expectation that they will lead to the sale of the patented
     products in that country. A patent is "worked" when the patented
     good is sold. "Working requirements" thus are conditions
     specifying that the good must be sold domestically while the
     patent remains in effect. Some countries go further and impose
     working requirements to force firms to manufacture or assemble
     the product in the country. In such cases, imports would not
     satisfy the working requirement. This is not reasonable. To
     satisfy the working requirement, patent holders must be allowed
     to import the good. There should be no discrimination in favor of
     domestic production in which economies of scale are often not
     available.
<P>
**   The GATT agreement should contain strict restraints on compulsory
     licensing arrangements, in which a government (usually foreign)
     allows a producer other than the patent holder to produce the
     patented good or to use a patented process. The GATT should
     require that such licensing be "non-exclusive," meaning that the
     patent holder always should be allowed to produce the product
     even if a compulsory license is granted to another firm. The
     compulsory licensing arrangements also should be "non-
     discriminatory" toward patentable subject matter, meaning that
     all industries should be treated similarly.
<P>
**   All nations that are party to an agreement on patents should be
     required to develop effective legal systems to enforce the
     agreement. The international agreements should put the force of
     domestic law behind these treaties.
<P>
**   The GATT agreement should not allow "parallel importing."
     "Parallel importing" is a form of arbitrage that buys cheaply in
     one market, ships the good to a higher-priced market, and sells
     for the higher price. Normally, arbitraging is an important way
     that prices in various markets keep prices aligned. In the case
     of goods under exclusive franchise, however, "parallel
     importation" undermines patent protection by permitting goods
     going to other markets, where pricing conditions may differ, to
     be returned and sold in the original market, thereby undercutting
     the prices of the patent holder.
<P>
**   The GATT agreement should require a transition period of no more
     than two years for countries to adopt adequate patent laws. This
     provision will prevent countries from delaying their acceptance
     of the new standards for patent protection. Of course, the least
     developed countries should be allowed one or two years longer to
     adjust to the technical demands of enforcing patent protection,
     such as the establishment and maintenance of patent offices.
<P>
**   A GATT agreement should provide "pipeline" protection. Such
     provisions safeguard products that in effect were in the pipeline
     -- patented in one country prior to the enactment of an adequate
     patent law in another one. Once the newcomer to effective patent
     enforcement establishes its law, goods patented elsewhere but
     never marketed in that country will receive protection as if the
     new law always had been in effect.
<P>
**   The U.S. should seek a strong agreement safeguarding intellectual
     property, rather than dilute the terms of protection to gain a
     universal agreement on intellectual property accepted by all GATT
     members. An agreement that offers strong intellectual property
     protection but which may only be ratified in the short term by
     the fifty most important commercial nations is better than a
     watered-down agreement ratified by a greater number of GATT
     members.
<P>
**   The U.S. should make its patent system conform to the basic
     system used by the rest of the world. Called "harmonizing" the
     patent system, this will require that America adopt a "first to
     file" system in which patents are given to the first bona fide
     applicant to file. Of course, such an approach should include
     adequate protection against theft or other abuses that might
     permit a dishonest party to file first. The U.S. would have to
     abandon its "first to invent" method, which allows challenges to
     the first-filers by those who claimed to have conceived the idea
     previously. The American system, in its practice, is biased
     against the patent applications of foreigners and should be
     abandoned.
<P>
THE GATT NEGOTIATIONS
     When the U.S. Congress approved a two-year extension of the
President's fast track negotiating authority this May, it provided an
opportunity for the world's trading countries to complete relatively
quickly the negotiations at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
that convened in Punta del Este, Uruguay, in 1986. GATT is a
multilateral treaty that has increased international trade by reducing
tariffs and non-tariff barriers to international trade. 
<P>
     Since the first GATT agreement of October 30, 1947, there have
been seven completed rounds of trade negotiations. The Uruguay round
is the eighth. The most noted rounds have been: the Dillon Round of
1960-1961, which adjusted the international trading system to the
creation of the European Economic Community; the Kennedy Round,
completed in June 1967, which reduced tariffs 50 percent on a broad
range of products (Louis Henkin, Richard Crawford Pugh, Oscar
Schachter, and Hans Smit, eds., International Law (St.  Paul, Minn.: 
West Publishing, Co., 1987), p.  1166.); and the Tokyo Round,
completed in 1979, which established rules of conduct (codes) in such
non-tariff areas as trade subsidies, technical barriers to trade,
import licensing procedures, anti-dumping actions, and government
procurement policies.
<P>
     Fast track authority permits George Bush to negotiate a trade
agreement until May 1993 and submit it to the Congress for a yes-no
vote on the entire measure. The House and the Senate must either pass
the agreement or reject it; neither House can amend the agreement. 
<P>
     The GATT has four fundamental features. First, it requires
contracting nations to practice non-discrimination in trade. All
nations are bound by the most-favored-nation (MFN) clause, which
requires each member to extend to other GATT members treatment that is
equal to that which is accorded to its most favored trading partner in
a specific good or commodity. Consequently, tariff reductions for one
country automatically are extended to all GATT parties. The GATT
framework allows special exceptions concerning MFN for customs unions
like the European Community and for free trade areas like that which
exists between the U.S. and Canada. ("GATT and the International
Trading System," U.S.  Department of State Dispatch, July 22, 1991, p. 
534.)
<P>
     Second, it specifies that the only protection for a member
state's domestic industries can be through tariffs. Import quotas are
generally prohibited. Tariffs are deemed more acceptable because they
are public, recognizable, and thus more easily negotiable.
<P>
     Third, it requires that imported goods receive the same treatment
given to domestically produced goods in the home market. Restrictions
and regulations made applicable to the imported goods must apply also
to the domestically produced goods.
<P>
     Fourth, it allows a member state to challenge another member
state's trading practices when they appear to violate GATT rules.
Disputes are settled by an ad hoc panel of three to five individuals
agreed to by the parties. This arbitration panel submits a written
opinion about the dispute. If the GATT Council finds that there has
been a violation of international law, it will call for compliance.
The case will be kept on the agenda of the Council until the issue is
settled. Until recently the power to authorize retaliation almost
never has been sought. (Robert E.  Hudec, "Dispute Settlement," in
Jeffrey J.  Schott, ed., Completing the Uruguay Round:  A
Results-Oriented Approach to the GATT Trade Negotiations ( Washington,
D.C.:  Institute for International Economics, 1990), p.  181.) The
problem with GATT dispute resolution is that it is too heavily
influenced by procedures that require consensus. The moral authority
of the GATT, to stretch a term, has served well in creating a desire
to comply with GATT rulings. 
<P>
     The current and eighth round of negotiations, the Uruguay Round,
are the most comprehensive multilateral trade talks ever. Many issues
in this round are being considered by the GATT for the first time.
These include foreign investment, the protection of intellectual
property, and trade in services. One of the fifteen negotiating groups
established to discuss these issues deals with the protection of
intellectual property rights. It is referred to as the Negotiating
Group on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights,
including Trade in Counterfeit Goods. This is abbreviated as the
Negotiating Group on TRIPS.
<P>
     The TRIPS negotiating group must resolve the competing desires to
create an economic environment in which there is unimpeded diffusion
of technology and an environment that rewards those inventors,
entrepreneurs, and writers who seek compensation for their labor.
According to Keith Maskus, professor of economics at the University of
Colorado, there is a clear difference of opinion over the issue of
giving exclusive property rights over ideas. (Keith E.  Maskus,
"Intellectual Property," in ibid., p.  165.) Technology-exporting
countries like the U.S. and Japan see this issue very differently from
technology-importing countries like Brazil, India, and Thailand. It
may never be possible to obtain a TRIPS agreement signed by all
members of the GATT. Yet it should be possible to find enough
technology-exporters and technology-importers to reach a middle
ground.
<P>

THE DEVELOPMENT OF UNITED STATES PATENT LAW<P>
     A major milestone in patent law was the passage of the Statute of
Monopolies in England in 1623. This ended the most damaging commercial
monopolies, which impeded "free trade and competition in staples and
commodities." (Arthur R.  Miller and Michael H.  Davis, Intellectual
Property:  Patents, Trademarks, and Copyright (St.  Paul, Minn.: 
1990), 2nd ed., p.  5.)
<P>
     This English common law hostility toward monopolies was carried
to the British colonies in North America, where it exerted an even
more powerful influence. It was recognized in the 1770s that patents
granted to promote invention could lead to the discovery of new areas
of technical knowledge that would benefit the entire community. By the
time of the American Revolution all thirteen colonies had granted
patents, and patent procedures subsequently became well established in
some states under the Articles of Confederation. (Ibid., pp.  6-7.)
<P>
     Patent Law was considered important enough in post-colonial
America that the Constitutional Convention of 1787 gave the federal
government the power to protect certain types of intellectual property
for limited periods of time. States Article I of the U.S.
Constitution:
<P>
     <UL>The Congress shall have power... To promote the progress of
     science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to
     authors and inventors the exclusive right to their
     respective writings and discoveries. (U.S.  Constitution,
     Article I, sec.  8, clause 8.  According to Miller and
     Davis, because trademark protection comes under the commerce
     clause, its protections are much less solid than are those
     afforded to patents and copyrights which receive
     constitutional protection.)</UL>
<P>
     Congress enacted the first American patent law in 1790, and made
major revisions of this "Patent Act" in 1793, 1836, and 1952. The 1836
act established the Patent Office, which "has been vested with the
authority to examine patents and determine at the outset whether a
patent application satisfies the requirements of the statute." (Miller
and Davis, op.  cit., p.  9.) Prior to the 1836 law no administrative
body existed for examining the validity of patent claims. The Patent
Act may be found in the United States Code under Title 35.

<P>
THE NEED FOR AN AIRTIGHT GATT AGREEMENT 
<P>
     The U.S. should not sign a GATT agreement on patents unless it
affords the highest level of protection against infringement. The
reason: Once signed and then approved by the Congress, a multilateral
arrangement like GATT will supersede American laws that provide for
selective retaliation against nations that are violators of American
intellectual property rights.
<P>
     The U.S. Congress has given the President the power to single out
nations that systematically infringe on U.S. patent protection and
retaliate against them. The 1988 Trade Act, which amended the Tariff
Act of 1930, "provides for a systematic mechanism designed to ensure
that U.S. trading partners are providing adequate and effective
protection of intellectual property." (Mayer, Brown & Platt (attorneys
at law), "A Practical Business and Legal Guide to the Omnibus Trade
and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (Washington, D.C.:  1988), p.  113.)
The general provisions of the 1988 law are known as Super 301 and can
be found in Sections 301 through 310 of the amended Tariff Act of
1930. (Ronald A.  Cass, "Velvet Fist in an Iron Glove:  The Omnibus
Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988," Regulation, Winter 1991, p. 
52.) The specific provision protecting intellectual property is
Section 182, which is referred to as Special 301.
<P>
     Special 301 is a useful weapon in the American arsenal against
nations that steal intellectual property. This law requires the U.S.
Trade Representative (USTR) to identify annually countries that "deny
adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights or
deny fair and equitable market access to U.S. persons that rely on
intellectual property." Then the USTR may cull from that list
"priority countries" that are the most egregious violators of
intellectual property rights. Within thirty days of this, the USTR
must initiate a Section 301 investigation of each "priority country"
and recommend action within six months of initiation, unless it
becomes apparent to the President that the initiation of the
investigation would harm larger U.S. national interests such as
national security concerns. (Mayer, Brown & Platt, op.  cit., p. 
113.) 
<P>
     If intellectual property rights are deemed by the USTR to have
been abused by an investigated country, the USTR then is required to
enter into negotiations with that country to resolve the problem. If
no progress is made in direct talks, then retaliatory measures like
selective tariffs may be imposed against the offending nation by the
U.S. government. 
<P>
     Mexican Success. One example of the successful use of Special 301
occurred after the U.S. placed Mexico on the "priority watch list" in
May 1989. The prospect of being compared to India and other violators
of intellectual property rights spurred Mexican officials to
strengthen protections. In January 1990, USTR Carla Hills removed
Mexico from the trade list after that government published a plan that
outlined the steps Mexico would take to update its patent laws. In
1991 Mexico enacted a vastly improved law to protect intellectual
property. 
<P>
     This source of U.S. leverage in bilateral negotiations on
intellectual property rights would be lost if the U.S. acceded to a
GATT provision on intellectual property, because GATT supersedes
American law. If the protection afforded to patents by the new GATT
agreement is stringent, then losing bilateral leverage would be a
reasonable trade-off. In this case, the U.S. would have made the
protection of patents, copyrights, and trademarks an important part of
the international agreements on trade and tariffs. If, however, GATT
protection for patents is weak, then the U.S. would have sacrificed
the bargaining leverage derived from Special 301 without receiving
adequate compensation.
<P>

AN AMERICAN NEGOTIATING AGENDA AT GATT<P>
     Given the many ways in which patents can be undermined, effective
protection of patents requires that the TRIPS negotiations at GATT
proceed on several fronts.
<P>
** U.S. trade negotiators should focus on GATT as the proper forum for
reaching an intellectual property agreement. 
<P>
     Concessions should not be made at GATT in the hope that they can
be won back at the United Nations' World Intellectual Property
Organization, based in Geneva. WIPO's weakness is typical to the U.N.
system: too many nations have voting power greater than their economic
size would justify. Consequently, a WIPO agreement on patents can be
shaped or vetoed by groups of states that have a small role in
international trade but who can outvote the major trading nations.
WIPO's value is in settling technical issues such as the definition of
what can be patented. It is not an instrument, however, for protecting
intellectual property.
<P>
     GATT is the only set of negotiations in which all trade issues
are simultaneously on the table. This is an advantage because it
creates opportunities for trade-offs. Example: A set of trade talks
that focused only on patent protection could not produce an agreement
since developing nations, like Argentina, would not subject themselves
to tougher patent laws. In GATT, however, these nations can get
advantages in other areas by making concessions on intellectual
property. Argentina, for instance, might receive concessions from the
European Community on agricultural goods, which Argentina exports, in
exchange for concessions on patents. Without such a wide-ranging basis
for negotiations, negotiating a comprehensive trade agreement would be
impossible. Therefore, the attention and energy of the U.S. government
must be focused on GATT. 
<P>
     This should not preclude the U.S. pursuing strong patent
protection in negotiations like the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) in case the GATT round fails. In the case of NAFTA,
Mexico recently improved its patent laws, but Canada lags behind the
other major industrial countries and Mexico in protecting patents.

<P>
** The GATT agreement should grant patent protection for products and
processes for at least twenty years. 
<P>
     This is the accepted standard period for patent protection.
European, Japanese, and now Mexican products are protected twenty
years from the date of filing for the patent. In the U.S., patents
provide protection for seventeen years after the date on which the
patent is granted. Since the average time required for the processing
of a patent around the world is two to three years from the date of
filing, the Japanese-European date and the American date are
essentially equivalent. There thus should be little difficulty
obtaining GATT agreement on this provision. Some products like
pharmaceuticals require lengthy periods of regulatory processing. For
this reason, the U.S., Italy, and Japan have extended patent
protection in this area beyond twenty years. Consequently, the GATT
should not set a ceiling of twenty years but make that the minimum
period of protection.
<P>
** The GATT agreement should establish reasonable "working
requirements," and imports must be allowed to meet these requirements.
<P>
     A patent is a property right in which a government grants
exclusive rights to produce a product to an inventing person or
organization. When an application for the patent is filed, it is made
public, thus revealing the novelty of the product or process for which
a patent is being sought. This advances technological knowledge in the
manufacturing and scientific communities.
<P>
     Patents also may be granted on the premise that they will be
"worked" or used. For example, if General Motors is given a patent in
Germany for a new type of automobile headlight, Germany may require
General Motors to sell the headlight, thereby "working" the patent.
The U.S. has no working requirements. American patent law relies on
competitive innovation to prevent abuse of the monopoly privilege. It
is conceivable that the holder of a patent for one good might not want
to sell that good if its sale could undercut the market position of
more profitable good that the firm sells.
<P>
     Typically, many countries require that local manufacturing take
place to meet a working test. If the product for which the patent is
granted is not locally manufactured within a specified period (the
period of time varies per country) then a "compulsory license" is
granted to another company to work the patent. For most kinds of goods
a period of three to five years would be adequate for the working
requirement, but for some industries this period would be too short.
In the pharmaceutical industry, for example, a period of ten to twelve
years is required to test a drug's safety, so a longer period is
needed.
<P>
     It must be permissible to import a patented product as a means of
satisfying the working requirements. Spain and some other countries
require that a product be manufactured in that country for it to
satisfy this condition. This is in reality a protectionist policy.
Requirements that a good be manufactured in every country in which it
is sold creates tremendous economic inefficiencies, destroying
economies of scale and increasing the average cost of the product. If
a manufacturer is forced to operate his plants at inefficient levels,
the cost of the product will increase for consumers.
<P>
     When countries impose working requirements, therefore, they must
allow these requirements to be fulfilled by imported goods as well as
by those manufactured in the country.
<P>
** The GATT agreement should contain strict restraints on compulsory
licensing arrangements, in which a government (usually foreign) allows
a producer other than the patent holder to produce the patented good
or to use a patented process. 
<P>
     Such licensing must be "non-exclusive" and "non-discriminatory"
toward subject matter that is able to be patented. "Non-exclusive"
means that holder of the patent should always be permitted to sell the
product. "Non-discriminatory" means that there should be no
discrimination against foreign patent holders or against patent
holders in specific industrial sectors. 
<P>
     According to the 1883 Paris Convention for the Protection of
Industrial Property, the first major international intellectual
property agreement: "Each country... shall have the right to take
legislative measures providing for the grant of compulsory licenses to
prevent the abuses which might result from the exercise of the
exclusive rights conferred by the patent, for example, failure to
work." (Paris Convention, Article 5.A.2.  The Paris Convention was
first signed on March 20, 1883.  It has been revised on a number of
occasions, most recently in 1979.  Ninety-nine nations are party to
the Paris Convention.) Under the Paris Convention a government is able
to protect its people from abuses that might arise from granting
patents, but the wording of the provision quoted above is vague and
open-ended.
<P>
     Consequently, abuses of the compulsory licensing provision are
possible. Unscrupulous governments have passed on information about
patented products or processes to domestic producers with a compulsory
license, and then refused the company with the original patent the
right to sell the good in that country's market. To make matters
worse, the domestic producer with the compulsory license often will
export the product at a considerable price advantage because that firm
did not have to bear the costs of research and development.
<P>
     The GATT agreement must specify when compulsory licensing is
permissible. GATT also must enumerate restraints on compulsory
licensing. Compulsory licensing should be minimized; the capacity to
issue these licenses is a temptation to abuse the privilege. 
<P>
     Compulsory licenses should be permissible only: 1) if the holder
of a patent fails to "work" the patent; 2) if customers are exploited
by "tie-in sales" provisions which require the purchaser of the
patented good, over which the producer has a monopoly, to buy other
goods from the patent holder that the consumer does not want, making
this in effect an act of extortion; and 3) if a national emergency
arises and additional manufacturers of a patented product are needed
quickly, as during an epidemic requiring massive quantities of
vaccines that may require additional manufacturers.
<P>
     The compulsory licenses further should be "non-exclusive" so that
the holder of the patent always would be allowed to market the
licensed good. If a compulsory license is granted to a manufacturer
who does not hold the patent, therefore, the patent holder must not be
precluded from selling or importing the product. Under GATT compulsory
licenses also should be "non-discriminatory" in two ways. First, there
should be no distinction made between local and foreign origins of the
good. A patent holder foreign to a market should not be denied the
right to sell its product in that market and reap the benefits of the
technological innovation. Second, there should be no discrimination
intended to help domestic manufacturing sectors. Governments should
not be able to protect domestic companies that use technologies made
available in the patent process from competition with the patent
holder.
<P>
     Goods that are manufactured under compulsory licensing
arrangements should not be permitted to be exported. Much of the cost
of producing an innovative product resides in costs related to
research and development. A good produced under compulsory licensing
does not bear these costs because the holder of the patent was
required to reveal the nature of its technological innovation to
receive the patent. Therefore, the goods produced under compulsory
licensing arrangements should not be permitted to undermine the
competitive position of the patent holder's products internationally.
<P>
** All nations that are party to an agreement on patents should be
required to develop effective legal systems to enforce the agreement. 
<P>
     There must be an adequate domestic legal system in which actions
can be taken to stop patent infringements and seek recompense when
they occur. There also should be an effective customs agency in each
nation that can prevent the illegal importation of goods that infringe
the right of the patent holder to make, use, or sell the patented good
or process.
<P>
** The GATT agreement should not allow "parallel importing." 
<P>
     Parallel importing occurs: 1) when goods produced to be sold in
foreign markets at a lower price than in the home market are imported
back into the country of original manufacture; 2) when unauthorized
imports (those produced with stolen intellectual property) are sold in
a market to compete with goods produced domestically under legitimate
license; or 3) when unauthorized imports into a foreign nation are
allowed to compete with authorized imports into that nation. (A. 
Duncan and T.  Jackson, "Parallel Importing:  An Economic
Perspective," Discussion paper, August 13, 1991 .) Such parallel
importing creates unfair market conditions.
<P>
     In the U.S., once the patent holder sells its product it loses
control of the pricing of that good. It is said that its control has
been exhausted by the first sale. In the case of domestic
transactions, the first sale doctrine is fine. For international
sales, however, it  is not adequate because "first sale" would allow
exporters to take a good slated for export and divert it back to the
domestic market. The allowance of such practices would  undermine all
patent protection because the pricing of goods bound for foreign
markets reflects economic conditions abroad that may differ greatly
from conditions in the  domestic market. A nation that allowed
parallel importing effectively would provide  no patent protection.
<P>
**   The GATT agreement should require a transition period of no more
than two years for countries to adopt adequate patent laws.
<P>
     Once an agreement on patents is reached at the GATT and GATT
members ratify  the intellectual property provisions, the new rules
should come into effect as quickly as  possible. One to two years
should be sufficient for the signatories to bring their domestic
policies into conformity with the international consensus. Less
developed nations  might need a bit longer to muster the technical
expertise required to establish patent offices and to enforce the
international agreement.
<P>
**   A GATT agreement should provide "pipeline" protection.
<P>
     Pipeline provisions safeguard products that were patented in one
country prior to the  enactment of a new, adequate patent law in
another country. Once the newcomer nation to effective patent
enforcement establishes its law, goods patented elsewhere but  never
marketed in that country will receive protection as if the new law
always had  been in effect. Patent holders benefit because their goods
receive protection in another  country for the remainder of the life
of the patent. The country affording the protection  benefits because
it does not have to await new inventions and subsequent patent
applications to begin offering patent protection. As a result,
companies will begin to sell  and manufacture their patented
protections in this new business environment that protects
intellectual property rights.
<P>
     A hypothetical case illustrates the pipeline issue. Take Mexico,
which this year  passed an excellent law protecting patents, as an
example. The Mexican law grants a  standard twenty years' protection
for the patent from the date of filing. Assume an  American company
sought a patent in the U.S. for a new microprocessor in 1985 and 
obtained the American patent. Assume also that the microprocessor was
never marketed in Mexico in any manner, either by the designer or by a
counterfeiter. Under  pipeline protection, as soon as Mexico enacted
its new twenty-year patent protection  law, Mexican patent protection
would cover the microprocessor as if it had been patented in Mexico in
1985. As such, the microprocessor would be protected in Mexico  until
2005, just as it would be in the U.S. This is important because even
products patented elsewhere before the enactment of the improved
Mexican law can now receive  protectionthe benefits will not be
restricted to new inventions only. Mexico will not  have to wait for
new inventions to reap the benefits of providing a commercial
environment that is more friendly to the holders of intellectual
property.
<P>
**   The U.S. should seek a strong agreement safeguarding intellectual
property, rather than dilute the terms of protection to gain a
universal agreement on intellectual property accepted by all GATT
members.
<P>
     The U.S. should seek an agreement that offers strong intellectual
property protection  even if only the fifty most important commercial
nations, with some possible exceptions, ratify the agreement. U.S.
willingness to accept a non-universal agreement will  prevent an
intellectual property agreement from being subject to the vetos of
nations  like China, Egypt, and India, and other nations with
inadequate intellectual property  protection.
<P>
     The GATT agreement concluded in the 1970s during the Tokyo Round
contains various codes that were not ratified by all nations but which
nevertheless serve as benchmark for reducing barriers in specific
trading areas. The anti-dumping code, designed  to prohibit the sale
of goods at prices below cost of production, is the most prominent  of
these agreements. There is an advantage in pursuing a code strategy. A
code can establish the fact that owners of intellectual property
deserve international protection.  Those nations that agree to the
code would be subject to the GATT's enforcement  mechanisms. The vast
majority of important trading nations would be certain to support an
intellectual property code, particularly if it is endorsed by
commercial titans  like the U.S., the European Community, and Japan.
Nations that remain outside the  code still would be subject to
bilateral trade sanctions. For the U.S., this means that the  Special
301 provisions could be triggered. Because the GATT agreement
supersedes  American domestic law, nations that did not sign a code on
intellectual property still  would be subject to U.S. law when they
allowed their citizens to pirate American intellectual property.
<P>
**   The U.S. should make its patent system conform to the basic
system used by rest of the world.
<P>
     America, the nation with the oldest patent system in the world,
follows a "first-to-invent" system, not the "first-to-file" system
used by most other countries. Under American law acts of invention
that predate someone else's filing for the patent can be used  to
establish a claim to the patent. If two inventors seek a U.S. patent
for a particular invention, therefore, "the first to conceive
generally has priority to patent protection."  There are some
exceptions to this. If the first to conceive of the idea does not seek
the  patent with "due diligence," the patent can be denied.
<P>
     Proving who was the first to conceive of an innovation can
involve costly legal discovery actions. Challenges against the
priority of a particular patent claim in legal actions are known as
"interference procedures." Such interference procedures have the 
potential to discriminate against foreign applicants. In fact, U.S.
law makes it difficult  for a foreigner to prove his claim to a
patent. Activities that might prove a claim of  first
conceptualization of the novel idea but which did not take place in
the U.S. are  not admissible in the interference process. As a result,
foreign applicants are allowed to submit fewer types of evidence than
domestic applicants to support their claims to a  patent.
<P>
     Minimal Impact. Although the actual detriment that occurs to the
foreign patent applicant from this discrimination is negligible, the
negotiating damage in trade talks is  significant. The U.S. Patent
Office recently examined a large number of cases in which  there was
potential for discrimination against foreign applicants. It discovered
that actual discrimination rarely was a factor in awarding a patent.
Because the filing date for  the patent in the inventor's home country
is bona fide evidence, and because most inventors are large
organizations with some international reach, patents are usually 
sought simultaneously around the world. Consequently, the
discriminatory impact of  this law is minimal.
<P>
     This fact, however, does not stop other nations from pointing to
the U.S. law to  make negotiating points and to put the U.S. on the
defensive at the GATT intellectual  property negotiations. The
European Community has been aggressive in trying to  wring concessions
on intellectual property out of the U.S. as a price for allowing the 
U.S. to keep its first-to-invent criteria for awarding patents.
<P>
     This is a price that the U.S. should not pay. Instead, the U.S.
should abandon its first to-invent criteria and adopt first-to-file
criteria. The legal fees associated with this  method for obtaining a
patent will be less costly, thereby lowering the costs of production.
First-to-file also will reduce uncertainty among entrepreneurs. They
will know  that once their priority in filing is established that no
other claimant later can wrest  away their patent. The U.S. should
seek harmonization by adopting the first-to-file system in the TRIPS
negotiations at GATT, and also at WIPO, where useful work is being 
done to create uniform rules for patent protection. Of course, such an
approach should  include adequate protection against theft or other
abuses that might permit a dishonest  party to file first.
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
     The protection of American patents is vital to American economic
health, for America possesses a comparative advantage in trade related
to technology and innovation.  The costs of research, development, and
new production often are tremendous. Other  nations should not be
allowed to benefit from the inventions of Americans without 
compensating those who took the risks to develop that knowledge.

     The race to acquire new technology and the derivative products is
becoming increasingly rapid. For the U.S. to keep its front-runner
position, the U.S. must maintain a  solid base of technology that
cannot be stolen. As such, any agreement on intellectual  property to
emerge from the Uruguay Round must provide airtight protection for
patents, copyrights, and trademarks. A mediocre agreement will damage
American interests because the new GATT agreement will supersede
American laws like Special 301  that provide the bilateral means to
retaliate against nations that steal U.S. intellectual  property. A
universal GATT agreement on intellectual property protection therefore 
should not be reached by diluting the strength of that protection.
<P>
     Universal Benefits.  A GATT agreement would provide worldwide
norms concerning the protection of intellectual property that would
benefit technology-exporting nations like the U.S. and Japan, but ut
also would benefit developing countries as well.  They would be forced
to accept, at some level, the traditional notion of property rights,
which would extend their own citizen-entrepreneurs protections for
innovation that might not have been otherwise available to them. 
Additionally, in exchange for concessions on intellectual property,
developing nations will pocket concessions in industries in which they
discuss comparative advantages, such as agriculture and textiles.

<h2>
Pat Buchanan's 'Old Right" Opposed Tariffs
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>
 
What kind of conservative is Pat Buchanan? Supporters and  
opponents say that he's bringing back an older tradition, which  
rejects the cosmopolitanism of the National Review 
generation, and hearkens back to the "isolationism" and America  
First movement of the 30s and 40s.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Mr. Buchanan doesn't dispute this, and why should he? The  
Old Right, though widely misunderstood, was a principled band of  
intellectuals and activists, many of them libertarians, who  
fought the "industrial regimentation" of the New Deal, and were  
the first to note that, in America, statism and corporativism are  
inseparable.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Unfortunately, despite an otherwise appealing platform, Mr.  
Buchanan doesn't represent Old Right economic ideals. These  
writers ardently defended capitalism, including big business and  
corporations, celebrated the profit motive, and took a strict  
laissez-faire attitude toward international trade. They loathed  
tariffs, and saw protectionism as a species of socialist  
planning.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Frank Chodorov was a central intellectual figure on the  
Right from the 1920s to the 1950s, editing the early Freeman 
magazine and founding Human Events and the Intercollegiate  
Studies Institute. A prolific writer, Chodorov guided two  
generations of students and activists to the literature of  
liberty, and urged no compromise with the central state.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

He proudly wore the label "isolationist" and, like Mr.  
Buchanan today, saw entry into the two world wars as a mistake  
because they bolstered militarism and big government in America.  
To Chodorov, isolationism was "not a political policy," but the  
proper and "natural attitude." People are rightly concerned with  
family and neighbors, he said, not foreign peoples and their  
troubles. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But, as he made clear, Chodorov's isolationism had nothing  
to do with international economics. Free trade with other nations  
is part of the normal working of the economy, which stems from  
being concerned with the well being of our families. Chodorov was  
aghast and angered when some people tried to make "America First"  
mean "Buy American": that is, "economic, rather than political,  
isolationism."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"Economic isolationism--tariffs, quotas, embargoes, and  
general governmental interference with international trade--is an  
irritant that can well lead to war," he wrote. "To build a trade  
wall around a country is to invite reprisals," and generates  
"misunderstanding and mistrust." To Chodorov, "Free trade is  
natural, protectionism is political."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

T. Flynn, the great journalist and leader of the  
America First Committee, agreed with Chodorov. "The last seventy  
years of American history," he wrote in 1944, "have been a struggle 
between the ideal of free enterprise and the determination to restrain 
and regiment it." Business "comprises the whole immense web of 
producing and distributing enterprises," but tragically, "some men, 
for various reasons, set out to interfere in the natural workings of 
this immense organism."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Flynn condemns domestic industrial planning because it leads  
to trade barriers. "The first condition of a planned economy is  
that it shall be a closed economy," he wrote. That's why  
socialists want "an impenetrable wall around" the nation,  
"keeping out everybody and every kind of goods and striving for a  
complete self-sufficiency. Of course, this is not practical  
anywhere."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Though a nationalist, Flynn understood the difference  
between caring about one's country first and trade restriction,  
which he saw as having a socialist and fascist pedigree. The link  
between protection and planning, he pointed out, was not disputed  
even on the left. To Stuart Chase, the New Dealer who coined the  
term, "national planning and economic nationalism must go  
together or not at all."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Flynn's view, toughened with a right-wing anarchist edge,  
was also that of Albert Jay Nock, the social critic who inspired  
several generations with his biting attacks on collectivism,  
egalitarianism, and modernity. As a writer for Harper's, he  
helped make anti-statism the political center of pre-war American  
conservatism.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

He too was against entering any foreign war, and could thus  
be fairly described as an "isolationist." But protectionist? "We  
all now know pretty well," he wrote in 1935, "that the primary  
reason for a tariff is that it enables the exploitation of the  
domestic consumer by a process indistinguishable from sheer  
robbery."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"By putting a tariff against the importation, say, of wool,  
the State permits the domestic wool-producing interests to levy a  
tax upon consumers of wool to the amount of the excess in price  
over the price determined by supply and demand in a free  
competitive market. These interests give the consumer nothing in  
return for the tax; the State gives them as beneficiaries, the  
privilege of levying it, and they accordingly do so."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Felix Morley was more of a traditionalist. He won the hearts  
of conservatives by defecting as editor of the Washington  
Post and later becoming editor of Human Events, as well as  
the author of brilliant books on federalism and foreign policy. 
He was an America Firster, an isolationist, and a right-wing  
populist to boot.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But when it came to free enterprise, there was no  
compromise: it must not stop at the border. "Unrestricted  
competition is essential to economic freedom," he wrote. "Indeed,  
it can be said that competition is freedom, as distinct from  
the personal attribute of liberty." "It follows that in an  
advancing civilization the objective with regard to the market will 
always be the removal of restrictions to trade."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This is why Morley doubted that businessmen would be the  
best defenders of the market. They too often seek to protect  
themselves from competition in the name of free enterprise. "Time  
and again," he wrote, "those who argued for competition have, in  
practice, leaned toward monopolistic operations. Advocates of the  
free market have worked openly and surreptitiously for high  
tariffs and other governmental favors." As an example, he cites  
the industrial protectionism of the 19th century that Mr.  
Buchanan now praises.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The preeminent economic theorist of the Old Right was Henry  
Hazlitt. Kicked out of The Nation because he opposed FDR's  
National Recovery Act, he was made editor of The American  
Mercury by H.L. Mencken. During the heyday of Keynesianism,  
Hazlitt thrilled the free-market right with his editorials in  
Newsweek. He was also second to none in his hatred of all  
forms of government intervention, including protectionism and  
economic nationalism.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Hazlitt's Economics In One Lesson, still in print after  
fifty years, devotes two chapters to the tissue of fallacies that  
is the case for protectionism and subsidized exports. As Hazlitt  
demonstrates, "The tariff--though it may increase wages above  
what they would have been in the protected industries--must on  
net balance, when all occupations are considered, reduce real  
wages." As a friend of Ludwig von Mises and F.A. von Hayek,  
however, Hazlitt might be considered one of "those damned  
Austrian economists" that Mr. Buchanan warns us against reading.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

There were Old Rightists who worried about free  
international trade, but not on Buchananite grounds. Essayist  
Garet Garrett came to favor closed borders because he worried  
about the war potential of forcing foreign consumers to buy  
American products, another policy Mr. Buchanan favors. At the  
same time, big business never had a greater champion than  
Garrett. A biographer rightly called him "Profit's Prophet."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Whatever can be said of Mr. Buchanan's trade theories, they  
are not those of the Old Right. Their intellectual legacy is more  
likely British mercantilism, and that's one import we can do  
without.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<h2>Kudos For General Dan "SDI" Graham </h2>
<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a></center>
<p><P>
Can one person really make a difference in this country of 250,000,000  
people? The life of General Daniel O. Graham, who passed away on New Year's  
Eve, gives a stunningly affirmative answer.<br>  
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dan Graham, whose first love was the cavalry, liked to quote an old  
proverb. For want of a nail, the shoe was lost; for want of the shoe, the  
horse was lost; for want of the horse, the battle was lost. <br> 
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That proverb defines his place in history. For want of Dan Graham, Ronald  
Reagan would not have had the vision of a defense against ballistic  
missiles called the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI); for want of  
Reagan's leadership, the United States would not have had a project called  
SDI; and for want of the SDI project and the threat of what it could do,  
the Cold War would have been lost.<br>  
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is now clear that we won the Cold War when Mikhail Gorbachev reluctantly  
concluded that he couldn't talk Reagan out of SDI (at Geneva or elsewhere),  
and that the miserable Soviet economy couldn't match U.S. expenditures for  
building a nuclear defense. When Reagan called on Gorbachev to tear down  
the Berlin Wall, the media laughed; but SDI turned that "pie-in-the-sky"  
prediction into reality.  <br>
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Democratic-controlled Congresses never voted the funds to deploy SDI,  
but they did tolerate limited funding for research and development.  
Fortunately that (combined with the collapsing Soviet economy) turned out  
to be enough to checkmate Gorbachev. <br> 
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;General Graham had a much-decorated 30-year military career that included  
service in Germany, Korea and Vietnam and was capped by serving as director  
of the Defense Intelligence Agency. In retirement, he rejected lucrative  
offers from defense contractors and dedicated his life to American national  
defense.  <br>
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As Ronald Reagan's military adviser in his 1976 and 1980 campaigns, Dan  
Graham laid out for his candidate the folly and culpable negligence of the  
Federal Government's leaving America totally undefended against incoming  
nuclear missiles. Graham's coaching led Ronald Reagan to articulate the  
crucial question on March 23, 1983: "Would it not be better to save lives  
than to avenge them?"  <br>
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;America's national grand strategy, developed by Secretary of Defense Robert  
McNamara in the early 1960s, was still in 1983 totally based on killing  
Russians instead of on protecting the lives of Americans. This strategy,  
called Mutual Assured Destruction, was known by its appropriate acronym  
MAD.  <br>
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This theory proclaimed the notion that the way to avoid nuclear war was (a)  
not to build any defensive weapons, but instead (b) to threaten the Soviets  
that, if they fired their nuclear missiles at us, we would retaliate with  
our offensive nukes and kill tens of millions of Russians. If this scenario  
ever took place, tens of millions of Americans would die because our  
government had done nothing at all to protect them.  <br>
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;MAD was a suicide pact -- a strategy of revenge, rather than defense. Dan  
Graham said there must be a better way.  <br>
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The better way developed by Graham was originally called High Frontier  
(because space is the high frontier of America's future), and was later  
called SDI. It is a plan for a layered defense, in which non-nuclear  
weapons shot from satellites in space and from ground bases in this country  
would destroy enemy nuclear missiles in flight before they incinerated  
Americans.  <br>
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dan Graham had the vision that a defense was both essential and doable, he  
was the salesman who persuaded Ronald Reagan and other public officials and  
opinion makers that it was sound political and military strategy, he  
assembled the scientists and engineers who proved it would work, he raised  
the funds to do all of the above, and he was a veritable machine grinding  
out refutations of the attacks launched on High Frontier/SDI by those  
determined to mislead the public with deceptive criticisms.  <br>
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;General Graham had to fend off the Ted Kennedy claque who tried to ridicule  
High Frontier as "Star Wars," and the liberal Democrats who are viscerally  
opposed to spending any money on defense. Graham had to withstand  
opposition from Paul Nitze and the internationalists who opposed SDI  
because they sought nuclear disarmament through international agencies, and  
from the arms control lobby, which had a vested interest in continuing  
their jobs attending international meetings where they tilted about arcane  
nuclear weapons statistics.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A couple of weeks ago, President Clinton vetoed the defense authorization  
which funded SDI, claiming that it is "on a collision course with the ABM  
treaty." That document is a relic of the Cold War, which continues to  
impose MAD on us and restricts our constitutional right to "provide for the  
common defense."  <br>
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The nuclear threat today is from attacks by the several rogue nations that  
now possess ballistic missiles. The ABM treaty cannot protect us against  
them, but SDI can.  <br>
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Where there is no vision, the people perish." General Daniel O. Graham had  
the vision for a "Defense that Defends." As a fitting tribute to a great  
patriot, let us work to make it a reality.

<P>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the coming days, the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations
may take up the matter of ratifying the Strategic Arms Reduction
Talks (START II) Treaty. Signed by President George Bush on January
3, 1993, START II requires that the United States and Russia reduce
their strategic nuclear arsenals to no more than 3,500 deliverable
warheads. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee should not consent
to the ratification of START II, and thereby allow the U.S. strategic
nuclear arsenal to shrink to such low levels, unless the Clinton
Administration first makes some changes in the U.S. nuclear force
posture, strategy, and policy. Before reductions are made, the
U.S. must be committed to four goals:
<P>
1) Building a national missile defense system;
<P>
2) Devising a backup plan in case the reductions process breaks
down;
<P>
3) Continuing nuclear testing to ensure a safe and reliable arsenal;
and
<P>
4) Establishing a clear strategic nuclear targeting policy.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Senate can ensure that these changes are made by imposing
conditions on the ratification of START II. These are conditions
which the Clinton Administration would have to meet before the
treaty could be brought into force. While these conditions do
not affect the draft of the treaty, and thus would not involve
a renegotiation with the Russians, they would mandate that the
Clinton Administration correct some of the serious flaws in its
nuclear, strategic, and arms control policies.
<P>
<b>PROBLEMS WITH CLINTON'S STRATEGIC POLICY</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;On September 22, 1994, the Clinton Administration released a study
of U.S. nuclear doctrine and force structure called the Nuclear
Posture Review (NPR).<sup>1</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The study was designed to establish a new nuclear policy for the
United States covering 1) nuclear doctrine, 2) the force structure
for both strategic and tactical nuclear weapons, 3) nuclear arms
control matters, 4) nuclear command and control, and 5) safety
issues. One of the most important of the NPR's findings was that
the doctrine of intentional vulnerability to nuclear attack, called
Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD), should be replaced with a
doctrine called Mutual Assured Safety (MAS). Another major conclusion
was that the U.S. should retain the existing &quot;triad&quot;
of intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic
missiles, and heavy bombers, even with a smaller nuclear arsenal.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The NPR, however, presents a number of problems which must be
solved before the Senate agrees to ratify START II. Indeed, solving
these problems should be conditions which the Senate imposes on
the Administration before consenting to ratification.<sup>2</sup> 
<P>
<ul>
<LI><B>Problem #1: The Nuclear Posture Review fails to establish a
proper role for strategic defenses. </B>While the NPR declares
that Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) has been replaced with
Mutual Assured Safety (MAS), it fails to provide a clear definition
of this new doctrine. Furthermore, it fails to acknowledge that
strategic defenses, and particularly missile defenses, can play
an indispensable role in buttressing MAS.<sup>3</sup>  Discussion of strategic
defenses was omitted because such weapons are not nuclear-armed
and therefore were deemed to be outside the scope of the study.
This is a mistake. What matters is the strategic nature of missile
defenses, not whether they are nuclear-armed. Missile defenses
are strategic weapons that must be considered in devising a strategy
of Mutual Assured Safety.
<P>
<LI><B>Solution #1: Condition the ratification of START II on submitting
a plan to deploy strategic defenses. </B>In light of the decision
to replace MAD with MAS, the Clinton Administration needs to revisit
the recommendation to defer deployment of strategic defenses.
The President made this decision in 1993 when his Administration
completed its study of conventional military forces, called the
Bottom-Up Review. A deployment plan should provide for defenses
not only against ballistic missiles, but against bombers and cruise
missiles as well. Absent such a plan, U.S. territory and the American
people will remain vulnerable to the broad array of strategic
weapons deployed by foreign countries. This vulnerability will
exist at a time when an increasing number of countries are building
ballistic missiles and the political stability of Russia is uncertain.
The Clinton Administration needs to back up its MAS promises with
action. It needs to present a plan for deploying missile defenses.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Senate can require the President to order the Secretary of
Defense to revisit the issue of deploying strategic defenses.
Both the House and Senate versions of the FY 1996 Defense authorization
bill already contain provisions requiring the Secretary of Defense
to produce a plan for developing and perhaps deploying a national
missile defense system. But the bill is bogged down in a House-Senate
conference and under the threat of a veto by the President. To
get around this problem, the Senate could impose a condition on
the ratification of START II:  The President should order the
Secretary of Defense to submit a plan to Congress for deployment
of strategic defenses.
<P>
<LI><B>Problem #2: The Clinton Administration has failed to articulate
which steps should be taken if the arms reduction process breaks
down.</B> The NPR requires the Pentagon to maintain a &quot;hedge&quot;
against a breakdown in the arms control process. It fails to state,
however, which steps the U.S. would take under adverse circumstances.
For example, nothing is said about what the U.S. should do if
the Russians delay in implementing the START treaties, or refuse
even to comply with them. In short, the term &quot;hedge&quot;
remains undefined. Since the NPR's force structure recommendations
are predicated on the implementation of START II and START I,
the Clinton Administration essentially is assuming that nothing
can go wrong with the reduction process.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But something already is going wrong:  America is reducing its
nuclear arsenal faster than Russia. The U.S. has cut its arsenal
to 6,000 deliverable warheads, while Russia retains 9,000.<sup>4</sup>  This
kind of unilateral disarmament undermines the strategic balance.
If this trend continues, America may end up with too few weapons
to cover all its strategic targets. Even if the Russians are not
technically in violation of START II, a targeting disparity could
emerge if the U.S. continues to disarm unilaterally. If the U.S.
rushes to disarm too quickly, there will be a disparity between
the number of U.S. nuclear warheads and their respective targets
in Russia  the very nuclear missiles the Russians have been so
slow to dismantle. If Russia were to drag its feet, it would violate
START II. As things now stand, the U.S. would have no recourse
but to issue diplomatic complaints about such violations. There
currently are no provisions specifying how the U.S. strategic
force posture should be adjusted if the disarmament process breaks
down.
<P>
<LI><B>Solution #2: Condition ratification of START II on a halt in
U.S. reductions and, if necessary, the reconstitution of U.S.
strategic nuclear forces if the disarmament process breaks down.
</B>The Clinton Administration, at a minimum, needs to declare
that it will halt the disarmament process if the disparity in
the pace of U.S. and Russian reductions becomes too great. In
addition, the U.S. should state unequivocally that if the Russians
seem poised to break out of the START treaties, it will reconstitute
its nuclear force to the levels necessary to hold the larger Russian
nuclear force at risk.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Thus, in keeping with these provisions, before it agrees to the
ratification of START II, the Senate should impose the following
requirements on the President:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> <b>A declaration</b> that the U.S. will halt reductions and reconstitute
the strategic nuclear force if the disarmament process breaks
down;
<P>
<LI> <b>A halt</b> to dismantling strategic nuclear weapons under START
I and START II any time the number of accountable warheads in
the strategic nuclear arsenal of the United States is 500 fewer
than in the strategic nuclear arsenal of Russia;
<P>
<LI> <b>A resumption</b> of U.S. reductions only after Russia has lowered
its strategic nuclear arsenal to a level equal to that of the
United States; and
<P>
<LI><b> A plan</b> to begin rebuilding U.S. strategic nuclear forces in
six months if the number of accountable Russian warheads has not
been reduced to U.S. levels.
</UL>
<P>
<LI><B>Problem #3: The Clinton Administration has no plan if countries
other than Russia build or expand their nuclear arsenals.</B>
The NPR, for good reasons, is focused primarily on Russia. To
be sure, Russia retains one of the largest strategic nuclear arsenals
in the world. Moreover, it remains the only country capable of
destroying the U.S. Nevertheless, because START I and START II
will shrink America's nuclear arsenal dramatically, the U.S. must
be cognizant of nuclear weapons development in other countries
 such known proliferators as China and North Korea, for example
 which may threaten the American people. Otherwise, the combined
threat of Russian and other nuclear arsenals could put the U.S.
at a strategic disadvantage. 
<P>
<B>Solution #3: Condition ratification of START II on a declaration
that the U.S. will withdraw from START II if countries other than
Russia significantly expand their nuclear arsenals. </B>Article
VI of the START II Treaty permits either party to withdraw, with
six months notice, if it determines that &quot;extraordinary events
related to the subject matter of this Treaty have jeopardized
its supreme interests.&quot;  The Senate should require the President
to notify the Russians that the expansion of strategic arsenals
by countries other than Russia may well cause the U.S. to exercise
its option to withdraw under Article VI.
<P>
<LI><B>Problem #4: The Clinton Administration has failed to explain
how the U.S. can retain a modern, safe, and reliable nuclear arsenal
without nuclear testing. </B>The NPR fails to explain how the
safety and reliability of the nuclear arsenal it recommends can
be ensured absent underground explosive tests of nuclear weapons.
If the NPR is clear in declaring that the U.S. will remain a nuclear
power for the foreseeable future, it is not clear as to how it
will assure this outcome without conducting explosive weapons
tests. President Clinton announced on August 11 that he desires
to extend the current moratorium on U.S. nuclear testing until
the ratification of a comprehensive test ban treaty. In reality,
a modern, safe, and reliable nuclear arsenal cannot be maintained
under a comprehensive test ban. The U.S. cannot remain a nuclear
power indefinitely, nor can it modernize its arsenal, if a truly
comprehensive ban on testing is adopted.<sup>5</sup>
<P>
<LI><B>Solution #4: Condition ratification of START II on the resumption
of nuclear testing. </B>The Senate needs to be absolutely clear
in expressing its determination that the U.S. will retain the
capable and reliable nuclear arsenal recommended by the NPR. It
can do so by requiring the Clinton Administration to order the
Department of Energy to conduct at least one underground nuclear
test per year until a comprehensive test ban treaty is ratified
by the United States and enters into force.
<P>
<LI><B>Problem #5: The Clinton Administration has failed to clarify
the connection between its strategic policy of Mutual Assured
Safety (MAS) and the targeting requirements established for the
U.S. strategic nuclear arsenal.</B> A strategic policy like Mutual
Assured Safety is designed to define both the purpose and the
mission of the strategic nuclear arsenal. The purpose should be
to deter an enemy attack on the U.S. or, if deterrence fails,
to stop that attack with nuclear weapons and strategic defenses.
The mission of U.S. strategic forces, whether they be offensive
or defensive, can be defined by assigning enemy missiles and other
strategic objects as &quot;targets&quot; for U.S. forces (called
targeting requirements).<sup>6</sup>  For example, if the mission of the strategic
nuclear arsenal is to deter an attack by threatening the civilian
populations of potential aggressor nations, the targets will be
urban centers. If, on the other hand, the mission is to deter
attack by threatening enemy missiles, the missiles themselves
will be the targets.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The public description of the NPR provides only the most cursory
definition of the targeting requirements it established for the
strategic nuclear arsenal. The NPR is classified, but press releases
state only that targeting requirements are based on &quot;projected
military requirements.&quot;<sup>7</sup>  Absent some explanation of what
&quot;projected military requirements&quot; means, there is no
clear indication that these targeting requirements are connected
in any way to MAS policy. In other words, it is not clear whether
potential enemy missiles will be targeted for destruction by America's
offensive and defensive strategic arsenal. If they are not, Clinton's
MAS policy will have no practical meaning.
<P>
<LI><B>Solution #5: Condition ratification of START II on the establishment
of strategic targeting requirements that assume the destruction
of weapons that threaten the United States. </B>If the word &quot;safety&quot;
has any meaning, the Clinton Administration's strategic policy
should seek to protect the American people against nuclear weapons.
How can safety be achieved?  By developing a strategic mission
for both offensive and defensive weapons that would destroy enemy
missiles and the infrastructure that supports them. The infrastructure
would include such things as strategic nuclear command and control
centers and storage facilities. The purpose of this strategy would
be to use both offensive (nuclear missiles and bombers) and defensive
(anti-missile missiles) weapons to limit damage from an attack
on the U.S.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Senate can ensure that these targeting requirements are reflected
in America's strategic policy. The Senate can condition the ratification
of START II on adoption of these targeting requirements. Furthermore,
the Administration should be required to certify that the vast
majority of U.S. strategic weapons are targeted on the weapons
that threaten U.S. territory and their supporting infrastructure.
This will ensure that the Administration has taken the necessary
steps to implement the targeting policy required by the condition.<sup>8</sup>
 Finally, the Senate should require the Administration to notify
both houses of Congress in advance of any future changes in strategic
targeting policy. With this provision, future Congresses will
not be caught by surprise in the event there is a decision to
change the targeting policy. 
<P>
</UL>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton Administration's Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) has
declared that Mutually Assured Destruction is no longer U.S. policy.
This is a step in the right direction. The U.S. is entering a
period in world history where the threat of retaliation with nuclear
weapons is less likely to deter an attack on the U.S. But the
NPR also contains a number of problems. It does not account adequately
for the role of strategic defenses, and it fails to explain how
the U.S. would react if the nuclear arms reduction process breaks
down. Until these problems are resolved, it would be foolish for
the Senate to agree to the dramatic reductions in the U.S. strategic
nuclear arsenal required by START II.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Senate Foreign Relations Committee can use the opportunity
presented by the ratification of START II to solve the problems
presented by the NPR. This can be done by imposing conditions
on the ratification of START II. Once these conditions are imposed,
the Senate can and should consent to ratification. Only then can
the treaty really help to protect the American people from nuclear
attack.

<P>
Sample Resolution of Ratification
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<I>Resolved, (two-thirds of the Senators present concurring therein),</I>
That the Senate advise and consent to the ratification of the
Treaty Between the United States of America and the Russian Federation
on Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Weapons
signed at Moscow on January 3, 1993, including Protocols on Elimination
or Conversion and Inspections, and Memorandum of Understanding
on Warhead Attribution (all transmitted within Treaty Doc. 103-1);
all such documents being integral parts of, and collectively referred
to as, the &quot;START II Treaty,&quot; subject to the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> (1) CONDITIONS.  The Senate's advice and consent to the ratification
of the START II Treaty is subject to the following conditions,
which shall be binding upon the President:
<P>
(1) A PLAN FOR DEPLOYING STRATEGIC DEFENSES.  Prior to the exchange
of the instruments of ratification of the START II Treaty, the
President shall order the Secretary of Defense to submit to the
Senate and the House of Representatives, by no later than six
months following the issuance of the order, a plan that --
<UL> 
<P>
<LI>(A) recommends the deployment of strategic defenses to counter
the following strategic weapons, which may be used to attack the
territory of the United States and against which the offensive
strategic nuclear arsenal cannot readily be used:  1) mobile intercontinental
ballistic missiles; 2) submarine-launched ballistic missiles;
3) long-range bombers; 4) cruise missiles;
<P>
<LI>(B) recommends providing the means for destroying at least 50
percent of weapons in each category of weapons described in subparagraph
(A) likely to be deployed by Russia after the implementation of
the START II Treaty;
<P>
<LI>(C) includes a plan for the deployment of a national missile defense
system that combines sea-based and space-based systems such that
when the entire system is deployed it is capable of meeting the
requirements established by subparagraph (B) for countering mobile
intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-launched ballistic
missiles.
</UL>
<P>
<LI>(2) PRESIDENTIAL ORDER ON HALTING THE DISARMAMENT PROCESS AND
RECONSTITUTING THE STRATEGIC NUCLEAR FORCE.  Prior to the exchange
of the instruments of ratification of the START II Treaty, the
President shall issue an order to the Department of Defense requiring
it to  
<P>
<UL>
<LI>(A) discontinue dismantling strategic nuclear weapons under the
START Treaty and the START II Treaty at any time the number of
accountable warheads in the strategic nuclear arsenal of the United
States is 500 fewer than in the strategic nuclear arsenal of Russia;
<P>
<LI>(B) resume dismantling the strategic nuclear weapons of the United
States after the United States halts the disarmament process pursuant
to the requirements of subparagraph (A) only after Russia has
reduced its strategic nuclear arsenal to a level equal to that
of the United States in terms of accountable warheads;
<P>
<LI>(C) initiate the drafting of a plan to reconstitute U.S. strategic
nuclear forces at the time the United States halts the disarmament
process pursuant to the requirement established by subparagraph
(A), which shall be submitted to the President for his consideration
if the number of accountable warheads in the strategic nuclear
arsenal of Russia has not been reduced to a level that equals
the number of accountable nuclear warheads in the strategic arsenal
of the United States by six months following the initiation of
the drafting of the plan. 
</UL>
<P>
<LI>(3) EXPANDING STRATEGIC ARSENALS IN COUNTRIES OTHER THAN RUSSIA.
 If during the time the START II Treaty remains in force there
is an expansion of strategic arsenals by countries not party to
the Treaty, the supreme interests of the United States could be
jeopardized. Should that occur, it would constitute a basis for
withdrawal from the START II Treaty. This statement shall be communicated
by the President to the Russian Federation, in such form as he
deems appropriate.
<P>
<LI>(4) NUCLEAR TESTING.  Prior to the exchange of the instruments
of ratification of the START II Treaty, the President shall issue
an order to the Department of Energy requiring it to  
<P>
<UL>
<LI>(A) conduct no less than one underground nuclear explosive test
in each fiscal year, beginning with the fiscal year that starts
immediately following the entry of the START II Treaty into force;
<P>
<LI>(B) halt the conduct of underground nuclear tests only after the
United States and an adequate number of additional countries ratify
a comprehensive test ban treaty in order to bring the test ban
treaty into force;
<P>
<LI>(C) pay for the tests described in subparagraph (A) from funds
Congress may make available to the nuclear stockpile stewardship
program.
</UL>
<P>
<LI>(5) STRATEGIC NUCLEAR TARGETING REQUIREMENTS.  Prior to the exchange
of the instruments of ratification of the START II Treaty, the
President shall certify to the Senate that  
<P>
<UL>
<LI>(A) the targeting requirements for strategic nuclear weapons of
the United States, along with those for strategic defensive weapons,
are based on a policy that seeks to limit, to the greatest extent
possible, the damage that would otherwise be inflicted on the
territory of the United States from an attack with strategic weapons
by seeking to destroy such weapons and their supporting infrastructure
in a timely and effective manner;
<P>
<LI>(B) the strategic nuclear weapons of the United States, along
with strategic defensive weapons, are now targeted primarily,
although not necessarily exclusively, on the strategic weapons
deployed by nations other than the United States that may pose
a threat to the territory of the United States and their supporting
infrastructure;
<P>
<LI>(C) the Senate and the House of Representatives shall be notified
in advance of any future changes in the policy governing the targeting
requirements for the strategic nuclear weapons of the United States.

<h2>FEDERALLY SUBSIDIZED NATIONAL TRUST LOBBIES CONGRESS</H2><br>

<p>
The National Trust for Historic Preservation (NTHP) receives approximately $7 million each year from the American taxpayers.  As part of its effort to set budget priorities and balance the budget, the House Appropriations Committee has decided to phase out federal funding for this organization over the next two years. An amendment by Representative Tom DeLay (R-TX) that would have eliminated the subsidy in just one year was defeated by voice vote in committee.
<p>
	In recent years, the Trust has lobbied Congress to expand the historic rehabilitation tax credit (at a cost of $1.4 billion over five years, according to the Trust itself1) and has fought economic development nationwide, including a proposed Disney theme park in Virginia.2  It should come as no surprise that the Trust appears to have mobilized its forces to oppose these proposed cuts in its federal support.
<p>
	In a June 28, 1995, letter to members of the House of Representatives, Trust President Richard Moe declares that "Congress has given the National Trust a central role in the federal historic preservation program under our 1949 charter and the National Historic Preservation Act, as passed in 1966 and amended in 1992."  Despite this self-described pseudo-governmental role, the organization has chosen to mount a full-scale lobbying campaign against the funding reduction.

<blockquote><b>"VOTE NO ON AMENDMENT BY REP. DELAY TO ELIMINATE  FUNDING
FOR THE NATIONAL TRUST FOR HISTORIC PRESERVATION"</b></blockquote>
<p>
declares the headline on the National Trust's letter. Attached to the two-page text of the letter is a two-page target list of members who voted against cutting the NTHP's funding in 1993. 
<p>
	The National Trust for Historic Preservation's letter clearly shows the trouble with taxpayer-subsidized political advocacy.  In its fight to continue feeding at the public trough, the Trust has given the American people a good look at their tax dollars at work.

INTRODUCTION

<P>
     Many American policy makers over the past decade have replaced
calls for more free trade with demands for "fair trade." The United
States, they say, should keep its markets opened to imports, but must
also act aggressively against "unfair" trade practices by foreign
businesses and governments. One of the pillars of this "fair trade"
approach is a set of so-called antidumping and countervailing duty
laws. (Both antidumping laws and countervailing duty laws shall
hereinafter be referred to simply as antidumping laws, unless
otherwise noted.) Antidumping laws seek to prevent products
manufactured overseas from being sold by foreign firms in the U.S. at
"less than fair value." Countervailing duties seek to offset the
subsidies that foreign governments provide for some exporting firms by
imposing duties on the goods these firms export to the U.S. 
<P>
     While duties and restrictions designed to achieve so-called fair
trade seem reasonable to many Americans, in reality their effect is
anything but fair or beneficial to U.S. consumers. The antidumping
laws are confusing and arbitrary, and in many instances merely allow
American firms to secure punitive tariffs against competing importers
where no unfair trade practices are involved. Worse, these laws drive
up the costs of imported components used by other American
enterprises, making their products less competitive in world markets.
As a result, American consumers pay higher prices for both imported
and domestically produced goods, and American workers find fewer
employment opportunities in less competitive American firms. 
<P>
     When an American firm accuses a foreign firm of dumping in the
U.S. market, the Commerce Department must compare the price of the
good in the home market of the foreign firm and the price it is sold
for in the U.S. If the U.S. price does not reflect "fair market
value," as determined by the Commerce Department, the foreign firm can
be found guilty of dumping. 
<P>
     Complex and Arcane Methods. The problem is that the methods the
Commerce Department employs are complex, arcane, and plagued with
conceptual and technical problems. And because so many aspects of
estimating the fair market value are subjective, it is easy for the
Commerce Department to "prove" dumping when in fact no dumping has
occurred. This can happen for a number of reasons:
<P>
    <UL> When no government subsidy is involved, the definition of 
     an "unfair" price is arbitrary.
<P>
     The Commerce Department often will compare the prices of
     different rather than the identical products, so price
     comparisons are subjective.
<P>
     The Commerce Department often will subtract expenses 
     from foreign products sold in the U.S. in making its 
     calculation, but not subtract the same expenses incurred 
     in the home market. 
<P>
     The Commerce Department often neglects to take into account
     exchange rate fluctuations in its comparative price 
     calculations for the home and export markets.
<P>
     When determining prices in the foreign market, the Commerce
     Department sometimes will use an "average foreign price" for 
     a product, which does not take into account price fluctuations 
     at the time of the sale. Moreover, Commerce often will neglect 
     to take into account the differences in wholesale and retail
     prices.
<P>
     In many cases, the Commerce Department requires accused foreign
     firms to supply a massive amount of information, including
     business secrets, to determine foreign production costs. If the
     information supplied is not satisfactory to Department
     investigators, they may use production cost estimates by
     different firms in third countries, even though these costs are
     not comparable to production costs in the home market.</UL>
<P>
     These practices by the Commerce Department routinely result in
inaccurate production cost determinations, causing many companies to
be found guilty of dumping, even when no such action occurred. In some
cases, these questionable practices are simply the product of
overzealous officials. But for the most part, these problems are
systemic, rooted in the dumping laws themselves.
<P>
     To promote free trade and thus to give consumers full access to
the products they want, the Bush Administration should seek the
support of Congress to end harmful dumping determinations that
artificially raise the prices of certain imports. Specifically, it
should:
<P>
    <UL> **Seek agreement in the current Uruguay Round of General
      Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT) talks for a multi-
      lateral phase-out of antidumping laws in exchange for 
      stricter limits on government subsidies to industries. 
<P>
     **Commission a study of the damage done to American business 
      and consumers by antidumping laws.
<P>
     **Propose interim legislation that incorporates the initial 
      intent of the Antidumping Act of 1916.</UL>
<P>
     Antidumping laws originally sought to prevent foreign exporters
from using predatory pricing to undermine American businesses. The
burden of proof was on the government and American businesses. But
these laws have evolved into yet another form of trade protection,
which American firms can use to keep out competitors, whether or not
they are engaged in unfair trade practices. If the U.S. is to be the
leading advocate of free trade in the world, and keep its own market
open as well, it should eliminate its unfair trade practices.

<P>
THE EVOLUTION OF DUMPING LAWS IN THE U.S.
<P>
     According to the U.S. Department of Commerce definition,
"dumping" occurs when, "... a good is sold for less than its 'fair
value,' generally meaning it is exported for less than it is sold in
the domestic market or third country markets or it is sold for less
than production cost." (Reference Terms of International Trade, United
States Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration,
Washington, D.C., July 1987, p. 4.) Since 1897, the U.S. effectively
has had antidumping laws on the books, and these laws have enabled the
U.S. government to punish firms in other countries that send
subsidized exports to the U.S. (Countervailing Duty Law of 1897, 19
U.S.C. 1303.)
<P>
     It was not until 1916, however, that Congress passed a law
specifically targeting dumping. According to the Antidumping Act of
that year, for dumping to occur, a "predatory intent" by the exporter
must be shown. (Antidumping Act of 1916, 15 U.S.C. 71.) In other
words, the exporter must intend to sell its products in the U.S. at
below production cost in order to cause material injury to an existing
U.S. company. (This act is codified in Section 801 of the Revenue Act
of 1916.) This law came in an era in which the federal government also
enacted antitrust laws to prevent American enterprises from pursuing
similar predatory practices against their domestic competitors.
<P>
     With the Antidumping Act of 1921, Congress loosened the
requirements to permit federal action to keep out foreign products not
only if foreign companies engaged in predatory pricing, but merely if
their products were deemed to be priced lower than similar American
products, regardless of whether predatory pricing was an issue.
("Comparison of U.S. and Foreign Antidumping Practices," United States
General Accounting Office, Report No. GAO/NSIAD-91-59, November 1990,
p. 8.) This Act forms the basis for America's current antidumping law.
The Antidumping Act was incorporated into the 1930 Tariff Act, and
later amended by the 1979 Trade Act, the 1984 Trade Act, and the 1988
Trade Act. ("1992 Trade Policy Agenda and 1991 Annual Report of the
President of the United States on the Trade Agreements Program,"
Office of the United States Trade Representative, Executive Office of
the President, Washington, D.C., 1991, p. 78.) These revisions made it
easier for American companies to initiate dumping complaints, and for
the U.S. government to restrict foreign imports that are sold at lower
prices than similar American products. 
<P>
     Several multilateral agreements also have addressed the dumping
issue. The Kennedy Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT), held between 1963 and 1967, resulted in the GATT Antidumping
Code. This code sets out guidelines under which countries may act
against foreign firms that practice predatory pricing resulting in
material injury to an industry based in the importing country.
("Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade," June 30, 1967, GATT BISD, 15th Supp., 1968, p.
24.) GATT itself does not establish specific definitions of what
constitutes dumping or act against countries that dump; it simply
creates the guidelines on which countries can adopt their own laws to
prevent dumping. The code was amended during the Tokyo Round of GATT,
held between 1973 to 1979. ("Agreement on Implementation of Article VI
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade," April 12, 1979, GATT,
BISD 26th Supp., 1979, p. 171.) Of the 103 members of GATT, however,
only 25 have signed on to this amended code. (These are: Australia,
Austria, Brazil, Canada, Czechoslovakia, the European Community,
Egypt, Finland, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico,
New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, Singapore, Spain,
Sweden, Switzerland, the United States, and Yugoslavia. The European
Community is considered one member, with the exception of Spain, which
signed the GATT antidumping code separately.) The Tokyo Round
agreement mandates that all antidumping investigations be reported
immediately to GATT and that a semiannual report on antidumping cases
be forwarded by the signature countries to the GATT Secretariat. ("Use
of the GATT Antidumping Code," General Accounting Office, Washington
D.C., GAO/NSIAD-90-238FS, July 1990, p. 2.) According to the Code,
each signatory can legislate and administer its antidumping code, as
long as it conforms to GATT standards. (These standards are explained
in Article VI of the GATT Agreement.) As recently as this year, the
GATT has found the U.S. violating the intent of international
guidelines to which the laws of signatory countries must conform.
Specifically, the GATT accused the U.S of making it too easy for
American enterprises to obtain punitive tariffs against foreign
products. The U.S. so far has ignored the GATT warning, indicating to
other countries that the U.S. does not intend to play fair in trade.
("GATT: U.S. Bars Cheaper Imports," The Washington Times, March 13,
1992, p. C3.)
<P>
     The Growth in Cases. Recently the number of dumping cases
instigated by American businesses using U.S. laws has grown. Many U.S.
industries that in the past might have sought trade protection
directly from Congress have found this route more difficult as
successive GATT rounds have eliminated many forms of direct trade
protectionism. U.S. antidumping laws thus have proved to be a more
convenient tool to limit competition by denying foreigners access to
the U.S. market. The U.S. steel industry, for example, has received
trade protection for almost two decades. In 1992, however, the quota
system that had protected the U.S. industry expired. As a result, the
industry has flooded the Department of Commerce and the International
Trade Commission with new dumping complaints.
<P>
     During the 1980s, 1,456 antidumping cases were reported to the
GATT. Australia, the United States, Canada, and the European Community
accounted for 95 percent of those cases. The U.S. was responsible for
90 percent of all countervailing duty cases initiated between 1980 and
1986. (Jeffrey J. Schott, "The Global Trade Negotiations: What Can Be
Achieved?" Policy Analysis in International Economics #29 (Washington,
D.C.: Institute for International Economics, September 1990), p. 17.)
In 1980, there were only 83 outstanding U.S. antidumping orders on
foreign imports. By 1990, outstanding antidumping orders had increased
to 197. In that year, the U.S. government considered 27 dumping
complaints, and almost 200 separate dumping orders were, in effect,
imposing duties and higher prices on one or more products from 42
different countries. This was up from 84 orders on 23 countries in
1980. (From an unpublished forthcoming study by Keith Anderson, Senior
Advisor to the Vice Chairman Anne Brunsdale, International Trade
Commission, Washington, D.C.) And in the first ten months of 1991, the
number of new dumping complaints considered by the U.S. was more than
double the 1990 figure. ("GATT: U.S. Bars Cheaper Imports," The
Washington Times, March 13, 1992, p. C3.) 
<P>

HOW THE U.S. GOVERNMENT DETERMINES "DUMPING"
<P>
     The Investigation Process. The U.S. Department of Commerce and
the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) jointly administer
America's cumbersome antidumping law. The steps in a dumping case are
as follows: 
<P>

1)   A U.S. company submits a petition to the International Trade
     Administration at the Department of Commerce, alleging that a
     foreign company is dumping its product in the U.S.
<P>
2)   If the Commerce Department determines that sufficient evidence
     exits, it will proceed with an investigation.
<P>
3)   The ITC then may start its own investigation to determine whether
     there is injury to any domestic companies.
<P>
4)   If the ITC finds there has been material injury to a U.S.
     company, the Commerce Department will determine whether the
     product in question is being sold in the U.S. at "less than fair
     value," or at a lower price than that sold in the home market or
     a third country market.
<P>
5)   If the Department issues a preliminary finding that sufficient
     evidence of such pricing practices exists, it will direct the
     U.S. Customs Service to suspend the importation of the product,
     or require U.S. importers of the product to post a deposit. This 
     bond must be paid to the U.S government in the event that a final
     determination finds that the product is being sold at less than
     fair value.
<P>
6)   The ITC, at this point, must determine if there is any actual
     material damage to U.S. companies caused by the alleged dumped
     imports.
<P>
7)   If the ITC determines that the dumping has caused injury to a
     U.S. manufacturer, the products then are subjected to
     "antidumping duties" equal to the amount of the determined
     dumping margin. The dumping margin is the difference between the
     price of the "dumped product" and the price the product would
     sell for if it were being sold at a "fair" price, according to
     calculations by the ITC. If, however, the ITC finds that there is
     insufficient evidence, the case is dismissed.
<P>
     Investigation Methods. When the Commerce Department attempts to
determine when a product is being dumped, it compares the "U.S. price"
with the product's "foreign market value." The U.S. price is
determined by the purchase price when the good enters the U.S., minus
packaging costs, import duties, and taxes. In other words, the
exporter's sale price will be reduced by the amount of fees paid and
other pre-sale costs that result from selling products in the U.S.
After this amount is determined, the Commerce Department will then
determine if the price reflects a "fair market value" (FMV). The FMV
can be determined in three ways, namely:
<P>
1)   Home Market Price. (19 U.S.C. Section 1677b(1)(A).) The Commerce
     Department tries to determine how much the same product is sold
     for in the country where it is manufactured. If the price in the
     home market is more than the U.S. purchase price, the Department
     normally finds that dumping has occurred.
<P>
2)   Third Country Price. (19 U.S.C. Section 1677b(1)(B).) If there
     are no home market sales of the product, or the sales are so
     small that it is impossible to determine a market price, the
     price that the product sells for in a third country may be used.
     If that price is higher than in the U.S., the Commerce Department
     normally would find that dumping has occurred.
<P>
3)   Constructed Value. (19 U.S.C. Sections 1677b(a)(2), 1677b(b), and
     1677b(e).) If the market value of the product cannot be
     determined either by a home market price or a third country
     price, the Department will rely on a "constructed value." The
     constructed value method attempts to establish the exact cost of
     production of the product in question by using "best available
     information," which includes financial statements and documents
     on the product and companies in question. If this method is used,
     the U.S. government requires the foreign company under
     investigation to provide financial statements, production cost
     documents, and any other kind of document necessary to determine
     the costs of production.
<P>
     If the company does not provide the information in a specified
period of time, the Commerce Department will then look to a third
country of similar "level of industrialization" to determine how much
"similar" products in that country cost to produce. This might mean
that Commerce will ask the U.S. companies that initiated the case to
provide information on the accused foreign companies. 
<P>
     When it constructs value, the Commerce Department adds an 8
percent profit margin to its calculated production cost to estimate a
"fair" sale price in the U.S. This effectively means that if a foreign
company cannot sell its product in the U.S. for at least an 8 percent
profit, it likely will be found guilty of dumping. If a foreign
company is willing to accept only a 7 percent profit on a shipment of
sweaters, for example, the Commerce Department would find it guilty of
dumping those sweaters in the U.S.

<P>
PROBLEMS WITH U.S. ANTIDUMPING LAWS
<P>
     While the federal government claims that antidumping laws help
fight unfair trade practices by foreign firms or governments, in
reality there are so many problems associated with determining the
existence of dumping that the rules themselves turn out to be unfair.
Among the difficulties: 
<P>
     1)   Defining Unfair Prices. When no government subsidies are
involved, there is no economic case for the claim that selling at
below cost is an unfair practice. The claim of unfairness usually is
based on the fear that a business will use so-called predatory pricing
to drive out its U.S. competitors, leaving it to enjoy a monopoly and
charge U.S. consumers higher prices. But the world market today is so
integrated and competitive that it is virtually impossible for a
company to exploit a dominant share of a market for long, if at all.
Thanks to freer trade in recent decades, there is little chance of an
exporter achieving the power to charge a monopoly price.
<P>
     Another problem with the concept of unfair dumping is that U.S.
firms presumably can cut their prices to "unfair" levels in order to
drive their foreign competitors out of the American market. In other
words, if the U.S. firm is allowed to "dump" in its own market, the
practice is not considered unfair.
<P>
     Finally, it is a common business practice to sell products at a
loss. For example, if a product is not selling well, a business owner
might sell below cost in order to recoup at least some of his
investment in the product. Yet when a foreign firm sells below cost in
the U.S. market, it is considered to be abnormal and unfair.
<P>
     2)   The Problem of Comparing Products. When a U.S. company
charges a foreign company with dumping, the Commerce Department
assumes that the products in question are similar. For example, if
U.S. farmers charge Colombian farmers with dumping, it is assumed that
the American farmers are accusing the Colombians of dumping the
identical crop to that produced by the Americans. Yet many U.S.
dumping cases against foreign products are initiated by American
companies marketing products significantly dissimilar to the products
allegedly dumped. In such cases, when the U.S. Commerce Department
attempts to determine a "fair market value" for the item in question,
it is comparing apples and oranges.
<P>
     In one 1984 dumping case, for example, an Italian company was
found guilty of dumping pads for woodwind musical instruments in the
U.S. Yet the smaller, cheaper, and lower quality woodwind pads sold by
the Italian firm were meant for the lower lines of instruments in the
U.S. market. The firm sold more expensive, higher quality pads for the
top-of-the-line woodwind instruments in the Italian home market. When
Commerce initiated its investigation, it compared the prices of the
two products as though they were identical. (James Bovard, The Fair
Trade Fraud: How Congress Pillages the Consumer and Decimates American
Competitiveness" (New York, St. Martin's Press, 1991), p. 119; also
see Luciano Pisoni Fabbrica Accessori Instrumenti Musicali v. United
States Court of International Trade, No. 84-10-01435, June 12, 1986,
640 F. Supp. 255 (CIT 1986).) This was like a foreign country accusing
America's General Motors of dumping its cars by comparing the price of
an exported Chevette with the price of a luxury Cadillac sold in the
U.S. Not surprisingly, the U.S. government found that the Italian
company was dumping woodwind pads in the U.S. In defending its
actions, Commerce admitted that it did not compare similar products,
but then said that it had the prerogative not to do so.
<P>
     3)   Calculating the Costs Associated with Selling. When the
Commerce Department attempts to determine the fair market value of a
product sold in the U.S., it subtracts various "sales-associated"
costs from the price that the import is selling for in the U.S. For
example, packaging costs, import duties, and other taxes are removed
from the U.S. selling price. Yet when Commerce seeks to determine the
home market value price of the same good, many sales-associated costs
are not eliminated. This can make the base price of the good in the
country of origin appear artificially higher than its base selling
price in the U.S. Thus it gives the incorrect perception the foreign
good is being dumped. 
<P>
     In 1989, for example, the U.S. initiated a dumping investigation
against imported telephone systems. In one step of its investigation,
the Commerce Department deducted the cost of inland freight for Korean
phone systems sold in the U.S. while neglecting to subtract the same
costs for Korean inland freight. The Korean inland freight was higher
because, unlike the shipment of telephone systems to the U.S. that
went to a large distributor, the systems in Korea went directly to
hundreds of different retailers, increasing the cost of distribution.
Thus the price of the product sold in Korea appeared higher than it
actually was when compared to the U.S. price.
<P>
     4)   Adjusting for Exchange Rates. When the Commerce Department
rules that a product is being dumped, it must determine the dumping
margin between the price a product is sold for in the foreign market
and the presumed U.S. market price. To be compared, both of these
prices must be calculated into U.S. dollars. But this creates a
problem. Some business agreements between a foreign company and a U.S.
importer use fixed exchange rate contracts. So the selling price in
the exporter's home currency will fluctuate according to the current
exchange rate, yet production costs remain unchanged. When
investigating a dumping case, however, the U.S. government sometimes
will use the current exchange rate. 
<P>
     This can give a misleading suggestion of dumping, because in the
time between the signing of the contract between the foreign and U.S.
companies and the time of actual delivery of goods, the exchange rate
between the U.S. dollar and the foreign currency might have changed
significantly. Deputy Assistant Secretary Gilbert Kaplan, of the
Commerce Department, noted this problem in a 1986 Senate Finance
Committee hearing. Explained Kaplan, "If the home market price is 200
yen and the U.S. price is $1.00 and the exchange rate is 200 yen equal
$1.00, there is no dumping. If the yen appreciated against the dollar,
however, so that only 150 yen equaled $1.00, unless there was a
corresponding change in prices, suddenly the company is dumping by 33
percent, because 200 yen is now worth $1.33." (United States Congress,
Senate Committee on Finance, "Remedies Against Dumping of Imports,"
July 18, 1986 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office,
1986), p. 35.)
<P>
     5)   Determining the Average Price. When the Commerce Department
attempts to determine the price a foreign good is being sold for in
its home market, it uses an "average price level," usually calculated
over a six-month period. Yet the Department compares this average
foreign price with the U.S. price at a specific time, not an average.
This can create serious distortions in price comparisons. For example,
a product might sell in the U.S. for $100 on a particular date when
competition is particularly fierce. But the price of that product in
the home market might range from $90 to $150 over a six-month period,
for an average of $120. In this situation, the company could be found
to be dumping. But the average price in the U.S. over the same six-
month period also might be $120, meaning that dumping, as defined by
current laws, in fact did not occur. 
<P>
     Another common defect in the Commerce Department price
determination is its practice of comparing retail with wholesale
prices. A company may export a product to the United States at a large
wholesale discount. This is how many American retailers are able to
import large quantities of items at cheaper prices than they could
obtain from domestic sources that do not sell in similar bulk
quantities. Yet the Commerce Department might compare the U.S.
wholesale price with the retail foreign price. In a 1985 case
involving cellular telephones Commerce compared the price of Toshiba's
phones sold to large U.S. wholesale distributors with the price of the
same units sold in Japan directly to retailers. Commerce did not
adjust for the price difference that resulted from selling in the
larger and smaller quantities. As a result, the foreign price appears
higher than the U.S. price, allowing a finding of dumping. (Bovard,
op. cit., p. 122.)
<P>
     6) Determining Production Costs. The Commerce Department uses
several methods to determine the costs of production of a foreign
firm. One method is to require the accused firm to turn over to the
U.S. government certain crucial business documents, including trade
secrets. A foreign company being investigated by Commerce generally
will receive a 50-to-100-page, single-spaced request for information
and be allowed only six to eight weeks to comply with the request.
During that time, the company must:
translate the request in their language for distribution to relevant
company employees;
<P>
     <UL>**identify sales in U.S. and home market;
<P>
     **identify all expenses related to the production and 
      export of the product;
<P>
     **assign each expense to a specific purpose;
<P>
     **conduct its own investigation on home market and U.S. prices.
       (Ibid, p. 135.)</UL>
<P>

     Companies competing internationally understandably are not always
willing to divulge to the U.S. government their business secrets and
other information that could help their U.S. competitors. But even if
they are willing to comply, often it is costly, difficult, or
impossible for foreign firms to gather such massive amounts of
information in the time required. If the Commerce Department does not
receive the information in time, it uses alternative methods to
calculate production costs. One is to compare production costs of
other manufacturers in a third country with a "similar" level of
industrialization. This happened in 1986, when a Chinese cookware
company accused of dumping its products in the U.S. was unable to
comply with Commerce's request for information. In order to determine
production costs Commerce compared the company with cookware
manufacturers in Thailand. The two countries, however, are hardly on
the same level of development. Using purchasing power parity, which
takes into account inflation, exchange rates, and other cost of living
adjustments, per capita gross domestic product in Thailand is about
$3,600, while in China it is $2,600, a $1,000 difference. ("Human
Development Report 1992," United Nations, New York, 1992, pp.
127-128.) Even so, the Commerce Department was unable to persuade Thai
companies to reveal detailed business information of their companies.
So it then used the prosperous countries of France, Norway, and West
Germany for comparing production costs with China. Not surprisingly
Commerce came up with rather large dumping margins.
<P>
     To avoid further dumping charges, some foreign companies found
guilty of dumping will raise prices on their products to exceed the
acceptable margins determined by the Commerce Department. Yet in some
cases, Commerce will change the country previously used for
comparison, and again find the foreign company guilty of dumping.
<P>
     This happened in 1990, when the Commerce Department imposed more
duties on manhole covers from China. In 1986 China had been found to
be dumping manhole covers in the U.S., based on comparisons of costs
of producing those items in Belgium, Canada, France, and Japan. In
1990 the case was reviewed again. This time, the Commerce Department
decided to use the Philippine manhole cover industry as its basis for
comparison even though the Philippine industry did not use pig iron, a
primary ingredient in the Chinese product. Thus the products were not
similar. But by changing the basis of comparison, a higher dumping
margin could be used against the Chinese. (Bovard, op. cit., p.
133-135.)
<P>
     Even when a foreign company goes to extraordinary lengths to
supply information and cooperate fully with the investigation, the
Commerce Department still may say that it is insufficient. In a 1989
case, for instance, SKF of Sweden, a manufacturer of ball bearings,
was accused of dumping antifriction bearings into the U.S. market. SKF
provided the Department with 150,000 pages of data. Still not
satisfied, the Commerce Department gave SKF only one week to make
revisions of several clerical mistakes. Then the Department declared
several figures in this new material supplied by an SKF subsidiary to
be misleading, so it dismissed as erroneous almost all of the material
SKF had supplied. Eventually, SKF delivered over twelve tons of
information to the U.S. government. But because of the errors the
Commerce Department treated SKF as if it had turned over no
information at all and imposed a dumping margin of 180 percent on the
company's products. (United States International Trade Commission,
investigation numbers 303-TA-19, 303-TA-20, and 731-TA-391-399.)
<P>

RECENT DUMPING CASES
<P>
     With the increase of American dumping investigations in recent
years, there have been a number of particularly disturbing cases that
have been plagued by questionable procedures and that in some
instances have hurt U.S. businesses and consumers. Several of these
recent dumping cases underscore the problems with America's dumping
laws. 
<P>
Example: Flat Panel Display (FPD) Screens. In response to a Commerce
Department ruling that flat panel display screens, which are used in
laptop computers and related products, were being dumped in the U.S.
by Japanese companies, the ITC initiated an investigation in February
1991. The ITC in August 1991 found that there was material damage to
American producers and thus recommended a 62.7 percent dumping duty on
imported screens. This left the American computer industry unable to
acquire affordable flat panel displays for their laptop computer
production. The problem with this finding: American manufacturers do
not even sell certain types of these screens in the U.S. market.
<P>
     The investigation focused on two basic types of displays --
electroluminescent FPDs and active matrix FPDs. Electroluminescent
displays generally are monochrome with lower resolution. Active matrix
displays generally are color with higher resolutions. The U.S. has a
large electroluminescent display industry and the Japanese share of
the U.S. market, at the time of the investigation in 1990, was just 5
percent and shrinking. During the time of the investigation, the small
Japanese portion of the U.S. electroluminescent market remained
somewhat steady. But it was clear that the Japanese share of the
American market in electroluminescent screens was not a threat to the
U.S. domestic industry. Still the Commerce Department saw a dumping
problem and levied a 7 percent dumping margin.
<P>
     More significantly, the Commerce Department imposed a 62.7
percent dumping margin for active matrix displays. Yet there is no
commercial U.S. active matrix display industry. There are two U.S.
companies manufacturing these screens, OIS Optical Imaging Systems,
Inc., and Standish Corporation. But their production lines are small
and costly, and the firms for the most part supply these screens only
to the U.S. government for military uses. In essence, what the
Commerce Department and the ITC did was to say that the U.S. active
matrix display industry, made up of two small firms supplying the
government, was being materially injured by Japanese firms exporting
these displays to large U.S. computer manufacturers who needed them
for their laptop computers.
<P>
     Acting ITC Chairman Anne Brunsdale, who dissented from the
opinion, states in the ITC report that, "Apple testified that it
considered OIS at the initial stage of its three-part vendor
evaluation when deciding which FPD to use in its Macintosh portable.
It found that OIS had 'zero high volume manufacturing capability,
little customer support experience, zero manufacturing flexibility,
zero mass production experience and delivery schedule.' It eliminated
OIS at the first stage of consideration." ("Certain High-Information
Content Flat Panel Displays and Display Glass Therefor [sic] from
Japan," United States International Trade Commission, USITC
Publication 2413, Washington, D.C., August 1991, pp. 35-36.) Thus,
American computer manufacturers had determined that there was no
domestic source for the needed display screens. Therefore they bought
their screens from the only available source, the Japanese. Not
sharing Brunsdale's view, the majority of the ITC claimed there was
dumping. But because of the high duties imposed by the federal
government on these high-quality color displays, America's largest
computer manufacturers, Apple, Compaq, and IBM, were left with no
access to affordable components for their laptop manufacturing,
prompting U.S. computer manufacturers to move production facilities
overseas or drop out of the market altogether.
<P>
     Because the decision to impose duties on these display screens
forced many American computer manufacturers to pay higher prices for
imports, the U.S. government action also resulted in the loss of
American jobs. Shortly after the decision to impose duties on active
matrix displays, for example, Toshiba Corporation, which had a
production facility in Irvine, California, announced that it would
shut down the plant and move production back to Japan. The dumping
duty only applied to the screens, which Toshiba imported from its
Japan production facilities to manufacture laptops in California.
Thus, the duty forced Toshiba to fire American workers, close the
plant, and begin assembly of laptops back in Japan. And because the
duty applied only to the flat panel screens, a completed laptop
computer that included the screen was not subjected to the duty. 
<P>
     Apple abandoned plans to manufacture laptop computers in
Fountain, Colorado, in favor of Cork, Ireland, to avoid paying the
duties. IBM also announced that it was considering moving its
production facilities abroad. ("Did Washington Lose Sight of the Big
Picture?" Business Week, December 2, 1991, p. 38.) 
<P>
Example: Antifriction Bearings. U.S. antidumping laws allow even the
smallest American firm to initiate a dumping charge, no matter how
much the domestic demand might be for the foreign products in
question. This allowed a small U.S. manufacturer of ball bearings, the
Torrington Company of Torrington, Connecticut, in 1988 to accuse
virtually all of the world's bearing manufacturers with dumping in the
U.S. The company claimed that firms in nine countries were acting to
undermine Torrington's competitiveness.
<P>
     On October 1988, the ITC initiated an investigation against
bearing manufacturers in Britain, France, Italy, Japan, Romania,
Singapore, Sweden, Thailand, and West Germany. In a May 2, 1989, press
release, Torrington Company President Thomas E. Bennett stated, "There
is clear evidence that dumping has caused long-term, fundamental
damage across the entire bearing industry, affecting all product
types. We will continue to monitor with great vigilance all bearing
imports and will not hesitate to take strong action again to challenge
additional unfair trade practices that are identified." ("Landmark
Dumping Decision Praised by U.S. Bearing Manufacturer," Torrington
Company, Torrington, Connecticut, press release, May 2, 1989.)
<P>
     Yet before the investigation, domestic bearing manufacturers were
unable to supply enough bearings to meet domestic demand. In fact,
many U.S. manufacturers who use ball bearings in their products
testified at ITC hearings that they were unable to find any domestic
producers that could fill their orders. Moreover, in the orders that
were accepted by domestic ball bearing manufacturers, some companies
did not receive shipments in time and in some cases, not at all. Many
American users of ball bearings testified in the investigation that
Torrington had a long history of failing to supply agreed-upon
shipments of bearings. Indeed, the American Manufacturers for Trade in
Bearings released a statement during the investigation declaring that
"[f]oreign producers and domestic consumers of antifriction bearings
emphasized both delivery and reliability problems in their experiences
with Torrington."
<P>
     Despite this, the Commerce Department found dumping margins
ranging up to 212 percent with an average rate of about 60 percent. As
a result, the Department established duty rates based on the dumping
margins, and many American manufacturers that use ball bearings, like
the Briggs and Stratton Company, the General Electric Company,
Hewlett-Packard, and IBM, were forced to pay higher prices for
imported bearings, because domestic suppliers still could not meet the
demand. These duties increased the cost of production of such products
as electronic motors, household appliances, office equipment, and
power tools, which have been passed along to consumers in the form of
higher prices. Increased component costs also have made the products
of American firms less competitive abroad.
<P>
     Torrington still was not satisfied. In 1990, it pressed new
charges against firms in thirteen additional countries: Argentina,
Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Hungary, South Korea, Mexico, Poland,
Spain, Taiwan, Turkey, and Yugoslavia. This time the ITC threw out the
case ruling that no material damage was done. ("U.S. Maker of Ball
Bearings Loses New Dumping Case," The New York Times, March 28, 1991,
p. D5.)
<P>
Example: Uranium. Occasionally a U.S. government agency, rather than a
private company will request an investigation. In 1992, for instance,
two U.S. government-owned uranium mining companies -- one in Ohio and
the other in Kentucky -- requested that the Department of Energy start
an action against uranium imports from countries of the former Soviet
Union. Until recently, these two companies had a virtual monopoly on
uranium production outside the Communist world, allowing them to
charge higher prices. The Commerce Department found Kazakhstan,
Kirgizstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan were exporting
uranium to the U.S. at a price that was not fair to the U.S.
government-owned mining facilities. The Commerce Department attached a
115.82 percent dumping duty on the imports. ("Commerce Dept. Rules
Ex-Soviets Guilty of Uranium Dumping," The Washington Post, May 30,
1992, p. A18.) Unable to obtain information from the republics, the
Department used production information supplied by the petitioners,
that is, the two government-owned companies and the Department of
Energy, and the cost of production in the African country of Namibia
to determine the production costs in the former Soviet republics. This
is ironic since one justification for American countervailing duty law
is to counter government-sponsored or subsidized production and
exports from other countries to the U.S. 
<P>
     If the final decision, expected in August, on this dumping case
goes against the former Soviet republics, they could be assessed
retroactive duties. But the Bush Administration and Congress currently
are debating the amount of foreign aid to give to the former Soviet
republics. It would be ironic if duties are imposed on these uranium
imports, forcing republics to use American foreign aid dollars to pay
dumping fines assessed by the U.S. government. 

<P>
The Retaliation Against U.S. Firms 
<P>
     Many American businesses are growing concerned about the
enforcement of international antidumping laws. The U.S. has made
extensive use of dumping laws to keep out foreign imports, and other
countries have begun to learn that this is a way to introduce
protectionist policies without running afoul of the GATT rules.
American laws have now become the model for dumping legislation. More
and more countries have increased dumping charges against U.S. firms.
From 1980 to 1988, for instance, Canada initiated 55 investigations
against U.S. companies, Australia initiated 52 cases, the European
Community 23 cases, Mexico fourteen, and Argentina six cases, most of
these in the past few years. ("Some Big U.S. Companies Favor Loosening
Anti-Dumping Laws," The Wall Street Journal, August 31, 1990, p. A2.)
Significantly, several countries are using U.S.-style antidumping laws
against American products. South Korea, for example, found in 1990
that America's DuPont Chemical Company was dumping plastic resin at
prices 30 to 90 percent higher than their home prices. A 40 percent to
50 percent duty was recommended. ("A Korean Firm's Dumping Charge
Takes DuPont, Two Others, By Surprise," The Wall Street Journal,
November 8, 1990, p. A20.)
<P>

WHAT THE U.S. SHOULD DO
<P>
     The procedures used by the Department of Commerce to determine if
dumping has occurred are unfair and in many cases result in harm to
U.S. firms as well as higher costs to U.S. consumers. To make the
procedures fairer, and to help stop the danger of retaliation against
U.S. firms, the Bush Administration should:

<P>
1)   Seek agreement in the current round of General Agreement on
     Tariff and Trade talks for a multilateral phase-out of dumping
     laws in exchange for stricter limits on government subsidies to
     industries. <P>
     Like the European Community, the U.S. has been unduly stubborn in
negotiating certain reforms in the current Uruguay Round of GATT. One
such reform is the reduction of excessive use of antidumping laws and
countervailing duties. The U.S. is the biggest abuser of such laws.
There is an international consensus to limit such laws, but U.S. trade
negotiators refuse to consider reform. The Bush Administration,
working through the United States Trade Representa-tive's Office,
should work hard to modify or dismantle potentially dangerous laws,
while pursuing agreements to end government subsidies for exporters.
<P>
2)   Commission a study of the damage done to American businesses 
     and consumers by antidumping laws. 
     Antidumping duties cost the U.S. economy millions, perhaps
billions, each year in higher prices, lost jobs, and declining
competitiveness. No significant studies on these costs have ever been
conducted. The Bush Administration should commission an objective
study of these laws to determine the cost incurred from their usage.
<P>
3)   Propose interim legislation that incorporates the initial 
     intent of the Antidumping Act of 1916.<P>
     The original intent of America's antidumping legislation was to
prevent "predatory pricing" by foreign firms. This required the U.S.
government and the petitioning American company to prove that the
foreign firm was pricing their product with the specific goal of
driving the U.S. company out of business. If this could not be proven,
then no dumping duties would be applied to the foreign product. While
waiting for an international agreement to end these damaging trade
laws, the Bush Administration should propose interim legislation that
requires the Commerce Department and the U.S. firm requesting the
investigation to prove that predatory pricing was being utilized. This
will eliminate some of the most abusive rulings that occur under
current laws.

<P>

CONCLUSION<P>
     The United States government is raising costs for American
consumers and in some instances undermining American competitiveness,
all in the name of fair trade. Supporters of U.S. antidumping laws say
such laws are needed to prevent foreigners from destroying American
jobs and industries. But in practice the application of these laws in
many instances causes more damage and creates more problems than it
solves. Thanks to duties imposed as a result of antidumping laws, U.S.
manufacturers of such products as computers, medical equipment, and
machine tools are paying increased prices for the components they
import to manufacture their products, raising production costs and
making their exports less competitive in world markets. In some cases,
such as computer components, U.S. firms have effectively been denied
needed supplies. And many American jobs are lost when domestic
manufacturers feel forced to move overseas to avoid high duties on
their imported components.
<P>
     While the Bush Administration has been a strong advocate of free
and open trade by supporting such policies as the free trade agreement
with Mexico, and the trade liberalization efforts of GATT, it has done
little to address counter-productive U.S. trade laws. If the Bush
Administration truly wants to make America more competitive and to
avoid an increase in back-door protectionism through the wider use by
countries of antidumping laws, it will take urgent action to reform
the practices of its own officials.
<P>

<h2>
The Dumbing Down Of America's Colleges 
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">
Phyllis Schlafly
</a>
<P>
The 1996 Governors Education Summit at Palisades, New York, spent 
two days discussing &quot;standards&quot; for what students should learn in 
public schools.  Longtime American Federation of Teachers 
president Al Shanker gave this concept a reality check. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
He said, when as a teacher he assigned homework to his class, the 
pupils invariably responded in chorus, &quot;Does it count on our 
grade?&quot;  He pointed out that standards aren't going to make any 
difference if, no matter what students learn or don't learn, they 
can still get admitted to nearly all U.S. colleges and 
universities. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
The National Association of Scholars (NAS), the nation's leading 
higher-education reform organization, has just published a 
devastating 65-page report on the dumbing down of the 50 top 
undergraduate colleges and universities.  The NAS used U.S. 
News & World Report's annual listing of &quot;America's Best 
Colleges&quot; (including both private and public) and compared the 
years 1914, 1939, 1964, and 1993. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
The NAS concludes that students no longer learn the common core 
of knowledge once taken for granted as essential to a liberal- 
arts education.  The universities have simply purged from the 
curriculum many of the required courses that formerly taught 
students the historical, cultural, political and scientific 
basics of our society. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The number of mandatory courses has been dramatically reduced 
from an average of 9.9 in 1914, to 7.3 in 1939, to 6.9 in 1964, 
and to 2.5 in 1993.  The formerly universal requirement that 
students take a basic survey course in several important areas 
has virtually vanished. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Universities now offer very few courses that require 
prerequisites, which means that very few college courses now 
require any advance knowledge or preparation.  In 1914, 
universities offered an average of only 23 courses per 
institution that did not require a prerequisite course; in 1964 
the figure had risen to 127; today, the number is 582. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Only 12 percent of universities now require a thesis or 
comprehensive examination to get a bachelor's degree.  As late as 
1964, more than half of universities did. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The college year has been shortened by about one-fourth (leaving 
more time for spring break and other frivolities, but, of course, 
without any reduction in tuition price or professors' salaries).  
In 1914, college classes were in session an average of 204 days a 
year; by 1939 the number had dropped to 195; in 1964, to 191; and 
today students and teachers are expected to show up in class only 
156 days per academic year. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Maybe the reason why young people can't write good English is 
that so few colleges teach writing any more.  In 1914, nearly all 
universities had required courses in English composition; by 1964 
the figure was 86 percent; today, it's only 36 percent. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ditto for math.  In 1914, 82 percent of the universities had 
traditional mathematics requirements; by 1964 only 36 percent 
did; now, only 12 percent do.  In 1914, 1939 and 1964, more than 
70 percent of the institutions required at least one course in 
the natural sciences; that figure has now fallen to only 34 
percent. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Maybe the reason why the taxpayer-financed federal guidelines on 
the teaching of American history turned out to be such a travesty 
was that most college graduates haven't studied any history.  In 
1914, 90 percent of our elite colleges required history; in 1939 
and 1964 more than 50 percent did; but now only one of the 50 
schools has a required history course. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Literature courses were required at 75 percent of the 
institutions in 1914, and at 50 percent in 1939 and 1964.  Today, 
not one of the &quotbest&quot; institutions has a literature requirement. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Meanwhile, the total number of courses offered at undergraduate 
institutions has increased by a factor of five since 1914, and 
has doubled since 1964, but that doesn't offer more opportunities 
to become an educated citizen.  The majority of these additional 
courses are on narrow and idiosyncratic subjects of interest to 
the professors but almost worthless to the students. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Many courses are not college courses at all; they are designed to 
teach students what they didn't learn in high school.  Sometimes 
these courses are called &quot;remedial,&quot; but the institutions prefer 
euphemisms such as &quot;second tier&quot; and &quot;sub-freshman.&quot;
Unheard of prior to 1939, today such non-college courses are offered in 70 
percent of the elite universities, and most of them award college 
credit. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
California state legislators have recently discovered the high 
cost to the taxpayers of the remedial education courses given at 
the state universities.  Last year, 60 percent of new students 
needed remedial help. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
California legislators assert that students have been the victims 
of consumer fraud perpetrated on them by the high schools that 
gave them high grades.  The legislators want to send the invoice 
for the cost of the remedial courses to the high schools that 
deceived their students by giving them a 3.8 or higher grade- 
point average. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The NAS concludes that our best colleges and universities no 
longer turn out graduates who have even an elementary knowledge 
of our civilization and its heritage.  They do not learn the 
basic facts of our country's history, political and economic 
systems, philosophic traditions, and literary and artistic 
legacies, and the result is that we are in danger of losing the 
national cohesion of a known and shared American heritage.

INTRODUCTION
<P>
     Mexico's economic revolution now has spread from the cities to
the countryside. As part of his comprehensive program to liberalize
and modernize the Mexican economy, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari
earlier this year began a sweeping reform of Mexico's antiquated
agricultural sector. In so doing, he has reversed seven decades of
village socialism and has laid the foundation for a modern, market-
oriented agricultural system. Together with the integration of Mexico
into the world economy and the recent completion of the negotiations
for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), these
agricultural reforms promise to transform the Mexican countryside and
peasantry and bring prosperity to a population that has never known
it.
<P>The importance of these changes extends beyond their economic
impact. They are symbolic of the deeper changes underway in Mexico and
are unambiguous evidence that Mexico is shedding its socialist past
and creating a modern society. Although much of the focus of Salinas's
reform program has been on economics, his larger agenda embraces
social and political reform as well. His major objective is to
transform Mexico from a Third World country to a member of the
developed world. Accomplishing this means overturning the old social
and political order and remaking the country's identity.
   <P>  At the heart of the rural social order in Mexico is the ejido
system -- a quasi-socialist system of communal land tenure. Land
ownership has been a highly emotional issue throughout Mexico's
history, and the ejidos represent a bastion of Mexico's entrenched
economic, social, and political interests. Salinas's willingness to
tackle this stronghold of the political left in Mexico, and his
success in doing so, has demonstrated once again his mastery of
political timing and the widespread support he has assembled for his
program of reform. Only a few years ago, most observers would have
deemed his agricultural reforms impossible; now, however, the absence
of serious opposition is the clearest demonstration yet of the
economic and ideological bankruptcy of the old system and the broad
acceptance of the new.
   <P>  Although Mexico and the Mexican peasantry are the clear
beneficiaries of these reforms, the United States stands to gain as
well. An open and prosperous Mexican agricultural industry increases
U.S. export opportunities and also creates a source of low-cost
agricultural products for the U.S. domestic market. But the most
important benefit for the U.S. is that the reforms serve American
strategic interests. By advancing Mexico's prosperity, these reforms
of the countryside will contribute to the U.S. goal of promoting
Mexico's social and political stability. Few areas of the world will
have a greater importance for the U.S. over the next several decades
than Mexico, and that country's entry into the developed world is the
best way of ensuring that the interests of both countries are secured.
<P>
MEXICO'S AGRICULTURE SINCE THE REVOLUTION
  <P>   Although the latent wealth of Mexico's agricultural sector is
enormous, the countryside is in fact very backward. Operating far
below its potential -- much of it at the level of subsistence
farming -- Mexican agriculture has become a significant drain on the
larger economy. For example, although Mexico employs 26 percent of its
population in agricultural production, agriculture accounts for only 9
percent of the nation's gross domestic product. Equally serious are
the social and political consequences of rural underdevelopment, most
importantly the perpetuation of an impoverished peasantry and their
exclusion from a market economy.
  <P>   The problems of Mexican agriculture are largely man-made, the
result not of nature but of failed government policies. For over
seventy years, the government has extended its control over all
aspects of the countryside in an effort to create a socialist system
of agriculture. The results have been the same as with socialist
systems elsewhere: destruction of market incentives, pervasive
underdevelopment, squandering of resources, endemic poverty, and
corruption. 
<P>     In truth, the free market never has been allowed to operate in
Mexico's agricultural sector. The landed classes and the government
derived great power from their control over the countryside -- a power
they historically have been reluctant to give up.
 <P>   This legacy of controlling the countryside began in Mexico's
colonial era. The feudal system of land tenure that developed for the
majority of Mexicans after the Spanish conquest in 1521 resembled that
of black sharecroppers and tenant farmers in the American South
shortly after the Civil War. For nearly four centuries, most Mexican
peasants had no land of their own and instead worked on large estates,
with most of Mexico's land being controlled by a small group of
landowners. The peasantry lived in perpetual indebtedness to the
landowners, who used that indebtedness to tie their workers to the
land.
 <P>    This exploitative system, and the peasants' demand for land, were
among the most important causes of the Mexican Revolution of 1910-17.
In 1910, Porfirio Diaz, who had ruled Mexico for over three decades,
was overthrown by a group of revolutionary generals. Although control
of the country was bitterly contested over the next several years
between champions of the old order, radicals, and countless warlords,
the victors who emerged were heavily influenced by socialist ideology.
Among the most important was Emiliano Zapata, who had a strong
following among the landless peasants in the southern part of the
country. Zapata became the most vocal advocate for the redistribution
of land.
  <P>   In 1915, then-President Zapata passed through the Mexican
Congress the Agrarian Reform Act, which set the tone of Mexico's
agricultural policy for the next seven decades. The most important
feature of this legislation was a government commitment to
redistribute land to peasants. This was followed in 1917 by a new
constitution written by the revolutionary government that firmly
established the principle of land redistribution. Article 27 of the
Mexican Constitution conferred on each citizen a right to land and
obligated the government to provide it. This provision also gave the
government the right to confiscate unused or underutilized lands and
distribute them to Mexicans who petitioned the government for land.
The government also acquired extensive powers to regulate all aspects
of the countryside.
  <P>   In its redistribution program, the government rejected giving
land to individual farmers and instead established the ejido, or
communal farming system. The government divided land into plots that
were cultivated individually or collectively, but they were owned
communally by the ejido. Ownership of the land, however, remained in
the hands of the state. This communal or ejido definition of land was
written into the Constitution in 1917. The state saw private ownership
of land as "unsuited" to Mexico's agricultural traditions, and the
ejido was regarded as being more in line with the socialism favored by
the Mexican government at that time. Not incidentally, the ejido
system also provided the government with greater control over the
countryside and the peasantry. This control became a major instrument
of power for the ruling party -- the Partido Revolucionario
Institucional (PRI) -- which ruled over the peasantry through the
appointed administrators of the ejido system and the local patronage
they exercise.
 <P>    Once the country achieved stability after the long and bloody
years of the Revolution, conditions in the agricultural sector were
generally favorable. For twenty years following the Revolution, fallow
land once under the control of vast estates was cultivated as peasants
worked the newly formed ejidos. Between 1940 and 1960 agricultural
production in Mexico grew at an average rate of 4.6 percent, compared
with 2.7 percent for all Latin America. The principal cause of this
growth, however, was not an increase in the efficiency of production,
but the introduction of new harvesting and irrigation equipment and
high-yield, pest-resistant crops. Also, new lands were brought under
the plow as ejido farms were created and as private landowners
cultivated formerly fallow land, hoping thereby to avoid its
confiscation. (John Richard Heath and Gioia Palmieri, "Enhancing the
Contribution of the Land Reform Sector to Mexican Agricultural
Development," Agriculture Operations Division of the Latin America and
the Caribbean Regional Office, World Bank, Report # 8310-ME, March 30,
1990, p. 27.)
   <P>  Confiscations, however, continued, and an ever-increasing
percentage of land was brought under the ejido system. By 1988, half
of Mexico's arable land was controlled by the government through the
ejido system.

<P>
STATE INTERVENTION IMPOVERISHES THE MEXICAN COUNTRYSIDE
<P>    The growth of Mexican agriculture in these years, however, masked
major problems. Had ejido farms been as efficient as private ones,
Mexican agriculture would not have been harmed as the number of ejidos
grew and eventually dominated Mexican agriculture. The ejido system
worked against the emergence of modern, efficient farms and led
instead to the creation of very small farms of less than twelve acres.
Dedicated to subsistence farming, these small farms became
substantially isolated from the national and international economy. 
   <P>  Under Mexican law, the peasants grouped in an ejido could neither
sell nor rent the property; title remained in the hands of the
government. As a result, farmers had little incentive to invest in and
improve the land they worked. The lack of capital and market
incentives hampered modernization and mechanization. Government
control over all aspects of the agricultural system steadily
increased, from the regulation of prices to the establishment of
monopolies over purchasing and supply. In effect, the ejidos became
simple extensions of the economic and social planning bureaucracies in
Mexico City.
<P>
     When President Salinas took office in 1988, he inherited an
agricultural system in crisis. Despite strenuous efforts by the
government to fulfill its constitutional mandate to distribute land,
the promises of the revolution to the peasants had not been fulfilled.
Rural Mexico was now poorer than ever. Rural Mexican wages were one
third that of the average Mexican worker. The enormous resources of
the countryside were largely untapped and remained securely bound by
government control. Undercapitalized and underdeveloped, the Mexican
countryside in 1988 was little better than it was when Mexico won its
independence from Spain in 1821. 
<P>
POPULATION GROWTH HAMPERS LAND DISTRIBUTION
    <P> There were many sources of Mexico's agricultural problems, but an
important one was rapid population growth over the last fifty years.
Inefficient and underdeveloped, the state-owned and controlled
agricultural system failed to adapt to Mexico's population explosion.

   <P>  In 1917 Mexico had a population of only 13 million people.
Between 1915 to 1938, the government distributed 18.5 million acres to
the peasants, but this represented only six percent of Mexico's
farmland at that time, and it met most of the demands from Mexicans
for land. However, by 1940 Mexico's population had grown to 20
million. From 1938 to 1943 the government confiscated and distributed
an additional 44.5 million acres as the growing rural population
demanded more land. Thirty years later, the population had increased
155 percent to 51 million, (Alan Riding, Distant Neighbors: A Portrait
of the Mexicans (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., 1984), p. 220.)
creating tremendous pressures for further land confiscations and
redistributions. President Luis Echeverria Alvarez, who took office in
1970, expropriated 30 million acres from private farmers between 1970
and 1976, but only half of that was redistributed to peasants. The
rest either remained in the government's hands or was distributed to
wealthy Mexicans with political connections. By the time Echeverria
left office, ejido lands had jumped from one fourth to almost one half
of total agricultural lands. The next Mexican President, Jose Lopez
Portillo, seized 40 million additional acres, 16.5 million of which he
made into ejidos between 1976-1980. (Large confiscations occurred
during the administration of almost every Mexican President since the
revolution. By 1991 Mexico's Revolutionary Government had confiscated
246 million acres that were converted into ejido lands.) 
    <P> By 1988 Mexico had a population of 81 million, with 25 million
living in rural areas. When Salinas came to office in 1988, 3 million
petitions for land were on file. However, little unused arable land
remained to be confiscated. Over 70 million acres had been seized
during the previous twenty years alone, totalling over 246 million
acres since the revolution.

   <P>  Not only had the number of ejido farms increased dramatically,
but they had been subdivided numerous times, with a depressing effect
on income and productivity. Sixty percent of all arable land was in
ejido farms that averaged less than 11.5 acres, which is one-tenth the
size of the average U.S. farm. (Luis Tellez, "Imperativo de Cambio en
el Campo Mexicano," February 16, 1992, p. 3.)Ejido farmers working
these smaller plots received less than one sixth the salary of ejido
farmers working on plots larger than 18 acres. 
<P>
     Absence of Private Property Rights. A more serious problem than
the ejido's size was the absence of private property rights. Without
private ownership, ejido farmers had little incentive to improve the
land they worked. In addition, the Constitution's broad mandate
granting the government "caretaker" status of ejido lands prompted
Mexico City to adopt a paternalistic stance toward the ejido farmer.
Government control over all phases of agricultural production grew
steadily, embracing crop selection, planting time, fertilizers,
marketing, prices, and credit. Increasing government control meant
worsening results, especially in agriculture where decision-making
must be sensitive to daily, local, and individual conditions. In the
absence of a market economy, ejido farmers were grossly inefficient.
Private farmers in Mexico today are, on average, five times more
productive than their counterparts on the government-owned and
controlled ejidos. (Ibid, p. 4.)
<P>
     Article 27 of the Constitution prohibited ejido farmers from
mortgaging the land or using it as collateral for loans, making it
virtually impossible to obtain private credit. Ejido farmers were also
prevented from renting their land to others. These legal prohibitions
prevented farmers from developing their land. For instance, in spite
of advances in irrigation technologies, the amount of Mexican land
under irrigation has decreased dramatically over the last two decades.
Today only 14.8 million of Mexico's 234 million acres of agricultural
lands are irrigated. (Ibid, p. 3.)
  <P>   Between 1950 and 1965 agricultural production grew by 6.3 percent
annually, in spite of an increase in land cultivation by communal
farms. The reason: The introduction of new seed and fertilizer
technologies to Mexico. (Paul L. Yates, Mexico's Agricultural Dilemma
(Tucson, Arizona: University of Arizona Press, 1981), p. 19.) However,
the annual growth of agricultural production slowed to 2.9 percent
from 1966 to 1980 as more ejidos displaced private farmers. During the
1980s production ceased to grow at all and even began to decline,
falling 3.9 percent and 4.3 percent in 1988 and 1989, respectively. In
1990-1991 there was modest growth because of unseasonably good
rainfall, the government's withdrawal of farming subsidies, and
deregulation which forced farmers to use resources in more efficient
crop production.
   <P>  Besides suffering low productivity, Mexican agriculture is also a
tremendous drag on the rest of the economy. For example, agricultural
production represented 9 percent of Mexico's GDP in 1991, and yet it
absorbed 26 percent of the labor force. ("Profile of Mexican
Agriculture," U.S. Embassy, Mexico City, March 20, 1992, p. 2.)
According to the World Bank, 11 million of the 27 million rural
Mexicans live in extreme poverty, the principal cause being "lagging
rural and agricultural development." (Heath and Palmieri, op. cit., p.
35.)
    <P> These ill effects of Mexico's agricultural crisis are also
evident in the deterioration of the country's agricultural trade
balance. From 1960 to 1965 Mexico had an annual average agricultural
trade surplus equal to 2.3 percent of Mexico's GDP. By 1979 that
annual figure had fallen to only 0.7 percent of GDP. By 1989 Mexico's
agricultural surpluses had disappeared: from 1980 to 1989 Mexico had
an average annual agricultural trade deficit representing 0.3 percent
of GDP. During the 1980s Mexico was reduced to importing beans and
corn, which had been grown at home in sufficient quantities for
centuries.<P>
SALINAS REVOLUTIONIZES MEXICAN AGRICULTURE
<P>
     Salinas realized that Mexico could not fully modernize its
economy and provide a decent standard of living for its peasantry
unless it reformed its agricultural system radically. Dramatic steps
were needed to turn around a system that threatened to keep Mexico
permanently in the role of an underdeveloped country. 
  <P>   As a first step, after a year in office, Salinas began limited
reforms of the ejido system. For decades ejido farmers had "rented"
state-owned lands to private farmers, despite a constitutional
prohibition on such practices. "Rentismo," as the Mexicans called it,
had become widespread because it was one of the few ways the communal
farms could earn a living. Beginning in 1990, Salinas set up 79 pilot
projects to legalize ejido land rentals and also to attract capital
from the private sector. The first such program was started in May
1990 in the town of San Jose de Vacquerias in the northern state of
Nuevo Leon. The Vacquerias program was a joint business venture
between Gamesa Corporation, a Mexican food company owned by PepsiCo,
and a local ejido association.
 <P>    Under the agreement Gamesa contracted a purchase agreement with
the ejido association for wheat and agreed to invest $6 million in the
ejido for irrigation, seeds, fertilizers, and equipment; in return,
the ejido supplied the land and labor to grow the wheat. Since the
project began in 1990, Vacquerias has had two harvests per year
compared to annual harvests in previous years, and it has increased
output by 100 percent. The venture was so successful that investors
received a 29.6 percent return on their investment. A portion of these
profits was passed on to the workers in salaries three times the
amount stipulated in the contract between the workers and the
investors. Thereafter known as the "Vacquerias program," this model
has been copied in other regions of the country, most notably in the
Mexican states of Vera Cruz and Jalisco. (Roberto Salinas, "Ejido +
Private Sector," Business Mexico, July 1991, p. 27.)
<P>
     These and other free market reforms have been resisted by leftist
and nationalist forces who claim Salinas violated the Mexican
Constitution and undermined the Mexican Revolution's achievements in
the countryside. But far from undermining the peasantry, Salinas was
attempting to rescue it from the agricultural disaster caused by the
ejido system. (Tellez, op. cit., p. 4.) In his 1991 State of the
Nation address Salinas declared:
<P>
     <UL>The land distribution established more than fifty years ago . . .
     in its time brought justice to the countryside. But to attempt in
     the present circumstances to continue along the path then
     followed, no longer signifies prosperity for the country or
     justice for the campesinos. In the past, land distribution was a
     path of justice; today it is unproductive and impoverishing.
     (Carlos Salinas De Gortari, "Third State of the Nation Report,"
     (Presidencia de la Republica Direccion General de Comunicacion
     Social,1 November 1991), p. 69.) </UL>
<P>
     Constitutional Changes To Mexico's Agricultural System. Salinas
went on to announce sweeping reforms in Mexico's agricultural system.
In February 1992 the Mexican Congress adopted Salinas's free market
reform package for the Mexican countryside. In this Salinas proposed
to drastically reduce the government's role in agriculture, establish
private property rights, integrate the agricultural sector into the
larger market economy and thus bring it into the 20th century. 
<P>
     These changes included amending the Constitution to remove the
automatic "right" to land and the government's direct obligation to
provide it. The government also lost the power to expropriate lands it
deemed "unused or underused." In addition, the agency governing land
confiscations and distributions, the Secretariat of Agrarian Reform,
was reduced in size and much of its authority taken away. 
<P>
     Under the new law, individual ejido farmers will be given title
to their land. They also will be able to sell it, rent it to other
ejido associations or private corporations, use the land as collateral
for loans, and pass the land on to their heirs. Limits on acreage have
been relaxed. Formerly, individual ejido farmers were not allowed to
"own" more than 247 acres of irrigated land, 496 acres of non-
irrigated land, or 1,976 acres of forests. The new law allows the
creation of corporations or associations that legally can own 25 times
that limit: 6,175 irrigated acres, 12,350 nonirrigated acres, or
49,400 acres of forest. This will improve agricultural efficiency by
creating economies of scale where associations and corporations can
pool resources for credit and equipment purchases. 
<P>
     The prohibition on foreign ownership renting of farm land of any
type has also been removed. This is especially important for the
growth of agribusiness. The new legislation also establishes
independent tribunals that will adjudicate land disputes over
ownership rights to farmland. Formerly, the executive branch operated
as rule-maker, enforcer, and judge of land rights, creating a system
where corruption and abuse were common.
<P>
(Chart of different laws, now and then.) 
 <P>
     In addition to denying private property rights to farmers, the
old Article 27 gave the government extensive power over both private
and ejido land and the agricultural system in general. As a
consequence, the Mexican government created enormous government-owned
monopolies to supply Mexican farmers with credit, fertilizer, seeds,
irrigation equipment, and water. The government also became the
purchaser and marketer of food production, using price supports and
production requirements to regulate the market. The result was the
creation of a rigid system, guided more by political and bureaucratic
requirements than market forces. This system told farmers what to
grow, restricted the private sector from providing farmers with
necessary supplies and equipment, and effectively limited private-
sector financing.
<P>
     Realizing that private property rights were meaningless when
dominated by government monopolies, Salinas cut back the role of the
state. Most important, he reduced the power and budget of the state
food distribution monopoly CONASUPO. (CONASUPO stands for Compania
Nacional de Subsistencias Populares.) Formerly, CONASUPO set prices on
most food commodities and was the monopoly purchaser and distributor
for most foodstuffs. Today, CONASUPO supports artificial prices for
only two commodities: beans and corn, which are staples of the Mexican
diet. Similarly, the government's monopoly on fertilizer production
and distribution in Mexico was ended in 1991 with the privatization of
the state-owned fertilizer company, FERTIMEX. (FERTIMEX stands for
Fertilizantes Mexicanas.)
    <P> These reforms will have far-reaching effects on the agricultural
sector beyond the ejidos. In the past, extensive land confiscations
had a pernicious effect on private farmers, even on those whose land
was not seized. Since both small and large private property owners
could find their land taken at any time, Mexican land owners had
little incentive to improve their plots, never knowing when future
confiscations would wipe out their investment. (R.L. Barnes, "Proposed
Mexican Land Tenure Reform," Report #MX 1246, Agricultural Affairs
Office, U.S. Embassy, Mexico City, January 1992, p. 4.) The small
farmers were disproportionally affected because they had neither the
money nor the political connections to prevent their lands from being
confiscated. Now that the prospect of confiscations is gone, private
farmers will have greater incentives to invest in long-term production
and improvement of their lands. 
<P>
BENEFITS TO THE U.S. AND MEXICO UNDER AGRICULTURAL REFORMS
   <P>  Mexicans themselves will be the principal beneficiaries of
Salinas's reforms; the United States will benefit significantly, too.
Lower prices paid by U.S. consumers, opportunities for U.S.
businesses, reduced illegal immigration, and improved environmental
protection in Mexico -- as agribusiness industries use safer
pesticides and fertilizers -- will be among the long-term benefits of
these reforms.
<P>
     Advantages to U.S. Consumers and Businesses.As more fruits and
vegetables are grown more efficiently in Mexico, U.S. consumers will
have a wider variety of food products at lower costs. In the U.S.,
labor accounts for nearly 40 percent of the cost of the cultivation of
fruits and vegetables. (James A. Duffield and Lewell Gunter, "Will
Immigration Reform Affect the Economic Competitiveness of Labor-
Intensive Crops?" Agriculture and Rural Economy Division, U.S.
Department of Agriculture, May 1991, p. 7.) In 1987 those costs
amounted to $1.75 billion in such horticultural specialty products as
tomatoes, peppers, and cucumbers, $1.2 billion in melons and
vegetables, and $2.1 billion in fruit and nuts. Those costs, passed on
to the American consumer in higher prices, will be reduced as more of
this food is grown in Mexico. Although some Mexican food products,
such as tomatoes, compete directly with food producers in the U.S.,
Mexico's growing seasons for fruits and vegetables often occur in the
American "off-season" when domestically grown products are unavailable
or costly. Reduced costs on basic food items like fruits and
vegetables will most benefit poor Americans who, as a percentage of
their income, spend twice as much on food as the average American.
<P>
     U.S. businesses will benefit also from Salinas's agrarian reforms
and deregulation, which embrace not just the ejidos but the entire
food production and distribution system. Mexico has a population of 81
million, almost one third that of the U.S.-Mexican demand for food
products will grow 5 to 6 percent during the 1990s, almost double the
rate of Mexico's population growth. ("Profile of Mexican Agriculture,"
p. 6.) Mexico already represents a $21 billion market for U.S. food
producers, and as this grows new opportunities will open up for
American exporters. Already, Mexico's middle-class has developed a
growing appetite for U.S. food products. According to the U.S. Embassy
in Mexico, "Imports of products such as frozen foods and microwavable
foods have more than doubled in the last several years." ("Economic
Trends Report," (U.S. Embassy, Mexico City, August 1991, p. 50.) The
NAFTA will reduce tariffs and import restrictions on most U.S. food
products entering Mexico. Of even greater importance are the
agricultural reforms that will allow U.S. agricultural companies to
compete with formerly government-owned food distribution companies and
monopolies in Mexico, such as CONASUPO. FERTIMEX, the government
fertilizer monopoly, is being privatized, and foreign companies can
now sell fertilizers in Mexico. 
<P>
     The ejido reforms also have made it possible for U.S. companies
to expand their operations to Mexico, thereby helping them to stay
competitive in the global market. The flower industry is one example.
Joint ventures with Mexican companies are now helping U.S. flower
producers capture that part of the U.S. market that historically has
gone to European companies. ("Opportunities in the Mexican
Agricultural Sector," Mexican Secretary of Agriculture and Water
Resources, Subsecretary of Planning, 1991, p. 15.)
 <P>
     Several other projects now underway highlight the importance of
the growing strategic partnership between companies in the U.S. and
Mexico in the agribusiness sector. (Ibid., p. 29.) Companies involved
in U.S.-American agribusiness are:
<P>
**   Tropicana Foods, Inc. Tropicana, a U.S. company specializing in
fruit juice production and distribution, has begun two projects for
producing oranges, one privately owned and the other a joint venture
with ejido farmers. In this division of labor, the Mexican company
will be responsible for production and processing, while Tropicana
will market the orange juice both in Mexico and internationally.
<P>
**   Green Giant Corporation. Green Giant, a Mexican-based subsidiary
of Pillsbury Foods, Inc., processes and packages vegetables in the
state of Guanajuato in Mexico. Green Giant is involved in the entire
production process in Mexico from the production and package of
vegetables to their marketing and distribution. Its operations in
Mexico support exports to the U.S. and the rest of the world. 
<P>
**   PepsiCo, Inc. PepsiCo is involved in two projects in Mexico. One
is a joint venture with an ejido farm and the Mexican cookie and
cracker producer Gamesa. In this project PepsiCo is providing capital,
Gamesa the Mexican distribution network, and the ejidos the labor and
land. PepsiCo is using this project to further penetrate the growing
Mexican market. PepsiCo's other joint venture is with the Mexican
bread company Bimbo to produce corn and potato products for Bimbo's
line of products in Mexico. 
<P>
**   Grupo Trasgo. The Trasgo group is a consortium of Mexican
companies operating joint ventures with U.S. companies. Trasgo is
working with Tyson Foods Company, a U.S. based chicken producer, in
poultry growing and packaging. Fifty percent of the production in this
project is sold in the Japanese market. 
<P>
     As the ejido reforms place more Mexican land into productive
agriculture, the demand for farm machinery, irrigation equipment,
seeds, and fertilizer will grow dramatically. In these and other
areas, the U.S. is the supplier of choice. Last year the U.S. supplied
over 75 percent of Meico's imports of machinery and equipment,
including that used in agriculture. These exports are expected to
increase as food demand increases an estimated 5 to 6 percent during
the next ten years because rising incomes and population and the
positive effects of agricultural reforms.
<P>
     Stemming Illegal Immigration.The illegal immigration of Mexican
workers into the U.S. has long been a sensitive issue, clouding U.S.-
Mexico relations for decades. Last year U.S. immigration officials
caught over 1.1 million people trying to enter the U.S. illegally
across the U.S.-Mexico border, eighty-seven percent of which were
Mexicans. The U.S. Border Patrol estimates that only one in ten aliens
attempting to cross the border is caught.
<P>
     Most illegal immigrants from Mexico come from rural areas. Ejido
life has impoverished the Mexican farmer and made even subsistence
living difficult in many places. Many ejido farmers therefore migrate
to the U.S. in search of work. According to Antonio Hernandez,
director of a cooperative representing 2,850 ejidos in the Bajio
region of Mexico, 70 percent of his cooperative has at least one
family member working in the United States. (Dianna Solis,
"Agricultural Reform in Mexico Leaves Farmers Wanting, and Fearing,
Change," The Wall Street Journal, February 26, 1992, p. A4.) Salinas's
reforms will keep more Mexicans at home as they see the opportunities
now available at growing and harvesting their own crops.
<P>
     Promoting Environmental Protection. Mexico's legacy of government
intervention and public ownership of lands has led to destructive
behavior by Mexican farmers, miners, and lumber companies. Without
private ownership, ejido farmers have had little incentive to improve
their properties for future generations, and this has contributed to
the degradation of the land. The uncertainty of land rights in
general, made worse by repeated confiscations, has caused even private
property owners to neglect their lands. Many farmers, therefore,
choose to exploit their land for short-term profits instead of
spending the time and money in irrigation and crop rotation to protect
their lands. As a result, overuse has depleted much of Mexico's best
soil and made marginal farm lands barren. For example, ejido farmers
in the southern state of Chiapas are destroying large segments of
tropical forests in primitive slash and burn techniques in order to
open new land for planting. <P>
     The degradation of the rural environment should stop once
Salinas's reforms take hold. The new constitution gives farmers
ownership and, consequently, responsibility over the protection and
long-term care of these lands. Possessing property rights, farmers no
longer will have an incentive to destroy the rural environment.
<P>
     Mexico's forests also will be better protected under the agrarian
reforms. Today 80 percent of Mexican forests are held communally or
owned by the federal government. These lands are often rented to
lumber companies for short-term contracts to harvest trees. The
absence of private property rights means that those who have temporary
control of the resources will be motivated to make the quickest profit
from them. A U.S. Embassy study found that such a system created
"every incentive to clear-cut the land and little to replant."
(Barnes, op. cit. p. 5.) The recent reforms allow private ownership of
forestry lands. Since land now can be owned for long periods, rather
than being rented for only a few years, owners will have incentives to
replant trees for future harvests.
<P>
     Creating Strategic Stability.Mexico is America's most populous
neighbor and one of the most important countries in Latin America.
There is no escaping the reality that instability there will adversely
affect the U.S. Massive immigration into the U.S. is only one example
of domestic problems which have their origin in Mexico. Social and
political instability there would produce unforeseeable and disturbing
consequences along the 2,000 mile border. Only by securing Mexico's
stability can the U.S. hope to cope with these threats.
  <P>   Social and political stability will be served well by Salinas's
agricultural reforms. If the agricultural economy grows, more jobs
will be created and the standard of living of Mexican farmers will
rise. Economic growth is a critical element of social and political
stability in Mexico.
     <P>
     For most of their common history, relations between the U.S. and
Mexico have been distant and difficult. Now, with Salinas's reforms
and improved relations with the U.S., there is the opportunity to move
beyond this legacy. The signing of the NAFTA is an historic
achievement, for it joins the two countries together in an ever-closer
relationship and creates the foundation for them not just to get along
but to become partners in North America. In the uncertainties of the
post-Cold War world, the U.S. will have a need for new friends.
<P>
CONCLUSION<P>
     Privatizing Mexico's ejido, or state-owned communal farming
system, is the most radical, and yet the most necessary of Salinas's
economic reforms. The radical agrarian reforms of the 1917 Mexican
Revolution were seen by many as justified by the country's feudal
past. At first, they were focused on breaking the power of the landed
elite and providing land to millions of peasants who previously had
none. However, 75 years of land confiscations, redistributions, and
other forms of government intervention have devastated Mexican
agriculture and the very peasantry they were intended to help. The
increasing government role in agriculture during those decades,
combined with the Mexican Constitution's bias against private
property, created an environment in which the government effectively
replaced the wealthy landlords of the past with its own form of
dominance over the Mexican farmer. By the 1980s the Mexican ejido
system served neither the farmer nor the country as a whole. 
<P>
     Salinas's reforms have transformed the way Mexicans look at land
and at their government's role in the economic and social life of the
countryside. By breaking with the agricultural socialism of the past
and by creating the conditions for the flourishing of a market
economy, Salinas has set the stage for a far-reaching and
overwhelmingly beneficial transformation of Mexico's countryside.
Modernization will bring increased output, rising incomes, and
increased exports.  
<P>
     For Mexico, the benefits from this reform reach far beyond the
new wealth it will create. The Mexican environment is certain to be
better protected as more land is placed in private hands. Democracy
also will be strengthened as Mexican peasants increase their control
over the land they work. As their economic freedoms grow, the power of
the state to control their lives will diminish. These agricultural
reforms are one more step in bringing Mexico into the modern world and
in providing its population with the prosperity and freedom they have
so long sought. For this reason alone, the U.S. stands to benefit
greatly. 
<P>
     For the United States, there are direct benefits as well. U.S.
consumers will benefit from better choices and lower costs resulting
from expanded, more efficient production. American farm equipment
producers and agricultural businesses will profit from the new markets
for farm and irrigation equipment, seeds, and fertilizers. In
addition, U.S. investment in Mexican agriculture, one shunned, is now
encouraged, opening opportunities for joint ventures between Mexican
and U.S. agribusiness companies. All told, the economic benefits to
the U.S. from the opening of Mexico's food industry will be measured
in the billions of dollars, and ten of thousands of Americans jobs.
And, as a solution to Mexico's pressing problem of providing jobs for
its rural population, an expanding Mexican economy will stem the flow
of illegal immigrants to the United States.
  <P>   Ratification of the NAFTA, of course, is essential to the U.S.
benefitting from these reforms, for only when goods and services can
pass freely between the two countries will American consumers and
businesses be able to make use of these new opportunities.

INTRODUCTION


<P> The White House is wrestling with America's "wetlands" policy.
This is because the federal government has been coming under heavy
criticism for abusing its powers to declare private property a
"wetland" and then to restrict how owners use their land. This
criticism and the broad confusion over wetlands policy, and even over
the definition of "wetlands," has prompted the President's cabinet-
level Council on Competitiveness, chaired by Vice President Dan
Quayle, to examine and plan revisions of the federal government's
"Wetlands Delineation Manual." ( Federal Manual for Identifying and
Delineating Jurisdictional Wetlands (1989).) This manual sets criteria
for use by all Executive Branch agencies and departments in
determining what is a wetland. In addition, the White House Domestic
Policy Council is conducting a broad overview of wetlands policy in
general.
<P> Checking Regulators. The Competitiveness Council's revisions are
to be completed by month's end and then released for public comment
before taking effect. If they are to contribute to government's dual
task of preserving ecological integrity and creating an environment
that spurs economic growth, then the Council's revisions must check
the impulses of regulators to declare even dry pieces of land to be
wetlands and place them under government jurisdiction. Too often such
action restricts the rights of owners without any compensation.

<P> Imprecise Definition. There are two problems with the federal
government's current policy toward wetlands. First, the definition of
a "wetland" is very imprecise, allowing many plots of essentially dry
land to be classified as "wet." Under this definition, for example,
even if a plot of land is dry for 358 of the 365 days in a year, it
still can be a target of government regulators.

<P> Second, because the definition of wetlands is imprecise, the
federal government has expanded the use of the "wetlands" designation
beyond what law originally intended. This law, the Clean Water Act of
1977, correctly seeks to limit discharges of pollutants into the
nation's waterways. Under the law, the federal government can regulate
pollutants dumped into wetlands if there is a danger that the
pollutants will seep into other nearby bodies of water, like lakes,
rivers, or other wetlands.

<P> The Clean Water Act is the principal instrument of America's
wetlands policy, with the focus exclusively on stopping pollution. Yet
over the years, the Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental
Protection Agency steadily have expanded their jurisdiction, using the
Clean Water Act as a means to protect wetlands and the flora and fauna
that depend on them for their own sake. In effect, the Clean Water Act
has been transformed into a "Wetlands Protection Act." Yet Congress
has never passed such a law. If the wetlands merit protection as
wetlands and if Congress and the Bush Administration want to protect
wetlands as such and the wildlife that use them, they should debate
the issue on its own merits and draw up laws tailored specifically to
that task. The federal government should not use the Clean Water Act
to do a job for which it was not originally designed.

<P> Attacking Private Property. The definition of a wetland might
seem like an obscure and unimportant detail buried harmlessly in
mountains of government regulations. In fact, the use of the current
definition by the federal government could affect most landowners in
the country, depriving them of the use of their property without
compensation. Under this law, for example, a Colorado farmer was
indicted for redirecting a river, which had been diverted onto his
land, back into its original bed. Under this law, too, a Pennsylvania
man was jailed for cleaning up tires in his backyard and hauling in
clean fill dirt, considered a pollutant, to level his land in
preparation for building a garage. The federal government threatened a
Pennsylvania couple with legal action for installing a tennis court on
their property on the grounds of polluting the water. A woman in
Wyoming was denied a permit to plant roses on her land. These are but
a few of thousands of similar cases of federal regulators moving
against private property in the name of preventing pollution or
protecting wetlands where no threat or where no wetland existed.

<P> The Council on Competitiveness can head off such abuses in the
future and bring balance to the treatment of wetlands by advising the
President to tighten the definition of a wetland. To restore the
original purpose of the Clean Water Act, that is, to prevent pollution
from spreading from one body of water to another, the revised wetlands
Delineation Manual should exclude the "wetlands" designation to any
tract if:
<P>
1)  it is not located close enough to another "water of the United
    States" for natural water flows to carry pollutants from the
    wetland into another such water, or 
<P>
2)  the physical nature of the wetland makes it generally impossible
    for pollutants to be carried out of the wetland via normal water
    flows.
<P>
This change would restore and confine the Clean Water Act to its
original status as an anti-pollution statute. If the government
specifically wishes to protect wetlands and wildlife, specific
statutes should deal with them.

<P> Such proposed charges surely will be resisted by many officials
in the Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection
Agency, who will protest a redefinition that restricts their power to
use the Clean Water Act to protect wetlands simply because they are
wetlands. Even if such far-reaching changes are not politically
feasible at this time, at a minimum, the Council should try to tighten
the definition of what land actually qualifies as "wet." The new
definition should:
<UL>
Raise the minimum soil inundation and saturation requirements.

<P> Limit the list of plants used as indicators of whether an area is
    a wetland to those that grow exclusively in such an environment.

    <P>Require designated wetlands to meet all three traditional wetland
    identification criteria: degree of saturation, type of
    vegetation, and type of soil.

    <P>Place the burden of proof on the government to prove that an area
    in fact is a wetland covered by the Clean Water Act when a
    property owner is charged with polluting a wetland.

    <P>Drop the ambiguous "Difficult-to-Identify" category for wetlands.

    <P>Reevaluate all land currently designated as a wetland in
    accordance with the criteria of the new manual.
</UL>
<P> Comprehensive Review. The Domestic Policy Council, another
cabinet-level group, meanwhile is comprehensively reevaluating how to
deal with those areas determined to be wetlands. If the government's
purpose is to preserve wetlands or wildlife, then instead of using the
Clean Water Act to deny landowners permits for the use of their land,
the government either should purchase the land or pay the owners to
conserve it as a wetland. A principal purpose of government is to
protect private property. The federal government can perform this task
and deal with legitimate environmental concerns as well by defining
wetlands in a reasonable manner and using the Clean Water Act for its
original purpose of preventing pollution of the nation's waterways.

<P>
FROM CLEAN WATER STATUTE TO A NATIONAL ZONING LAW

<P> In 1965, Congress passed the Federal Water Pollution Control Act
to limit water pollution. The Act was amended in 1972 and again in
1977, when it was renamed the Clean Water Act. The Act makes the
"discharge" of any "pollutant" from any "point source" into any
"waters of the United States" illegal unless the person responsible
has obtained a permit from the Secretary of the Army through the Army
Corps of Engineers. Rather than spell out what substances were deemed
harmful, Congress deliberately defined "pollutant" broadly, allowing
the Corps of Engineers to assess the threat to water quality posed by
any given pollutant in any given waterway case-by-case. The Corps may
grant or deny permits, or attach various conditions. A decision to
grant a permit is subject to veto by the EPA.

<P> The Act was amended in 1972 to cover all "waters of the United
States," which include all interstate waterways as well as all bodies
of water that drain into other waters that can carry pollutants across
a state or national boundary.

<P> Originally the Army Corps of Engineers did not apply the Clean
Water Act to wetlands, usually defined as "marshes, bogs, swamps, mud
flats, prairie potholes, and other forms of land flooded or saturated
by water." (   Richard Miniter, "Muddy Waters:  The Quagmire of
Wetlands Regulation," Policy Review No.  56 (Spring 1991), p.  70. 
See also William A.  Niering, The Audubon Society Nature Guides: 
Wetlands (New York:  Alfred A.  Knopf, Inc., 1988), pp.  18-134.) In
1975, however, a federal district court ordered the Clean Water Act to
be applied to wetlands. (   Natural Resources Defense Council v. 
Callaway, 392 F.  Supp.  685 (D.D.C.  1975).) The rationale was that
pollutants discharged into a wetland might be carried out of the
wetland and into an adjacent body of water by natural water flows, and
from there be carried downstream and eventually across a state line.
To the extent that there is an actual physical water connection
between a wetland and another water body (itself perhaps a wetland)
that is capable of carrying pollutants, then this wetland is plausibly
a "water of the United States" as defined in the Clean Water Act in
1972. Many wetlands, however, do not fit this definition.

<P> Broad Definition. To make matters more confusing, the Army Corps
of Engineers has defined "waters of the United States" to include "All
waters which are currently used, or were used in the past, or may be
susceptible [in the future] to use in interstate or foreign
commerce.... " (   33 C.F.R.  328.3(a)(1).) The Corps has used this
definition to extend even further the jurisdiction of the Clean Water
Act. For example, a wetland becomes a "water of the United States"
simply if it can be used for recreational purposes by interstate or
foreign travelers. In litigation, the Corps and the EPA have argued
that a wetland can be a "water of the United States" for purposes of
the Clean Water Act if it actually or potentially can be used by
migratory waterfowl that may have crossed a state or national boundary
while traveling to or from the wetland.

<P>
A NATIONWIDE WETLAND

<P> The expansive interpretation of the Clean Water Act and the
phrase "waters of the United States" has meant that areas of little or
no ecological value are classified as "wetlands." This subjects these
areas to the permit requirements of the Clean Water Act. By one
estimate, 104 million acres, or 5 percent of all land in the lower 48
states, is now officially classified as wetland. (   Betsy Carpenter,
"In a murky quagmire," U.S.  News & World Report, June 3, 1991, p. 
45.) The Soil Conservation Service estimates that, under the current
definition, as many as 70 million acres of existing farmland could be
considered wetlands subject to federal control. (   Rick Henderson,
"The Swamp Thing," Reason, April 1991, pp.  32-33.) According to
economist Warren Brookes, the federal government's jurisdiction under
the Clean Water Act, as defined by the regulators, now encompasses "at
least half of all farmland, and as much as 60 percent of U.S. total
land area." (   Warren Brookes, "Swamping the economy?"  The
Washington Times, April 11, 1991, p.  63.) According to other
estimates, most of the eastern United States and 40 percent or more of
California may fit the current Delineation Manual's definition of
wetlands. (   Henderson, op.  cit., pp.  32 - 33.) Approximately 75
percent of the usable land in Alaska, that which is neither a mountain
nor a glacier, is classified as wetland, by definition, because for
much of the year the ground is frozen and water is locked underneath
the surface. (   Miniter, op.  cit.  p.  73.)

<P>
THE CURRENT WETLANDS QUAGMIRE

<P> Expansive interpretation of the Clean Water Act by federal
regulators has denied Americans the legitimate use of their property.
Example: A self-employed truck mechanic in Morrisville, Pennsylvania,
John Pozsgai, was sentenced to three years in prison and fined
$202,000 for removing old tires and rusting car parts from his land,
and then hauling in clean fill dirt to level the property in
preparation for building a garage. The trouble, Pozsgai was told, was
that he did not first obtain a permit from the Army Corps of
Engineers. This permit was necessary because, in the eyes of the
federal government, by cleaning up his land Pozsgai ostensibly was
discharging pollutants into a water of the U.S. Under the definitions
used by the Corps of Engineers and the EPA, the clean fill dirt
constituted a "pollutant," and his land constituted a "water of the
United States."
<P>
Example:      A corn farmer in Missouri, Rick McGown, is being
prosecuted for repairing a sunken levee on his property, thereby
restoring 150 acres of brushland to cropland, on which corn is now
planted. For McGown, the problem was his failure to obtain a Corps of
Engineers permit. The Corps considers his cornfield a wetland, and
thus a "water of the United States," because a Corps official claimed
to have found cattails, a kind of marsh plant, growing on the land.
However, what the official thought was cattail was actually sorghum, a
plant that may look like a cattail but which grows on dry land. The
sorghum, moreover, had been planted by McGown. Like Pozsgai in
Pennsylvania, McGown is charged with illegally polluting the water. 

<P>Example:      In Juneau, Alaska, plans to expand a private shelter
for the homeless were held up recently for over a year because the
land underneath the shelter was declared to be a wetland, thus making
a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers necessary before the
addition could be built. It made no difference that the plot of land
was in the middle of a city block. 

<P>Example:      In Maryland and California, federal wetlands
regulations have blocked the construction of low-income housing
projects.

<P>Example:      A young couple in Pennsylvania recently was threatened
with suit by federal authorities for installing a tennis court in
their yard. The charge: polluting the water.

<P>Example:      An elderly woman in Wyoming was prohibited from
planting a bed of roses on her land, again in the name of enforcing
the Clean Water Act.

<P>Example:      Around the country, farmers have been warned that their
land is a federally protected wetland, and hence that they absolutely
must not plow it or plant crops on it unless they first obtain a
permit.

<P> These and countless similar incidents (   For documentation of
these and other incidents, see Miniter, op.  cit.; Henderson, op. 
cit.; Rick Raber, "Wetlands statutes bog down residents," The Times of
Trenton, February 3, 1991, p.  B7.  See also Carpenter, op.  cit..)
have two things in common: 1) The land involved is basically dry, or
only marginally wet at most, making its characterization as a "water
of the United States" highly dubious; and 2) the "pollutants"
allegedly being "discharged" into these putative "waters of the United
States," and the activities for which a permit is being required,
almost always pose not even a remote threat to water quality.

<P> For the Army Corps of Engineers and the EPA to move against such
lands, therefore, amounts to these agencies making zoning or land-use
decisions under the guise of enforcing the Clean Water Act. 

<P> Usurpation of Authority. The Corps of Engineers and the EPA have
been using the Clean Water Act as a de facto Wetlands and Wildlife
Protection Act -- even though no such legislation exists. ( Although
the Clean Water Act has never been amended by Congress to make it a
Wetlands Preservation and Wildlife Protection Act, Congress has
enacted a wholly separate statute that specifically addresses these
subjects:  the "Water Bank Program for Wetlands Preservation,"
codified in Chapter 29 of Title 16 (Conservation) of the United States
Code.  The Water Bank Program authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture
to negotiate with landowners and to pay them a fee to keep their land
in its natural condition.) Anytime the agencies feel that a particular
parcel of land may be beneficial to wildlife, they arbitrarily apply
the wetlands definition to the parcel to prohibit the owner from using
the land.

<P> This usurpation and abuse of authority by federal regulators
affects all Americans, not just those who own land. Federal wetlands
regulations reduce the availability of land for housing and thus raise
the costs of all housing, including rental units. Requiring a
contractor and developer to obtain a Corps of Engineers or EPA permit
delays construction of state and federal housing projects and thus
raises their costs to taxpayers and eventual tenants. (   See, e.g.,
Advisory Commission on Regulatory Barriers to Affordable Housing, "Not
In My Back Yard":  Removing Barriers to Affordable Housing (July 8,
1991); Jack Kemp, "Free Housing from Environmental Snobs," The Wall
Street Journal, July 8, 1991, p.  A6; Brookes, op.  cit.) Similarly,
food costs increase as the amount of land available for farming is
reduced and the costs of complying with bureaucratic red tape are
passed on to consumers.
<P>
POLLUTION PREVENTION OR ARBITRARY ECOLOGY?

<P> The Council on Competitiveness, chaired by Vice President Quayle,
has the responsibility for reviewing federal regulations to determine
whether laws are being enforced in the most efficient and least costly
manner. At the highest level the Council consists of the Secretary of
the Treasury, Nicholas Brady, Attorney General Richard Thornburgh,
Secretary of Commerce Robert Mosbacher, the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget, Richard Darman, the Chairman of the Council of
Economic Advisors, Michael Boskin, and the Chief of Staff to the
President, John Sununu. Other cabinet members are invited to
participate when the Council deals with issues affecting their
agencies. The Executive Director of the Council is Allan Hubbard. 

<P> The Council now is reviewing the definition of "wetland" as used
in the Wetlands Delineation Manual. By this review, the Council has
the opportunity to restore fairness and balance to the definition of
wetlands, and to end abuses of the Clean Water Act.

<P> Many of the problems result from the attempt to use the Clean
Water Act not for the purpose of dealing with pollution but as a means
to preserve wetlands and wildlife for ecological reasons. To restore
the Clean Water Act to its original purpose, it is necessary to define
"wetland" in the context of preventing pollution. By this definition,
a plot of land is not a wetland covered by the Clean Water Act if:
<UL>
    it is not located close enough to another "water of the United
    States" for natural water flows to carry pollutants from the
    wetland into the other such water; or 
<P>
    the physical nature of the wetland makes it generally impossible
    for pollutants to be carried out of the wetland via normal water
    flows.
</UL>
<P> Such a redefinition would allow the EPA to focus its attentions
and efforts on the original purpose of the Clean Water Act: to prevent
the spread of pollutants in America's lakes and rivers. If there is a
need for separate laws to protect wetlands and wildlife for their own
sake, the Administration and Congress should consider this issue on
its merits and develop guidelines and regulations appropriate to the
task. ( One possible option, of course, would be to expand one of the
existing programs that already deal with the protection of wetlands
and wildlife, such as the Water Bank Program for Wetlands Preservation
mentioned in note 11 above.)


PUTTING THE "WET" BACK IN WETLANDS

The Council on Competitiveness, however, may find it difficult to
adopt a definition of wetlands that focuses exclusively on pollution
prevention. This is because the EPA and other agencies will resist
changes that prevent them from continuing to use the Clean Water Act
for purposes in addition to pollution prevention. If Quayle and
Hubbard are unable to convince the full Council on Competitiveness to
restore the definition of wetlands to the original intent of the law
and if they are forced to accept some definition of wetlands that
transforms the Clean Water Act into a charter to preserve wetlands and
wildlife for their own sake, then Quayle and Hubbard should press the
Council on Competitiveness to revise the Delineation Manual so that at
least wetlands no longer means puddles in people's backyards or damp
vacant lots in the middle of cities. A revised definition of wetlands
at least should:
<P>
** Raise the minimum soil inundation and saturation requirements.

<P> The current version of the Delineation Manual allows an area to
be classified as a wetland if it is either inundated or saturated with
water for a mere seven days a year. This is an unreasonable
definition. For land to have significant ecological value as a
wetland, its soil must be saturated long enough for vegetation and
wildlife to adapt to the saturated conditions. Most types of wildlife
dependent on wetlands, such as amphibians or immature water fowl, need
more than 14 days to complete the water phase of their life cycle. The
minimum periods of inundation or saturation required for an area to be
classified as a wetland therefore should be around 30 consecutive
days. Critics of the current wetlands definition suggest at least 21
days. These days of inundation or saturation, moreover, should be
during the growing season. Inundation or saturation occurring outside
the growing season, which is the time when the aquatic phase of most
animals' and plants' lifecycle occurs, is of no use to such wildlife
and should not count in deciding whether an area is a wetland. 

<P> The Manual's new definition should require saturation at the
surface, in contrast to the current Manual's requiring merely that
saturation occur within 18 inches of ground surface. This change
apparently makes sense to the former head of the Corps wetland
regulatory office, Bernard Goode, who helped write the current
Delineation Manual. According to a recent article, Goode "suggests
basing the delineation of wetlands on one parameter: the presence of
enough surface water for a sufficient amount of time to support
typical wetland plants. To meet this criterion, the water table -- not
merely a random puddle -- must be at or above the surface for 30 days
during the growing season." (   Henderson, op.  cit., p.  35.  (The
quotation is Henderson's summary of Goode's suggestion.))
<P>
** Limit the list of plants used as indicators of whether an area is a
wetland to those that grow exclusively in such an environment.

<P> Often the inundation and saturation characteristics -- or
"hydrology" -- of an area are difficult to determine. As such, as
indicators of whether a plot is a wetland, federal regulators look at
the vegetation growing in the area. The EPA recognizes some 7,000
"indicator species" of plants: If any of them are present, EPA
presumes that the land is a wetland. A major problem with this long
EPA list of indicators is that it includes many "facultative" species
-- those that are equally adapted to wet or dry conditions. As a
result, federal regulators now can designate land as a wetland even if
the only plant species growing on it are all capable of growing in dry
conditions. Many areas designated as wetlands, therefore, from an
environmental perspective, are not wetlands at all. The list of plants
used to indicate whether a plot is a wetland should be confined to
species that can grow only in a wet environment.

** Require designated wetlands to meet all three traditional wetland
identification criteria.

<P> The EPA normally looks at three factors in determining whether to
classify an area as a wetland: the number of days per year that the
area is inundated or saturated with water; whether the area has at
least one of the 7,000 indicator species of plants growing on it; and
whether the area is composed of any kind of "hydric" soil, that is
"earth that is chemically changed by water, usually with a peat, muck,
or mineral base." (   Miniter, op.  cit.  See also Niering, op.  cit. 
) Typically, the EPA classifies an area as a wetland if any two of
these factors exist. This predictably increases substantially the
amount of land deemed wetlands. And this then substantially increases
the cost to the American public of complying with the Clean Water Act.
To reduce these compliance costs to a level commensurate with the
environmental benefits conferred, only areas that meet all three
wetland identification criteria should be designated as wetlands and
subject to permitting requirements.
<P>
** Place the burden of proof on the government to prove that an area
in fact is a wetland covered by the Clean Water Act when a property
owner is charged with polluting a wetland.

<P> When the government accuses a property owner of violating the
Clean Water Act, the courts have tended to accept the government's
determinations that an area is a wetland subject to the jurisdiction
of the Act, notwithstanding the fact that the burden of proof is
supposed to be on the government. As a practical matter, the property
owner must prove that his or her land is not wetland. The burden of
proof, however, in wetlands cases as in all others, always should be
on the government. The federal agencies should be required to prove
that the area in question is a "water of the United States," as
defined by the Clean Water Act, and that the owner is guilty of
polluting in violation of the Act.
<P>
** Reject the ambiguous "Difficult-to-Identify" category for wetlands.

<P> Some officials in the Bush Administration suggest that the new
Delineation Manual include a special section for "Difficult-to-
Identify Wetlands." They fear that without such a definition, some
wetlands might be overlooked. Yet no "Difficult-to-Identify" section
is necessary. If a "difficult-to-identify" area truly is a wetland, it
will be covered by the Manual's definition. Mainly what a "Difficult-
to-Identify Wetlands" category would do is preserve the very
ambiguities in the current Manual that are responsible for current
problems. Many plots of land now designated "wetlands" appear to have
been done so arbitrarily, because they are considered environmentally
valuable, even though they are not covered by the Clean Water Act. The
"Difficult-to-Identify" designation seems devised to allow such
classifications in the future.
<P>
** Reevaluate all land currently designated as a wetland in accordance
with the criteria of the new Manual.

<P> To remedy, in part, past abuses, and to apply the new regulations
fairly, all land should be presumed not to be wetland. The EPA then
should review every case to determine which property is a wetland for
the purposes of enforcing the Clean Water Act.

<P>
AN HONEST WETLANDS PROTECTION POLICY

<P> On a parallel track to the questions being considered by the
Council on Competitiveness, another cabinet-level group, the Domestic
Policy Council, is conducting a broad overview of general wetlands
policy. One of the questions the Council is considering is what to do
with an area after it is determined to be a wetland. Under the current
policy, the government denies owners the use of their land. This
raises a very important legal question. The Fifth Amendment to the
U.S. Constitution guarantees that when the federal government takes
private property for public use, it must pay the owner just
compensation. This is the Constitution's so-called "takings clause."
When the Clean Water Act is used in the manner originally contemplated
by Congress, to prevent water pollution, no compensation is required.
The "takings clause" is not at issue. The government simply prevents
one landowner from dumping a pollutant into a body of water that might
flow on to someone else's property. A landowner does not have a right
to create a nuisance on his property if it damages the property of
another. 

<P> The situation is quite different when the government denies an
owner a permit to use this property for activities that do not
constitute pollution. Then the owner is being deprived of a legitimate
use of his or her land. The "takings clause" thus applies, and the
government is obligated to pay compensation. 

<P> Recognizing Landowners' Rights. The courts are beginning to
recognize that the "takings clause" is being violated by some wetland
permit practices of the Army Corp of Engineers and the EPA. Last year,
in the case of Florida Rock Industries v. United States, the U.S.
Claims Court held that a landowner who had been denied a permit under
the Clean Water Act for discharging "pollutants" that did not
adversely affect water quality into wetlands was entitled to just
compensation. (   Florida Rock Industries v.  United States, 21 Cl. 
Ct.  161 (July 23, 1990).  See also Loveladies Harbor, Inc.  v. 
United States, 21 Cl.  Ct.  153 (July 23, 1990).) The Claims Court
awarded the landowner over $1 million in damages, applying the well-
established doctrine of takings law "that the public at large, rather
than a single owner, must bear the burden of an exercise of state
power in the public interest." (   Florida Rock Industries v.  United
States, 21 Cl.  Ct.  161, quoting Agins v.  Tiburon, 447 U.S.  255,
260-61 (1980).) 

<P> This case sets a precedent. If the Corp of Engineers and the EPA
continue to use the Clean Water Act as a vehicle for preserving
wetlands, they probably face more court judgments requiring them to
pay just compensation to landowners whose property is, in effect,
taken for public use. If the government wants to set aside and
preserve ecologically valuable wetlands, it should take the legal and
just approach: it should pay for them. The government, for instance,
could purchase "conservation easements" by paying the owners not to
change the land. Or the government could purchase the land outright. ( 
 The federal government already does this, to a limited extent,
through programs such as the Water Bank Program for Wetlands
Preservation mentioned in note 11 above.  Thus, all that is really
necessary is to expand an existing program.)

<P> Conservation Easements. Some may complain that paying to preserve
valuable wetlands may be expensive. Yet there may be no choice. The
courts seem ready to require that compensation be paid to landowners
denied their property rights. There is, of course, another source of
funds besides taxes that could be used for wetlands purchases. The
federal government already owns between one-quarter and one-third of
all the land in the U.S. Some of this could be sold and the proceeds
used to purchase conservation easements on ecologically valuable
wetlands. (   Alternatively, as San Francisco attorney Mark Pollot has
suggested, the federal government could compensate landowners whose
land it wishes to preserve as wetlands by simply giving them
substitute land directly.  See Henderson, op.  cit., p.  35.) By doing
so, the government would be substituting high-priority lands for low-
priority lands in its overall land holdings. This would achieve George
Bush's goal of "no net loss of wetlands" in a manner consistent with
the equally important goal suggested by economist Warren Brookes: "no
net loss of private property."


CONCLUSION

 The Clean Water Act originally was designed to prevent pollutants
from flowing from one body of water to another. To this end, the
federal government could claim jurisdiction over wetlands that may be
a source of such pollutants. Over the years, however, regulators have
used the Act's open-ended terms for a purpose for which the Act was
not intended: to protect wetlands as such. The Clean Water Act is an
inappropriate and inefficient vehicle for this end. Because the goals
of a wetlands policy and the best means to implement it have never
been considered and debated publicly in a coherent manner by policy
makers, often there is little connection between the government's use
of the "wetlands" designation and any legitimate environmental goal.
Worse, under the guise of protecting wetlands, the federal government
arbitrarily deprives owners of the full use and enjoyment of their
land without compensation.

<P> Restoring A Balance. Protecting private property rights is a
principal purpose of government. Preventing a pollutant from being
dumped in a body of water or a wetland does not necessarily violate
property rights. Quite the contrary. Preventing a pollutant from
flowing from water on one person's property into water on another's
protects the property rights of the latter. It is when the government
arbitrarily limits an owner's use of his property without
compensation, as it often has in the name of protecting wetlands, that
it oversteps it purpose.

<P> The Bush Administration can restore a balance to the government's
wetlands policy by revising the Delineation Manual and can begin an
open public debate on the role of the federal government in protecting
wetlands for their own sake.

     In the months of controversy since President Bill Clinton pledged
to end the military's ban against homosexuals, this ill-considered
idea has been widely rejected. It is clear that the campaign to allow
homosexuals to serve openly in the armed forces is failing. Last week,
following an exhaustive study, the Pentagon once again concluded that
"homosexuality is incompatible with military service." 
<P>
     The same study nevertheless proposes a policy that allows
homosexuals to serve if they keep their lifestyle private. Dubbed
"don't ask, don't tell," it is unclear if the policy has the support
of Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, who is holding
hearings to determine whether the current ban should be upheld,
altered, or abolished. "Don't ask, don't tell" is a compromise that
would prevent recruiters from screening homosexuals at the point of
enlistment, and might restrict the services' ability to investigate
evidence of homosexuality. Either way, the armed services would be
disrupted as commanders scrambled to deal with a fundamental
contradiction: a policy that claims that "homosexuality is
incompatible with military service," yet tacitly allows homosexuals to
serve so long as their sexual activity is private. This is a
politically expedient solution that will almost certainly subject
future presidential candidates to pressure for further compromise from
activists who are unhappy with "don't ask, don't tell."
<P>
     A policy based on contradictions is bound to fail. Congress
should resolve this issue by passing a law affirming that
homosexuality is incompatible with military service, and giving
military commanders authority to screen and discharge homosexuals
under any circumstances. 
<P>
     Sound Reasons. There are three detrimental effects of homosexuals
in the armed services that form the basis for the ban. They are:
<P>
1)   Unit cohesion is weakened. 
  <P>   Unit cohesion is the social bond that gives rise to that
intangible feeling which causes a man to dive on a grenade to save his
buddies, or to risk his life simply because his leader tells him to.
It requires the soldier to place the needs of the unit ahead of his
self-interest and individual identity. He will do this, however, only
if he trusts that his comrades and commanders are doing likewise.
While cohesion requires a strong degree of mutual affection, sexual
emotions are rooted strongly in self-interest. They can be distracting
and even disruptive, and often lie beneath the surface, not indicated
by any overt action or statement. 
<P>
2)   Professionalism is undermined. 
<P>     The presence of homosexuals in the armed services threatens the
military's highly regarded merit-based system. Sexual attraction
encourages special relationships without regard to rank and increases
the risk of favoritism. Political activism elsewhere in society
suggests that weakening the ban would be followed by quotas and
lawsuits if homosexuals were not promoted in representative numbers.
This would destroy the cohesion of a military unit, and erode the
military's successful merit-based promotion system.
<P>
3)   The risk of AIDS in the services is increased. 
<P>     Homosexuals contract HIV, the human immuno-deficiency virus, at
thousands of times the rate of heterosexuals and, according to the
federal Centers for Disease Control, two-thirds of U.S. AIDS cases are
found among homosexual men. Testing is imperfect, and may not reveal
the presence of HIV for months. During combat, individuals are exposed
routinely to the blood of others, and frequently require battlefield
transfusions from their fellow soldiers. If the "don't ask, don't
tell" compromise allows off-base, off-duty homosexual sex, will a
soldier hesitate to help a wounded homosexual soldier who may have
contracted HIV since his last test? Should battlefield medical
personnel proceed directly to a heterosexual soldier after treating a
homosexual's open wound? Military men and women willingly accept risks
not found anywhere else in society, but should they be needlessly
exposed to a disease that is 100 percent fatal and has no known cure?
Even the Red Cross does not allow homosexuals to donate blood.
<P>
     These sound reasons against allowing homosexuals in the armed
services are easily understood by the American people. Indeed, most
Americans  hold the sensible view that the purpose of the military is
to win wars, not to conduct liberal social experiments. In a recent
Gallup poll, Americans supported the ban by 53 percent, compared to 35
percent opposed.
<P>
     As most Americans understand, the issue is not one of fairness,
but of military effectiveness. The armed forces exist to wage war. War
is fought by units, not by individuals. Units function best when
differences among individuals are kept to a minimum. When units
function well, fewer Americans die. It is not fair to risk the lives
of American soldiers and sailors merely to accommodate the sexual
lifestyles of certain individuals.  
<P>
     Life in the military is indeed unique. Soldiers and sailors have
little choice about whom they work with or where they live. They are
part of a chain of command 24 hours a day. The commander's
responsibility for everything the unit does or fails to do never ends;
the now-infamous Tailhook scandal, in which dozens of officers were
disciplined for sexual misconduct during an off-duty event, proves
that military people are never off duty enough to escape the
consequences of their actions. This kind of accountability is rare in
society, but it is absolutely essential to military effectiveness. 
<P>
     Ask the Question. Behind the "don't ask, don't tell" policy is a
misguided assumption: that homosexual military personnel will abstain
from sexual activity. Proponents of this policy argue that what
matters is not whether someone is homosexual, but whether he or she
engages in homosexual behavior. But this is a distinction without a
difference. Is it reasonable to assume that homosexuals will not
engage in homosexual behavior? Do proponents of this proposal really
expect homosexuals to become celibate for the duration of their stay
in the armed services -- an expectation no one would reasonably have
for heterosexual recruits? 
<P>
     If it is reasonable to assume that homosexuals engage in behavior
which is "incompatible with military service," why not screen recruits
in advance in an attempt to limit that behavior? Acknowledging one's
homosexuality prior to induction does not result in criminal
prosecution or any infringement of rights; it simply denies the
homosexual the opportunity to be a soldier. Other behavior that harms
military effectiveness, such as drug abuse and sexual harassment, is
not tolerated in private; there is no reason why homosexuality should
be dealt with differently. 
<P>
     If homosexuality is incompatible with military service, it should
be prohibited outright. Looking the other way when homosexuals seek to
join the armed forces sends the message that they are welcome so long
as they remain celibate -- or do not get caught. Such a policy is
disingenuous and unrealistic.
<P>
     Endangering American troops just to placate those who promote a
homosexual lifestyle is irresponsible. Allowing homosexuals to serve
under any conditions would jeopardize U.S. troops, military readiness,
and the nation's security and prosperity. Congress should heed the
sound arguments for excluding homosexual Americans from the military.
It should end the use of this issue as a political football by passing
a strict version of the ban into law.

 Backgrounder #982 <BR>
 March 11, 1994 <BR>
 (published at 15 pages) <P>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>
</CENTER>INTRODUCTION 
 <P>
 Leaders from the major industrialized countries are 
scheduled to meet in Detroit, Michigan, on March 14-15, at 
the request of President Clinton, to discuss the causes of 
the persistently high levels of unemployment in their 
countries. Announcing the goals of the summit in Europe this 
January, President Clinton declared that, "We simply must 
figure out how to create more jobs and how to reward people 
who work both harder and smarter in the workplace." (David 
R. Sands, "Clinton Announces Plans for Jobs Summit," The 
Washington Times, January 11, 1994, p. B7.)
<P>
 The President is right to focus on how to create more jobs 
in this country. Although he boasted during his State of the 
Union address that 1.6 million jobs were created in 1993, 
job growth, in fact, is much weaker than normal this long 
after a recession. Since World War II, total employment 
growth has averaged 9.2 percent 33 months after a recession. 
But since the bottom of the 1990-1991 recession, total 
employment in the United States has climbed by just 2.5 
percent. (Daniel J. Mitchell, "The Budget and the Economy:  
A First Year Assessment of the Clinton Presidency," Heritage 
Foundation Backgrounder Update No. 213, February 7, 1994, p. 
2.)  President Clinton would do well to ponder the anemic 
job growth in Europe, because European firms are encumbered 
with costly mandates and taxes on employment that have 
discouraged hiring and held back employment growth. The 
President should recognize that his Administration's 
policies are repeating the mistake of the Europeans, and 
contributing to slow growth of earnings and employment in 
the United States. For example, the Administration has:
<P>
 Enacted the biggest tax increase in American history, which 
will discourage new business investment and job creation by 
raising corporate and individual tax rates.
<P>
 Signed the mandated Family and Medical Leave Act, which 
will raise labor costs and force employers to be far more 
selective about whom they hire, since they are required to 
offer certain employees more time off.
<P>
 Proposed a massive overhaul of the health care system, 
which would raise labor costs by mandating that employers 
cover workers. According to Lewin-VHI, one of the country's 
leading health care econometrics firms, the Clinton health 
plan would mean that among firms now providing health 
insurance, 19.9 percent would see costs per employee rising 
$500-$1,000 per year, 51.6 percent would face cost increases 
per employee of $1,000-$2,500, while another 15.2 percent 
would face costs per employee of more than $2,500. (Lewin-
VHI, The Financial Impact of the Health Security Act 
(Fairfax, VA:  Lewin-VHI, 1993).)
<P>
 Proposed worker training and unemployment insurance reform, 
that would cost between $3 billion and $9 billion per year. 
(David R. Sands, "Hill Republicans Criticize Clinton's 
Jobless Measure," The Washington Times, February 23, 1994, 
p. B8.)
<P>
 Considered a hike in the minimum wage from $4.25 to $4.75 
an hour, which would further increase the disincentive to 
hire teenage and poor, inner-city unemployed individuals.
<P>
 Moved ahead with an ambitious environmental regulatory 
agenda rangeing from global warming to new logging policies. 
(Federal Register pages, a rough estimate of the overall 
amount of regulatory activity, ran 60,950 for 1993, the 
highest level since the Carter Administration left office in 
1980.)
<P>
 These policies signal an apparent misunderstanding of the 
employment and job policies that led to the creation of over 
20 million new jobs in the 1980s. (See Daniel J. Mitchell, 
"Tax Rates, Fairness, and Economic Growth:  Lessons from the 
1980s," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 860, October 
15, 1991, p. 2.)  Each of these new programs or proposed 
policies add to the three principal governmental barriers 
that discourage employers from creating new jobs:  taxes, 
credit barriers, and regulatory and mandated benefit 
burdens. These barriers, which have steadily increased over 
the past few years in the United States, have discouraged 
business expansion and increased the cost of hiring new 
workers. Failure to reduce these barriers or -- worse still 
-- the imposition of new barriers, means that America will 
become a slow-growth economy.
<P>
  President Clinton should realize that high wages and 
mandated benefits are ruining the European economies and 
leading to high unemployment rates. In fact, several 
European countries and Japan are now trying to lower their 
labor costs and dismantle their generous "safety nets."  
Instead of continuing to add more burdens on employers, 
President Clinton should take the opportunity of the summit 
to advocate five simple principles of job creation: 
<p>
Principle #1:  European-style job training and employment 
policies have proven incapable of keeping unemployment low 
or raising the worker's overall standard of living.
<P>
 Principle #2:  High tax rates on employers and capital is 
the quickest way to insure high unemployment.
<P>
 Principle #3:  Excessive financial and banking regulations, 
which restrict the amount of capital firms can obtain, 
greatly limit business and job expansion.
<P>
 Principle #4:  Increasing the regulatory burden and 
mandating numerous employee benefits is a recipe for job 
destruction.
<P>
 Principle #5:  Sustained job growth results from 
competitive, efficient industries that are free of excessive 
government interference.
<P>
 Only by talking bluntly to the European allies and shunning 
"solutions" to the continuing problems of unemployment that 
will only slow wage growth, can President Clinton help the 
industrialized world to correct its economic ills. Adopting 
European-style employment policies, on the other hand, will 
lead only to European-style results. 
<P>
 UNDERSTANDING THE FIVE PRINCIPLES OF JOB GROWTH
<P>
  PRINCIPLE #1: European-style job training and employment 
policies have proven incapable of keeping unemployment low 
or raising the worker's overall standard of living.
<P>
 During his speech announcing the jobs summit, President 
Clinton declared, "We Americans have a lot to learn from 
Europe in matters of job training and apprenticeship, of 
moving our people from school to work into good-paying 
jobs." (Sands, "Clinton Announces Plans...," op. cit.)  
Undoubtedly, Americans have much to learn from the 
Europeans, but not about their employment policies. 
<P>
 The true effects of the European policies which the 
President and others glorify are best illustrated by the 
case of Germany. German workers enjoy roughly six weeks paid 
vacation each year, the shortest work week of any major 
industrial nation, high wages (averaging $26 an hour), and 
extensive health benefits mandated by the government. But as 
Ferdinand Protzman of The New York Times notes, 
"Unfortunately, [the German system] no longer works. 
Instead, the social contract that once made Germany's 
economy a model of stability has helped erode the nation's 
competitiveness as it struggles to recover from the worst 
recession in postwar history." (Ferdinand Protzman, 
"Rewriting the Contract for Germany's Vaunted Workers," The 
New York Times, February 13, 1994, p. F5.)
<P>
 Like many of its European neighbors, Germany is struggling 
with what has come to be known as "Eurosclerosis," which 
signifies a stagnant growth environment. As the chart on the 
following page shows, adherence to this model has brought 
the European Union (EU) slow growth and high unemployment. 
Unemployment has averaged almost 10 percent over the past 
decade in the major European countries, and is projected to 
average 12.1 percent in 1994 for the members of the EU. At 
the end of last year, approximately 32 million Europeans 
were jobless, which is roughly equivalent to the combined 
workforces of Spain and Sweden. (Stella Dawson, "Global Jobs 
Summit Delayed Amid NAFTA Battle," The Reuters European 
Business Report, November 4, 1993.)  Overall, the U.S. rate 
of employment growth has far outstripped Europe. Observes C. 
Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute of International 
Economics, "The U.S. has kept labor costs down and created 
40 million new jobs over the past 20 years. In Europe, wages 
have risen about 60 percent during that span but only 2 or 3 
million jobs have been created." (Quoted in Protzman, op. 
cit.)
<P>
 Peter Gumbel of The Wall Street Journal maintains this 
Eurosclerosis is caused by a "tangle of labor regulations 
and rising costs for employers [which] acts as a major 
disincentive to job- creation -- and a powerful incentive to 
moving production elsewhere." (Peter Gumbel, "Western Europe 
Finds That It's Pricing Itself Out of the Job Market," The 
Wall Street Journal, December 9, 1993, p. A1.)  Not 
surprisingly, perhaps, some 30 percent of business surveyed 
recently by the German Chamber of Commerce say they are 
considering shifting production to a more hospitable 
business environment. 
<P>
 Beside the European burdens on employers which discourage 
job expansion, employment is also discouraged through 
extensive unemployment insurance programs. Explains David R. 
Henderson of the Hoover Institution, "A single 40-year-old 
previously employed at the average production worker's wage 
would get benefits equal to 59% of previous earnings in 
France, 58% in Germany and 70% in the Netherlands." (David 
R. Henderson, "Eurosclerosis Spreads to Our Shores," The 
Wall Street Journal, October 14, 1993, p. A16.)  These 
benefits can be collected for many years as well. Hence, 
although the broad safety net available to displaced workers 
seems compassionate on the surface, it actually creates 
disincentives to full employment and a productive workforce. 
Absenteeism, for example, ran at 9 percent in Western 
Germany in 1992, 8.2 percent in France, and 12.1 percent in 
Sweden. By way of comparison, the U.S. rate is only 3 
percent. (Protzman, op. cit.)
<P>
 Also overrated is the German job training system, which 
Clinton and his Labor Secretary, Robert Reich, seek to 
emulate. While the German educational system focuses on 
highly technical training for its future workers, the U.S. 
system focuses on generalized training. Some academics, such 
as Lester Thurow of MIT argue that the German approach has 
created a superior workforce which enjoys a better standard 
of living. But a recent comparison of the two systems by 
Kenneth A. Couch, of Syracuse University, disputes this 
belief. Couch concludes that, "an apprenticeship program by 
itself is unlikely to have widespread positive effects 
either on economic measures such as employment or indirectly 
related social problems." (Kenneth A. Couch, "Germans and 
Job Training, Education and Us," The American Enterprise, 
November/December 1993, p. 18.)  For example, comparing 
German and American 24- to 33-year-old high school 
graduates without further education, Couch found roughly the 
same percentage were employed (with actually more Americans 
than Germans possessing manufacturing jobs), more of the 
Americans in the sample group were married, and slightly 
more Americans had children. Likewise, from 1983 to 1988, 
Couch found American workers outperformed their German 
counterparts overall. America experienced average annual 
employment growth during the period of 2.4 percent, versus 
Germany's meager 0.4 percent. And real GDP growth over the 
same period averaged 3.9 percent for America and 2.3 percent 
for Germany. Other European countries have fared no better 
relative to America.
<P>
 If American policymakers choose to move toward a more 
technical-based educational system, the German approach 
thus is not the obvious model to follow. As Couch notes, 
"Emulating the German approach may in fact give us an 
educational system that will not perform better but will 
cost more than our current one." (Ibid., p. 13.)
<P>
 Following the Failed Model. European-style job training and 
employment policies which have been implemented in America 
have met with failure. Public employment programs have 
proven to be net job destroyers, since the amount of money 
required to create a public sector job is typically several 
times that of private sector job creation. (See Edward L. 
Hudgins, Ph.D., "Why Infrastructure Spending Won't Jump 
Start the Economy," Heritage Foundation Memo to President-
Elect Clinton No. 9, January 15, 1993.)  A recent study of 
public transit investment by John Semmens of the Chandler, 
Arizona-based Laissez Faire Institute, notes that for the 
$61.5 billion invested since 1965, only 800,000 jobs were 
created. If that same amount of money had been invested by 
private business through a corporate tax cut, 8 million jobs 
could have been created. (John Semmens, "Government 
Investments Yield Poor Results," Heartland Institute, A 
Heartland Perspective, October 18, 1993, p.2.)  Likewise, 
Semmens found that 13 million to 20 million jobs would have 
been created if the $61.5 billion had instead been devoted 
to a capital gains tax cut, or an expansion of Individual 
Retirement Account investment in Treasury bills or common 
stocks. (John Semmens, "Federal Transit Subsidies:  How 
Government Investment Harms the Economy," The Freeman, 
February 1994, p. 71-75.)  Most important, instead of 
producing the high-wage, well-skilled jobs the current 
Administration calls for so frequently, public programs only 
provide low-wage, low-skill, temporary employment, which 
often costs taxpayers dearly in the process.
<P>
 Further, it cannot be argued that government sponsored 
employment training policies provide European citizens with 
greater purchasing power and a higher standard of living 
than Americans. Purchasing power parity, which is the most 
accurate measure of comparative consumer power, shows that 
U.S. consumers have a clear advantage over foreign citizens 
(see table on preceeding page). Following Europe's poor 
example, therefore, likely will lead not only to lower 
growth and fewer jobs, but also to a lower standard of 
living for American citizens.
<P>
 The "Europeanization" of the American Labor Market. Despite 
the failure of the European system to sustain employment and 
a higher standard of living, America's federal labor market 
policy is being molded to resemble German, French, and other 
European models. This "Europeanization" of the American 
labor market policy threatens to undermine industrial 
competitiveness, increase budgetary strains, and lower the 
average worker's standard of living. 
<P>
 PRINCIPLE #2: High tax rates on employers and capital is 
the quickest way to insure high unemployment.
<P>
 To hire additional workers, employers need capital. Capital 
fuels job creation by allowing employers to invest in the 
various means of production, including land, equipment, 
factories, new technologies, and labor. Capital can be 
acquired in one of two ways:  saving it from profits or 
borrowing it. Examining each method of capital accumulation 
indicates why U.S. employers are finding it increasingly 
difficult to obtain the fuel for job creation.
<P>
 The Current Tax Environment. Past recoveries show that the 
U.S. economy is performing below typical levels. Whereas 
employment in the previous post-war recoveries averaged 9.2 
percent 33 months after the end of the recession, the 
current recovery has only seen approximately 2.5 percent 
growth over a similar period of time. One factor that aided 
recoveries during the early 1960s and early 1980s was a 
reduction in tax rates.
<P>
 Unfortunately, the most recent recession, which followed 
the 1990 tax hikes, has been followed by tax rate increases. 
The Clinton tax plan adopted by Congress last year increased 
taxes on business and investment. The corporate tax rate on 
business, for example, was raised from 34 percent to 36 
percent. Likewise, top individual rates moved up from 31 
percent to as high as 42.5 percent. This is important since 
approximately 80 percent of small businesses pay taxes under 
the personal income tax code. The excessive taxation of 
capital gains also continues. The capital gains tax on 
individuals currently stands at 28 percent, up from 20 
percent in 1986. As the chart on the following page shows, 
before this rate jump, new business incorporations had risen 
steadily throughout the 1980s. After the increase, start-ups 
fell immediately and sharply. The aggregate effect of these 
taxes is a huge barrier to job creation, as capital shifts 
from the hands of investors to the government. 
<P>
 The Effects of the Tax Barrier. High taxes reduce 
investment in businesses and slow job growth by encouraging 
individuals and firms to seek alternative investments with a 
more profitable return on their dollar. It should be no 
surprise that America's current savings and investment rates 
are lower than those required for robust, long-run economic 
growth. This is due directly to the trade-off investors face 
when contemplating increasing consumption versus saving or 
investing. Increasing consumption carries little penalty; 
few taxes or other disincentives exist for immediate 
purchases. But forgoing current consumption to invest assets 
represents an increasingly unattractive option if the 
rewards of profitability springing from investment are 
penalized with higher tax rates. Moreover, earnings in the 
U.S. are still penalized twice through taxation, first at 
the corporate level and then later at the individual level. 
Therefore, if an investor had $10,000 to spend or invest, 
spending currently would more than likely represent a more 
attractive choice than investing. 
<P>
 Taxes raise the cost of capital for industrial equipment 
and machinery. As the American Council for Capital Formation 
(ACCF) reports, "Recent research confirm[s]... that the 
volume of investment in equipment is a critical factor in 
the pace of economic growth and development. [I]nvestment in 
equipment is perhaps the single most important factor in 
economic growth and development." (Mark Bloomfield and Margo 
Thorning, Ph.D., "The Impact of President Clinton's Tax 
Proposals on Capital Formation," American Council for 
Capital Formation, Testimony to the House Ways and Means 
Committee, March 16, 1993, p. 5.)  Yet, ACCF points out that 
despite the beneficial effects of the tax-reducing Economic 
Recovery Act of 1981 on such investment, tax policy in the 
following years became heavily biased against such 
investment incentives. The tax acts of 1982 and 1986, which 
raised taxes, each resulted in an increase in the cost of 
capital for equipment as investors found such opportunities 
less attractive. Largely as a result of these high-tax 
policies, the total cost of capital for manufacturing 
equipment increased by 22.9 percent from 1981 to 1986. The 
most recent revisions of the tax code are likely to further 
discourage investment, and thereby increase barriers to 
expansion and job creation.
<P>
 Hence, the potential for long-term job creation in the 
current tax environment is not encouraging, since 
entrepreneurs are less able to entice investors to risk 
their money on new business ventures. Because taxes create 
disincentives to invest in businesses, capital for future 
job creation is being produced at a lower rate.
<P>
 PRINCIPLE #3: Excessive financial and banking regulations, 
which restrict the amount of capital firms can obtain, 
greatly limit business and job expansion.
<P>
 In recent years, the term "credit crunch" has been coined 
to refer to how difficult it has been for many businesses to 
obtain loans. One reason this crunch has occurred has been 
the sharp rise in banking regulation in recent years. In 
addition to $10.7 billion in general regulatory compliance 
costs in 1992, bankers face costs from lost interest 
payments on reserves they are required hold at the Federal 
Reserve, and deposit insurance premiums. (Not included in 
the $10.7 billion figure are the potential costs from the 
FDIC Improvement Act of 1991, which could push regulatory 
costs even higher.)
<P>
 The Effects of the Credit Barrier. How do these trends 
affect job creation?  This regulatory burden has had a 
restrictive effect on credit growth in recent years. The 
American Bankers Association observes that over this same 
period, more than 40 major federal regulations affecting 
bank operations were promulgated. (American Bankers 
Association, "The Banking Industry:  The Key to Jobs and 
Economic Growth," February 1, 1993, p. 8.)  Although 
estimates of the regulatory burden on banks are not 
available for previous recessionary periods, there is no 
doubt that the number of regulatory restrictions and burdens 
the banking industry faces have increased significantly over 
the past 20 years. Declares the American Bankers 
Association:  "Hog-tying the banking system with regulatory 
red tape means two things -- more expensive bank credit and 
less of it." (American Bankers Association, "Cutting the Red 
Tape:  Let Banks Get Back to Business," November 1992.)
<P>
 Just as higher taxes restricted job creation by holding 
back entrepreneurs, so too has the credit crunch. Without 
easy access to credit, American firms are forced to postpone 
plans for job expansion. A 1993 survey of small and mid-size 
businesses by the Arthur Anderson Enterprise Group revealed 
that 38 percent of all businesses surveyed were unable to 
fulfill their capital needs. Perhaps more important, 58 
percent of businesses that were in their first three years 
of operation have been unable to fulfill their capital 
needs. The same survey noted that, due to the lack of 
capital, 39 percent of the surveyed businesses were unable 
to expand operations and almost 20 percent of them reduced 
employment. (Arthur Anderson Enterprise Group, Survey of 
Small and Mid-Sized Businesses:  Trends for 1993, June 1993, 
p. 11.)  Limited access to capital has also made it more 
difficult for firms to purchase their own equipment, forcing 
an increasing number of small businesses to lease equipment, 
often at very high interest rates. (Michael Selz, "Many 
Small Businesses Are Sold on Leasing Equipment," The Wall 
Street Journal, October 27, 1993, p. B2.)
<P>
 In response to this problem, the Clinton Administration has 
called for new banking regulations governing how loans are 
made. The Administration hopes to boost the number of loans 
made through the Small Business Administration to "make SBA 
more responsive to those industries with the potential for 
creating a higher number of jobs, those involved in 
international trade, and those producing critical 
technologies." (The National Performance Review, Creating a 
Government That Works Better & Costs Less, September 7, 
1993, p. 148.)  But this is unlikely to be a solution to the 
underlying problem of restricted credit growth. The SBA loan 
program accounts for only a small percent of capital for new 
firms, and in any case tends to funnel dollars to favored 
businesses rather than the best investments.
<P>
 Clinton's new plan to reform banking regulation through 
agency consolidation will not help either. Monopolizing 
regulatory power in the hands of one agency will make it 
easier for heavy-handed and manipulative policies to be 
implemented, thereby raising the regulatory burdens faced by 
banks. Lawrence Lindsey, a member of the Board of Governors 
of the Federal Reserve System, says, "Monopoly regulation is 
a bad idea. [It] will greatly harm both the banking industry 
and the economy, and lead to an unfortunate politicization 
of bank regulatory policy." (Lawrence Lindsey, "How to 
Corrupt Banking," Forbes, January 31, 1994, p. 100.)
<P>
 PRINCIPLE #4: Increasing the regulatory burden and 
mandating numerous employee benefits is a recipe for job 
destruction.
<P>
 The number of regulations and mandated benefit requirements 
that employers are forced to comply with has grown steadily 
in recent years. Estimates of the total cost that 
regulations impose on the economy range from a low of $615 
billion to a high of $1.7 trillion. (See "Manhandled by 
Mandates," Forbes, October 25, 1993, p. 39; William G. 
Laffer III and Nancy A. Bord, "George Bush's Hidden Tax:  
The Explosion in Regulation," Heritage Foundation 
Backgrounder No. 905, July 10, 1992.)  This burden 
translates into millions of foregone job opportunities. 
(William G. Laffer III, "How Regulation is Destroying 
American Jobs," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 926, 
February 16, 1993)  For example, Michael Hazilla and Raymond 
Kopp have estimated that environmental regulations reduced 
aggregate employment by 1.18 percent as of 1990, (Michael 
Hazilla and Raymond J. Kopp, "Social Cost of Environmental 
Quality Regulations:  A General Equilibrium Analysis," 
Journal of Political Economy, Vol. 98, No. 4 (1990), p. 
867.) which means over one million jobs would have existed 
without the regulations. ( Laffer and Bord, op. cit., p. 6.)
<P>
 Regulation and mandated benefits take their toll 
indirectly. When the government increases this burden on the 
private sector by promulgating new rules, firms must adjust 
their behavior accordingly. This adjustment process may 
require an increase in worker training, paperwork 
requirements, or even retooling. Regardless of the 
adjustment method, costs will be incurred. The costs of 
adjustment directly affect the firm's profits since a 
greater than expected amount of earnings will be exhausted 
in compliance measures. In addition there may be extra costs 
associated with hiring new workers. As a result, firms will 
try to pass the costs of adjustment on to their consumers, 
or, if that is not possible due to competitive market 
conditions, scale back future production, investment, or new 
hiring. If the new compliance and adjustment costs are 
sufficiently high, firms may scale back existing production 
and lay off workers.
<P>
 The Effects of the Regulatory and Mandated Benefits 
Barrier. Several studies point to the job-destroying effect 
of the regulation and mandated benefits explosion that has 
taken place in recent years. (See Laffer, op. cit., p. 7; 
Gary Anderson and Lowell Gallaway, "Derailing the Small 
Business Job Express," (Washington, D.C.:  Joint Economic 
Committee, November 7, 1992); Lowell Gallaway and Richard 
Vedder, "Why Johnny Can't Work:  The Causes of 
Unemployment," Policy Review, Fall 1992; Alan Reynolds, 
"Cruel Costs of the 1991 Minimum Wage," The Wall Street 
Journal, July 7, 1992, p. A14.)  With the passage of 
mandates included in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, 
the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, and the Civil 
Rights Act of 1991, and the increases in the minimum wage in 
1990 and 1991, the burdens on employers have ballooned. 
<P>
 The dramatic rise in the minimum wage alone, from $3.35 in 
1989 to $3.80 in 1990 and $4.25 in 1991, helped push teenage 
unemployment to the highest rate in a decade. If the Clinton 
Administration proceeds with plans for a 50 cent hike in the 
minimum wage, and the labor market adjusts as it has in the 
past, there is likely to be an increase in the teenage 
unemployment rate of between 0.5 percent and 3 percent.
<P>
 Another burdensome employer mandate will be the "employer 
trip reduction" requirement of the Clean Air Act. Starting 
this year, this will require employers in nine metropolitan 
areas to reduce the number of employees driving to work. 
Although no employment loss estimates are available, over 12 
million employees will be covered by the act, making it 
difficult to believe that some jobs will not be effected. 
(See David Andrew Price, "Newest Mandate -- Everyone Into 
the Carpool," The Wall Street Journal, November 8, 1993, p. 
A14.)
<P>
 Whatever their intentions, civil rights employment mandates 
also take their toll. Peter Brimelow and Leslie Spencer of 
Forbes recently estimated the total cost of civil rights 
regulation to be $236 billion, which translates into a loss 
of 4 percent of GNP. (Peter Brimelow and Leslie Spencer, 
"When Quotas Replace Merit, Everybody Suffers," Forbes, 
February 15, 1993, p. 82.)
<P>
 The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, which grants 
employees as much as 12 weeks unpaid leave each year, 
discourages job creation. Because many employers will not be 
able to absorb the high costs and lost output resulting from 
mandatory worker leave, the policy will have the unintended 
consequence of encouraging struggling businesses not to hire 
individuals who might take advantage of the leave policy. 
The SBA has found the overall costs of this act to total as 
much as $1.2 billion. (Eileen Trzcinski and William T. 
Alpert, "Leave Policies in Small Business:  Findings From 
the U.S. Small Business Administration Employee Leave 
Survey," Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy 
Research Summary Number 99, March 1991.)
<P>
 Other employer mandates that currently burden the labor 
market include the health care requirements found in the 
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 
(COBRA), the prevailing wage requirements of the Davis-Bacon 
Act, and workers and unemployment compensation payments. 
These factors create added disincentives to job expansion 
since taking on an additional worker means steadily higher 
employer payroll burdens.
<P>
 Employment Thresholds. In recent years, many legislators 
have come to realize that added regulation and mandates have 
a destructive effect on job growth, particularly in the 
small business sector. But, instead of attempting to craft 
more sensible policies or deregulate where possible, they 
tend to respond to small business concerns by adopting 
employment thresholds. Employment thresholds exempt smaller- 
sized businesses from certain regulations. For example, the 
Americans With Disabilities Act currently exempts all firms 
with fewer than 25 employees from the regulation; this will 
be lowered to cover firms with fewer than 15 employees after 
July 26, 1994. Other examples include the Family and Medical 
Leave Act, which exempts business with fewer than 50 
employees and the Plant Closing Law, which exempts 
businesses below 100 employees.

 These thresholds have the unfortunate side-effect of 
discouraging employers near the threshold from hiring new 
employees. Pointing to the Family and Medical Leave Act, 
Ruth Stafford, president of the Kiva Container Corporation, 
says, "Fifty is the magic number." (Jeanne Saddler, "Small 
Firms Try To Curb Impact of Leave Law," The Wall Street 
Journal, August 5, 1993, p. B1.)  Her firm, like many 
others, plans to hold employment stable just under the 50 
employee barrier using more temporary or part-time workers. 
This phenomenon is already being seen:  according to the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics, temporary employment grew by 20 
percent in 1993, up from 6 percent in 1990.
<P>
 PRINCIPLE #5: Sustained job growth results from 
competitive, efficient industries that are free of excessive 
government interference.
<P>
 Steering America onto a path of greater job creation, low 
unemployment, and a higher standard of living will require a 
shift of current American economic policy. The three primary 
governmental barriers to job expansion -- high taxes, 
limited credit through irrational financial regulations, and 
excessive regulations and added mandated benefits -- all 
must be corrected. Adopting the European system would be a 
mistake. America should instead learn from history that 
where goods, services, labor, and wages have been allowed to 
move or fluctuate freely, prosperity, entrepreneurship, and 
high employment have been the result. 
<P>
 To put America back on the high-employment, high-wage 
track, President Clinton should take several specific and 
immediate steps to ensure American industries remain strong 
and competitive:
<P>
 Step #1:  Lower tax rates on businesses and capital. The 
effects of high tax rates on employers and capital are 
direct and damaging. Lowering both corporate tax rates and 
the capital gains tax rate (while indexing it for inflation) 
would provide an immediate and strong job stimulus by 
reducing the cost of hiring workers and unlocking the 
capital needed for business expansion.
<P>
 Step #2:  Reject all attempts to establish a European-style 
employment policy, especially expensive job training 
programs. High wages, sustained employment, and increased 
business activity should be guiding goals of public policy. 
Mandating them should not. Costly and ineffective job 
training programs should be ruled out as job-creating 
options. Americans need only look at the failure of European 
programs to understand why such an approach is a mistake. 
Such programs require massive amounts of public spending for 
the small number of jobs which are created.
<P>
 Step #3:  Cap federal spending. This will aid job creation 
by increasing the amount of private savings available for 
business investment.
<P>
 Step #4:  Enact comprehensive regulatory reform. The 
"hidden tax" of regulation and increased mandated benefits 
directly increase the cost of employing workers. The 
President and Congress should establish a federal regulatory 
budget and estimate the employment impact of regulations 
before they take effect. The regulatory budget would place a 
limit on the total cost that is imposed on the economy each 
year by new federal regulations. When the budget had been 
passed, no new regulations could be imposed -- unless other 
rules were withdrawn.
<P>
 Step #5:  Adopt rational health care reform based upon 
consumer choice and not new employer mandates. No new policy 
action threatens to do as much damage to the labor market in 
the immediate future as does employer-based health care 
mandates. While reform is needed, it should not simply push 
the cost of comprehensive health coverage onto employers 
through expensive new payroll taxes. Accomplishing reform in 
this manner will result in the loss of millions of jobs. 
(See Daniel J. Mitchell, "The Economic and Budget Impact of 
the Clinton Health Plan," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder 
No. 974, January 13, 1994.)
<P>
 Step #6:  Reform America's archaic financial and banking 
laws. Financial restrictions such as the McFadden Act of 
1927, the Bank Holding Act of 1956, and the Glass-Steagall 
Act of 1933 retard bank stability and expansion and, 
therefore, limit the credit opportunities they can offer to 
businesses. Eliminating these impediments to financial 
efficiency would allow businesses to take advantage of 
expansionary opportunities by borrowing needed capital.
<P>
 Step #7:  Overhaul antiquated antitrust laws. America's 
outdated antitrust laws, such as the Sherman Antitrust Act 
of 1890 and the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, make it 
difficult for firms to enter into joint production alliances 
that could raise industrial efficiency and create new job 
opportunities.
<P>
 Step #8:  Pass product liability reform and other tort 
reform legislation. Currently, America's tort system saps 
private sector entrepreneurialism, hinders product 
innovation, and threatens the continuation of numerous 
businesses. Without reforms limiting punitive damages and 
streamlining costly court procedures, an increasing number 
of jobs will be placed at risk.
<P>
 Step #9:  Continue to push for trade liberalization 
globally while eliminating domestic barriers to free trade. 
While the job gains will result from the wise actions 
already taken of passing the North American Free Trade 
Agreement (NAFTA) and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT) agreements, further efforts should be made to expand 
free trade agreements while lowering the domestic barriers 
to imports.
<P>
 Step #10:  Encourage the use of privatization and 
contracting out whenever possible. Privatization and 
contracting out not only insure that services are delivered 
more efficiently for less money, they also allow private 
firms to raise capital and re- invest in more productive, 
long-term private sector jobs. Vice President Gore's 
National Performance Review failed to tap such methods of 
real government reform. (See Scott A. Hodge and Adam D. 
Thierer, "The National Performance Review:  Falling Short of 
Real Government Reform," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder 
No. 962, October 7, 1993.)  Undertaking such measures would 
encourage increased private sector employment while 
demonstrating that the Administration is serious about 
changing the way Washington works.
<P>
 CONCLUSION
<P>
 The Jobs Summit affords President Clinton the opportunity 
to outline the fundamental principles of job creation to the 
industrial nations of the world. Unfortunately, many 
nations, specifically in Europe and more recently the United 
States, have forgotten that low taxes, easy access to 
credit, rational regulations, and vigorous exposure to 
competition, are the foundation for a healthy, job- creating 
economy. 
<P>
 The most important lesson that President Clinton can bring 
back from Detroit is that government policies that increase 
the cost of hiring people mean that fewer people will be 
hired.

 <H3><I> STAY OUT OF UNESCO </I></H3>

<P>

The Clinton Administration is weighing a U.S. return to the United Nations 
Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Deputy 
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott wrote last December that a return to 
UNESCO, from which the U.S. withdrew in 1984, "remains high on our 
agenda." Rejoining UNESCO, however, would be a serious mistake. 
UNESCO is poorly managed, suffers from a vague mandate, and duplicates 
the efforts of other U.N. agencies and private organizations. Moreover, there 
is no need for the U.S. to rejoin because it already participates in the best 
UNESCO programs. 
<P>
Established in 1946 and headquartered in Paris, UNESCO today is the third-
largest specialized agency in the U.N. system. It has 182 member nations and 
an annual budget of some $450 million. UNESCO attempts to foster 
international intellectual cooperation in a wide range of fields, including 
communications, education, and oceanography. These activities include 
collecting statistics on school enrollments and education spending in member 
states. UNESCO's Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) 
promotes scientific research on the world's oceans. UNESCO also undertakes 
development programs in several fields, providing education-related 
fellowships and grants, for example. Its World Heritage Commission (WHC) 
aims to protect historic sites and natural landmarks by providing financial aid
for restoration, technical advice, and training. 
<P>
Reagan Withdraws. 
<P>
The Reagan Administration withdrew from UNESCO in 1984 largely because 
the agency had become highly politicized. When the U.S. left, many 
UNESCO programs and debates focused on disarmament, "collective rights," 
and other themes which Washington believed were departures from 
UNESCO's original mandate. Moreover, these activities, driven by East Bloc 
and Third World countries, were hostile to free markets and a free press. 
UNESCO became a hotbed of agitation for the so-called New World 
Information and Communications Order (NWICO), which would have 
sanctioned government licensing of reporters. 
<P>
The Reagan Administration also criticized UNESCO for its top-heavy, over-
centralized bureaucracy. The lavish lifestyle which UNESCO afforded 
Director General Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow throughout the 1970s and early 
1980s, including his opulent penthouse above UNESCO headquarters, also 
aggravated U.S. officials. Moreover, during these years UNESCO had the 
most unrestrained budgetary expansion in the U.N. system. 
<P>
A Return to UNESCO? 
<P>
Today's UNESCO Director General Federico Mayor Zaragoza has introduced 
some management reforms. As a result, he has won over the U.S. State 
Department to the view that the U.S. should rejoin UNESCO. The State 
Department believes that American concerns expressed ten years ago and 
reaffirmed by the Bush Administration have been addressed adequately. 
Clinton Administration officials have suggested that only budgetary concerns 
are keeping the U.S. from rejoining; full membership would cost Washington 
$65 million a year. 
<P>
Rejoining UNESCO, however, would be unwise for several reasons. 
<P>
REASON #1: UNESCO has serious management shortcomings. A 1993 
General Accounting Office (GAO) report notes that UNESCO has made little 
progress in remedying its overly centralized bureaucracy. UNESCO has too 
many of its personnel and activities based in its headquarters and not in the 
field. Employees, the GAO reports, are hesitant to leave behind their Parisian 
lifestyles. The resulting centralization complicates and reduces the 
effectiveness of UNESCO's activities. It is difficult, for example, to help a 
country develop its communications facilities when programs concerning this 
issue are centered in Paris. Moreover, the GAO reported a planned 66 percent 
budget increase for 1994-1995 in the Participation Program, a reserve fund 
for special programs and grants which UNESCO insiders have described as a 
"slush fund" for the Director General. 
<P>
REASON #2: Rejoining UNESCO would send the wrong signal about U.N. 
management reform. That UNESCO management is flawed should come as 
no surprise. The U.N. itself is poorly managed. Former Under- Secretary 
General for Administration and Management Dick Thornburgh, in a scathing 
1993 report, wrote: "The United Nations presently is almost totally lacking in 
effective means to deal with fraud, waste and abuse by staff members." 
Current U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Madeleine Albright acknowledged last 
year that Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's reform efforts have been 
disappointing. While Boutros-Ghali has no direct control over UNESCO, the 
U.S. would be sending the wrong signal concerning how serious it is about 
U.N. reform if it were to rejoin UNESCO now. 
<P>
REASON #3: UNESCO's mission lacks focus. UNESCO was chartered "for 
the purpose of advancing, through the educational, scientific and cultural 
relations of the peoples of the world, the objectives of international peace an
the common welfare of mankind." This mandate is too broad and only 
encourages confusion about the agency's mission. The State Department in 
1990 reported that confusion about UNESCO's mission has resulted in "a 
work program of astounding breadth, with resources spread so thinly that it 
has often been difficult to discern any measurable impact." This assessment 
remains valid today. The most efficient and valuable organizations within the 
U.N. system are those that pursue clearly defined tasks: technical 
organizations like the Universal Postal Union and the International 
Telecommunications Union. 
<P>
REASON #4: UNESCO activities are redundant. The activities of UNESCO 
are duplicated by other U.N. organizations. The World Health Organization, 
for example, promotes awareness about AIDS, as does UNESCO. In fact, 
Boutros-Ghali has recognized that this problem exists among U.N. economic 
and social development programs. He is quoted in Thornburgh's 1993 report 
as complaining that "Duplication is widespread; co-ordination is often 
nominal; bureaucratic battles aimed at monopolizing a particular subject are 
rife; and organizational objectives are sometimes in conflict." Rejoining 
UNESCO would be a step away from the consolidation the U.N. system 
desperately needs. Moreover, UNESCO's educational programs also are 
duplicated by a host of public and private American organizations, including 
the U.S. Agency for International Development and the German Marshall 
Fund. 
<P>
REASON #5: The U.S. already benefits from the best of UNESCO. The U.S. 
currently participates and enjoys full voting rights in those UNESCO 
programs that it considers worthwhile, including the World Heritage 
Commission and the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission. By 
spending no more than a few million dollars annually, the U.S. supports these 
activities while avoiding the added costs of UNESCO overhead. Instead of 
rejoining UNESCO, the U.S. should be working to spin off its worthwhile 
operations to non-UNESCO organizations. The IOC, for example, could 
become part of the World Meteorological Commission. 
<P>
The U.S. has done well for ten years without belonging to UNESCO. The few 
truly worthwhile UNESCO activities are open to U.S. participation without 
U.S. membership. There is a plethora of poorly managed U.N. organizations 
and commissions with murky mandates and elusive goals which need the U.S. 
more than the U.S. needs them. UNESCO fits this description. This is no time 
to rejoin.

By Marshall J. Breger<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>

     Judge Charles Richey of the United States District Court for the
District of Columbia on June 30 hurled a judicial thunderbolt against
the NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement between the U.S.,
Canada, and Mexico.
<P>
     Agreeing with the complaint of three special interest groups --
Ralph Nader's Public Citizen, the Sierra Club, and the Friends of the
Earth -- Judge Richey in Public Citizen v. Office of the United States
Trade Representative, found that the United States Trade
Representative (USTR) had failed to comply with the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) by not preparing an environmental
impact statement on the NAFTA. He then ordered the Clinton
Administration to write such a statement as soon as possible. 
<P>
     An environmental impact statement, or EIS, is an evaluation of
the environmental impact of a U.S. government agency action or
legislative proposal. The agency must canvass affected state and local
governments, prepare an assessment of environmental vulnerabilities,
and propose alternate options. The EIS was mandated to ensure that
administrative agencies take environmental factors into account in
their decision-making processes.
<P>
     By statute, the EIS requirement applies in terms not only to
agency decisions such as rule-making but to such informal action as to
where to place a dam. Indeed, it goes so far as to apply to "every
recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and other major
Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human
environment." Congress, however, has always known how to get
information it wants from the executive branch. Thus, students of
environmental law have never understood the point of the requirement
of an EIS for legislative proposals. Judge Richey seemingly wants to
instruct them.
<P>

The Posture of the NAFTA
<P>
     George Bush signed the NAFTA agreement with Mexico and Canada on
December l7, l992. Bill Clinton had stated during the presidential
campaign that he would not send NAFTA implementing legislation to
Congress unless he successfully negotiated side agreements on labor
and environmental issues with Mexico and Canada. Among his
requirements were the creation of two tri-national commissions, one on
labor and one on environmental issues. The Clinton Administration
currently is negotiating these side agreements and hopes to reach a
successful resolution this summer in order to simultaneously submit
implementing legislation for both the NAFTA and the side agreements to
Congress this fall.

<P>
Judge Richey's Opinion
<P>
     Richey's opinion is vulnerable for a number of reasons. First, it
remains doubtful whether the "public interest" plaintiffs have
standing to sue. Do they have a sufficient interest in the controversy
that justifies their bringing the case? Can they show some concrete
injury-in-fact? Under recent Supreme Court precedents, Judge Richey's
grant of standing, based on the mere conjecture that the NAFTA will
constrain U.S. environmental regulation in a manner that increases
environmental degradation, is problematic at best. Similarly, Public
Citizen's assertion that organization members living in border states
will be affected adversely by the trade agreement is no more than an
"academic exercise in the conceivable." Ultimately, plaintiffs are
reduced to relying on a bizarre form of injury. They argue that the
failure of the government to prepare an EIS deprives them of needed
information about the environmental effects of NAFTA. 
<P>
     Even if the plaintiffs do have standing to bring this case to
court, it is unlikely that the environmental impact requirement for
legislative proposals is judicially enforceable. The NEPA does not
create an independent private right of action. If someone wants to sue
for a violation of NEPA -- such as a failure to prepare an EIS -- it
must be done through the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), which
permits judicial review of "final agency action" only. Judge Richey
tried to get around this hurdle by finding that final agency action
was taken by the United States Trade Representative. He is simply
incorrect. It is the President who submits the NAFTA implementing
legislation to Congress. It is settled law that the President is not
an agency for purposes of the Administrative Procedures Act. Thus, as
the Supreme Court has underscored in the 1992 census case
(Massachusetts v. Franklin), where it is the President, not an agency,
who specifically must take final action under a statute, APA review is
not available. The Administration's decision not to draft an EIS,
therefore, is simply not a reviewable agency action. 
<P>
     Far more important, however, is that the Richey decision raises
significant constitutional issues. It places constitutionally
problematic strictures on the President's power to propose
legislation. And more broadly, it intrudes the courts into the
President's authority to effectively enter into international
agreements. 
<P>
     Indeed it is hard to imagine that Congress, in passing the NEPA,
actually contemplated that the President must prepare an environmental
impact statement for international agreements and treaties negotiated
with foreign countries. While it may be unsurprising that the State
Department, for many years, has prepared EIS's for numerous
international treaties and agreements, these precedents in no way
vitiate the constitutional issues presented since the State
Department's past voluntary actions in no way impairs the scope of the
President's executive authority.

<P>
Legal Effect
<P>
     The immediate legal effect of the Richey decision on the NAFTA is
unclear. Judge Richey did not enjoin the USTR to stop negotiating the
side agreements with Mexico and Canada until an EIS is completed. Nor
did he forbid the Clinton Administration from submitting the NAFTA to
Congress without an EIS, stating only that USTR "shall propose such an
Environmental Impact Statement forthwith."
<P>
     Under traditional NEPA jurisprudence, an agency action based on a
defective EIS is open to judicial review. However, where a legislative
EIS is required, as in the NAFTA implementing legislation, no court
can prevent Congress from voting on that legislation because the court
believes that an environmental impact statement is defective. In that
sense, this Public Citizen litigation should be regarded as a
"nuisance" suit, brought less to accomplish legal purposes than to
wreak political havoc with the NAFTA. 

<P>
Political Effects
<P>
     Here it may succeed. The political effect of the district court
decision is potentially devastating to the fate of the NAFTA. It
provides succor to those who oppose the NAFTA for any and all reasons
and raises the "price" the Administration will have to pay in the
NAFTA side agreements to secure "Green" support. It provides an excuse
for those who want to delay the NAFTA to demand that Congress wait
upon the judicial branch. And indeed it may yet lead those within the
Clinton Administration who are ambiguous about the NAFTA to put the
whole thing off until next year. Such a delay would likely doom the
NAFTA.
<P>

What To Do?
<P>
     The Clinton Administration has sought an expedited review of
Judge Richey's decision. Already the parties have agreed to a
compressed briefing schedule with final briefs due on August l0. At
that time the Court of Appeals will set a hearing date. The Justice
Department has requested that the Court hear the case in late August.
It is important that the Court do so. A decision would then be
possible sometime in September, and this would still allow the NAFTA
to be voted on this fall.
<P>
     The pendency of the Court decision ought not preclude the
Administration from moving quickly to conclude its negotiations over
the NAFTA side agreements. The Court case has absolutely no impact on
the side agreements. Indeed, concluding the side agreements should
clarify significantly the environmental impact of the NAFTA and how
the U.S. is seeking to protect the environment of the U.S. and Mexico.
<P>
     In the unlikely event that the Court of Appeals affirms Judge
Richey's decision, the Administration should immediately seek
expedited review in the Supreme Court. In light of the NAFTA's
importance, the Administration also should be ready to submit an EIS
forthwith if the Supreme Court so requires. While some have suggested
that preparation of an EIS would take six months to a year, this need
not be the case. The Administration has already done extensive work on
the environmental impact of the NAFTA. It has prepared a 250-page
Review of U.S.-Mexico Environmental Issues assessing its various
environmental ramifications. Thus, much of the "scoping" of issues has
already been done. Furthermore, many of the environmental consequences
of the NAFTA are speculative at best. Thus, the amount of further
empirical work that must be done is limited. While in no way
preferable, it should be possible, if legally required, to provide
Congress with an EIS while it debates the NAFTA.
<P>
     In any event, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor has pointed
out that the Clinton Administration is free to submit the NAFTA to
Congress at the earliest possible moment -- regardless of whether the
environmental impact statement is finished. Judge Richey did not
forbid this. Indeed, as Public Citizen itself has admitted, "the
Administration remains fully free to send the NAFTA to Congress for
approval whenever it wishes, whether or not the office of USTR has
completed its EIS by that time." And obviously the Congress, in Public
Citizen's words, has "the right... to consider the NAFTA with or
without an EIS." In the final exigency, the Administration must be
prepared to act.
<P>
     On its own, Judge Richey's decision cannot derail the NAFTA. It
can only slow down the train. Any delay in bringing the NAFTA to the
Hill, however, provides oxygen to NAFTA opponents. It is up to the
Clinton Administration to prevent the battle over the NAFTA from being
bogged down in a dispute over the reach of the National Environmental
Policy Act.

<title>After the Summit: Preventing the Collapse of Israeli-Palestinian Negotiations - Heritage</title>

<h3>AFTER THE SUMMIT: PREVENTING THE COLLAPSE OF ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN NEGOTIATIONS</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/phillips.htm">James Phillips</a><br>
Senior Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 463<br>
October 10, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Last week's Arab-Israeli summit in Washington was a foreign policy fiasco. President Bill Clinton claimed that it was a success because Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat began to talk to each other again after their negotiating dialogue had been broken off by civil disorders that claimed the lives of 15 Israelis and 59 Palestinians. But talking, by definition, is what happens at a summit. The real test of the Washington summit was whether Clinton could take concrete action to advance the American goal of building a secure and stable Arab-Israeli peace--and here the talks failed miserably. There was no substantive agreement, and the only outcome was procedural--a decision to undertake nonstop negotiations beginning October 6 at the Erez border crossing between Israel and Gaza.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There was so little agreement that the two sides were unable even to hammer out a joint statement. Instead, at the summit's conclusion, President Clinton read a maddeningly vague statement that failed to condemn the political violence that had derailed the negotiations, despite the fact that such violence--particularly armed attacks by the Palestinian police--violated the September 1993 Israeli-Palestinian peace accord signed at the White House. Moreover, Clinton's statement included a weak and unseemly plea to the violent Palestinian mobs that endanger the fragile peace negotiations, asking them to give the summit participants "more time."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This timid entreaty ignores the fact that the Palestinian civil disorders were not a spontaneous reaction to the September 23 opening of a second exit to an archaeological tunnel in Jerusalem; they were orchestrated by Arafat, who used the official Palestinian television and radio stations to incite his followers. The Palestinian leader charged falsely that the tunnel somehow defiled Muslim holy sites located 250 yards away. Arafat undoubtedly hoped to exploit the ensuing violence to undermine Prime Minister Netanyahu's domestic political support, isolate him abroad, and drive a wedge between Israel and the United States that could help strengthen the Palestinian bargaining position in future negotiations with Israel. This strategy can work only if the outside world buys into it by blaming Israel for Arafat's brinkmanship. Clinton should have made it clear to Arafat that exploiting political violence to gain negotiating leverage is unacceptable and will doom the negotiations if tried again.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Washington summit also dealt a setback to U.S. foreign policy by squandering the prestige and credibility of an American President on a risky, unscripted diplomatic enterprise. The summit's prospects for success were marred by inadequate advance preparation and the lack of a clear negotiating agenda, and its inconclusive results will undermine American policy in the Middle East by leading U.S. allies and adversaries in the region to question the wisdom and skill of American policymakers at the highest levels. This is particularly damaging, coming on the heels of President Clinton's weak response to Saddam Hussein's violation of the Kurdish safe haven in August.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A more prudent response to the Israeli-Palestinian crisis would have been for Secretary of State Warren Christopher to take the lead as a diplomatic troubleshooter, holding presidential involvement in reserve as a last resort. The failure of the Washington summit is likely to undercut Clinton's ability to convene another emergency summit in the future, thereby limiting U.S. options in the event of another crisis in Arab-Israeli relations. In the future, the Clinton Administration should rule out such diplomatic high-wire acts and make every effort to avoid engaging the prestige of the presidency unless some diplomatic progress is assured in advance.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the aftermath of the summit, the U.S. should modify its approach to promoting peace to reflect the fact that negotiations have been severely disrupted, if not destroyed altogether, by the recent political violence. The cornerstone of the Oslo agreement, negotiated by Israel and the PLO in Norway in August 1993, was Palestinian renunciation of the "armed struggle" in return for Israeli recognition and an opportunity to gain gradually increasing authority over an incrementally growing slice of territory. The recent violence, especially the participation of some of the 30,000 Palestinian police, threatens the viability of the Oslo process.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The ailing peace negotiations need major surgery, not a cosmetic facelift. This urgent operation requires the agreement and close cooperation of the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli government. The U.S. cannot impose a solution, but it must assist the two sides to reach a durable agreement. To do so, the Clinton Administration should:
<p><ul>
<b><li>Make bolstering security against terrorism the highest priority.</b> More than 230 Israelis have been killed by terrorists since the September 1993 peace accord, compared with 209 killed in the entire decade before the agreement was signed on the White House lawn. Prime Minister Netanyahu has pledged to continue along the Oslo negotiating track, but seeks to renegotiate parts of the original agreement to enhance Israeli security. The U.S. should sympathize with this approach, especially since the Palestinian police -- presumed at Oslo to be an anti-terrorist force -- have proved unreliable. Washington also should encourage the two sides to negotiate improved security arrangements for the 450 Israeli settlers in Hebron, the last Palestinian city under Israeli control, that provide for Israeli military redeployment within (but not from) that tense city.
<p>
<b><li>Insist that Yasser Arafat suppress terrorism and cease his inflammatory rhetoric. </b>  Arafat's police intermittently crack down on Hamas (the Islamic Resistance Movement) and other terrorist groups opposed to peace negotiations and then seek to co-opt them by releasing their members from prison. If he expects to be treated as a reliable negotiating partner, Arafat must comply consistently and fully with his obligation under the Oslo agreement to halt terrorism, take action to purge his police force of those that fired on Israelis, stop using political violence as a negotiating tactic, and cease his calls for a jihad (holy war).
<p>
<b><li>Stretch out the negotiating timetable.</b> Oslo process established a five-year period of Palestinian self-government that would allow the two sides to build confidence in each other before they resolved the most contentious issues, such as Palestinian statehood, the demarcation of borders, the status of Jerusalem, the future of Israeli settlements, and the question of Palestinian refugees. These thorny issues were not scheduled to be negotiated until the final status talks, slated to start at the beginning of the third year of Palestinian self-government. It was hoped that both sides by then would gain the political flexibility needed to make difficult compromises. However, the experiment in coexistence has turned into a nightmare for Israelis, who have become less willing to take risks for peace.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To salvage the chances for a stable peace, the negotiating deadline for reaching a final status agreement should be stretched out past the current 1999 target date. Final status talks should begin as soon as possible, but the two sides should be freed from deadline pressures to enable them to reach a workable agreement without being rushed. This will give the Palestinian Authority more time to prove that it is willing and able to cooperate with Israel in rooting out terrorism. Moreover, it will take at least a generation to lay a solid foundation for a durable peace. Pressing the two sides to rush to meet the 1999 deadline when most other deadlines set by the Oslo agreement have been missed is unrealistic and could jeopardize the chances for a genuine peace.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The U.S. must focus on its long-term goal of helping to build a stable and secure Arab-Israeli peace, and not become bogged down in obsessively advancing a "peace process" that is doomed to failure unless its security flaws are rectified. While Washington should continue to serve as an honest broker in the negotiations, it must bear in mind that Israel is a close ally whose vital security requirements should not be sacrificed for Palestinian promises that too often go unfulfilled.

<CENTER><H3><I> NOW COMES THE HARD PART: THE U.S. OCCUPATION OF HAITI</I>

Executive Memorandum #391<BR>
September 20, 1994

<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>


     Everyone can draw a sigh of relief now that U.S. forces will not
be invading Haiti. The loss of American lives that would have resulted
from an invasion has been avoided. Nonetheless, for the first time in
80 years, large numbers of American troops are landing in Haiti.
Within several weeks, as many as 15,000 U.S. forces are expected to be
dispatched to that poor, chaotic nation. Thus, while an invasion of
Haiti has been avoided, an occupation has not. 
    <P>  And this is precisely Bill Clinton's -- and America's -- new
problem. The actual invasion of Haiti to reinstall Father Jean-
Bertrand Aristide to power was never the main reason for opposition to
Clinton's Haiti policy. Secretary of Defense William Perry recently
acknowledged that even an invasion that encountered resistance would
have taken no more than "a few hours." Rather, people were against the
invasion because of what would come afterward -- a U.S. occupation of
Haiti that they felt was unwise and unnecessary. Therefore, the
original cause of opposition to Clinton's policy remains. With U.S.
troops heading for Haiti, the easy part is over. Now the difficult
task of pacifying and "restoring" democracy begins. 
  <P>   Public Wary About Clinton Policy. Having assumed responsibility
for Haiti's future, the Clinton Administration still has not convinced
the American people that intervention in Haiti was necessary. Even
after a speech to the nation on September 15, in which the President
outlined his reasons for military action, more than 60 percent of
Americans polled were against the use of U.S. force. In fact, as the
hour of invasion drew closer, the more opposition to an invasion
mounted. New reports reveal that Clinton was desperate for Jimmy
Carter's peace mission to succeed. In the hours before the invasion
was to begin, the President apparently began to realize that military
action would be a big political mistake.
  <P>   But the President may face an even bigger political headache in
the future: managing the occupation of an extremely poor and divided
Third World country. Clinton has yet to outline a convincing "exit
strategy" for the U.S. -- to define clearly the conditions that must
be met in order to get the troops back home. Despite the President's
assurances that U.S. troops will return soon, the Clinton
Administration is underestimating the troubles U.S. forces will face
in Haiti. Bringing Aristide back to Port-au-Prince will be easy.
Keeping him there in power will not be.
  <P>   Many Unanswered Questions. The precise terms of the agreement
between the United States and the Haitian military junta are unclear.
According to the deal brokered by Jimmy Carter, by October 15, unless
the Haitian parliament has acted sooner to offer them political
reprieve, the junta must relinquish power to the elected government of
Aristide. This poses a number of intriguing questions, including:
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>1)   To whom will the military and police forces owe their allegiance
     once their leaders have abdicated? Many of them were opponents of
     Aristide and his supporters. American peacekeepers may be left to
     contend with general lawlessness among thousands of armed forces
     whose leaders no longer control them. The U.S. troops will have
     to disarm these troops if they are to avoid becoming targets
     themselves. But the policy of disarming belligerents in Somalia
     failed, at the cost of more than three dozen American lives.
<P>
2)   What if General Raoul Cedras or other members of the junta refuse
     to leave Haiti once they step down from power? In the press
     conference after the deal was announced, Secretary of State
     Warren Christopher said that "there will be no incentive for [the
     generals] to stay in Haiti" after October 15. But nothing in the
     agreement prevents them from staying in Haiti. Moreover, Cedras
     and his allies represent the most well-organized and determined
     opposition to Aristide. If Cedras stays and decides to run for
     parliament this year or for president next year, U.S. forces may
     find themselves caught between two diametrically opposed
     political factions. It is not inconceivable that Aristide,
     emboldened by the U.S. presence, might incite his followers to
     the same type of mob tactics he used as president to intimidate
     political opponents. In August 1991, he encouraged his supporters
     to surround the parliament building to prevent members from
     voting a motion of no-confidence against his government.
<P>
3)   How long before Aristide turns on his American mentors? The
     Clinton Administration has been able to extract promises of good
     behavior from Aristide as long as he has been living comfortably
     in Washington, D.C. Once he is back in Port-au-Prince, however,
     he could revert to the anti-Americanism that had been the
     hallmark of his political career. For example, in an April 1990
     radio interview regarding U.S. support for the upcoming Haitian
     elections, Aristide claimed that "they [the Americans] want to
     hold our guts always in their hands. Thus, we will be
     economically, politically, and culturally dependent. For our
     part, we reject this.... "  If Aristide becomes unhappy with the
     United States -- if aid is not enough or if he thinks the U.S. is
     equivocating in its support for him personally -- this anti-
     Americanism is bound to resurface.
<P>
4)   What happens if Aristide decides not to step down at the end of
     his presidential term? In his September 15 address to the nation,
     President Clinton declared that "Aristide has pledged to step
     down when his term ends... [in 1996]." But that is a rather
     dramatic concession that may come as a surprise to Aristide's
     supporters in Haiti. Until now, Aristide has held firm to the
     belief that the period of his exile does not count as part of his
     five-year term in office. Will the U.S. blockade Haiti and impose
     economic sanctions if Aristide remains in office past 1996, in
     violation of the 1987 Haitian constitution?
<P>
5)   What happens when "democracy" fails to take root with Aristide's
     return? With the occupation of Haiti, the U.S. assumes
     responsibility for building "democracy" in a country where three-
     quarters of its presidents in nearly two centuries of
     independence have not completed their terms. The U.S. will soon
     be sending judicial, law enforcement, military, economic, and
     political advisors to help establish civil order there. Despite
     Clinton's claims to the contrary in his September 15 speech, this
     is nation-building pure and simple; it is a policy that failed
     miserably in Somalia last year with the unnecessary loss of some
     40 American lives.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     America's new venture into liberal colonialism has begun. The
U.S. is about to occupy a country to install in power a left-wing
priest who made a career out of denouncing America and everything it
stands for. Meanwhile, a few hundred miles closer to U.S. shores,
another Caribbean dictator abuses human rights and rules
undemocratically. Yet Fidel Castro is spared the fate of the Haitian
generals. The reasons for this double standard are as mysterious as
the reasons for occupying Haiti in the first place.

<title>Time to Resolve the House Post Office Scandal -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>
<h3> TIME TO RESOLVE THE HOUSE POST OFFICE SCANDAL </h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/mason.htm">David M.  Mason</a><BR>
                    Director, U.S. Congress Assessment Project
<BR>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 375<br>
February 17, 1994<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p> 


     When the House of Representatives returns from its current break
on February 22, Members will decide how to resolve the House Post
Office scandal.
<P>
     Despite the conviction of seven former House employees for Post
Office-related crimes, and allegations of improper activity by sitting
Members of Congress, the House has failed to investigate the matter
properly or even to consider disciplinary action.  Representative
Ernest Istook (R-OK) has moved to force a vote next week ordering the
House Standards of Official Conduct Committee (the Ethics Committee)
to investigate the matter.
<P>
          The Post Office scandal began with a May 1991 investigation
by the U.S.  Capitol Police into embezzlement by a single employee. 
The inquiry rapidly expanded to include allegations against other
employees and a general audit of the Post Office.  In early June 1991
top House officials moved to stop the investigation despite protests
from then-Capitol Police Chief Frank Kerrigan.  A month later, the
Postal Inspection Service of the U.S.  Postal Service began its own
investigation at the request of then-U.S.  Attorney Jay Stevens.  In
September 1991, the report of that investigation was turned over to
House Postmaster Robert Rota, who says he gave the report to Heather
Foley, wife of House Speaker Thomas Foley and his unpaid chief-of-
staff.  No action was taken until January 1992 media reports revealed
that embezzlement and drug sales had taken place in the House Post
Office.  Following those reports, Democratic leaders referred the
matter to the House Administration Committee, which established an
investigative task force.
<P>
     The task force's investigation was marked by partisan disputes,
leading to the issuance of separate Republican and Democratic reports
in July 1992.  Democratic Task Force Leader Charles Rose of North
Carolina declared the matter closed, but the Republican report raised
numerous questions about illegal activity and mismanagement in the
Post Office, noting that many issues could not be resolved by the task
force because important records were unavailable and because Rota and
other Post Office employees were not questioned under oath.  Rota
subsequently admitted that he misled the task force.  The House agreed
to put the Post Office under the control of a new, non-partisan
administrator, but took no action to clarify questions raised by the
Republican task force report or to investigate and consider
disciplinary action against specific employees or Members, a step
which can be taken only by the Ethics Committee.
<P>
     The issue again subsided until July 1993, when former Postmaster
Rota pleaded guilty to three criminal charges, implicating House Ways
and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski and former
Representative Joe Kolter in an illegal scheme to trade stamps or
official House postal vouchers for cash.  Soon thereafter
Representative Istook began calling for an Ethics Committee
investigation of these allegations.  Largely on the argument that an
Ethics Committee investigation might interfere with the workings of an
ongoing grand jury inquiry, Istook agreed not to force a vote on his
request, but did introduce a resolution (H.Res.  238) calling for such
a probe.  The resolution has 60 cosponsors.
<P>
     Istook's request has now been pending for six months.  In the
meantime, authority for the first grand jury expired and a second
panel had to start work anew, this time under the third U.S.  Attorney
to supervise the case -- a Clinton appointee.  Istook argues that
further delay based on potential grand jury action is unwarranted, if
indeed it was ever justified.  As the House was preparing to leave for
a week-long recess on February 10, Istook gave notice that he would
demand a vote on his request for an Ethics Committee investigation as
soon as the House returns.  Since this is a matter of privilege under
House Rules, the Speaker must schedule the vote within two legislative
days, making it necessary for the House to consider the issue within a
day of its return on February 22.
<P>
     The Constitution gives the House the authority, and by
implication the responsibility, to discipline its members.  In other
cases House leaders have acted aggressively to preserve the
prerogatives of the House to discipline Members, rejecting attempts by
the executive branch or the judiciary.  This separation of powers
argument is a key justification, for instance, for congressional self-
exemptions from legal requirements or enforcement procedures under
many civil rights and worker protection laws.  Representative Rose,
who chaired the original Post Office investigation, claims that Ethics
Committee action regarding alleged deficiencies in his own financial
disclosure statements precludes subsequent court action on the same
charges.  The logic of these arguments would demand that the Justice
Department stand aside for an internal House probe of its Post Office,
rather than the other way around.  At a minimum it is clear that there
is no legal or constitutional requirement for the House to delay an
inquiry into the conduct of its own Members in anticipation of
potential action by the executive branch.
<P>
     House inaction on the Post Office compares unfavorably with the
Senate Ethics Committee's investigation of arguably lesser charges
against Senator Bob Packwood (R-OR).  Despite the Senate's aggressive
stance, the Justice Department apparently is conducting a parallel
investigation (an FBI agent recently examined Packwood's financial
disclosure filings).
<P>
     Istook has responded to charges that a House inquiry might
interfere with the Justice Department probe by requiring, in his
resolution, that the Ethics Committee cooperate with Justice and by
allowing the committee to suspend its inquiry with respect to any
Member who is already under investigation.  While media attention has
focused on allegations regarding Representative Rostenkowski, Istook's
resolution orders a broader inquiry which might determine whether
other Members violated House rules in connection with the Post Office. 
Such matters might well fall below the standard for criminal
prosecution, but still could warrant internal House action.
<P>
     Finally, Istook argues against the House simply awaiting
executive branch action, pointing out that the Reno Justice
Department's record in politically sensitive cases including
Whitewater, the death of Vincent Foster, and the State Department
personnel files (where Justice refused to prosecute, despite a
recommendation from the State Department's Inspector General),
inspires little confidence.  It was in anticipation of precisely this
sort of politically sensitive situation that the Constitution granted
Congressmen partial immunity from arrest and gave each House power to
discipline its own Members.  Abdicating that responsibility in such a
high profile case would again show that the House is incapable of
managing its internal affairs, and strengthen arguments for remedies
such as independent counsels and subjecting Members to executive
branch regulators.
<P>
     The House Post Office scandal has dragged on for three years. 
Despite the criminal convictions of several staff members, House
leaders have continued to resist a thorough investigation of
Representatives' conduct.  While caution to avoid interference with
criminal probes is appropriate, such external efforts are no excuse
for the House failing to deal with its internal scandal.  Istook's
motion for an Ethics Committee investigation will ensure that House
Members can no longer avoid this issue.

<title>The UN's 50th Anniversary: Time for Reform, Not Celebration</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>THE U.N.'s 50th ANNIVERSARY: TIME FOR REFORM, NOT CELEBRATION</h3>
By Thomas P. Sheehy<br>
Jay Kingham Fellow in International Regulatory Affairs<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum 434<br>
October 20, 1995<br>
<hr size=3 width=50%></center><p>


The Clinton Administration and many other governments worldwide have been turning up the rhetoric for the United Nations' 50th anniversary. The celebration is set to culminate early next week when most heads of state, including President Bill Clinton, address the U.N. General Assembly. Amid all the standard accolades for the U.N., the President is bound to raise the issue of reform. Even Ambassador Madeleine Albright, who is second to none in her enthusiasm for the U.N., says the world body is an "elephantine" organization in need of reform. But to reform the U.N., the Clinton Administration will have to do more than talk. Among other steps, it will have to:<p>
<ul>
<li>Cut funding for U.N. peacekeeping,
<p>
<li>Eliminate funding for big U.N. conferences, and
<p>
<li>Eliminate funding for the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).
</ul><p>
<b>Working Around the Edges.</b> In large part because the 104th Congress is increasingly skeptical about the value of the U.N., the Clinton Administration has given U.N. reform a sense of urgency. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, in a September 25 address to the General Assembly, declared that "The U.N. bureaucracy should be smaller, with a clear organizational structure and sharp lines of responsibility."  Christopher then went on to propose a "concrete agenda" of reform which includes ending programs that have achieved their purpose, consolidating overlapping programs, downsizing regional economic commissions, adopting a moratorium on big conferences, streamlining the Secretariat, extending the scope of the Inspector General to the entire U.N. system, and expanding Security Council membership. Several other proposals would affect peacekeeping, including subjecting proposed missions to more rigorous scrutiny.  
<p>
These measures, while welcome, would change the way the U.N. operates only marginally. Expanding the scope of the Inspector General will matter little as long as the office remains what Senator Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS) and Representative Lee Hamilton (D-IN) call a "disappointment."  Former Under-Secretary General for Administration and Management Dick Thornburgh wrote in 1993 that "The United Nations... is almost totally lacking in effective means to deal with fraud, waste and abuse by staff members."  It appears that the Inspector General, recently established and lacking essential powers, has not been the remedy.
<p>
The sincerity of the Clinton Administration's commitment to some of these reforms is doubtful. The moratorium on big conferences, for example, is odd given that the Administration has boasted frequently of its participation in these events. Vice President Al Gore went to the Cairo Conference on Population and Development in 1994; the Vice President accompanied Hillary Clinton to the Copenhagen Social Summit last March; and Mrs. Clinton and Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala attended the recent Fourth Women's Conference in Beijing. The Clinton Administration's opposition to these wasteful talkfests rings hollow. 
<p>
<b>Toward Real Reform.</b> Instead of waiting for the U.N. bureaucracy to act, the U.S. should take the lead in pressing for needed reforms. Specifically, the U.S. should:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Cut funding for U.N. peacekeeping.</b> U.N. peacekeeping has grown considerably in size and scope over the last several years. There now are 16 peacekeeping operations worldwide, and the U.S. peacekeeping bill is some $1.1 billion a year, up from only $64 million in 1988. Many U.N. peacekeeping missions have floundered, most notably in Somalia and Bosnia. Generally, these are "second generation" peacekeeping missions in which U.N. forces enter hostile environments in the hope of forging peace and providing humanitarian aid. These misguided efforts have brought the U.N. close to financial ruin. The U.N. peacekeeping account is now nearly $1 billion in the red. 
<p>
Despite opposition from the Clinton Administration, Congress has moved to reduce America's contribution to U.N. peacekeeping. The House in June cut one peacekeeping account to around $425 million, which is some $100 million less than last year. (The U.S. funds peacekeeping through several accounts.) A Senate bill -- the Foreign Relations Revitalization Act of 1995 (S. 908) -- gradually reduces the annual U.S. contribution to peacekeeping to some $200 million by 1999. If implemented, these reductions would ensure that the U.N. sticks to traditional peacekeeping operations, such as in Cyprus, and would put a stop to the risky and senseless expansion of U.N. peacekeeping operations to include "peace-enforcement." 
<p>
<li><b>Eliminate funding for big U.N. conferences.</b> These conferences cost millions of dollars and typically are long on rhetoric and short on achievement. The Social Summit, for example, focused on "Creating Jobs" and "Building Solidarity," two objectives well beyond the capabilities of a one-time gathering of national and international bureaucrats. The 1996 City Summit to be held in Istanbul will develop a "global plan of action" to address every conceivable urban problem, including crime and transportation inadequacies. If the U.S is truly interested in ending support for blatantly counterproductive programs, it should withdraw its funding for the City Summit now. 
<p>
<li><b>Eliminate funding for the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).</b> The UNDP is one of a bewildering array of specialized agencies in the U.N. system. It is charged with, among other objectives, "contribut[ing] to a sustainable expansion of the world economy."  Essentially, the UNDP is a foreign aid program. These activities are beyond what should be the scope of the United Nations:  acting primarily as a forum for discussion of international security matters while undertaking such other focused activities as humanitarian relief efforts. Moreover, the notion that foreign aid can promote economic development has been proven fallacious. The countries which have lifted themselves out of poverty, such as Chile and Hong Kong, have done so largely because they were deprived of foreign aid, not because they received any money from the U.N. 
</ul><p>
The Clinton Administration recognizes that the U.N. badly needs reform. Even the President, who once embraced "assertive multilateralism," has come to recognize that the U.N. wastes U.S. taxpayer dollars. The Administration is misguided, however, in thinking that its reforms go far enough. Much more needs to be done. The Congress has the opportunity to promote the establishment of a realistic U.S.-U.N. relationship, one in line with the U.N.'s limited accomplishments and potential. With its American funding reduced, the U.N. will be forced to adopt discipline in taking on peacekeeping missions and reduce the number of its wasteful undertakings. Otherwise, the current U.S. reform campaign will be yet another wasted opportunity on the long road to reforming the U.N.

<html><title>Messages Clinton Should Deliver At the U.S.-Russian Summit -- heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>MESSAGES CLINTON SHOULD DELIVER AT THE U.S.-RUSSIAN SUMMIT</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/cohen.htm">Ariel Cohen, Ph.D. </a><br>
Salvatori Fellow in Russian and Eurasian Studies<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 435<br>
October 23, 1995<br>
<hr size=3 width=50%></center>
<p>
President Bill Clinton is planning a positive, "feel-good" summit with Russian President Boris Yeltsin on October 23, 1995, in New York City. This event takes place as an intense parliamentary campaign is underway in Russia which ultimately may cast a shadow over Boris Yeltsin's political future and imperil U.S.-Russian relations. Popular support for Russian nationalist leader General Alexander Lebed and the recent Communist victory in the Volgograd local elections indicate that the tide of Russian political opinion may be turning against Boris Yeltsin.
<p>
U.S.-Russian relations are too important to waste on a "feel-good" summit. The President needs to be preparing the ground for what could be a challenging period in U.S.-Russian relations. He needs to get down to business, not only dealing with such issues as Bosnia and NATO expansion, but positioning the U.S. for a time when Boris Yeltsin may no longer be president of Russia.
<p>
<b>America's Russian Challenge.</b> Russia's recent outcry over the NATO bombings in Bosnia exposed a former superpower in search of an identity and led by an increasingly combative political establishment. Russia's foreign policy is becoming more anti-Western, as evidenced by the opposition to NATO enlargement, the planned sales of nuclear reactors to Iran, and threats to breach the 1990 Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty. Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev has been weakened by intrigues and is about to be dismissed by President Yeltsin. Suspicion of the West is growing in Moscow. Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, presidential foreign policy advisor Dmitrii Ryurikov, General Evgenii Primakov, head of the foreign intelligence service, and General Alexander Korzhakov, ubiquitous Chief of the Kremlin guard, all tend to be anti-Western and against reform. They also are in positions of major influence over Yeltsin's foreign and security policies. 	
<p>
<b>Yeltsin's Political Weakness.</b> Yeltsin's internal position is precarious. His public approval ratings hover between 9 and 15 percent, and his chances of winning a presidential bid do not look bright. The polls consistently show that several Russian politicians, such as Lebed and Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the YABLOCo party, would be able to defeat him in an election. Two "centrist" parties were launched in May:  Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin's Our Home Russia and Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin's Accord. The first is polling around 10 percent, and the second has yet to get off the ground. According to high-level Russian sources, some in Yeltsin's circle are considering canceling the presidential elections altogether. Thus, Yeltsin and his team could be swept away by a cadre of anti-Western nationalists if the presidential elections slated for the summer of 1996 actually take place. Alternatively, Yeltsin could be rendered more prone to a coup if he fails to hold the elections and undermines his remaining legitimacy. 
<p>
President Clinton needs to take stock of the new winds blowing in Russia. He must prepare U.S. policy for the likelihood that Russia may be on the verge of a major political crisis. At the New York summit, the President should:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Support democracy and free-market principles rather than particular Russian leaders.</b> Clinton's unwavering support of Yeltsin, particularly in the wake of the October 1993 attack on the Russian Supreme Soviet and the Chechnya operation, have already cost the U.S. a great deal of goodwill among both Russian nationalists and reformers. The chances are good that Clinton or the next American President will have to deal with a new set of players in Moscow. The U.S. cannot afford to appear partisan. Clinton should be firm in expressing American support for democracy, elections, free markets, and individual rights in Russia. He should play down his support for the personal political fortunes of Boris Yeltsin.
<p>
<li><b>Proceed with caution in bringing Russian peacekeepers to Bosnia.</b> While the U.S. should support a sustainable, long-term peace settlement in Bosnia, it is too early to negotiate the specific details of Russia's military involvement in a peacekeeping operation. Nevertheless, President Clinton should declare that, in principle, the Russian armed forces will be welcome to support peace in Yugoslavia, but only if American troops are committed to the peacekeeping mission.1  Clinton should be careful not to jeopardize NATO's operational control over the entire peacekeeping mission. Russian troops could play a positive role in such important tasks as mine-sweeping, logistics, and communications. In these areas, the Russian military could cooperate with its NATO counterparts. However, Clinton should not agree to integrating Russian troops into the NATO command and control structure. This leaves open the possibility of a Russian "occupation sector" inside Bosnian Serb territory. The presence of Russian troops on the ground could prevent further NATO air strikes in the event the peace treaty collapses. 
<p>
<li><b>Reaffirm that NATO enlargement is not directed against Russia.</b> Many in Moscow are expressing deep concern about NATO expansion. The summit is a good opportunity for President Clinton to make clear to Boris Yeltsin and the Russian people that the North Atlantic alliance harbors no hostile intentions toward them. While NATO enlargement will occur, Russian participation in the Partnership for Peace and Moscow's dialogue with Brussels should be expanded simultaneously. NATO enlargement will expand the zone of peace and stability in Europe. Such a zone is in the interests not only of Europe, but of Russia, Belarus, and other countries of the former Soviet Union as well. 
<p>
<li><b>Oppose a unilateral breach of the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty.</b> The Russian military is threatening a unilateral breach of the CFE treaty. Specifically, Moscow insists on reviewing upwards the limits it imposes on the number of tanks and cannon permitted on the ground. President Clinton should oppose such an asymmetrical approach. These issues can be renegotiated within the framework of the treaty. If Russia remains determined to deploy more treaty-limited equipment on its southern flank, then the U.S. should seek a <i>quid pro quo</i> -- relief from the 1972 ABM Treaty, which is impeding the U.S. ballistic missile defense program.

<li><b>Offer incentives to cancel the sale of nuclear reactors to Iran.</b> The radical regime in Tehran has launched a bid to acquire nuclear weapons and has ordered two nuclear reactors from Russia. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not support this sale, which could endanger both Russian and Western security. The deal is being promoted by the powerful atomic industry ministry (Minatom) and its chief, Viktor Mikhailov. Iran, with its formidable oil and gas resources, does not need nuclear power. If Tehran wants an additional source of electricity, Russia could sell electrical power from its own ample resources. In addition, to compensate Russia for the lost reactor sales, the U.S. could increase its Russian uranium import quota or cooperate in building safer nuclear reactors on Russian soil.
<p></ul>
This is not the time for a "feel-good" summit with the Russians. Although the President's time with Boris Yeltsin is limited, he has enough time to deliver some important messages, not only to Yeltsin, but to all of Russia and the world. The U.S. is still committed to democracy in Russia, but that cause no longer has a single human face. At the New York summit, President Clinton should be looking ahead, preparing the ground for what may well be a rocky road in future U.S.-Russian relations.

<title> Using the Appropriations Process To Curb EPA's Regulatory Excesses  -- Heritage </title>

<center><h3><i> USING THE APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS TO CURB EPA'S REGULATORY EXCESSES</i></h3>
By John Shanahan<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Issue Bulletin No. 213<br>
September 13, 1995<br>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
</center><p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
The House-passed version of the Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies appropriations bill includes 17 restrictions on the Environmental Protection Agency's use of appropriations to implement select environmental laws. These limitations, more commonly known as appropriations "riders," have proven to be controversial. But in many cases they are needed to encourage the EPA and the Clinton Administration to act more responsibly in setting and enforcing regulations. They also are needed to encourage the Agency and the White House to work with Congress to reform some of the most seriously flawed environmental statutes. 
<p>
The bill reported out of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies, includes only one rider, which prohibits the EPA from requiring states, under Section 304 of the Clean Air Act, to enforce trip reduction efforts such as car pooling. As the Senate acts on the VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies bill, however, there are important reasons why it should adopt most of the EPA riders in the House version. While they would limit the promulgation and enforcement of regulations under laws dealing specifically with air, water, waste, pesticides, and similar problems, most deal with the general application of law1 and represent an attempt to correct examples of excess or abuse by the EPA. <p>Both the EPA and the White House brought about this action by refusing to cooperate in substantive reform of existing law. Faced with a Congress intent on reducing unnecessary and expensive laws without sacrificing environmental quality, the Administration has persisted in spurning efforts to craft bipartisan reform. Indeed, the EPA has been assiduous in implementing new regulations that are inflexible, expensive, and pay little attention to the underlying science or economics. Congress has but few tools to reshape policy in this situation. The most promising short-term solution is to use the appropriations process to restrict the use of government funds to pursue certain goals. Environmental riders not only would cool the EPA's regulatory zeal, but also would encourage the Administration to show more cooperation in negotiating substantive reform.
<p>

AN IMPERFECT BUT NECESSARY SOLUTION
<p>
Appropriations riders are not a substitute for substantive reform. They can be useful as stop-gap measures, but changes are needed in the underlying statutes.
<p>
Nevertheless, using the appropriations process in most cases is still better than taking no action. The Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) is a good example of why environmental riders can be an imperfect solution. As part of the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act of 1986, TRI requires companies to report to the EPA any legal releases of chemicals officially listed as toxic, so that communities will know the types and quantities of these chemicals that end up as wastes. The requirement applies when waste is released into the air or water, and when it is disposed of properly at a landfill or incinerator -- even if that facility is federally run.
<p>
While no doubt well intentioned, TRI has not been a success. Industry experts estimate that it imposes nearly $1 billion in costs, and the list includes numerous chemicals that pose little risk. Particularly troublesome is the EPA's proposal to require that companies report their use of individual chemicals, regardless of whether these chemicals are released into the community or recycled during manufacturing. It is clearly inconsistent with the original intent of the law, which deals with releases into the environment, to require companies at enormous expense to catalog every instance of a chemical's use in its manufacturing. Indeed, the General Accounting Office concluded recently that the EPA's regulatory plan is too ambitious and too great a burden on the chemical industry.2
<p>
In order to make these and other critical environmental issues a priority for this Administration, Congress has been forced to use appropriations riders to force officials to address programs that do not work. In this context, using the appropriations process to restrict enforcement to the reporting of chemicals listed in the authorizing legislation is entirely reasonable. 
<p>
Unfortunately, the TRI rider is less attractive politically than other riders. President Clinton has chosen to politicize and obscure this issue and ignore the underlying problems. Rather than acknowledge the merit in Congress's effort to draw attention to a serious example of over regulation, the Administration falsely claims that the bill would allow firms to pollute communities with toxic chemicals. Unfortunately, proponents of the rider are hampered by the difficulty of communicating this complicated issue to the public. This difficulty underscores the limits of such riders, which must be categorical in their limitations and thus may be nearly as inflexible in the short term as the regulatory excesses they correct. This is why general reform legislation would be far better. Nevertheless, most of these riders are necessary short-term solutions to intractable regulatory problems.
<p>

WHAT THE SENATE MUST DO
<p>
As the Senate considers the EPA appropriations, it should keep most of the House appropriations riders to force the EPA and the White House to focus on much-needed environmental reforms. Congress also should make a concerted effort to identify these as important and communicate this effectively to the public. While many of the riders in the VA/HUD/Independent Agencies appropriations bill address important areas, several are particularly important, and including them in the Senate bill should be a top priority. Three of the most important riders not included in the Senate bill deal with: 
<p><ul>
<li> Wetland enforcement;
<li> Enforcement against states litigating Title V of the Clean Air Act (CAA); and
<li> Penalties against companies for acting responsibly.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Wetland enforcement.</b>
The wetland rider would restrict the EPA from enforcing its Section 404 permitting program. The EPA relies on Section 404 of the Clean Water Act to regulate landowners who wish to disturb a wetland on their property. There are three principal problems with EPA's wetland policies.3 
<p>
First, the statutory authority is questionable; indeed, for isolated wetlands, known as "non-adjacent" wetlands, authority seems clearly to be lacking. Obviously, EPA should not pursue policies that neither the Constitution nor a statute allows it to pursue. 
<p>
Second, the EPA definition of what constitutes a wetland is so unnecessarily broad that land which is bone dry for almost the entire year can be deemed a wetland. 
<p>
Third, the financial resources of many Americans are being destroyed in the name of protecting wetlands because they are forced to surrender, without compensation, their right to use their land. Because many of these affected individuals make their living or pay their mortgages from income derived from the land, their savings can be wiped out. 
<p>
The principal reason for this rider is to give Congress time to enact legislation. This legislation would make wetlands protection legal, priority-based, and fair to those now forced to shoulder the financial burdens alone.

<p>
<b>Enforcement against states litigating Title V of the Clean Air Act.</b>
This rider would restrict EPA from promulgating, implementing, or enforcing the federal permitting program under Sections 502(d)(2), 502(d)(3), and 502(i)(4) of the CAA against a state involved in Title V litigation with the Agency. This provision provides a strong tool against EPA regulatory zeal in the face of state government resistance. Currently, EPA has the authority and incentive to write further regulations under Section 502 and impose sanctions against states that, instead of completing their State Implementation Plans, are litigating Title V. Clearly, states that believe the EPA has overstepped its bounds and is pursuing inflexible and unnecessary regulations detrimental to their residents should have access to the courts without the harassment of sanctions.
<p>

<b>Penalizing companies for acting responsibly.</b>
This rider would prohibit EPA from taking legal action against states or companies for environmental violations discovered during voluntary self-audits and disclosed in compliance with state law. Companies that inadvertently violate environmental regulations now are discouraged from conducting voluntary self-audits to correct violations quickly because they must report their findings to the EPA, which may fine them millions of dollars for past non-compliance. This policy discourages responsible behavior. But if barriers to voluntary compliance are eliminated, companies will clean up pollution faster, more thoroughly, and more cheaply. Because numerous companies have indicated they would perform self-audits and correct violations if the threat of prosecution were minimized, restricting EPA from punishing this past behavior would be a win-win situation for the economy and the environment.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
While permanent environmental policy reform should be pursued, many of the problems addressed by the House appropriations riders are so egregious that immediate relief should be granted. While these riders are an imperfect solution, the Senate must view them as appropriate and necessary to encourage a recalcitrant EPA and White House to reform some of the most burdensome environmental statutes.
<p>
In addition to the one rider in the bill reported out of the Senate subcommittee on VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies, the Senate would do well to include, at a minimum, the three riders in the House version relating to wetlands, Title V of the Clean Air Act, and voluntary environmental self-audits. Failing that, Congress should fix these problems when the House and Senate bills reach the Conference Committee.

Executive Memorandum #422<br>
July 26, 1995<P>

<P>
<blockquote>	My name is John Q. Specialinterest. I am testifying today on behalf of Americans for a Happy Tomorrow (AHT), which represents senior citizens, environmentalists, school lunch servers, and the dispossessed. In the last fiscal year, AHT received $73 million from the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). I am here to protest the cruel and heartless proposed budget cuts in the DOL, HHS, and EPA.</blockquote>

<p>
	As Congress begins budget reconciliation hearings, it would be enlightening if every witness's testimony included a "truth in testimony" statement. This small but significant change in the way Congress does business could shed a powerful light on the true motivations and self-interest of organizations that claim to represent the "public interest."
<p>
	Each day, another organization expresses its outrage on Capitol Hill over proposed reductions in government spending. But what remains largely unknown to the taxpayer is that many of these groups themselves benefit from federal largesse. Over the past forty years, Congress has created a vast patronage network of organizations which enjoy tax-preferred status, receive federal funds, and engage in legislative or political activity. The days of big-city political machines disbursing patronage may be coming to an end, but the disbursement of financial dividends to political friends is a prominent feature of the federal budget. While claiming they are only "doing good," they are in fact "doing well" at the taxpayer's expense. The taxpayers have a right to know.
<p>
	On February 2, 1995, the Child Welfare League of America testified before a House Ways and Means subcommittee about welfare reform. This organization benefited from approximately $250,000 in FY 1994 and ran an advertisement opposing the Contract with America's welfare reform bill which claimed:  "More children will be killed. More children will be raped."
<p>
	One month later, a subcommittee of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee held a hearing on "forest health and restoration."  One of the panels was 50 percent federally subsidized and included representatives of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners ($257,000 in federal funding in FY 1994) and the National Audubon Society ($135,000, excluding state-based affiliates). 
<p>
	 Clearly, the right to petition government to redress grievances is precious and should not be infringed. Individuals and organizations using funds from the private sector should be encouraged to engage in the legislative and political process without fear of regulation. It is an entirely different matter to employ the coercive power of the federal government to force taxpayers to finance organizations which lobby Congress or government agencies. 
<p>
	Truth in Testimony is Needed. Congress needs to know which advocacy organizations are federally funded, particularly when they are lobbying Congress. Witnesses who testify before a congressional committee should be required to state in their written and oral testimony how much federal funding they receive and how they use it. In addition, the committee should request that each organization provide an IRS Form 990 for the committee to keep on file. The 990 is a public document each organization must file that lists its sources of revenue, along with pertinent information on the group's affiliations with other organizations.
<p>
	The people's representatives have a right to know if the testimony they are hearing is coming from someone who is feeding at the public trough.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Members of Congress submit annual financial disclosure statements.

<li>Senior officers in the executive branch file regular reports on outside income.

<li>Lobbyists must register with the government and identify themselves as such.

<li>Witnesses from federally funded groups are not required to disclose this fact to Congress.
</ul>
<p>
	Many laws have been passed to combat possible financial conflicts of interest by the political class. But until now the focus has been in one direction:  money going into the coffers of politicians. What about private lobbying groups that receive taxpayer dollars from the politicians?  Admittedly, this represents a very touchy subject for many special interests. Hundreds of activist organizations receive millions upon millions of taxpayer dollars each year -- and then turn around and use that money to lobby Congress to send even more of this money their way.
<p>
	For example, the AFL-CIO receives more than $10 million each year and then promotes a television ad campaign to oppose everything the new Congress is undertaking. The clear goal is to stir up grassroots opposition from union members and others to attack the reforms the new leaders of Capitol Hill are attempting to make.

<p>	The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), the largest lobbying organization in America, receives $86 million in taxpayer funds each year. At the same time, the AARP lobbied Congress to pass a big-government health care bill that the American people -- and many AARP members themselves -- firmly opposed.
<p>
	Most federal programs, like student loans and funds for new prisons, are specified in the federal budget. Each receives its own "line item" that tells how much money it will be able to spend in the coming year. The trouble is that a line item labeled "AFL-CIO" or "AARP" does not exist. If it did, it would be a lightning rod for criticism and would top most people's list of spending cuts. It is time to acknowledge that the American people are fed up with special interest lobbying and certainly would not stand for the government's helping these groups to advance their particular agendas.
<p>
	There is no justification for special interest lobbying groups' receiving money from the American taxpayers, only to turn around and spend it to lobby Congress for even more. Congress should recognize the danger of this corrupt practice and expose federally funded hypocrisy. Each committee should demand full disclosure of its witnesses so the American public can see whether their tax dollars are subsidizing calls for more of their money.

<TITLE>Pay Freeze and Staff Cuts Needed To Perfect Reformist Legislative Appropriation Bill -- Heritage </TITLE>

<h3>PAY FREEZE AND STAFF CUTS NEEDED TO PERFECT REFORMIST LEGISLATIVE
APPROPRIATION BILL</h3>

By Dan Greenberg<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum #418<br>
June 19, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>
<P>
 This week, the House of Representatives will consider the Legislative
Branch Appropriations Bill for FY 1996. The bill will provide
systemic congressional reforms as important as any yet enacted,
including spending cuts, privatization, and abolition of unnecessary
offices and functions. The only significant reforms the bill fails
to address are a pay freeze for Members of Congress and a reduction
in Members' staff and office expenses. Amendments on these topics
may be offered on the House floor.
<P>
<B> Spending Cuts.</B> The House bill proposes to reduce legislative
branch spending by nearly $155 million next year, or about 8 percent.
When the Senate, which is responsible for its own budget, adds
its anticipated cuts, savings should exceed $200 million. If proportional
cuts were made in all government spending, the deficit would be
reduced by approximately $143 billion. These cuts are achieved
through major restructuring and economies in congressional operations.
If the Clinton Administration's &quot;Reinventing Government&quot;
efforts had resulted in similarly proportioned reductions, 80
percent of the $176 billion FY1995 federal deficit would be eliminated.
<P>
 Among the major spending reductions in the bill are:
<UL>
<LI>A 25 percent cut in the General Accounting Office's appropriation
over two years. 
<LI>Elimination of 2,350 jobs from congressional payrolls, an
8.6 percent reduction. 
<LI>Removal of funding for constituent copies of the <I>Congressional
Record</I>.
<LI>Cancellation of subscriptions to the entire United States
Code for every lawmaker. 
</UL>

<P>

<P>
  The bill will require congressional agencies to absorb pay increases
at their current level of funding, and all agencies (except the
Library of Congress) will be held to the previous year's level
of funding or below.
<P>
<B> Privatization.</B> Working with the House Oversight Committee,
the Appropriations Committee determined that a number of operations
currently performed by congressional agencies could be accomplished
more efficiently by the private sector. The bill privatizes several
functions immediately and requires studies in other areas.
<P>
 The General Accounting Office is pushed to privatize its administrative
functions, such as printing, mail handling, and library services.
It also will be provided with funds to contract out some of its
auditing work so that it can benefit from the lower costs available
in the private sector. 
<P>
 The bill will abolish the &quot;revolving funds&quot; that support
House barber shops, beauty shops, and recording studios, leaving
those services to be performed on a break-even basis. Direct funding
for an office devoted solely to flying flags over the Capitol
(which are then sent to constituents) is also eliminated. Responsibility
for this operation, estimated to cost over $325,000 per year,
will be turned over to the U.S. Capitol Historical Society.
<P>
 Preparing for additional privatization efforts, the bill instructs
the Office of the Architect to issue requests for proposals for
private-sector bids for U.S. Capitol custodial services. The Architect
is also ordered to study privatization of the Capitol's $11 million
power plant.
<P>
<B> Elimination.</B> The bill eliminates the $21 million Office
of Technology Assessment, an agency many criticize as redundant.
The House Special Services Office, which serves as a kind of concierge
for Members, House Administrators, and favored guests, is also
eliminated by the appropriations measure. Funding for the Joint
Committee on Printing is cut sharply with eventual abolition in
view. Similarly, the bill funds the Joint Economic Committee in
FY1996 (cutting its funding, however, by $1.2 million), but the
committee report suggests there will be no funding in 1997.
<P>
 In a minor disappointment the bill fails to eliminate the century-old
Government Printing Office, but does impose several economies
on printing operations. Representative Scott Klug (R-WI) has estimated
that it is three times as expensive for GPO to print any document
than it is for a private sector firm. The highly competitive private
printing industry is a strong argument against retaining the GPO
and its yearly budget of $121 million.
<P>
 In moves to streamline operations and reduce Congress's administrative
duties, the appropriations bill would remove non-legislative activities
from direct congressional supervision. With the cooperation of
the House Oversight Committee, it will place the House post office
under Postal Service supervision and, as of next year, transfer
control of the Botanical Garden to the National Arboretum.
<P>
 Especially in view of simultaneous reforms by the House Oversight
Committee, the bill is a tremendous improvement over the legislative
appropriations of previous Congresses. However, some areas for
potential improvement remain:
<P>
<B> Members' Salaries.</B> Because Members' salaries (currently
$133,600 per year) are funded by a permanent, indefinite appropriation
rather than through the annual appropriations bill, they are nearly
invulnerable to legislative change when the rest of Congress's
budget is under discussion. Congress should work to make Members'
salaries a legislative appropriations line item and eliminate
the automatic salary COLA that, unless Congress acts, gives each
Member an automatic pay hike. Such an automatic pay raise violates
the spirit of the 27th Amendment to the Constitution, which states
that Members must stand for reelection before any pay raise they
vote on takes effect. <B>At the very least, this year's legislative
appropriations bill should eliminate the pay hike that otherwise
would automatically go into effect.</B>
<P>
<B> Members' Accounts.</B> This year's appropriation combines
the three Members' personal allowance accounts (staff salaries,
office expenses, and official mail) into one appropriation, a
positive step to increase flexibility and ease administrative
burdens. However, the combined account is increased by over 2
percent to over $360 million due to increases in staff salaries
and mail funding. Although increases in postal rates and population
may justify some adjustment of mail allowances, it is difficult
to make similar arguments for an increase in the aggregate staff
salary appropriation. During the debate at the beginning of this
year over the elimination of Legislative Service Organizations,
advocates of LSO abolition intimated that a substantial portion
of their $5 million yearly expense would be saved. In fact, even
steeper staff cuts are justified. <B>A 10 percent ($25 million)
cut in the staff salary portion of the new combined account would
deliver the savings promised from LSO elimination and extend the
staff reductions achieved in almost every other congressional
operation to Member's personal offices for the first time.</B>
<P>
 In an era of downsizing and restructuring, the House's willingness
to examine Congress itself for savings is a welcome response to
citizens' demands for economy in government. Although amendments
to freeze Members' pay and cut personal staff funding are still
needed, the Legislative Branch Appropriation for Fiscal Year 1996
represents a radical and welcome departure from politics as usual.

<P>


     Term limit advocates have had difficulty translating their
overwhelming successes in state referenda into support in Congress. 
Freshman Rep.  Peter Hoekstra (R-MI) has an idea that may force
Congress to pay attention:  the Voter Opportunity to Inform Congress
Effectively (VOICE) on Term Limits Act, H.R.  3835.  This legislation
would create a national advisory referendum this fall on limiting the
terms of Members of Congress.  The question to voters would read: 
"Should Congress approve a constitutional amendment to limit the
number of terms that a Member of the United States House of
Representatives and United States Senator can serve in office?"  The
referendum would be placed on the November 8 general election ballot
in every congressional district and would be nonbinding, meaning that
ballot results on the question would be tabulated, certified, and sent
to Congress, but would not have a direct legal or constitutional
effect.  Though never before exercised, Congress has the authority to
order such a ballot question pursuant to its power to regulate
elections.
<P>
     The VOICE legislation requires that Congress's Judiciary
Committees consider the results of the term limit vote and report on
it to the House and Senate.  Though Congress would not be bound by the
national referendum, Members will ignore what is likely to be an
overwhelming pro-term limits vote at their own political peril.  Thus,
a national advisory vote may do more to induce congressional action on
term limits than have binding initiatives in individual states.
<P>
     VOICE supporters also favor a national approach because most
states do not allow citizen initiatives.  Voters in fifteen states
have approved term limits for their own congressional delegations, but
only eight additional states allow citizen initiatives.  A primary
argument against the state efforts has been that referendum states may
suffer under term limits relative to the remaining 27 states whose
Congressmen would be allowed to continue to amass experience and
seniority.  The nationwide vote under the VOICE initiative would avoid
that issue, give the public its first opportunity to vote on term
limits for federal officeholders, and present perhaps the only
opportunity for voters in non-initiative states to be heard on the
issue.  Activists in the 27 states that do not have the initiative
process are finding it difficult to push state legislators (many with
future congressional ambitions) into voting for term limits on
Congressmen.
<P>
     A legally binding national referendum would require a
constitutional amendment.  The VOICE Act, however, avoids that need
and skirts some problems that could be encountered in a binding
ballot.  The VOICE question does not include a specific number of
years or terms, for instance, postponing at least temporarily a
divisive fight between congressional backers and grass-roots activists
over the appropriate length for term limits.
<P>
     Although never implemented, a national referendum is not a new
idea.  In 1924, the Democratic party asked for a referendum on the
consideration of United States membership in the League of Nations. 
In 1964, Rep.  Charles Gubser sponsored a resolution to create a
yearly nationwide advisory opinion poll.  In 1980, current House
Majority Leader Richard Gephardt introduced a bill to poll citizens on
three designated issues every two years during the federal election
cycle.
<P>
     Court Considerations.  Without a national referendum effort, a
Supreme Court decision adverse to the constitutionality of state-
imposed service limits on federal legislators could fatally wound the
term limits movement.  On February 10, Federal District Court Judge
William Dwyer declared Washington state's term limits law, challenged
by Speaker of the House Tom Foley, among others, unconstitutional as
it applied to federal officeholders.  On March 7, the Arkansas Supreme
Court issued a similar ruling on that state's law.  Both decisions are
being appealed and term limits backers are hopeful that higher courts
will reverse the rulings.  The cases emphasize, however, the
vulnerability of the state-by-state approach to term limits and the
need for a national effort.
<P>
     Opponents' Arguments.  Opponents of a national referendum on term
limits argue that the question should be left up to the states and the
court system.  But with fifteen states having already acted, and court
cases moving forward, there is no reason to wait for further judicial
setbacks before launching a national term limits effort.  Others
oppose referenda generally or assert that petitions and referenda work
fine in a town hall atmosphere, but are inappropriate on a nationwide
basis.  An advisory question, however, such as that proposed on term
limits, would represent a useful trial effort for a national
referendum process.  Foes also claim that the VOICE Act would be
confusing to the public, but suggest in a contradictory manner that
the question should be more specific about, for instance, the number
of terms.  However, a national referendum on term limits surely would
be the topic of widespread discussion, and any initial voter questions
would be clarified through campaign efforts or by the media. 
Fundamentally, opposition to the VOICE Act is led by anti-term limits
insiders who fear the outcome of a national referendum.  What they
really mean is that voters in the 27 states without the initiative
process should not have a voice on term limits.
<P>
     Freshman Support.  In an unusual display of election-year
bipartisanship, Republican freshman reform leaders Tillie Fowler (R-
FL) and Peter Torkildsen (R-MA) were joined by Democratic Freshman
Reform Task Force chairs Karen Shepherd (D-UT) and Eric Fingerhut (D-
OH) in supporting Hoekstra's bill, declaring, "It is time for Congress
to address an issue that is clearly important to the overwhelming
majority of the American people....   The American people deserve a
voice on the matter of Congressional term limits."  They further
called for prompt hearings on the reform proposal by the House
Administration Committee.  To date, 42 cosponsors have signed on to
the VOICE Act, and if blocked in committee, Hoekstra has high hopes
for House consideration of the legislation through a discharge
petition.  In addition, numerous grass-roots groups have agreed to
support H.R.  3835. 
<P>
     Term limit advocates believe that government truly derives its
power from the consent of the governed, and that all Americans should
have a voice in the issue.  With most polls showing 75 percent to 80
percent support for term limits, it is time for Congress to act on a
term limits constitutional amendment.  Petitions and referenda are
democratically appropriate and historically tested means for citizens
to bring the ruling classes into line.  Political royalty in
Washington should listen to their voters and learn from the past.  By
giving every voter a voice, H.R.  3835 could break the term limits
logjam and force Congress to bend to the will of the American people.

<title>Truth in Testimony: Penetrating the Special-Interest Facade -- Heritage</title>

<h3> TRUTH IN TESTIMONY: PENETRATING THE SPECIAL-INTEREST FACADE</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/weinstein.html">Kenneth R. Weinstein</a><br> 
Director, Government Reform Project<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 456<br>
June 28, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Conservatives in Congress have not fared as well as many expected, partly because they have failed to make institutional reforms that would make it easier to promote conservative policies. A "Truth in Testimony" rule requiring witnesses appearing before congressional committees to disclose the amount of federal money their organizations receive would shed a bright light on the often self-serving character of testimony before Congress. Liberal advocacy groups would lose their claim to moral superiority when required to admit that they often benefit directly from the government programs they promote. Either house of Congress could adopt such a rule independently of the other, with no need for joint congressional or presidential approval.
<p>

<b>Stand for Children: A Case Study</b> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Those who doubt that Truth in Testimony would be an effective tool in responding to criticism of efforts to secure a balanced budget should consider the recent Stand for Children march in Washington, D.C. The Children's Defense Fund, a leading opponent of efforts to reform welfare, began a major public relations blitz months in advance of its June 1, 1996, Stand for Children rally on the Mall. Early stories invariably were favorable, largely verbatim recitations of organizers' claims that the event was "a non-partisan call to action" aimed at celebrating the nation's youth. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Beginning a few weeks before the march, The Heritage Foundation and other groups <a href="/heritage/library/categories/govern/gip9.html">revealed</a> that 25 percent of the national endorsing organizations were direct federal grant recipients, receiving a total of nearly $400 million per year. Other sponsoring organizations included the lobbying arms of federal programs costing nearly $7 billion per year and 20 groups representing social service administrators.<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Once the fact emerged that organizers had a vested interest in maintaining their own direct federal subsidies, even the mainstream press felt obliged to look beyond their claim to be defending children. Major print and broadcast media prominently reported information on sponsors' government funding in their coverage of the march. What could have been a public relations nightmare for conservatives in Congress turned into a wash. Indeed, Marian Wright Edelman, the Stand for Children's chief organizer, found herself spending much of her time deflecting questions about government subsidies. 
<p>
<b>The Congressional Analogy</b> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Thus, in some ways, Stand for Children became an important conservative victory. Conservatives were able to change the terms of debate by revealing that at one-fourth of the national sponsors of the rally receive federal funds. According to a reliable estimate, a far higher proportion of witnesses before congressional committees are federally funded advocates.<sup>2</sup>  Just as the Stand for Children's claim of altruism was unmasked, so can the claims of other federally funded advocacy groups which purport to speak on behalf of the disadvantaged while feathering their own nests. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Requiring organizations or individuals who testify before Congress to reveal the amount they receive in federal grants would radically change the dynamics and coverage of many congressional hearings. Almost daily, it seems, witnesses from various organizations express their outrage over proposed reductions in federal spending. Whereas the media often repeat hostile allegations made in testimony, what remains largely unknown to taxpayers is the extent to which advocacy groups enrich themselves at taxpayers' expense. That story goes unreported because Congress itself participates in the cover-up by refusing to disclose the links between witnesses and the programs about which they testify.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under Truth in Testimony, representatives of, say, the American Association of Retired Persons appearing before House or Senate committees would be required to disclose that their organization receives $86 million each year in federal grants. Labor leaders testifying on behalf of federal job training programs would have to disclose that their unions receive millions of dollars each year to administer these very programs. Inevitably, such information would become part of the media coverage of the hearing. 
<p>
<b>Truth in Testimony: A House Rule</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Either the House of Representatives or the Senate could act on its own to initiate Truth in Testimony. This reform does not require either the agreement of both houses of Congress or the signature of the President.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Language for a Truth in Testimony rule might read as follows:<blockquote>
	Witness statements shall include the amount and source (by agency and program) of any federal grants (including subgrants from other organizations or from a state pursuant to federal block grant) or any contract received during the current fiscal year and previous two fiscal years by a witness or an organization a witness represents. No testimony shall be included in a hearing record without such disclosure.</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Because this would be an internal House or Senate rule rather than a federal statute, there would be neither civil nor criminal penalties attached to Truth in Testimony. Therefore, witnesses coming before Congress could not claim to be intimidated by the rule. The measure would provide a clear sanction: If witnesses failed to provide such information, they would be penalized by their testimony's being excluded from the official hearing record.
<p>
<b>Conclusion</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Truth in Testimony is a needed reform, one that would open up the congressional process by informing taxpayers when federally funded groups lobby Congress for more funds under the guise of impartial testimony. Coverage of the Stand for Children indicates that the media are quite willing to disseminate information about the size and scope of federal grants to organizations seeking to lobby Congress. Truth in Testimony, likewise, would help to turn criticism of efforts to balance the federal budget into scrutiny of those who profit from tax dollars.

INTRODUCTION
<P>
     The United States has made significant progress in the past two years
toward expanding free trade.  Both the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) and legislation implementing the Uruguay Round of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) have been approved
by Congress and signed into law by the President.  Yet, forces are at work
in Congress to block further progress on free trade.  Special-interest groups
are mobilizing to subvert or block the legislation needed for the
Administration to open foreign markets to U.S.  goods and services. 
<P>
      This assault on free trade should be stopped.  This can best be done
if Congress grants the President "fast-track" authority to begin negotiating
agreements with those countries that are next in line for free trade --
namely, countries in Asia and Latin America.  Only then can the U.S. 
benefit from the expansion of overseas trade relations that will enlarge
economic opportunities and create new high-wage jobs for all Americans.
<P>
          Despite the progress that has been made, a succession of
events in Latin America has clouded the prospects for rapid trade
liberalization.  The collapse of the Mexican peso on December 20, 1994, not
only devastated the Mexican economy, but also eroded investor confidence
throughout Latin America.  The economic crisis in Venezuela deepened as
more banks collapsed and the inflation rate neared triple digits.  A long-
simmering border dispute between Ecuador and Peru flared up into fighting
between the armies of both countries.  Moreover, the alleged ties between
the new government of Colombian President Ernesto Samper and cocaine
traffickers have caused a serious chill in U.S.-Colombian relations.
<P>
          The news from Asia has not been much better.  The slow
response of the Japanese government to the earthquake that devastated Kobe
on January 17, 1995, highlighted the shortcomings of Prime Minister
Tomiichi Murayama's administration.  These shortcomings revealed a
weakness that may hamper Murayama's ability to overcome bureaucratic
resistance to develop a framework for trade liberalization in the forum for
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), which this year will hold its
Leaders' Meeting in Osaka.  Investor uncertainty about Mexico spilled over
from Latin America and caused stock markets throughout Asia to fall. 
Although the Clinton Administration settled a nasty trade dispute with China
over intellectual property rights on February 26, 1995, China's application
to join the World Trade Organization still must be negotiated.
<P>
          This bad news from Asia and Latin America has caused some
congressional leaders to cast doubt on the viability of new free trade
initiatives this year.  At a February 8 Heritage Foundation conference,
Representative David Dreier (R-CA), a leading proponent of both NAFTA
and GATT, stated, "I would like very much to charge ahead with fast track. 
But at the same time, I think that it's not going to happen because of some
questions that exist."  To his credit, however, President Clinton has
confirmed that formal negotiations to make Chile the fourth member of
NAFTA will continue.  On February 28, 1995, trade negotiators from
Canada, Mexico, and the United States met for the first time in Mexico City
to decide the structure of the upcoming talks with Chile.  The decision to
move forward with Chile to NAFTA is a good one.  The irresponsible,
politicized monetary policy pursued by the Banco de Mexico, not NAFTA,
caused the Mexican crisis.  Chile should not be penalized for Mexico's
mistakes.
<P>
          Not all the trade news coming out of Asia and Latin America
is bad.  In fact, countries from these regions continue to form free trade
agreements on their own.  For example, Australia and New Zealand have
their own free trade pact, known as the Closer Economic Relations Trade
Agreement (CER).  Moreover, the ASEAN nations agreed on September 23-
24, 1994, to accelerate the implementation of their ASEAN Free Trade Area
(AFTA).  On January 1, 1995, the Southern Cone Common Market
(Mercosur) -- whose members include Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and
Uruguay -- became a customs union.  Chile is negotiating an associate status
with Mercosur even as it prepares to join NAFTA.
<P>
          Rapid progress toward creating an APEC free trade and
investment area and expanding NAFTA, first to Chile and then to other
countries in both Latin America and Asia, is vital to America's economic
future.  The setbacks suffered by free trade, in fact, require that the U.S. 
redouble its efforts, providing strong leadership and a public reaffirmation
of the U.S.  commitment to free trade with Asia and Latin America through
APEC and the expansion of NAFTA.  The U.S.  cannot allow past progress
to be squandered.  To expand free trade, President Clinton should:
Urge the Japanese government to devise an acceptable framework for APEC
trade liberalization.  This would set firm deadlines for negotiating and
implementing steps leading to an APEC free trade and investment area by
2020.
<P>
Ask Congress for fast-track negotiating authority unencumbered by harmful
labor and environmental restrictions.
<P>
Start formal negotiations to extend NAFTA membership to Chile within 30
days of introducing the new fast-track request to Congress, wrapping up a
deal before December 31, 1995.
<P>
Identify additional candidates for NAFTA membership in Asia and Latin
America.  Candidates could include Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore
in Asia and Argentina and Trinidad and Tobago in Latin America.  Formal
negotiations with these countries should begin as quickly as possible.
<P>
WHAT IS "FAST TRACK"?
<P>
     For free trade to progress this year, Congress must grant the
President fast-track negotiating authority.  Fast track allows the President to
negotiate trade agreements with foreign countries which then will be subject
to approval, without amendments, in an up or down vote.  This approach
gives the President more bargaining leverage since his negotiating partners
will know that the agreement will not be drastically altered by Congress
through the amendment process.
<P>
          Beginning with the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of
1934, Congress periodically has authorized the President to negotiate and
implement reciprocal tariff reductions with other countries.  Presidents have
used this authority to negotiate GATT agreements to reduce tariffs
substantially around the world.  As tariffs have fallen, however, national
governments have resorted to nontariff barriers to protect domestic industries
from import competition.  Some nontariff barriers are fairly obvious border
measures, such as import quotas and so-called voluntary export restraints. 
Others are more subtle, arising from discriminatory domestic laws and
regulations.  To eliminate such discrimination, trade agreements must go
beyond border measures and address many aspects of domestic policy.
<P>
          In the Trade Act of 1974, Congress expressed its concern
about the "growing importance and proliferation of [nontariff] barriers to the
detriment of U.S.  export trade and the need to develop new or more
adequate international trade rules and mechanisms for their discipline."  The
Act charged the President to seek to reduce or eliminate these nontariff trade
barriers in future trade agreements.  Recognizing that such agreements
would compel the United States to change some of its own domestic laws
and regulations, Congress devised a new procedure, known as fast track, to
preserve the constitutional role of Congress and fulfill its legislative
responsibilities in shaping domestic policy while reducing the uncertainties
of the legislative process for approving and implementing trade agreements.
<P>
            Under the fast-track procedure, Congress sets the objectives
for trade negotiations in an authorizing law before actual negotiations
commence.  Through authorization, Congress determines what countries and
subjects may be included in trade negotiations.  Once these negotiations
begin, the Administration must keep Congress and the private-sector
Advisory Committee on Trade Policy and Negotiations informed on their
progress.  Periodic updates allow American negotiators to address potential
problems that a member of Congress or representative of an interested party
may raise before a trade agreement is reached, rather than after a deal has
been struck.
<P>
          Before signing a trade agreement, the President must give the
Congress at least 90 days notice.  During this time, the relevant
congressional committees may examine the proposed agreement, determine
what changes in U.S.  law may be required to implement the agreement, and
work with Administration officials to develop an acceptable implementing
bill.  After signing the agreement, the President must submit its final text
together with a draft implementing bill to Congress.  Once these are
submitted, the House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate
Committee on Finance have 45 legislative days in which to report a bill. 
Each house must vote either for or against the bill within 15 days of
receiving the committee report.  No amendments are allowed.
<P>
          Some critics contend that fast track allows the President to
ram a trade agreement through Congress with little examination and no
opportunity for amendment.  This criticism is unfounded.  First, Congress
sets the parameters for trade negotiations in an authorization act; a trade
agreement that falls outside of these parameters is not eligible for the fast-
track procedure.  Second, regular reporting on the progress of trade
negotiations allows members of Congress and the Advisory Committee on
Trade Policy and Negotiations ample opportunity to offer suggestions and
propose changes before an agreement is finalized.  Third, the 90-day notice
before the President signs a trade agreement gives members of Congress a
final opportunity to press for changes.
<P>
THE FORUM FOR ASIA PACIFIC ECONOMIC COOPERATION
<P>
     While fast-track authority is not absolutely necessary until a
framework agreement is reached, recent progress toward creating a free
trade and investment area in the Asia-Pacific region may slow unless
President Clinton receives fast-track authority from Congress before the end
of this year.  President Clinton took an important first step toward
expanding free trade by agreeing to the goal of "free and open trade in the
Asia Pacific [region] no later than the year 2020."  This commitment was
made at the Leaders' Meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) organization in Bogor, Indonesia, on November 15, 1994.  With this
agreement and other accomplishments, APEC launched its long-term quest
for free trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region.
<P>
          Many observers had doubted whether the APEC leaders could
agree on a timetable for achieving free trade in the region.  Prime Minister
Datuk Seri Mohammed Mahathir of Malaysia strongly opposed trade and
investment liberalization through APEC, preferring his own scheme for an
exclusionary Asia-only trade bloc.  The Chinese government had threatened
to block any agreement unless the U.S.  and other APEC countries allowed
the People's Republic of China to enter the World Trade Organization. 
Such other Asian countries as Japan and South Korea also were reluctant for
APEC to set a firm date for free trade.
<P>
          President Suharto of Indonesia, chairman of the Bogor APEC
meeting, deftly overcame these obstacles and helped forge a historic
agreement.  Under the Declaration of Common Resolve, the APEC leaders
pledged that industrial countries in APEC would achieve free trade by 2010
while developing countries would require another decade to complete their
liberalization programs.  To prevent any single country from blocking
liberalization, APEC leaders agreed to a "consensus minus x" formula
allowing members that "are not ready to participate" in an APEC trade
agreement to "join at a later date."  The APEC leaders charged their trade
ministers with developing a framework within which to negotiate and
implement a free trade agreement that could be approved at the next year's
Leaders' Meeting in Osaka, Japan.
<P>
          In Bogor, the APEC leaders also agreed to a voluntary
Concord on Investment Principles.  While its language was not entirely to
the liking of the U.S., Trade Representative Mickey Kantor was "pleased on
the substance" of the nonbinding Concord.  Also at Bogor, the APEC
leaders established an advisory council, the Asia Pacific Business Forum, to
increase private sector participation in APEC.  They also endorsed the
ongoing work of the Committee on Trade and Investment to facilitate trade
by standardizing custom procedures and harmonizing product standards.
<P>
          As host for the APEC Leaders' Meeting at Osaka in
November 1995, Japan will supervise the development of the trade
liberalization framework in APEC.  Given Japan's political uncertainties and
its reputation for closed markets, this responsibility will be a serious
challenge for Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama.  New Zealand's Foreign
Minister Don McKinnon noted, "I think this will be Japan's real chance to
display real economic leadership.  If they want a seat on the United Nations
Security Council, they will have to take another major step to fulfill that
broader leadership role."
<P>
          There are many disturbing signs that the Japanese government
is either unwilling or unable to exercise leadership.  The widely reported
failure of Prime Minister Murayama and his Socialist-Liberal Democrat
cabinet to act decisively after the recent earthquake in Kobe suggests, at a
minimum, a lack of political resolve.  The government's performance raises
similar questions about its resolve in developing an acceptable framework
for APEC trade liberalization.
<P>
          There is a wide disagreement among APEC members on how
to implement the Bogor declaration.  To devise and win approval for a trade
liberalization framework, the Japanese government must exercise economic
and political leadership.  Unfortunately, the Japanese government so far has
avoided making difficult decisions on the central issue of trade
liberalization, expending its energy instead on peripheral issues of trade
facilitation and development.
<P>
       To the dismay of the United States and other APEC members,
Japan's first action as chairman of APEC was to propose creating a new
APEC foreign aid conduit, to be known as Partners for Peace, to promote
economic development in less-developed APEC countries.  Other APEC
governments criticized the Japanese government for focusing on what at best
would be a duplication of existing foreign aid programs and urged Japanese
officials instead to tackle the tough issue of devising a framework for trade
liberalization.  Under fire, Japan subsequently withdrew its proposal and
suggested instead that APEC members accelerate the implementation of their
Uruguay Round liberalization commitments.  Nevertheless, this early effort
suggests that Prime Minister Murayama may be unable to surmount
bureaucratic resistance and protectionist elements in his own coalition to
forge an acceptable framework agreement without the firm resolve of other
APEC members.  Therefore, President Clinton should:
Urge the Japanese government to devise an acceptable framework for an
APEC free trade and investment area by 2020.
<P>
EXPANDING NAFTA IN LATIN AMERICA
<P>
     Held in Miami on December 9-11, 1994, the Summit of the
Americas made history.  For the first time, all of the nations of the
Americas except Cuba were represented by democratically elected heads of
government.  More important, the heads of government established the
policy framework for a new hemispheric partnership based on open markets,
free trade, democratic governance, and respect for human and property
rights.  Significantly, all 33 heads of government agreed to make NAFTA
the benchmark treaty for creation of a Free Trade Area of the Americas
(FTAA) by the year 2005.
<P>
          On the last day of the summit, President Clinton emphasized
America's commitment to the expansion of NAFTA by announcing that
formal talks with Chile would begin in 1995.  Even though widely
anticipated, this announcement generated a wave of enthusiasm throughout
Latin America.  Nine days later, however, the Mexican peso collapsed. 
Since then, the Mexican economic crisis and the Clinton Administration's
questionable bailout scheme have commanded all of Washington's attention. 
Some members of Congress have suggested that the Mexican crisis may
have derailed prospects for the approval of fast-track authority to expand
NAFTA to Chile.  Even one of NAFTA's strongest advocates,
Representative Jim Kolbe (R-AZ), admitted that new fast-track authority
would have to be put on hold "for the time being."
<P>
          Nevertheless, Republican leaders in Congress have pledged
to support the Administration's request for new fast-track authority as long
as it does not empower the Administration to impose labor and
environmental standards on Chile or other countries.  During a February 8
Heritage Foundation conference, Representative Phil Crane (R-IL), Chairman
of the Trade Subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee, said
he would move a "clean trade bill" to the House floor this year (1) granting
fast-track authority for Chile's accession to NAFTA, (2) extending the
Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), and (3) providing trade parity
to small Caribbean countries with NAFTA.
<P>
          On February 13, 1995, U.S.  Trade Representative Mickey
Kantor made clear that the Clinton Administration "intends to continue to
link labor and environment to trade, and the linkage is particularly relevant
in the upcoming negotiations to extend NAFTA to Chile."  Moreover,
Kantor indicated that the "principle of including labor and environment
should be carried forward in subsequent trade negotiations in Latin America
and Asia as well."  The Republican leadership, however, bitterly opposes
linking trade sanctions with labor and environmental issues.  In a February
9, 1995, speech to the Chemical Manufacturers Association, Representative
Bill Archer (R-TX) flatly stated, "there will be no inclusion of authority to
monkey around with labor standards and environmental standards around the
world." 
<P>
           Differences between Congress and the Administration over
the scope of the new fast-track negotiating authority could delay or derail
its approval.  That would be unfortunate.  Chile's quick accession to
NAFTA is needed for several reasons.
<P>
REASON #1:  It would reaffirm the U.S.  commitment to expansion of free
trade and democracy in the Americas and creation by 2005 of a hemispheric
free trade area.
<P>
REASON #2:  It would help to restore investor confidence in all of Latin
America, including Mexico.  In the wake of the Mexican peso's collapse
and the financial fallout this has caused throughout Latin America, the
region's democracies are waiting for the U.S.  to raffirm its commitment to
expanding NAFTA to all of the Western Hemisphere.
<P>
REASON #3:  Chile would anchor NAFTA in South America.  For the Free
Trade Area of the Americas to become a reality, NAFTA and Mercosur
must converge over time into a single free trade area, with NAFTA serving
as the benchmark agreement.  Argentina and Brazil are two of three "Big
Emerging Markets" in Latin America.   Mexico is the third.  All three are
critical elements in the Clinton Administration's export strategy and are
essential if the Summit of the Americas' central goal of creating an FTAA
within the next decade is to be achieved.
<P>
REASON #4:  Chile's economy is the freest and the best-managed in Latin
America.  Over the past decade, Chile's gross domestic product has grown
by an average of six percent per year.  Chile has even privatized its social
security system.  As a result, the assets of Chile's private pension funds are
equivalent to 50 percent of the country's annual Gross Domestic Product of
slightly more than $40 billion.  Chile has achieved a remarkable and painful
transition from socialism to military dictatorship and, finally, to stable
democracy. 
<P>
REASON #5:  U.S.  exporters and investors would benefit immediately. 
The tariff reductions Chile would make under a NAFTA agreement, plus the
transparent rules of the game established by NAFTA, would spur increased
U.S.  investment in Chile.
<P>
     Clearly, the national interests of both the U.S.  and Chile would be
served by having Chile join NAFTA as quickly as possible.  Chile not only
would provide a bridge for strengthening U.S.  relations with Argentina and
Brazil, but also would serve as a commercial gateway for U.S.  trade with
Asia by U.S.  companies established in Chile and the Mercosur countries. 
<P>
           President Clinton committed the U.S.  to a timetable for
Chile's admission to NAFTA at the Summit of the Americas.  American,
Canadian, and Mexican trade negotiators have laid the groundwork for
formal negotiations.  Chile already has its negotiating team in place and is
ready to get started.  Any delay would be interpreted as a failure of
American resolve and international leadership.  It would also be a blow to
democracy, free trade, and free-market reforms in the Americas.  To avert
this delay, the Clinton Administration should:
<P>
Ask Congress for fast-track negotiating authority unencumbered by harmful
labor and environmental restrictions.  Some members of Congress have
announced their support for new fast-track authority, provided that labor
standards and environmental issues are excluded.  President Clinton must
realize that insisting on negotiating authority on labor and environmental
issues will kill fast track.  The Clinton Administration therefore should drop
labor and environmental provisions from any trade bill submitted to
Congress.
<P>
Start formal negotiations to extend NAFTA membership to Chile within 30
days of introducing the new fast-track request to Congress, wrapping up a
deal before December 31, 1995.  With NAFTA already in place,
negotiations can reach agreement quickly with Chile on the terms of
accession.  Both Canada and Mexico enthusiastically support Chile's
membership in NAFTA.
<P>
Identify additional candidates for NAFTA membership in the Asia and Latin
America.  Candidates could include Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore
in Asia and Argentina and Trinidad and Tobago in Latin America.  Formal
negotiations with these countries should begin as quickly as possible. 
NAFTA must not be seen in Asia or elsewhere in the world as an
exclusionary trade pact.  It should be open to any country willing and able
to abide by its standards.  Therefore, the Clinton Administration should
move quickly to identify other qualified countries and invite them to join
NAFTA.  Expanding NAFTA to the Asia-Pacific is not a substitute for an
APEC free trade and investment agreement, but an interim step that would
accelerate the trade liberalization process in APEC.  Recent history suggests
that trade liberalization at one level can hasten trade liberalization at other
levels.  The willingness of the United States to pursue a subregional
approach in NAFTA is widely credited with motivating the European Union
and other countries to press for the successful conclusion of the Uruguay
Round.  Likewise, expanding NAFTA to some countries in Asia may
prompt other countries to accelerate APEC trade liberalization so their
economies will not be left out of a free trade area.  
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
     The Clinton Administration has committed the United States to
expanding NAFTA by extending membership first to Chile and then to other
countries in Asia and the Americas as quickly as possible.  In the wake of
the Mexican crisis, Chile and the rest of Latin America need a strong
reaffirmation of the U.S.  commitment to democracy, open economies, and
free trade.  Some populist demagogues and greedy special interests want to
argue that the Mexican crisis should derail the expansion of NAFTA and the
creation of a Free Trade Area of the Americas by 2005 and an APEC free
trade and investment area by 2020.  Such arguments are without merit. 
Delaying these trade liberalization initiatives would be a mistake.  Free trade
based on fair rules of the game for all participants is the surest road to
economic prosperity, jobs, and democratic stability.

INTRODUCTION
<P>
     After a slow start, the new democratic governments in Eastern
Europe are taking decisive steps to dismantle command economies
inherited from their Stalinist predecessors and to build genuine free
market systems. Yet a number of external economic shocks, including
the temporary spurt in oil prices generated by the Persian Gulf war,
and the collapse of trade with a dying Soviet Union, now threaten
these fledgling economies. Needed desperately in coming months and
years are increased trade with and investment from the West. 
<p>
      Severe Problems. East Europeans are faced with severe economic
problems. Energy price increases due to the Gulf war alone cost
Hungary $2 billion and Czechoslovakia $1.5 billion in hard currency.
Although oil prices have returned to near pre-Gulf war levels, the
massive below-market-price imports of oil from the Soviet Union have
made East European countries far more energy dependent than the West.
Moreover, Soviet oil deliveries to Eastern Europe have plummeted since
1990, sending East Europeans scrambling to set up barter deals for oil
with individual Soviet republics. Soon they will have to pay for this
oil, too, in hard currency, eating up most of the hard currency
earnings that otherwise could be put to use by private investors to
help build their economies.
<P>
      East Europeans also are suffering from the rapid economic
deterioration of the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe's largest trading
partner, and a drastic drop in intra-East European trade. East
European exports to the Soviet Union fell 48 percent in the first half
of this year, while imports from the Soviet Union dropped 41 percent.
The drop in East European and Soviet trade cost Czechoslovakia alone
over $2.5 billion by April 1991. Unless new markets quickly are
discovered for East European goods, thousands of state and nascent
private industries will go bankrupt. 
<P>
      In an attempt to assist the new democracies of Eastern Europe
during this time of economic trial, the United States Congress now is
hammering out the final version of a foreign aid package for the
region. While well-intentioned, the legislation will do little to
encourage economic growth and ease the precarious foreign trade
situation in Eastern Europe. 
<P>
      Failed Policies. The bill relies mostly on those standard
foreign aid policies that in the past quarter-century have failed
dismally elsewhere in the world. These include ineffectual technical
assistance offered mostly by the U.S. Agency for International
Development (AID), and government loans and grants, which actually can
delay economic development by removing incentives for wide-ranging
economic reform. 
<P>
      The West Europeans are counting on a new multinational bank, the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), to be their
main instrument for promoting economic development in Eastern Europe
and the Soviet republics. There is little reason, however, to believe
that this development bank will be any more successful in fostering
economic growth than the other West European efforts or the World Bank
have been in Africa. 
<P>
      East Europeans need and deserve more than traditional foreign
aid. Ultimately, they need expanding trade with the West, which will
create markets for their goods and increased Western investment. This
will enable them to modernize and expand their industries and services
to make them more competitive. 
<P>
      Alternative to Aid. This view is shared by many East Europeans
themselves. Czech Finance Minister Vaclev Klaus, Polish President Lech
Walesa, and Russian President Boris Yelstin repeatedly make the case
for access to Western markets and increased Western private investment
as an alternative to aid, which they view as detrimental to national
pride and to economic development. 
<P>
      It is in America's political and economic security interests for
the East Europeans, eventually including the former Soviet republics,
to make the transition from command to market economies. As leader of
the world's free market economic order, America should take the lead
in opening markets for East European goods and in pushing for Western
companies to do business in Eastern Europe. The Bush Administration
should do this by adopting a five-plank program for promoting trade
and investment in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics: 
<P>
Plank #1: Offer to negotiate free trade agreements between the U.S.
          and the East European countries, including the former
          Soviet republics. This would increase trade with the region
          by encouraging increased American investment and offering
          Eastern countries secure access to the giant American
          market. 
<P>
Plank #2: Lower U.S. trade barriers for goods and services from
          Eastern Europe and the republics and exempt their exports
          from all tariffs for five years. Unilaterally reduced trade
          barriers to Eastern products will provide East Europeans
          with markets for their products and help American consumers
          by lowering the price of imports.
<P>
Plank #3: Withhold U.S. funding for the new European Bank for
          Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) until the European
          Community (EC) agrees to reduce significantly trade
          barriers to Eastern Europe. This will press the EC, which
          has a tremendous political and economic stake in the EBRD,
          to open its markets to Eastern goods. 
<P>
Plank #4: Allow for "tax sparing" with East European countries and
          former Soviet republics. The U.S. should follow the example
          of other industrialized countries like Germany and the
          Netherlands and spare its right to levy higher U.S. taxes
          on American multinationals when they are granted tax
          holidays by countries in Eastern Europe and the former
          Soviet Union. This would reduce taxes for many American
          firms in the region, thereby increasing American investment
          in the region.
<P>
Plank #5: Reduce taxes on Americans working in Eastern Europe and the
          republics. This would give a greater incentive for top
          American businessmen to spend more time in Eastern Europe,
          where their expertise is needed.
<P>
WHY AID DOES NOT SPUR ECONOMIC GROWTH
<P>
      Despite a plethora of well-intentioned plans now being
considered by Congress and the Bush Administration, foreign aid will
not lift Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union out of the poverty caused
by decades of communism. Most government assistance programs in fact
do more harm than good. Generous food aid to Poland in 1989, for
instance, impoverished thousands of Polish private farmers unable to
compete with free food from the West. Due to Western generosity,
Polish farmers had to stand by helplessly watching as their own grain
and meat rotted for lack of demand.
<P>
      Technical assistance programs, while better than most foreign
aid programs, nevertheless also have a poor track record. According to
World Bank officials, only three out of nineteen major technical
assistance projects undertaken in Africa in the past five years have
been even moderately successful in accomplishing their goals. (Laura
Wallace, "Reshaping Technical Assistance," Finance and Development,
December 1990.) Government technical assistance projects in Eastern
Europe appear to be doing little better. Poles and Hungarians
frequently complain that the thousands of Western bureaucrats sent to
advise them on matters ranging from environmental regulation to
democratic institutions are of little help because they often have
limited knowledge of local circumstances.
<P>
      Government-to-government loans and grants can be particularly
detrimental to economic development. Grants often are used to
subsidize inefficient state industries, reducing the incentive to
undertake needed, if temporarily painful, free market economic
reforms. Loans can saddle countries with enormous foreign debts, as
Latin Americans and others painfully have learned. And, of course if
countries default on loans guaranteed by the U.S. government, American
taxpayers foot the bill. In addition to their economic costs, direct
loans and grants have adverse political effects. Often, for example,
loans to foreign governments reinvigorate the power of local
government bureaucrats -- in the East many of them communists -- by
giving them control over where aid is directed within the country. 
<P>
      Equal to Marshall Plan. Ignoring the lesson of foreign aid's
dismal record, massive amounts of Western cash are flowing into
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Over $16 billion in bi-lateral
and multi-lateral Western aid is targeted for Eastern Europe this year
alone. This massive aid infusion is just about equal, when adjusted
for inflation, to U.S. Marshall Plan aid to Western Europe after World
War II. (Susan M. Collins and Dani Rodrik, Eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union in the World Economy (Washington, D.C.: Institute for
International Economics, May 1991), p. 85.) 
<P>
      The popular myth is that the Marshall Plan was an unqualified
success. The reality however is that the Marshall Plan had mixed
results at best. Instead it was the economic policies pursued by
European leaders such as West Germany's Ludwig Erhard and Italy's
Luigi Einaudi that had the greatest impact on economic development in
the region. Similarly, in Eastern Europe, the growth of market
institutions will depend primarily on enacting the right economic
policies, not foreign assistance.

<P>
TRADE AND INVESTMENT, RATHER THAN AID
<P>
      Rather than pouring billions of dollars in government-to-
government aid into Eastern Europe and the republics, the West better
could promote economic development by taking steps to increase trade
and investment. The new democracies are critically short of the hard
currency needed to buy the machinery and Western high technology to
modernize their economies. Increased investment will bring private
capital to the region, and along with it the advanced technology and
managerial expertise required for economic expansion. Reducing Western
trade barriers will open markets for East European goods, thereby
encouraging the growth of agriculture, private industry, and services.
This in turn will lead to economic expansion and integration into the
world economy. 
<P>
      Western trade barriers remain a major impediment to expanding
trade. A 1989 Agency for International Development study on foreign
aid and economic development finds that Western trade protection
reduces the national income of developing countries by an amount equal
to twice the total aid sent annually from the developed to the
developing world. (Development and the National Interest: U.S.
Economic Assistance into the 21st Century (Washington, D.C.: United
States Agency for International Development, February 1989).
Hereinafter referred to as the Woods Report.) This costs the
developing world between 2.5 percent and 9 percent of its total
economic output and depresses developing country exports by over 10
percent. (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development,
"Protectionism and Structural Adjustment, Introduction and Part I,"
Geneva: January 1986.) 
<P>
      Free trade, of course, is a two-way street. It is equally
important that Eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics reduce
their own trade barriers to enjoy the benefits of freer trade,
including steady growth. High tariffs and such non-tariff barriers as
quotas and licensing fees impede economic development. They hurt Third
World consumers, who then must pay more for foreign goods. 
<P>
      Higher Prices. Also hurt are Third World domestic businesses,
which are forced to pay higher prices for imported supplies and raw
materials. This makes them less competitive on international markets,
decreasing exports. Trade barriers also reduce foreign investment,
since fewer world-class business opportunities exist in slow-growing
economies geared toward domestic markets. 
<P>
      The evidence now is indisputable that outward-oriented, free
trade countries have higher economic growth rates than protectionist
countries. A comprehensive 1987 World Bank study concludes that gross
domestic product (GDP), manufacturing, and investment all grow faster
in trade-oriented than in protectionist countries. (World Bank, World
Development Report 1987 (Washington, D.C.: Oxford University Press,
1987).) 
<P>
      Many East Europeans resist speedy trade liberalization because
they erroneously believe that removing trade barriers will destroy
local industries, create unemployment, lower government revenues, and
lead to balance of payment deficits. 
<P>
      These concerns are contradicted by the empirical evidence. A
World Bank study of nineteen countries, released in fall 1990, shows
that the unemployment costs of broad trade liberalization are low and
temporary, and are offset by increases in economic growth. (World
Bank, Liberalising Foreign Trade in Developing Countries: The Lessons
of Experience, Washington, D.C.: October 1990.) According to the
study, moreover, lower tariffs actually can generate higher government
revenues because taxable imports increase. This rarely results in
serious balance of payment deterioration, since exports also rise
quickly.
<P>
      Just as important as increased trade is increased Western
investment. American and other Western firms can supply Eastern Europe
with the capital needed to modernize their economies and gain access
to new technology, entrepreneurial skills, managerial and marketing
expertise, and jobs with higher wages. In contrast to government-to-
government loans, a squandered investment by a multinational firm will
be that firm's loss only; it will not be a loss for America's
taxpayers.
<P>
      In most of the less developed world, multinational corporations
have been the most effective agents for economic development. Unlike
government or international organization bureaucrats, businessmen must
measure success or failure by a "bottom line," and tend therefore to
invest their money far more carefully. When Western businesses go
abroad, they bring with them the business, managerial, and job
training skills that developing countries must adopt in order to
compete on the world market. This already is happening in Eastern
Europe where such American multinationals as International Business
Machines, Incorporated, and General Electric Company have established
extensive job and technology training programs. 

<P>
THE ASIAN MODEL
<P>
      The rapid development of East Asia's four "tigers" -- Hong Kong,
the Republic of China on Taiwan, the Republic of Korea, and Singapore
-- demonstrates the key role played by free trade and Western
investment in economic growth. In the 1950s, the Pacific Rim was as
poor as Africa, and America was pouring massive foreign aid into South
Korea and Taiwan. Today, the Pacific Rim is approaching the living
standards of Western Europe while Africa remains impoverished. One
reason: the Asian Tigers kicked the foreign aid habit while Africa
remains addicted. 
<P>
      American aid in the 1950s allowed Seoul and Taipei to pursue
protectionist trade policies, imposing high tariffs and quotas in the
knowledge that U.S. aid would cushion their economies from some of
protectionism's worst effects. The same rationale led to heavy
subsidies for domestic producers. The combination of trade barriers
and subsidies made goods more expensive for consumers, hurt exports,
and slowed economic growth. It appeared to many economists at the time
that Africa in fact, with its abundant natural resources, had a much
better chance for rapid economic development than resource-poor, slow-
growing East Asia. (Edward L. Hudgins and Bryan T. Johnson, "Why Asia
Grows and Africa Doesn't," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 756,
March 2, 1990.)
<P>
      In the early 1960s, however, the U.S. inadvertently did Taiwan
and South Korea a favor by slashing foreign economic aid to them.
Though political factors prompted the aid cutoff, the consequences
were mainly economic. Seoul and Taipei dealt with reduced aid flows
from the U.S. by removing many government controls from the economy.
Trade was liberalized and subsidies were cut. (Alvin Rabushka, "Tax
Policy and Economic Growth in Advanced Developing Nations," report
prepared for the U.S. Agency for International Development, 1987, p.
344.) Ever since, Seoul and Taipei steadily have lowered trade
barriers, in part to keep pace with Hong Kong and Singapore, whose
open trade policies and unfettered economies have been magnets for
Western trade and investment. (In South Korea, 95 percent of import
licensing arrangements have been eliminated.) 
<P>
      Export Explosion. The result has been an export explosion for
the region. In the 1970s, exports grew an average of 20 percent a year
for Singapore; 31 percent a year for Taiwan; and 37 percent a year for
South Korea. (Peter L. Berger and Hsin-Huang Michael Hsiao, eds., In
Search of an East Asian Development Model (New Brunswick, N.J.:
Transaction Books, 1988), pp. 48-50.) This would not have been
possible without access to Western markets, particularly to the
American market. American consumers, for example, purchase 40 percent
of everything that Taiwan and South Korea export. 
<P>
      Trade and investment alone were not responsible for economic
development in East Asia. The Asian Tigers helped themselves
enormously with economic policies that included low taxes, minimal
government regulation, tight monetary policy, and realistic currency
exchange rates. Taken together, these policies have led to more rapid
economic growth than any other region in the world. In three decades,
per capita income in the Asian Tigers increased 266 percent. (Hudgins
and Johnson, op. cit., p. 4.) Already, East Asia is beginning to
overtake parts of Western Europe: the average Hong Kong citizen, for
example, today has greater purchasing power than the average Swede. 
<P>
      East Europeans have the resources and the educated and skilled
work force needed to mimic the success of the Asian Tigers. To do so,
they will need Western help in the form of open markets for East
European goods and increased investment.

<P>
ACCESS TO MARKETS: THE KEY TO EXPANDING TRADE 
<P>
      Given market access, East European countries and the Soviet
Union could double their share of world trade over the next two
decades, according to a study by economists Susan M. Collins and Dania
Rodrik. Their study predicts a drastic redirection of trade for East
European countries and the Soviet Union away from each other and
toward Western markets. (Collins and Rodrik, op. cit., Chapter 2.)
<P>
      As a percentage of their total exports, East European exports to
the West are expected to increase from a current range of between 9
percent (Bulgaria) and 34 percent (Poland), to between 40 percent and
62 percent. 
<P>
      Europe, rather than the U.S. or Japan, will account for the
overwhelming preponderance of this trade shift. If the EC opens its
markets to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, trade with the East
could rise from 4 percent of EC trade today to 25 percent within
twenty years. Soviet and East European trade is predicted to rise only
to between 6 percent and 9 percent of U.S. trade from its level of
just over 1 percent today. (Ibid. pp. 44-48.) 
<P>
      Trade figures for 1990 and early 1991 tend to confirm the
changing patterns predicted by Collins and Rodrik. Hungary, for
example, increased its hard currency trade -- mostly with the West --
by 18 percent in 1990 and 40 percent in the first quarter of this
year. Most of the increase was due to the boost in exports by newly
created small- and medium-sized Hungarian private companies, which are
proving their ability to react more quickly than giant state
industries to the collapse of Soviet trade and the decline of East
European markets. 
<P>
      Pleading Desperately. The problem is that it is far from certain
that the West, particularly West Europe, will open its markets to East
European products. EC trade barriers keep out products from the East
despite desperate pleas for trade liberalization from Vaclev Klaus,
Lech Walesa, and other East European leaders. Complains Rita Klimova,
Czechoslovakia's Ambassador to the U.S., "The EC is talking about
environmental cooperation and cultural exchanges, but on the issue of
trade, they're relegating it to the end of the century." (Wall Street
Journal, July 25, 1991.) 
<P>
      Due to inferior technology, most East European and Soviet
industrial, high-tech and consumer goods cannot compete in Western
markets. Ironically, and not accidentally, it is in precisely these
sectors that the European Community has eliminated most non-tariff
trade barriers, such as quotas. 
<P>
      By contrast, in sectors where East Europeans often enjoy a
comparative advantage due to cheaper labor costs, lower land values,
and other reasons -- including agriculture, clothing, steel, and
textiles -- the European Community has erected very high barriers. If
the market alone were the arbiter, according to David Roche, chief
strategist with Morgan Stanley Company in London, there would be a
major transfer of production from Western Europe to the East in these
sectors. 
<P>
      Most troubling surely is the EC's notorious Common Agriculture
Policy (CAP). An anti-competitive program managed by the EC's Brussels
bureaucracy, the CAP mandates high tariffs on agricultural goods
imported by the EC while providing export and production subsidies for
EC farmers' products. (For more information on the CAP, see Ewen M.
Wilson, "The European Community's Common Agricultural Policy:
Continued Problems for the U.S.," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No.
799, December 5, 1990.) If it were not for the CAP, several East
European countries, particularly Poland, and eventually Ukraine, could
be major agricultural exporters to the EC. 
<P>
      Dumping of Products. In addition to blocking agricultural
imports into Western Europe, CAP subsidies mean that EC agricultural
products are dumped onto East European markets at below-market prices,
hurting local production. This has caused tremendous political
problems for the East European governments. In summer 1991, for
instance, Czech farmers went on strike and blocked border crossings to
protest the import of subsidized EC food. 
<P>
      The European Community currently is nearing agreement with
Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland to make these nations "associate
members" of the EC and to ease trade barriers. The association
agreements, however, at least in the short term, will keep many
barriers in place. EC quotas and duties on steel will be lifted within
five years and tariffs on textiles within ten years for the associate
members. Tariffs on meat will be somewhat lowered, but farm products
will continue to be heavily protected by the CAP. Germany still is
demanding import restrictions to keep out East European coal. 
<P>
      Too Long a Wait. East Europeans cannot wait five to ten years
for a partial opening of the West European market. The collapse of
trade with the Soviet Union and disintegrating intra-East European
trade make it imperative that markets for their goods open
immediately. Laments Vladimir Dlouhy, Czechoslovakia's economics
minister, "I don't need support [reducing trade barriers] in five
years. I need it now and terribly so." ("East Looks West and Sees
Trade Barriers," Wall Street Journal, July 25, 1991.) 
<P>
      One effect of the EC's refusal to eliminate trade barriers
quickly is that East European countries are likely to start raising
their own tariffs in response, reversing the welcome trend toward
trade liberalization. Hungary this year cut average tariff rates from
16 percent to 13 percent, bringing them more in line with other
developed countries. ("Hungarians allow most curbs on imports to
lapse," Financial Times, April 10, 1991.) License requirements for the
import of Western goods also have been cut by Hungary; they are now
required for only 10 percent of imports, and 99 percent of
applications were approved last year. 
<P>
      Poland, meanwhile, last year eliminated import quotas; most
duties were lowered to zero or five percent, and tariffs were removed
altogether on about 58 percent of goods coming into the country.
Partly as a result of the trade liberalization, Polish companies
bought cheap imported components and thus reduced costs. The result:
Polish businesses increased exports 50 percent last year. 
<P>
      Swinging Pendulum. But now the pendulum is swinging the other
way. This April, Poland raised the average customs tariff on
agricultural goods from 9.8 percent to 19.3 percent and duties on
finished tobacco products from 30 percent to 60 percent. 
<P>
      For its part, the U.S. has moved further and more quickly than
the EC to reduce barriers to East European exports. George Bush's
Trade Enhancement Initiative for Central and Eastern Europe, for
instance, grants duty-free benefits to some categories of East
European exports and funds seminars for East European officials on
U.S. trade laws. Further, in the past two years, Washington has
granted what is known as "Generalized System of Preferences" (GSP),
allowing $500 million in East European goods to be exported to the
U.S. free of duty charges. An additional $182 million in GSP benefits
for Eastern Europe were approved in March. ( Poland will receive $93.3
million of the benefits, thereby doubling Poland's duty-free exports.)

<P>
      While helpful, these measures are of limited assistance to East
European countries since by law they exclude the very sectors in which
the highest barriers already exist: cheese, clothing, steel, and
textiles. In July, Bush announced that special trade preferences would
be granted to Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland in the food and
textile sectors. All former East bloc countries except Albania and
Romania now have been granted Most Favored Nation (MFN) status by the
U.S., meaning they all receive the benefits of the same low tariffs
extended to more than 150 countries. Steel quotas will be removed next
year and textile quotas have been eased, although political opposition
from textile states makes complete elimination of the quotas unlikely.
Meanwhile quotas on clothing, a major potential East European export,
remain intact.
<P>

FOREIGN INVESTMENT INCREASING SLOWLY IN EASTERN EUROPE
<P>
      Since communism collapsed in 1989, Eastern Europe has attracted
over $1.5 billion in Western private investment. PlanEcon, a
Washington, D.C.-based consulting firm, estimates that by 1993,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland combined could be getting $3.2
billion a year in foreign investment. (PlanEcon Report, various
issues, Washington, D.C.) After a very slow start, American companies
are beginning to invest greater amounts of capital in the region. 
<P>
      American firms overtook the Germans last year as the top
investors in Hungary. Over 4,500 joint American-Hungarian ventures
have been registered; American giants Ford Motor Company, General
Electric Company, General Motors Corporation, and Sara Lee Corporation
plan a combined $440 million in investments in Hungary. American
institutional investors, too, are putting money in Hungary. Americans
recently bought about half the $14.3 million shares available in a
stock offering of Fotex Corporation, a Hungarian conglomerate with a
chain of photo labs, eyeglass stores, and crystal shops. 
<P>
      U.S. business investment also is picking up in Poland. American
investors accounted for 11.3 percent of the new foreign businesses
registered there in 1990, twice the level of 1989. ("Situation
Report-Poland: January-February 1991," U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
International Division, p. 5.) Over 214 American firms, with
investments of over $58 million, now are registered in Poland. Still,
this is a relatively small share of the $400 million in foreign direct
investment that flowed into Poland in just the first quarter of 1990.
<P>
      Like Asian Tigers. If East Europeans and the Soviet republics
are to duplicate the rapid economic growth of the Asian Tigers, they
must attract far greater levels of private investment from America and
other Western countries. Important steps in this direction already
have been taken by the East Europeans themselves. Western companies
now are permitted by Hungary and Poland to take their profits out of
the country. Tax incentives and legal investment guarantees
increasingly are being offered to foreign businesses. Czechoslovakia,
Hungary, and Poland, for instance, all offer "tax holidays" to foreign
businesses. Most of the East European countries already, or soon will,
permit majority foreign ownership of newly privatized companies -- a
complete turnaround from the xenophobia of the communist era. 
<P>
      There remain, however, significant obstacles to doing business
even in Hungary and Poland. Telecommunications systems remain
unreliable and of poor quality. Modern banking systems are not yet in
place. Laws governing ownership and the transfer of property still are
confused, while most industries remain in state hands. Bureaucratic
obstacles abound and currencies are not yet fully convertible on
international markets. 
<P>
      East European Role. Responsibility for increasing foreign direct
private investment rests mainly with the East Europeans themselves. If
they continue their march toward free market economies, foreign
investment will follow. Still there is much that America and Western
Europe can do.
<P>
      The Bush Administration already has moved to increase American
investment in Eastern Europe. A Bilateral Investment Treaty still
under negotiation with Czechoslovakia, for instance, will give
American investors such basic guarantees as equal treatment with local
companies. It also will allow full "repatriation" of profits to the
U.S. A similar treaty is being negotiated with Bulgaria. Last year,
the U.S. Senate ratified a Business and Economic Relations Treaty with
Poland which, along with the guarantees of a Bilateral Investment
Treaty, also protects intellectual property rights, like patents. 

<P>
U.S. TAX LAWS BARRIER TO INVESTMENT 
<P>
      One serious remaining obstacle to American investment in Eastern
Europe is the U.S. tax code. For nearly the first half-century after
the adoption of the corporate income tax in 1913, American companies
paid lower taxes relative to other countries on income earned abroad.
In this period, as a result, American companies were highly
competitive globally. 
<P>
      Starting in the early 1960s, however, tax laws were made ever
more complicated, eroding the tax advantage American companies enjoyed
over other multinationals. The average effective tax rate on income
earned abroad for U.S. companies is 38 percent. This is higher than
the rate paid by companies based in any of the six other major
industrial countries. Over the past thirty years, Germany, the
Netherlands, and other Western countries have revised tax laws to
encourage their companies to compete internationally. America has
moved in the opposite direction. (See, for example, The Competitive
Burden: Tax Treatment of U.S. Multinationals, prepared for the Tax
Foundation by Arthur Young and Company, Washington, D.C., 1988; Norman
B. Ture, "EC92's Implications for U.S. Foreign Tax Policy, " testimony
to the House Committee on Ways and Means, January 30, 1990; and
Competitive Tax Disadvantages Faced by U.S. Multinationals, A Tax
Foundation Special Report, Washington D.C., 1990.)
<P>
      No Tax Holidays. One of the most anti-foreign-investment aspects
of the U.S. tax code is that it does not permit American companies to
take advantage of many incentives to attract investment offered by
foreign governments, including the East European. Among these are "tax
holidays," which exempt foreign multinationals from all local taxes
for periods of up to ten years; Poland automatically grants joint
ventures with foreign investors a three-year tax holiday.
<P>
      The U.S. tax code requires American companies operating abroad
to pay foreign taxes on corporate profits. Then, if the foreign tax is
lower than the U.S. corporate profits tax, the difference between the
two taxes must be paid to the U.S. Treasury. If the foreign tax rate
is cut, therefore, the company receives no benefit because it simply
pays more to U.S. tax collectors. Even if a foreign country's tax rate
drops to zero, as it does during a tax holiday, the effective tax rate
for the U.S. company is not lower. The firm simply pays the full
amount to the U.S. government. Other industrial nations allow for what
is called "tax sparing." By this, the governments "spare" or "forgive"
the right to levy their full tax on a company if it takes advantage of
a "tax holiday" or similar incentive. 
<P>
      Forbidding Tax Sparing. Tax sparing encourages firms to do
business overseas, thereby assisting in Third World economic
development and at the same time making Western businesses in those
countries that allow it more competitive and profitable. By forbidding
tax sparing, the U.S. undermines the competitiveness of Americans own
companies vis-a-vis other Western companies. 
<P>
      A study by the Washington-based Tax Foundation finds, for
example, that a German firm operating in Singapore would have a 24
percent advantage in cash flow over an American firm; a Japanese firm
would have a 32 percent advantage. The reason: tax sparing. Germany
and Japan have tax sparing agreements with Singapore; America does
not. ( Competitive Tax Disadvantages Faced by U.S. Multinationals, A
Tax Foundation Special Report, Washington D.C., 1990.)
<P>
      Income Tax Earned Abroad. Another example of how U.S. tax laws
discourage American companies from investing and operating abroad is
the individual income tax. The U.S. is the only major industrialized
country that taxes individual income earned abroad. As a result, West
Europeans or Japanese working in Eastern Europe pay only local income
taxes. Americans, by contrast, pay U.S. taxes in addition to local
taxes on incomes above $70,000. 
<P>
      This discourages higher-paid, senior American executives from
working in Eastern Europe and elsewhere in the developing world. This,
in turn, makes it more costly and more difficult for U.S. firms to
compete globally, thereby decreasing competitiveness and ultimately
investment. The tax burden imposed on Americans working abroad also
costs the U.S. exports. According to a 1980 Chase Econometrics study,
U.S. exports decline by 10 percent for every 10 percent reduction in
American workers overseas. (Robert D. Shriner, "Taxation of U.S.
Workers Overseas Hurts Workers, Firms and Exports," Chase
Econometrics, U.S. Macroeconomic Forecast and Analysis, May 1981, pp.
A30-A37.)
<P>

A FIVE-PLANK PROGRAM TO INCREASE TRADE AND INVESTMENT WITH EASTERN
EUROPE AND THE REPUBLICS
<P>
      For Eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics to succeed in
their transformation to free market economies, their trade with the
West and their ability to attract foreign investment must increase
dramatically. Yet, so far, doors to Western markets remain tough to
pry open, while foreign investment is limited. Sweeping initiatives
are needed by the U.S. and Western Europe to open markets to East
European goods and to clear the way for increased Western investment.
The U.S. already has made progress. Further steps will signal the East
Europeans and former Soviets that Americans, unlike many West
Europeans, have confidence in Eastern Europe's ability to transform
its economy. George Bush should help the East Europeans and former
Soviet republics to help themselves by unveiling a five-plank program
for promoting increased trade and investment in the region. The
program: 
<P>
Plank #1: Offer to negotiate free trade agreements between the U.S.
          and the East European countries, including the former
          Soviet republics.
<P>
      Just when the countries of Eastern Europe most need free trade,
they are being met with resistance, especially by the European
Community. An offer to negotiate a free trade area with the U.S. would
give East Europeans leverage against the EC by offering them an
alternative economic partner. It also would encourage American
investment in Eastern Europe and give East Europeans access to the
American market. It further would ensure that when East-West European
trade barriers finally are dropped in ten years, America would not be
isolated, stuck with high barriers to trade with both the EC and East
Europeans.
<P>
      Free trade arrangements (FTAs) with Eastern Europe and the
republics would remove obstacles to trade such as tariffs, as well as
nontariff trade barriers like import licensing, trade quotas, and
subsidies. There are other potential benefits that can and should be
negotiated in FTAs. Restrictions on foreign investments can be
eliminated, intellectual property agreements that protect American
companies' patents and copyrights can be strengthened, and trade
conflicts, such as those over anti-dumping laws, can be reconciled by
creating a trade dispute resolution process. The U.S. has FTAs with
Canada and Israel and is negotiating an FTA with Mexico. FTAs offer
more short-term advantages than the higher tariffs and barriers
offered by "association" status with the EC, and would benefit East
Europeans over the long term since they would force the EC to open its
own markets to compete on equal terms with America. 
<P>
Plank #2: Lower U.S. trade barriers for goods and services from
          Eastern Europe and the republics and exempt their exports
          from all tariffs.<P>
      Free trade negotiations with the East Europeans could take
several years, given their political complexities. Immediately,
however, the U.S. can move unilaterally to reduce trade barriers to
products from Eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics. Barriers
should be removed, or lowered substantially, to the import of cheese,
clothing, steel, and textiles. These are some of the most heavily
protected U.S. markets, but also are the sectors in which Eastern
products have the best chance to compete in the American market. 
<P>
      The critical first step is to eliminate customs duties on
imported goods from Eastern Europe. The U.S. in the last two years
already has granted $682 million in "Generalized System of
Preferences," allowing East European goods to be imported into the
U.S. duty free. While helpful, these measures are of limited
assistance to East European countries since by law they exclude the
very sectors in which the highest barriers already exist, including
again, cheese, clothing, steel and textiles. 
<P>
      Bush announced at the July Western industrialized nations Group
of Seven (G-7) economic summit in London that Czechoslovakia, Hungary
and Poland would be granted special trade preferences in the food and
textile sectors. Quotas are to be increased on textiles while more
agricultural goods are to be eligible for GSP preferences. Bush should
take this one step farther by calling for an East European Trade
Preference Act which eliminates duties on all goods from Eastern
Europe for five years. This would open a huge market for East European
exports, thereby encouraging the rapid development of dynamic private
sector businesses with exporting potential.
<P>
Plank #3: Withhold U.S. funding for the New European Bank for
          Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) until the European
          Community agrees to reduce significantly its trade barriers
          to East European products.
<P>
      Dismayed by the European barriers to trade with the East, voices
in Europe are calling for trade liberalization. Jrgen W. Mollemann,
the German Economics Minister, advocates the elimination of quotas on
East European goods and the elimination of subsidies for EC producers,
including farmers. In a speech to his cabinet, German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl on October 13 endorsed Molleman's proposals. Britain and
Denmark also have called for rapidly opening markets to Eastern
Europe. An EC Commission report released last month urges the EC to
increase access for East European goods to EC markets. Major
opposition, predictably, is coming from traditionally protectionist
France. As such, the EC is not taking the advice of its own experts.
(Wall Street Journal, July 30, 1991, p. A13.) The Bush Administration
too repeatedly has pressed the EC to reduce trade barriers to Eastern
Europe, but to little avail. The EC needs to be pushed harder. 
<P>
      Aid to Transition. One lever Washington holds for this is the
U.S. contribution to the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD). The EBRD was created in early 1990 to assist the
East European transition to democracy and market economies. EC members
hold 51 percent of the shares in the bank, although the U.S. is the
largest individual country shareholder with 10 percent. Funds for the
bank are contributed by member countries proportionate with their
voting shares. This amounts to a $1.2 billion contribution from the
U.S. Of this, 30 percent, or $365 million, must be contributed in
cash, while the remainder would be "callable" when needed.
<P>
      Headed by French socialist Jacques Attali, the EBRD began
operations this fall, with $12.2 billion to aid Eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union. One-quarter of the bank's budget will go to the 23 well-
paid, full-time directors of the Bank, largely bureaucrats and ex-
politicians. ("A bank in the hand," The Economist, April 13, 1991, pp.
14-15.) 
<P>
      Due to American insistence, 60 percent of EBRD loans will go to
Eastern Europe's growing private sector, rather than to governments.
Firms that produce textiles and process food should be prime
candidates for loans from the bank. These loans will do little good,
however, unless new businesses in Eastern Europe have access to EC
markets for their products. Bush and Congress should refuse to approve
of the scheduled American contribution to the European-controlled
development bank until Western Europe eliminates or greatly reduces
its trade barriers to East European products, including opening its
markets to Eastern agricultural goods. 
<P>
Plank #4: Allow for "tax sparing" with East European countries and
          former Soviet republics.
<P>
      East European countries, desperate for Western capital and know-
how, are granting generous tax holidays to foreign companies. The tax
laws of many developed countries allow their multinational
corporations to take advantage of tax holidays. In these cases, the
developed country spares the multinational firm the obligation of
paying higher taxes in its home country when their foreign taxes drop.
This is not so for American companies, which simply have to pay higher
U.S. taxes when their foreign taxes are lowered. This hurts the
American competitive position vis-a-vis other Western multinational
corporations. 
<P>
      Toward a Level Playing Field. Tax sparing for American
corporations, instituted in the form of treaties between the U.S. and
East European governments, would promote increased American investment
in Eastern Europe and level the playing field for American companies
in relation to other Western corporations. Representative David
Dreier, the California Republican, will introduce a bill this month
known as PROGRESS. It would authorize the President to allow for tax
sparing for U.S. companies operating in Eastern Europe. 
<P>
      If it approves tax sparing, Congress would expand opportunities
for U.S. businesses and increase U.S. direct investment in Eastern
Europe and former Soviet republics. Bush should join Dreier in calling
on Congress to change the formula in the U.S. tax code that deals with
the treatment of foreign source income to allow for tax sparing. 
<P>
      According to Stephen J. Entin, resident scholar at the Institute
for Research on the Economics of Taxation in Washington, D.C., tax
sparing will not affect the 1990 budget agreement between the White
House and Congress nor will it hurt the U.S. budget deficit. (Stephen
Entin, "Aid to East Bloc -- A Taxing Question," Wall Street Journal,
September 5, 1991.) The reason: U.S. businesses have not actually
invested a great deal of money in the region and it will likely take
some time to realize substantial profits. Therefore the Treasury
Department's estimates for tax revenues from profits in the region
should be near zero anyway.
<P>
      Much of the U.S. investment in Eastern Europe and profits that
would be produced from the investments would not take place without
the tax sparing incentive. Therefore, tax sparing would have no real
revenue cost under the revenue estimating rules employed for budget
projections and could be enacted without the tax increases or spending
reductions mandated in the restrictions of the 1990 Budget Act.
<P>
      According to a January Price Waterhouse study, the value of
international trade as a percentage of U.S. national income has
doubled over the past four decades. The share of U.S. corporate
earnings produced by foreign affiliates has tripled, now accounting
for 43 percent of the worldwide profits of American multinational
corporations. (U.S. International Tax Policy For A Global Economy,
prepared for National Chamber Foundation by Price Waterhouse,
Executive Summary, January 11, 1991, p. e-3.) With international trade
becoming increasingly vital to the health of American businesses, the
U.S. no longer can afford to pursue tax policies that put its
companies at a disadvantage in the global marketplace. 

<P>
Plank #5: Reduce taxes on Americans working in Eastern Europe and the
          republics.
<P>
      Alone among major industrial nations, the U.S. taxes its
citizens who work abroad. Americans who earn more than $70,000 must
pay U.S. taxes in addition to foreign taxes. The resulting heavy tax
burden discourages individuals making more than $70,000 per year,
mainly high-level U.S. business executives with precisely the skills
needed in Eastern Europe, from spending much time working there. 
<P>
      The U.S. should be encouraging American firms to operate in
Eastern Europe, not discouraging them with high taxes. 
<P>
      Dreier's PROGRESS bill proposes doubling to $140,000 the amount
of foreign source income that can be exempted from U.S. personal
income taxes. This would offer powerful incentives for senior,
experienced American businessman to spend more time in Eastern Europe,
where opportunities for entrepreneurship and investment abound, and
where their managerial expertise and skills in finance and business
would be extraordinarily valuable in assisting local businesses to
adapt to free market conditions. 
<P>

CONCLUSION
<P>
      After decades of isolation, East Europeans and the peoples of
the dying Soviet Union want to develop free market economies and join
the world economy. Experience in the developing world demonstrates
that foreign aid is the wrong prescription both for economic growth
and expanding trade. Instead, as demonstrated in Africa, foreign aid
breeds a destructive cycle of dependency and ever increasing need. 
<P>
      The remarkable rise of the Asian Tigers -- Hong Kong, the
Republic of China on Taiwan, the Republic of Korea, and Singapore --
offers a lesson for Eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics:
rapid growth in exports and large infusions of foreign business
investment are far more important than government-to-government aid in
sparking rapid growth.
<P>
      At the London economic summit in July, the leading industrial
countries endorsed this prescription, formally declaring that
"expanding markets for [Eastern Europe's] exports is vital." Yet,
despite the rhetoric, there are few signs that Western trade barriers
to East European goods soon will fall. Increases in energy prices and
the collapse of Soviet and intra-East European trade have created a
dire economic situation in Eastern Europe and the republics of the
former Soviet Union. The situation requires the U.S. and other
industrialized nations to match their rhetoric with action. U.S policy
should promote free trade, free markets, and increased Western
investment in the East. 
<P>
      Lowering Barriers. A first step should be for the U.S. to offer
free trade agreements to East European countries and former Soviet
republics. In the meantime, trade barriers should be lowered and East
European and republic goods should be let into America free of duty
charges for five years. The U.S. also should press the European
Community to reduce its own stiff trade barriers to Eastern Europe.
One way would be to withhold funding from the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) until the EC opens its market to
East European agriculture, steel, textiles, and other "sensitive"
goods.
<P>
      To increase American business investment in Eastern Europe and
the republics, the U.S. should negotiate tax sparing treaties with
East European countries and liberated republics, and reduce taxes on
Americans working in the region. 
<P>
      The countries of Eastern Europe deserve to follow the high-
growth path of the Asian Tigers and reach the levels of prosperity
enjoyed in Western Europe. Toward this end, these countries are
adopting free market reforms such as freeing prices, tightening the
money supply, eliminating subsidies to state enterprises, and
privatizing and deregulating industry. Even with these reforms,
however, the East could fail unless the West opens its markets and
takes steps to encourage private investment in the East. It now,
therefore, is the time for America and the rest of the industrialized
world to assist them in their bid for prosperity and independence by
helping East Europeans to help themselves. 
<P>

THE MYTHS AND REALITIES OF TRADE DEFICITS -- Heritage </title>
   <center><h3><i>THE MYTHS AND REALITIES OF TRADE DEFICITS</h3></i>

   <b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
   
     The Clinton Administration's near collision with Japan over
   automobiles and auto parts almost started a trade war with America's second
   largest trading partner. Fortunately, however, the Clinton Adminstration
   backed off from insisting on numerical targets in the trade agreement, even
   though numerical purchasing quotas were the heart of its position. Thus, what
   was largely a defeat for Clinton's managed trade policy is a victory for the
   American consumer.
<p>   
     But the President and his trade team may not have learned the larger
   lesson from their defeat. Underlying the Clinton Administration's policies
   toward Japan is an irrational fear of trade deficits and the belief that
   protectionist policies are necessary to combat them.
   <p>
     Concern that Japan is trading unfairly with the U.S. motivates many
   within the Clinton Administration (and in Congress) to strive for what they call
   a "balanced trade sheet."  Specifically worrisome is the U.S. trade deficit with
   Japan, which is now about $50 billion a year.1 The belief that trade deficits are
harmful is what drove the Clinton Administration to threaten Japan with a trade
war over automobiles and auto parts.
<p>
  The Clinton Administration's managed trade policies are based on a number of
faulty assumptions and myths about trade deficits. Specifically:
<p><ul>
<li>That trade deficits are harmful and trade surpluses are beneficial;
<p><li>
That trade deficits cost jobs;
<p><li>
That Japan's prosperity is based on trade surpluses generated by managed trade policies;
<p><li>
That American companies will go bankrupt unless the U.S. government limits import
competition and forces foreign countries to purchase more U.S. goods;
<p><li>
That because the U.S. is unable to sell some goods and services there, Japan's market must
be closed;
<p><li>
That trade surpluses are always the result of government policy;
<p><li>
That trade retaliation is the most effective way to eliminate trade deficits; and
<p><li>
That trade sanctions to redress imbalances will protect American jobs.
<p></ul>
  In each case, however, the answer is:  Not true. For example, the U.S. has run a
trade deficit for most of its history, even during periods of economic growth, and the record
shows that unemployment generally drops as trade deficits rise. Moreover, managed trade
lowers living standards. The Japanese consumer is 30 percent to 40 percent behind his
American counterpart in terms of real purchasing power.
<p>
  In addition, protectionism may save jobs in one industry, but it often destroys many
more jobs in other industries. The fact is that, in most cases, trade retaliation has failed to
open markets while costing American consumers billions in higher prices. And yet, the
myths persist.
<p>

<b>THE MYTHS OF MANAGED TRADE</b>
<p>
  The Clinton Administration's approach to settling its trade disputes with Japan,
China, and other countries rests on a number of myths and faulty assumptions about trade
deficits. These myths are the intellectual foundation of the Administration's managed trade
policies.
<p>
<b>MYTH #1:</b> Trade deficits are harmful and trade surpluses are beneficial.
This is the core idea of protectionism and managed trade policies. Advocates of
this point of view argue that trade deficits harm the economy, destroy jobs, and
reflect a weakness in the economy.
<p>
<b>REALITY:</b>  Not true. Trade deficits are more a sign of strength than of
weakness. The meaning of the U.S. trade deficit is that Americans hold more
goods than their foreign trading partners, while foreigners hold more U.S.
dollars. This is a sign of America's wealth. Being the richest country in the
world, America consumes goods and services from both U.S. and foreign
companies. The influx of foreign goods and services in return for dollars adds
to America's wealth. It does not detract from it.
<p>
  Americans receive imported goods and services that increase their
standard of living. Moreover, the dollars sent abroad for the purchase of goods
and services typically cannot be used within those countries. While the dollars
are traded between countries in the financial markets, they are used mainly by
foreign consumers to buy American goods and services. Thus, nations use
surplus dollars to buy American goods and services, invest in U.S. firms, or
purchase U.S. Treasury bonds. These investments create jobs and wealth for
Americans, while the purchase of Treasury bonds frees U.S. domestic capital
for savings, investment, and purchases.
<p>
  Consider the following example:  The way the protectionists see it,
most people run a trade "deficit" with their grocer. When someone goes to the
supermarket and buys $150 worth of groceries, the protectionist believes the
proprietor has a trade "surplus" of $150, while the customer has a "deficit" of
$150. But this is not the case at all. The grocer ends up with $150 in currency,
while the customer has $150 worth of groceries. It is a mutually beneficial
transaction. Thus, both the grocer and the customer are winners. There are no
losers. No one would expect the grocer to buy an equal amount of goods from
the customer in order to have an equal balance sheet in exchanged goods. Nor
should one expect countries to have an even balance sheet in international
trade. The trade deficit represents nothing more than a surplus of foreign goods
and services which Americans now own. The value of these goods and services
is as much a part of the national wealth as is possession of U.S. dollars.
<p>
  Another misunderstanding involves trade deficit figures. At least one-third to one-half of the U.S. trade deficit figure counts U.S. imports from
American overseas subsidiaries as part of the deficit. For example, when Ford
Mexico sends a motor from its plant to the Ford assembly plant in Detroit, it is
counted as an import. However, if Ford then sells an American-made car with
a Mexican-made motor in the U.S., there is no corresponding export. Thus, a
"deficit" supposedly is created. But why should a car sold in the U.S. be
calculated as part of the trade deficit?  Most of the money made from this sale
stays in the U.S.
<p>
  Trade deficits are not harmful to the economy. If they were, America
would not be the economic powerhouse it is today. For most of its history, the
U.S. has run a trade deficit. For the first hundred years, these deficits were
fairly large. Nevertheless, throughout this period, growth rates were higher
than they are today. Trade deficits did not destroy the economy then. Nor will
they destroy it in the future.
<p>
<b>MYTH #2:</b> Trade deficits cost jobs. Protectionists claim that trade deficits are
a major cause of unemployment. This is the assumption that animated Ross
Perot's charge that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
would cause a "giant sucking sound" of jobs heading south to Mexico.
<p>
<b>REALITY:</b> Not true. History shows that, on average, unemployment drops as
trade deficits rise. If this myth were true, unemployment rates would go up
when trade deficits grow, and unemployment would drop when they shrink. In
fact, the opposite is more likely. For example, while the trade deficit leaped in
1983-1984 and peaked in 1987, the U.S. unemployment rate plummeted,
falling from 9.6 percent in 1983 to 5.5 percent in 1988; when it began to
shrink from 1989 to 1991, unemployment rose from 5.3 percent to 6.7 percent.
When the trade deficit began to rise from 1992 to 1994, unemployment shrank
from 7.4 percent to 6.1 percent (see chart).
<p>
Looking further back in history only confirms that trade deficits do not cause a
loss of jobs. Every year the trade deficit increased since 1962, unemployment
decreased. Likewise, every year the trade deficit decreased since 1962,
unemployment increased.2 Despite the trade deficit, the economy was growing
and jobs were being created.
<p>
<b>MYTH #3:</b>  Japan's prosperity is based on trade surpluses generated by
managed trade policies. U.S. policymakers often use Japan as an example of
how a country can eliminate trade deficits by managing trade and industry.
<p>
<b>REALITY:</b>  Not true. A closer look reveals that Japan's managed trade
policies have had mixed results. In fact, too much government "management"
may be responsible for Japan's current economic malaise. If the people's
standard of living is the measure of success, Japan has lost the "economic war"
with the U.S. For example, the real purchasing power of Japanese consumers
is 30 percent to 40 percent lower than that of the American consumer. Thus, in
purchasing power terms, the Japanese are at least one-third poorer than
Americans.
<p>
  Japan's lower standard of living can be attributed partly to managed
trade and industrial policies that drive up the cost of living. For example,
policies that restrict such imports as agricultural products, beef, and other food
items force the average Japanese to spend about 25 percent of his disposable
income on food, compared to less than 12 percent for Americans. Spending
more on food means less money for housing and other needs. The result:  a
lower standard of living.
<p>
<b>MYTH #4:</b> American companies will go bankrupt unless the U.S.
government limits import competition and forces foreign countries to
purchase more U.S. goods. Advocates of managed trade argue that closed
overseas markets are the chief reason for America's trade deficit, causing
enormous economic hardships that result in bankruptcies and lost jobs.
<p>
<b>REALITY:</b> Not true. This scare tactic is employed by U.S. companies to
frighten policymakers into taking up their cause in Washington. And what is
their cause?  To limit import competition with trade protectionism and force
foreign countries to purchase a set amount of U.S. goods and services. These
companies argue that they are hurt by closed markets overseas. As a result,
they want Congress and the Administration to punish American consumers by
forcing them to pay higher prices for imported products like automobiles.
<p>
  But if American companies are so beset by closed markets overseas,
why is America the world's largest exporter?  The U.S. exported over $697
billion in goods and services in 1994.3 By contrast, Germany exported only
$607 billion and Japan only $395 billion.4 Clearly, most U.S. exporters find
overseas markets for their goods.
<p>
  The most vocal complainer is the U.S. automobile industry. Ford Motor Company,
General Motors Company, and Chrysler Corporation are at the forefront in lobbying the U.S.
government to pressure the Japanese government to open its markets to American cars. But
the Big Three earned $14 billion in profits last year. They are in no danger of bankruptcy;
nor do they deserve government coddling.
<p>
<b>MYTH #5:</b>  Because the U.S. is unable to sell some goods and services
there, Japan's market must be closed. Many trade deficit "hawks" argue that
the U.S. has an open market, while Japan restricts American imports. Thus,
Japanese protectionism supposedly is the main cause of the U.S. trade deficit
with Japan.
<p>
<b>REALITY:</b> Not true. Japan is no more protectionist than the United States.
This is the conclusion of The Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic
Freedom, which measures the relative level of economic freedom in over 100
countries. The study concludes that Japan and the U.S. have relatively equal
levels of protectionism.5
<p>
  The trade deficit with Japan is not nearly as bad as deficit "hawks" argue. For
example, while the U.S. ran up a $66 billion merchandise trade deficit with Japan in 1994, it
had a $16 billion trade surplus in services. Thus, the real deficit was only about $50  billion.
Moreover, much of the trade deficit with Japan comes from counting the products of
American companies exporting their goods back home. But why should the   importation of
products made by American companies in Japan be counted against the deficit merely
because they were manufactured in Japan?  The profits from these sales go to the
stockholders of American companies, not directly to the Japanese.
<p>
  The truth is that Japan is the largest overseas export market for the U.S. Japan
imported $51 billion in goods from the U.S. in 1994. That is more than the U.S. exported to
the United Kingdom and Germany combined ($25.9 billion and $18.7 billion, respectively).6
Moreover, on a per capita basis, Japan buys more from the U.S. than the U.S.
buys from Japan. For example, each Japanese citizen bought $444 worth of
U.S. goods and services in 1994, while each American citizen purchased only
$441 worth of Japanese goods and services.7 But because Japan's population is
about 50 percent smaller than America's, a deficit exists. Americans purchase
more Japanese goods overall because there are twice as many Americans as
Japanese. Thus, a trade deficit exists for many reasons, but Japanese
protectionism is not the major reason.
<p>
<b>MYTH #6:</b>  Trade deficits are always the result of government policy.
Protectionists are fond of arguing that trade surpluses are "created"
intentionally by government policy. Thus, they reason, trade deficits must be
dealt with in the same manner -- by government action.
<p>
<b>REALITY:</b> Not true. Those who argue that trade surpluses and deficits are the
result of government manipulation fail to understand how a market economy
works. They ignore, for example, that some countries with scarce natural
resources are likely to run a trade surplus because they must import unfinished
goods, which are inexpensive, and export finished goods, which are more
expensive. Japan is a case in point. It must import such raw materials as oil
and lumber. These raw materials are used to manufacture more expensive
finished products, some of which are exported. Throughout this process the
Japanese are adding value to the imported raw materials by making more
expensive finished products for export. The result is a trade surplus. By
contrast, the U.S. has abundant natural resources, which in many cases it
exports. Thus, most of its imports are finished goods, which are more
expensive and worth more than the raw materials that went into making them.
<p>
<b>MYTH #7:</b> Trade retaliation is the most effective way to eliminate trade
deficits. Protectionists believe the best way to open foreign markets is to
threaten trade retaliation. The weapons of choice:  special tariffs and duties and
the imposition of import quotas.
<p>
<b>REALITY:</b> Not true. The U.S. has resorted to such tactics to open foreign
markets, but whether they have worked is debatable. Most of the time, these
threats have backfired. The principal U.S. law used to threaten trade retaliation
is called "Section 301."  This refers to Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act,
which grants the President the authority to impose punitive trade restrictions on
imports. Of the nearly 80 Section 301 cases initiated by the U.S. since 1974,
only about 15 were successful. Yet even in these cases, American consumers
were saddled with billions of dollars in higher prices caused by higher tariffs
and special duties. In the end, all Americans were the losers in this flawed
strategy.
<p>
<b>MYTH #8:</b> Trade sanctions to redress imbalances will protect American
jobs. Trade deficit "hawks" argue that forcing open foreign markets will create
U.S. jobs.
<p>
<b>REALITY:</b> Not true. The history of managed trade shows that even though
one industry may benefit temporarily from government help, the cost to other
industries and to U.S. consumers outweighs these benefits. Years of import
restrictions on textile and apparel products, for example, have destroyed far
more retail jobs than they have created or saved in textile manufacturing.
Moreover, while some jobs were saved in the steel industry as a result of
import restrictions on foreign steel, far more jobs were destroyed in industries
that use steel. Import restrictions increased the prices of finished products that
use steel, forcing businesses to spend more money on raw materials than on
creating new jobs.8 In short, the higher prices paid for domestic steel drove up
the costs of automobiles, machine tools, and appliances, and these higher
production costs stifled job growth in these and other industries.9
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
  The driving force behind the Clinton Administration's threat of trade sanctions
against Japan and its other managed trade policies is a misguided belief that trade deficits are
harmful to the economy. Nothing could be further from the truth. Trade deficits are a sign of
strength. They often represent a growing economy in which jobs and wealth are being
created, not lost.
<p>
  Another myth that inspires the managed trade policies of the Clinton Administration
is that trade deficits are mainly the result of closed markets overseas. Not true. There are
many markets for U.S. goods and services overseas. In fact, the U.S. is the largest exporter in
the world.
<p>
  The Clinton Administration misunderstands America's position in the international
economy. It has wrongly assessed America's massive export strength. It has wrongly   
assessed the implications of America's trade deficit. And it has wrongly assessed the reasons
why Japan has a trade surplus. As a result of these misjudgments, the Administration has
adopted a managed trade policy toward Japan and other countries that could threaten the
wealth and prosperity of all Americans. This is a high price to pay for a belief in myths.

INTRODUCTION

<P>Congress is considering legislation to reauthorize the Clean
Water Act, passed in 1972 to clean up the nation's rivers, lakes, and
streams. (The forerunner of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act,
as the Clean Water Act also is known, was passed in 1948 as the Water
Pollution Control Act of 1948, Public Law 809-845. The Clean Water
Act's structure is much different, but built upon the 1948
foundation.) One of the key issues being debated is federal wetlands
policy. In practice, the Clean Water Act is being used as a
legislative vehicle to restrict any disturbance of wetlands, even
though wetlands are not mentioned in the legislation.

<P>Wetlands can be defined very loosely as lands that are wet, such
as swamps, and their protection has long been a politically
contentious issue. Although the Administration recently claimed that
its new proposal "broke the gridlock on wetlands policy," ("Highlights
of the Clinton Administration's Environmental Accomplishments,"
released by the White House April 21, 1994.) its claim is far from
accurate; the controversy continues unabated, in large part because of
the confusing and onerous nature of existing wetland policy.
Specifically:

There is great doubt whether the executive branch is authorized to
protect wetlands under the Clean Water Act as currently written.

The official definition of what constitutes a wetland uses a one-size-
fits-all approach, has fluctuated frequently, and has been overly
broad.

Disagreement exists over whether the nation already has achieved its
wetland goal of "no net loss" in light of evidence that in 1994 there
will be a wetlands net gain of nearly 60,000 acres.
<P>
The government consistently has refused to compensate property owners
for the lost value of land when, to preserve wetlands, owners are
denied the right to develop or use their land.

<P>Congress should address these problems in its consideration of
the Clean Water Act and in subsequent legislation. Failure to do so
will mean continued and valid charges of injustice in federal policy,
and the resulting lawsuits will continue to clog the court system.
Equally important, failure will mean that the nation's scarce economic
resources will continue to be misdirected to low-priority
environmental problems. Specifically, Congress should:
<P>
1)   State clearly in the Clean Water Act reauthorization that
     protection is limited to water pollution and that wetlands are
     not protected under the Act.
<P>
2)   Decide whether wetlands should be protected for their own sake.
     If the answer is yes, a separate Wetlands Protection Act should
     be passed that provides clear authority to the executive branch
     to regulate wetlands for their ecological value. This new Act
     should require the executive branch to define different
     categories of wetlands according to their ecological structure
     and value. The categorization should include the economic value
     of land, to ensure that the country obtains the "biggest bang for
     every environmental buck."
<P>
3)   Require a Presidential Report to Congress detailing a county-by-
     county breakdown of the number of acres being converted from
     wetlands to productive use and the number of acres being restored
     to wetland status, highlighting any conflicts in the current
     government wetland data.
<P>
4)   Require the government to pay landowners that are denied the
     right to use their land the fair market value -- plus 15 percent
     -- of the rights taken. This additional premium would compensate
     owners on average for their inconvenience and for the lost
     personal value of their land. Additionally, it would discourage
     highly disruptive government actions that are only marginally
     beneficial. (See footnote 41 for a discussion of why a premium is
     needed.)

 <P>    If these solutions are not enacted, America will continue to
misspend its resources pursuing a misguided policy on wetlands
protection that it is not clearly authorized by law to regulate. And
irate landowners will continue to oppose government wetland policy
because of its fundamentally unfair nature. Wetlands protection should
not be an issue clogging the courts. It needs instead to be addressed
properly and definitively by Congress.
<P>
     
ACTION ON CAPITOL HILL

 <P>    Congress is having difficulty reauthorizing the Clean Water Act
because of the varied and complex issues surrounding the law. In
addition to dealing with the heated wetlands controversy, Congress is
considering how best to control what is known technically as "non-
point source pollution," or pollution that enters waterways from no
specific source, such as from agricultural run-off. These issues have
slowed considerably the progress toward reauthorization. 

<P>     The Senate Clean Water bill reported by the Environment and
Public Works Committee (S. 2093), which is the rewrite of S.1114 and
S. 1304, is co-sponsored by Senators Max Baucus (D-MT), Chairman of
the Environment and Public Works Committee, and John Chafee (R-RI),
ranking Republican on the same committee. (S. 2093 is a substitute
bill that combined the substantive provisions of S. 1114 and S. 1304
as well as other minor bills. Thus, it was reported as an original
bill.) Unfortunately, the bill does little of substance to solve the
major problems with current wetland policy. Significantly, it does
confer legislative authority on the executive branch to regulate
wetlands. But this authority would do far more harm than good unless
the other major problems listed above are addressed as well.

<P>     At this time, the status of the bill's consideration is
uncertain. Although Chairman Baucus has indicated he intends to bring
the bill to the floor as soon as possible, significant opposition may
forestall that step. One indication of this is a bipartisan letter to
Baucus in late April from 46 Senators detailing their extensive
substantive problems with S. 1114 (now incorporated in S. 2093),
including its failure to address key wetland reforms. (Specifically,
the letter states that "S.1114 fails to address needed wetland reform.
Prior converted wetlands should be excluded, regardless of the crop
grown. Agricultural lands cropped a majority of the time should be
excluded from jurisdiction. Classification of wetlands should be
established....We also have concerns with the following issues:...
prior converted wetlands, agricultural lands definition, definitions
for pollutant and discharge.... " Letter to The Honorable Max Baucus
from 46 Senators (bipartisan), April 25, 1994.) Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell, however, has indicated he will move forward with the
present bill despite these concerns.

<P>     On the House side, Representative Norman Mineta (D-CA), Chairman
of the Public Works and Transportation Committee, is sponsoring that
chamber's version of reauthorization legislation (H.R.3948). The bill,
introduced on March 3, originally ignored the wetland issue but has
been changed in fundamental ways by Chairman Mineta with little input
from Committee members. Although it now includes a wetland provision
providing legislative authority for regulation, like the Baucus bill
it still lacks the fundamental reforms needed.

 <P>    The House bill has been as controversial as the Senate version
because there were no hearings before mark-up originally was scheduled
for May 3. Chairman Mineta, however, did not have the votes to send
the bill out of committee. Also, Members in May circulated a
"Discussion Draft Bi-partisan Alternative" to H.R. 3948 that would
address many of the problems now existing in Clean Water Act and
wetland policy. Under pressure from his committee members, and because
of the possibility an alternative bill might succeed, Chairman Mineta
consented to hearings just days before the intended May 3 mark-up,
which was postponed until after hearings are concluded.

<P>     An important bill that is substantially incorporated in the
alternative proposal is H.R.1330, sponsored by Representative James
Hayes (D-LA). The Hayes bill would require the Army Corps of Engineers
to classify wetlands according to their ecological value. During
hearings, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner
stated that several of the alternative bill's provisions "would be
detrimental to wetlands protection." (Speaking before the Committee on
Public Works and Transportation's Water Resources and Environment
Subcommittee on May 24, 1994. Technically, the Administrator did not
address herself to the alternative bill, but the specific issues that
she addressed are the core wetlands provisions in the alternative
bill.) Specifically, she opposed plans to categorize and rank
wetlands, change wetlands delineation criteria, and pay owners for
government purchase of high-value wetlands.

<P>     Another important House bill concerning wetlands (H.R.3875) is
sponsored by W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (D-LA), who calls his bill the
"private property owners' Bill of Rights" because it mandates
compensation to landowners when government action to protect wetlands
or endangered species results in a fifty percent reduction in property
value. While this bill is not tied to the Clean Water Act
reauthorization, it has gained widespread support in the policy
community. Opposition to the Tauzin bill also has mounted, making
action doubtful at this time.

<P>
FUNDAMENTALS OF WETLAND POLICY

 <P>    Wetlands, traditionally known as swamps or bogs, have been
disappearing at a rapid rate during this century. The fundamental
reason for their disappearance earlier in the century is also the
reason for efforts to protect them now: wetlands or swamps are unique
ecosystems. Wetlands are valued by many Americans for the very
practical reason that they can act as a buffer against flooding and
can purify streams and rivers, in addition to providing a home for
diverse species of wildlife. Others despise wetlands as "mosquito-
infested swamps," and indeed they typically are breeding grounds for
disease-carrying mosquitoes. Historically, the vast majority of
Americans have fallen into the latter group and have supported efforts
to eradicate wetlands, but increased public recognition of the
positive qualities of some wetlands in recent decades has led to
demands for preservation.

<P>     Ironically, the organization in the United States most
responsible for destroying these swamps is now the primary
organization charged with their protection -- the Army Corps of
Engineers. In 1780, before the Corps' systematic campaign to fill in
wetlands, there were 221 million acres of wetlands in the lower
continental United States. Today only an estimated 104 million acres
are left. ("Wetlands Losses in the United States 1780's to 1980's,"
U.S. Department of Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1990.)
The Corps has taken on the mission of wetland protection as one of its
primary activities and, in conjunction with the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), zealously punishes violators of its
complicated regulations. For example, Bill Ellen, an environmental
engineer and consultant, inadvertently violated federal wetlands
regulations in 1988 by making duck ponds on his employer's privately
owned wildlife preserve. He paid for this error by being jailed as a
felon four years later. His case is not unique.

 <P>    Under federal regulations as now written, a landowner intending
to build on, clear, or otherwise disturb wetlands must obtain
permission from the EPA and the Corps through a permit application
process. (Sections 301 and 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control
Act, as amended.) If the permit is denied or carries conditions, the
landowner cannot use his property as he intended. Thus, for example,
if an application for a permit to alter a wetland in order to
construct a duck pond or building were denied, the landowner would be
an owner in name only. (The owner would have title to the land, and
would pay taxes on land, but would not in practice be able to use the
land. The landowner, however, still would retain the right to exclude
others from his property. While this retained right can have value if
the land is close to a home or for a similar reason, in the absence of
the right to beneficial use, this right to exclude is frequently
worthless. Counties increasingly are taking this decreased value into
account in terms of property taxes. In Anchorage, Alaska, for example,
the value of an acre of non-usable wetlands is deemed to be $100. This
has the effect of reducing local taxes significantly. Yet, while it
relieves the burden of the owner from paying high taxes on worthless
property, the productive value of the property is lost. Thus, the
local economy loses both economic value and tax revenues.)

<P>     Since the inception of wetland protection, many fundamental
problems and issues have arisen which have caused a growing backlash
against the EPA and the Corps, as well as against environmentalists.
(The backlash against environmentalists has occurred because they are
perceived correctly as driving the government's increasingly strict
wetlands policy. Moreover, they have lobbied actively against payments
to landowners when their land is taken on the premise that it would
cost too much. But there is a cost either way to taking the land; the
only question is who pays the cost.) Traditionally, environmental laws
regulate bigger firms by mandating that they use certain
"environmentally friendly" technologies or meet specific standards
when conducting large-scale operations. The Clean Water Act, for the
most part, uses this same regulatory structure designed for big
business, but under recent wetland policy, the Act's structure also
applies to smaller landowners.

<P>The Clean Water Act has been enlarged through statutory
interpretation to authorize the federal government to regulate anyone
who wishes to use his land if that land is found to meet the
government's definition of a wetland. Thus, homeowners, small
entrepreneurs and developers, and retirees hoping to build their dream
homes all have come under the direct authority of EPA and the Corps.
Essentially, ordinary Americans have been forced to deal with legal
requirements designed for businesses with lawyers on staff or
retainer. But what is an irritation for a large firm can be a costly
legal nightmare for a small landowner, and many of those complying
with requirements lose valuable rights when the federal government
denies them permission to alter their own land. Faced with heavy
mortgage notes on now nearly worthless land, many of those affected
have joined in a growing grass-roots movement to combat what they view
as heavy-handed and legally unauthorized federal actions. (In many of
these cases, the owners cannot simply abandon the mortgage note
because the land affected is generally only a portion of the whole
property. Thus, the regulated owner may own a home on the same site
that also acts as security on the note. Even when the note could be
abandoned, this merely transfers the economic loss to another
individual or firm.) 

<P>In any serious discussion of wetland policy, four issues are of
paramount importance.
<P>
ISSUE #1:  The "Law" That Is Not A Law

<P>The first issue is the apparent lack of legislative authority
under existing law for current executive branch policy on wetlands
protection. The Clean Water Act does not protect explicitly any
wetland; in fact, neither the word "wetland" nor any synonym is
mentioned or implied in the language of the Clean Water Act. Thus, on
its face, the Act authorizes no federal protection of wetlands.
Section 404, the center of the controversy, prohibits the "discharge
of dredged or fill material into the navigable waters" of the United
States unless a permit for such activity is issued. (33 U.S.C.A. sec.
1344; Permits for dredged or fill material, FWPCA sec. 404.) According
to the wording of this clause, Congress clearly intended to limit the
ability of individuals to choke waterways that were navigable by
limiting the practice of dumping dirt into them. By requiring
governmental permission, Congress ensured that navigation remained
clear for boat traffic.

<P>The clause, however, has been broadly interpreted by the Army
Corps of Engineers, the Environmental Protection Agency, and other
agencies to prohibit virtually any activity in connection with land
that has a certain minimum water content -- whether or not it is
navigable. The ostensible justification for this position is that any
form of pollutant, including clean fill dirt, that comes into contact
with wet soil will make its way via ground water flows into navigable
waterways. While minute quantities can make their way into navigable
waterways, this rationale has been stretched so far that the
government now considers any mechanical disturbance, such as
bulldozing of soil already naturally in the wetland, to be a violation
of the Clean Water Act. But Congress never intended to prevent such
minor movements of soil. Indeed, the legislative history of the
original Act shows that not a single Congressman voiced support for
the strained interpretation the executive branch now reads into it.
Not a single lawmaker even uttered the word "wetland."

<P>Nevertheless, it is arguable that certain kinds of wetland are
protected under the Clean Water Act. (For an in depth and thorough
treatise on the question of wetland protection authority, see William
G. Laffer III, "The Meaning and Scope of the Clean Water Act, and
Especially Section 404, As Applied To Wetlands," February 14, 1992
(revising original dated January 21, 1991. Comments filed with EPA
pursuant to 56 Fed. Reg. 40446.)) The legislative history may provide
some rationale for supporters of current protection in its discussion
of "navigable waters," a term used to specify the type of waterways
the overall Clean Water Act was meant to regulate. ( Courts often rely
on formal comments by Congressmen during the legislative process to
assist them in their determination of the meaning of specific
provisions of laws. The effort is based on the presumption that the
legislative record provides evidence of what meanings were intended by
Congress as a whole when it passed the law. A major problem with
reliance on legislative history, however, is that comments in the
record virtually never reflect the views of all those who vote on the
issue. Hence, the record may inaccurately reflect and even contradict
congressional understanding. The legislative record is useful,
however, to demonstrate that the common understanding of clear and
plain language was not contradicted during debate. See William N.
Eskridge, Jr. and Philip P. Frickey, Legislation: Statutes and the
Creation of Public Policy, American Casebook Series (St. Paul,
Minn.:West Publishing Co., 1988).) In presenting the Conference
version of the Clean Water bill to the House, Representative John
Dingell (D-MI), who was a member of the Conference Committee,
explained that:
<UL>
     the conference bill defines the term "navigable waters"
     broadly for water quality purposes.... Thus, this new
     definition clearly encompasses all water bodies, including
     main streams and their tributaries, for water quality
     purposes.... No longer are the old, narrow definitions...
     going to govern. (1 Legislative History 250 (House
     Consideration of S. Conf. Rep. No. 1236, 92d Cong., 2d
     Sess.) (Oct. 4, 1972) (emphasis added).)</UL>

<P>While this statement and others in the record indicate that
navigability should be construed broadly, this extension of the term
still was meant to apply only to waters that drain or flow into
navigable waters. The legislative history shows the focus of the
definition was to widen the requirement that directly affected waters
be those navigable by vessels. More precisely, the term was broadened
specifically to prevent the migration of pollutants to navigable
waterways from tributaries. ("Water moves[,]... and it is [therefore]
essential that discharge of pollutants be controlled at the source.
Therefore, reference to the control requirements [of the Act] must be
made to the navigable waters, portions thereof, and their tributaries.
S. Rep. No. 414, 92d Cong., 1st Sess. 77 (1971), reprinted in 2
Legislative History 1945.)

<P>Although it is possible to stretch that meaning to encompass some
wetlands, not all wetlands can contribute pollutants to navigable
waters. Most crucially, isolated wetlands which do not interact with
waters flowing into navigable waterways (technically known as "non-
adjacent wetlands") cannot by any stretch of interpretation fall under
the Act because there is no possibility a pollutant can enter a
waterway. (The factors that would have to be present for a wetland to
be legitimately covered under the Clean Water Act are, at a minimum:
1) a discharged material; 2) through drainage or flow via either
ground water or surface water; 3) could migrate to an interstate
water. Even this interpretation of the extent of authority is likely
overreaching and broad since section 404 refers specifically to dredge
and fill material.) Indeed, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in
May 1994 held that pollutants are not covered under the Act even if
they can migrate to navigable waters via ground water. The court
indicated that pollutants were covered only if they could migrate via
surface waters to navigable waterways. (Oconomowoc Lake v. Dayton
Hudson Corp., Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 93-3380, May 18,
1994.)

<P>In short, the Act was intended to reduce pollution at its source,
not to protect wetlands per se. (See Laffer, "Meaning and Scope," op.
cit. A final important argument is that Congress does not have the
authority to regulate intrastate wetlands that have no intercourse
with interstate waters because these rights are reserved to the
states. The Supreme Court, however, routinely grants such authority
under the Commerce clause. U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 8,
clause 3. While the judicial reasoning behind the Court's
interpretation of the Commerce clause is fatally flawed, it
nevertheless remains the law of the land. See Wickard v. Filburn, 317
U.S. 111, 63 S.Ct. 82, 87 L.Ed. 122 (1942).) If an activity would not
produce pollution downstream in a truly navigable water by fostering
migration of pollutants through surface water tributaries, it should
not fall under the authority of the law as written.

<P>Despite their highly questionable authority to regulate wetlands,
the Corps and the EPA have issued regulations restricting any wetland
interference without permission, which averages over a year to obtain
and often is not granted. Despite numerous court challenges,
enforcement of these regulations largely has been supported by the
courts. But this support has not been uniform. (See Oconomowoc, op.
cit.) Moreover, since the Supreme Court has yet to address the issue
squarely, the issue remains unsettled, which merely fuels further
litigation. (The Supreme Court did decide, in a case dealing with
adjacent wetlands, that the term navigable did not require the water
actually be navigable, but rather only that, from water, a pollutant
could flow into navigable waters. United States v. Riverside Bayview
Homes, Inc., 474 U.S. 121 (1985). This is consistent with the
discussion preceding the accompanying text.)
Recommendation: Given the executive branch's murky authority to
protect wetlands under the Clean Water Act, Congress should decide
legislatively whether wetlands as such should be protected.
In either case, Congress should add a provision during reauthorization
specifically limiting Section 404 to its original purpose of
regulating dredge and fill material, and not protecting wetlands for
their own sake. If Congress also wants to protect wetlands for their
own sake, it should enact separate legislation that consolidates all
wetlands policy and legislation. Thus all enforcement, mitigation, and
restoration programs intended to promote wetlands should be made part
of a "Wetlands Policy Act." Such a new law also should contain relief
measures for landowners once the Bush-Clinton goal of no-net-loss is
achieved (see below).
<P>
ISSUE #2: The Problem Of Definition

<P>The second issue is simply one of definition: what exactly is a
"wetland"? Although this would appear to be a relatively simple
matter, it has proven much more difficult for experts to define than
most people would imagine. Hence the ridicule when former Vice
President Dan Quayle questioned "how wet" land had to be under the
Act. Quayle understood this complicated environmental issue while his
detractors did not. The problem of defining what is a wetland was
characterized succinctly by Robert Pierce of the Army Corps of
Engineers in the National Wetlands Newsletter:
<UL>
     Ecologically speaking, the term "wetland" has no meaning:
     natural systems exist on a hydrolic gradient from ocean to
     desert. Somewhere in the middle are what society calls
     wetlands. For regulatory purposes, a wetland is whatever we
     decide it is. The type of natural systems that have been
     defined as wetlands has changed virtually every year for the
     last decade. (CEI Update (Competitive Enterprise
     Institute),Vol. 7, No. 4, citing Robert J. Pierce,
     "Redefining Our Regulatory Goals," National Wetlands
     Newsletter, November/December 1991, p. 12.)</UL>

<P>Not only has the definition of what is or is not a wetland
changed over time, but the definitions often have been overly broad.
As Senator David Pryor (D-AR) stated last year, "one definition would
designate the entire eastern half of Arkansas to be a wetland and any
activity -- be it for commercial, agricultural, or other purposes --
could be considered breaking the law." ("Wetlands Caucus Created in
Senate," EPA WATCH, August 31, 1993, p. 3.)

<P>Such disagreements as to what constitutes wetlands and how
broadly they should be defined have caused the government to change
its official definition twice since former President Bush made his "no
net loss of wetlands" pledge during the 1988 presidential campaign.
(Bill Peterson, "Bush Vows to Fight Pollution, Install 'Conservation
Ethic'; Speech Distances Candidate From Reagan," The Washington Post,
September 1, 1988, p. A1.) At that time, the 1987 Wetlands Delineation
Manual specified the official definition of a wetland. (Federal Manual
for Identifying and Delineating Jurisdictional Wetlands (1987).)

<P>Fundamental changes in this standard were made in 1989, however,
when President Bush's new appointees decided to broaden the definition
of a wetland. This new definition was severely criticized as
overreaching any reasonable definition of land that is wet. By some
estimates, 40 percent of drought-stricken California (even before the
winter rains of 1992-1993) would have qualified as wetlands under the
1989 standard. (Rick Henderson, "The Swamp Thing," Reason, April 1991.
pp. 32-33.) The 1989 Delineation Manual stayed in effect until 1992,
when an appropriations amendment sponsored by Senator Bennett Johnston
(D-LA) limited funding to enforcement of the 1987 standard. In effect,
the 1989 standard was put on the shelf. Although the definition issue
was re-evaluated yet again by the Clinton Administration, the White
House decided to let the 1987 definition stand temporarily.

<P>     Basically, three factors are considered when determining whether
an area is a wetland under the 1987, 1989, and other definitions:
<P>
1)   The number of days land is inundated or saturated with water;
<P>
2)   Whether the area has hydric soil, or "earth that is chemically
     changed by water, usually with a peat, muck, or mineral base;"
     (Richard Miniter, "Muddy Waters: The Quagmire of Wetlands
     Regulation," Policy Review, Spring 1991, p. 72.) and 
<P>
3)   Whether the area has one of approximately 7,000 "indicator"
     species of plants growing on it.

<P>     Most of the problems in defining a wetland have arisen not from
disagreements over the appropriate factors, but over how many factors
must exist and to what degree. For instance, should two or all three
factors exist for a given site to be classified as a wetland? How many
days should it be saturated with water and to what depth? 

<P>Much of the problem with both the 1987 and 1989 Delineation
Manuals has centered on the "one-size-fits-all" approach to wetlands
designation. Ecological systems by nature are typically varied in
their structure, sensitivity, and ecological and economic value. These
considerations, currently neglected in forming decisions, (There is
some limited flexibility in the 1987 Wetlands Delineation Manual, but
this flexibility cuts both ways; an EPA regional office has the
flexibility to ignore mitigating factors in its decision making
process.) should be given utmost attention whenever a determination is
made as to whether a particular site should be declared a wetland and
preserved or declared a "dry" land with no restrictions against
development (or even declared a wetland that should be developed
anyway because the economic value in a specific situation far
outweighs its limited ecological value).
<P>
Recommendation: If Congress wants to extend protection to wetlands
   legislatively, the Wetlands Protection Act should require the Army
   Corps of Engineers to classify lands according to their ecological
   value.

<P>Wetlands would be divided into classes, such as "A," "B," "C,"
etc. Government would be authorized to acquire only those with the
highest ecological value (class "A"), which would merit the highest
degree of protection. Lower categories or classes could be given
lesser degrees of protection. (Congressman James Hayes' bill,
H.R.1330, would put just such a system into place by dividing wetlands
into three categories and requiring payment to affected landowners in
Class "A" wetlands.) This would avoid the inherent waste of spending
scarce economic resources on relatively unimportant low-value wetlands
and enable the country to target its efforts toward protection of more
valuable ecosystems. Moreover, since the government would be obligated
to purchase only the highest-valued wetland property, its intrusion
into the personal affairs of middle-class Americans would be kept to a
minimum.
<P>
ISSUE #3: Wetland Gains and Losses

<P>The third issue centers on whether wetland protection legislation
is necessary at all. (For a more detailed, but concise treatment of
this topic, see Jonathan Tolman, "Gaining Ground: Analysis of Wetland
Trends in the United States," Washington, D.C.,Competitive Enterprise
Institute, May 1994.) Despite the statement last year by EPA
Administrator Carol Browner that nearly 300,000 acres of wetland are
lost annually, 300,000 acres are not being lost. (Ibid., citing USA
Today, August 25, 1993.) Her estimates are based on figures over a
decade old. (This figure reflects the annual loss rate of 290,000
estimated for the 1974-1983 period, see T.E. Dahl and C.E. Johnson,
Status and Trends of Wetlands in the Coterminous United States,
Mid-1970's to Mid-1980's, U.S. Department of Interior, Fish and
Wildlife Service, Washington, D.C., 1991.) More recent data suggest a
much different picture. Based on government figures, a recent study by
Jonathan Tolman of the Competitive Enterprise Institute estimates that
America will have 59,000 more acres of wetlands at the end of 1994
than it did at the beginning. (Tolman, op. cit.)

<P>Tolman's estimate does not imply that wetlands no longer are
converted to productive use such as agriculture or development
(although the loss rate has slowed), but rather that wetland
restoration has increased significantly. The most recent data
available on wetland conversion rates were compiled by the Department
of Agriculture's Soil Conservation Service as part of its National
Resources Inventory, which is updated every five years. (U.S.
Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, 1991 Update of
National Resources Inventory, Wetlands Data For Non-Federal Rural
Lands, Iowa State University Statistical Laboratory.) Unfortunately,
the Administration and groups calling for preservation of wetlands
have not made a point of publicizing the results, perhaps because the
results do not support their cause: the data show that wetland
conversion is slowing. From 1982-1987, the annual loss rate was
131,000 acres, significantly less than estimated by the Department of
Interior for the previous decade. Moreover, the loss rate slowed even
more from 1987-1991, when only 108,000 acres were lost annually.

<P>The rate of increase in wetland restoration, on the other hand,
has been dramatic in recent years, not because of the Clean Water
Act's prohibitions, but because of incentives to private landowners
under three other programs: the Partners for Wildlife program, the
Conservation Reserve Program, and the Wetlands Reserve Program. These
three programs, which are designed to encourage landowners to create
new wetlands, are responsible for the restoration of over 560,000
acres over the last seven years, and the annual rate has been
increasing. Based on annual trends and restoration authorizations,
Tolman estimates that in 1994 a total of 167,000 acres will be
restored -- compared with only 108,000 acres lost -- for a net gain of
59,000 acres of wetland. (Tolman, op. cit. The study contains good
charts illustrating this trend line, as well as more information on
the particulars of the wetlands restoration programs. Note that the
108,000 acres converted figure is probably conservative since the
trend, at least for agricultural conversions, has been downward. Thus,
the net gain figure is likely understated.)
Recommendation: Congress should require a presidential report
outlining all known information on wetland conversion and restoration.
This report should present a breakdown of conversions and restorations
on a county-by-county, state-by-state basis. Contradictory government
data should be highlighted and relevant considerations discussed.
Whenever discrepancies in the data exist, the report should show the
range of conversion and restoration estimates based on all data. The
report should be updated yearly. Moreover, if a "Wetlands Protection
Act" is considered necessary, Congress should incorporate a provision
giving relief to landowners from denial of permits to use their land
if in any consecutive two years there is a net gain of wetland acres.
Landowners, after all, should not be denied the fruits of their labor
if their actions will not result in a reduction of the "wetland
stock."
<P>
ISSUE #4: Whose Property Is It, Anyway?

<P>The fourth issue concerns the de facto taking of property through
regulation, known popularly as "regulatory takings," that now occurs
under regulation of wetlands and other property. (For in depth
research and clear analysis of constitutional issues surrounding
regulatory takings, see the book by Mark Pollot, Grand Theft and Petit
Larceny: Property Rights in America (San Francisco: Pacific Research
Institute, 1993). Pollot also authored Executive Order 12630, signed
during the Reagan Administration, that requires agencies to do a
Takings Impact Analysis (TIA); essentially, the agencies are required
to consider the potential that their actions will result in a taking
of property requiring just compensation and, where alternatives to
achieve the statutory goal exist, to adopt the alternative least
intrusive to the landowner.) One of the most unfair and burdensome
hardships inflicted by regulatory takings is that wetland owners are
not reimbursed for their loss. For instance, if an elderly couple
spends a large portion of their retirement savings to buy property to
build their dream home and that property is subsequently designated a
wetland, the value of their property -- and their savings -- is gone.
Unfortunately, tales of financial hardship caused by government
designation of lands as wetlands have become commonplace.

<P>The Administration is on record as opposing payments to
landowners whose property is designated a wetland. Office of
Management and Budget Director Leon Panetta says it would be "an
unnecessary and unwise use of taxpayer dollars" and a drain on the
federal budget. (Speaking at a hearing before the Committee on Public
Works and Transportation's Subcommittee on Water Resources and
Environment, U.S. House of Representatives, May 26, 1994.) Landowners
counter that regulatory takings are a drain on the family budget.
(Often ignored in the debate is that many families have mortgages on
the regulated land. While the regulated portions of their land may
become almost worthless, these families must continue to make large
mortgage payments or lose their homes situated on unregulated land
financed by the same mortgage.) Wetlands regulation has evolved into a
question of whether constitutionally guaranteed property rights are
being infringed; and since the courts have been of limited help,
landowners are in need of legislative protection.

<P>To understand why legislative protection for landowners is
appropriate, it is necessary to understand the broader issue of
governmental taking of property. The Fifth Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution implicitly recognizes that the federal government may
take private property for public use. This power, known as eminent
domain, was recognized by the Supreme Court as early as 1795 in
Vanhorne's Lessee v. Dorrance when the court found that "the despotic
power, as it has been aptly called by some writers, of taking private
property, when state necessity requires it, exists in every
government... government could not subsist without it." (2 U.S. (2
Dall.) 304, 311 (1795).)

<P>The Fifth Amendment explicitly mandates, however, that government
must pay the property owner for the land confiscated. This concept,
embodied in the clause "nor shall private property be taken for public
use, without just compensation," ensures that property taken for
public use is paid for by those who benefit -- the public -- and not
by the citizen unfortunate enough to own land the government wants.
(Constitution of the United States, Amendment V, clause 3) In its most
basic sense, this is a fairness issue: Why should one American bear
the entire burden of the government's pursuit of a national good?

<P>The Founders well understood the positive economic consequences
of protecting owners' investments in their property. If property is to
be put to its best and most highly valued use, ownership must reside
in the hands of those who value it for as much or more than the fair
market value. (By definition, owners personally value their property
more highly than the government even when just compensation is paid
for an involuntary taking of land, or else the owner would have sold
it voluntarily. This "idiosyncratic" or subjective value by the owner
is real, but is a premium above the amount that could be obtained in a
fair market transaction. Due to this generally small discrepancy, even
when the government pays fair market value, it is purchasing the
property in a sense at a bargain price because the payment is less
than the value of the property to the seller. Nevertheless, since the
subjective value cannot be measured accurately, the objective standard
of fair market value properly should be paid as just compensation by
the government, with perhaps a fixed percentage of additional
compensation to offset the damage to the owner forcibly separated from
control of his land. A fair percentage would be perhaps 15 percent. Of
course, under this additional compensation arrangement, there would be
"winners" and "losers" in the sense that the 15 percent premium would
be more or less than the owner's subjective value compared with the
market price. But on average landowners would be more fairly
compensated and the government would be discouraged from taking
disruptive actions that are only marginally beneficial to the public.)
If government had a free hand to take property without payment, its
incentive to confiscate property that conferred only a small benefit
on the public would be large; after all, even small benefits outweigh
a zero cost. The problem is that costs are nonexistent only to the
government. The actual costs, borne by someone else, often are
substantial.

<P>Another positive result of requiring just compensation is
increased security. The Founders well understood that protection of
property restrained usurpation of other rights recognized by the
Constitution. It is this relationship to which Supreme Court Justice
Potter Stewart referred in Lynch v. Household Finance Co. Inc. when he
stated that there is a "fundamental interdependence... between the
personal right to liberty and the personal right to property." (405
U.S. 538, 552 (1972).)

<P>Practically speaking, governments can control a wide spectrum of
individual activities if they can control whether individuals remain
financially secure or must surrender their property. The majority
truly can tyrannize a disfavored minority if property rights are
uncertain. As James Madison characterized the problem of individual
rights in Federalist Paper No. 10, "it is that [pure] democracies have
ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been
incompatible with personal security or the rights of property." It was
to restrict just such tyranny over individuals that the Framers put
severe limits, such as the requirement of just compensation, on the
unchecked will of the majority. 

<P>The Supreme Court has been clear in requiring federal, state, and
local governments to pay just compensation whenever governmental
bodies physically take or occupy land or real estate. (The requirement
of just compensation by the federal government under the 5th Amendment
is extended to the states under the 14th Amendment. It also applies,
by further extension, to localities since their authority is derived
from the state.) Essentially, the Court has held that, even if only a
small amount of real property is involved, a taking has occurred and
just compensation is required. (Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV
Corp., 458 U.S. 419 (1982).) Unfortunately, however, the Court's
decisions regarding regulatory takings have been less clear and
consistent. One landmark case essentially found that if any
compensation was provided, whether at a just level or not, a taking
had not occurred. (Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City,
438 U.S. 104 (1978). This was one of many holdings in the case.) This
reasoning was faulty because the question of whether a property right
has been taken is independent of the issue of compensation, which by
definition can take place only if property has been taken or lost. If
a small payment negates the finding of a taking, it also would negate
the requirement of "just" compensation. (This is clearly absurd on its
face. Such a construction completely negates the effect of the just
compensation clause and, instead, substitutes the requirement of a
token payment.)

<P>The Supreme Court in recent years has begun slowly to move back
toward protection of property owners. (See First English Evangelical
Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, California, 482
U.S. 304, 96 L.Ed. 2d 250 (1987) (finding a temporary restriction on
property to be a taking) and Nollan v. California Coastal Commission,
107 S.Ct. 3141, 488 U.S. 825, 97 L. Ed. 2d 677 (finding that the
government could not engage in "extortion" by requiring a homeowner to
provide public access to the beach in order to get a permit to build a
second story on his bungalow. The Court found that there was an
insufficient nexus between the Coastal Commission's mission of
protecting the coastal view and providing public access to the
beach).) In its most recent regulatory taking case, Lucas v. South
Carolina Coastal Council, (Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council,
505 U.S. ____, 120 L. Ed. 2d 798, 112 S.Ct. 2886 (1992).) the Court in
1992 found that a regulation prohibiting property use which also
destroyed 100 percent of the property's value was a taking requiring
just compensation. The Court, however, specifically declined to
address the issue of whether anything less than a complete devaluation
was a taking. (Essentially, the Court makes the same mistake here as
it did in Penn Central in defining a property right as being its
value. Simply put, property rights are fixed legal rights of an
individual to use and enjoy property. Since property can be used in
many different ways, there are consequently many different rights the
individual owns. For instance, an owner of land can sell an easement
to a neighbor allowing the neighbor to walk across the land, yet
retain all other rights to that land himself. By focusing on the value
of the rights infringed rather than on the substance of the rights
denied to an owner, the court confuses fixed legal rights with the
ever fluctuating fair market value of those rights. The value of the
rights taken certainly is important in determining the level of
compensation that is just, but it is irrelevant in determining whether
a legal right has been taken in the first place. The Supreme Court
heard its most recent property rights case, Dolan v. Tigard, on March
23, 1994. The case centered on whether the City of Tigard could
condition the issuance of a permit for store expansion on Dolan's
relinquishing of title to land; for a greenway and a bicycle path to
be constructed at Dolan's expense. The decision is expected this
summer.) Thus, it is uncertain whether the government must compensate
owners when the property retains, say, 20 percent of its previous fair
market value.
<P>
Recommendation: In light of the ambiguous and limited protection
   against uncompensated regulatory takings, a Private Property
   Protection Act is necessary to ensure private property rights are
   fully protected.

<P>If the government infringes any property right by denying an
owner use of his own land, the affected landowner should be given the
full fair market value of any reduction in the value of his property.
While any devaluation should be compensated, the Act should specify
that a 25 percent devaluation of real property after an infringing
governmental action is a presumptive taking requiring full
compensation for the value of the land taken. (The Act should include
a section that a taking has not occurred if the governmental action is
to abate a nuisance as defined by background principles of common law
within the state the property is situated.) The owner also should be
allowed to elect payment for the entire value of the regulated land --
rather than just the reduction in value -- if he forfeits title to the
government. (It is important to note that this provision should apply
only to land directly affected by the governmental action, including
permit denial, and would not allow the property owner to demand
payment for the value of acreage not affected by the regulatory
action. If the owner does not elect to forfeit his title, the
government should pay only the differential between the fair market
value prior to and after the regulatory taking since no additional
rights have been condemned and compensated.)  These provisions will
constrain judicial latitude and thus minimize the possibility of
misguided judicial interpretation limiting protection to property
owners.

<P>Moreover, a 15 percent premium over fair market value should be
paid. This premium roughly would compensate owners for their
inconvenience and for the lost personal value of their land. (See note
41 for a discussion of why a premium is needed.) It also would reduce
highly disruptive actions that are only marginally beneficial to the
government.


CONCLUSION

Unfortunately, the wetland policy that has emerged in recent years is
fraught with problems that have contributed to a growing backlash from
property owners. While the issues are many and varied, four basic
problems have fueled the controversy. First, clear legislative
authority to protect wetlands as wetlands is lacking in law. Second, a
one-size-fits-all definition of what constitutes a wetland is used but
is crude and inappropriate. Third, new evidence has shown that America
has met its no-net-loss of wetlands goal and more wetland acres are
being restored than lost. Fourth, landowners whose valuable property
rights are infringed to pursue this public benefit are not compensated
for their loss.

<P>Each of these problems can be solved. For example, the lack of
legislative authority to protect "wetlands as wetlands" can be dealt
with by clarifying that Section 404 of the Clean Water Act is not
intended to protect wetlands. If protection of "wetlands as wetlands"
is desired, a Wetlands Protection Act should be passed to encompass
all federal efforts to maintain the current number of wetlands,
including restoration of wetlands as well as efforts to slow wetland
losses. This Act also should require the Army Corps of Engineers to
classify wetlands according to their ecological value so that the
nation's economic resources are not squandered on land that is of
little ecological significance. Moreover, it may be unnecessary to
limit the private development of wetlands at all in light of new
evidence that the nation likely will gain almost 60,000 net acres of
wetlands due to increased restoration. Congress can answer the charges
of unfairness by landowners who have seen their life savings destroyed
by onerous wetlands regulations simply by requiring the government to
pay for the value of the land it takes.

<P>Although the Clean Water Act never was designed as a vehicle to
protect wetlands, it has evolved into a regulatory nightmare for
ordinary Americans who simply want to use their land as they intended
when they took out a mortgage on their property. If Americans still
believe in the basic concepts upon which this nation was built --
liberty, opportunity, and the right to reap the rewards of hard effort
-- they must reverse the current wetland policy of essentially
confiscating land from the nation's most productive and valuable
citizens.

<p>


     The National Endowment for Democracy (NED), which spearheads
American efforts to foster democracy throughout the world, is in
danger of being dismantled. The House of Representatives on June 22
voted 243 to 181 to approve an amendment to the State Department
authorization bill that would eliminate the Clinton Administration's
$50 million fiscal 1994 budget request for the NED. The NED's future
now is in the hands of the Senate. 
<P>
     The Senate should reverse the House's shortsighted action and
restore NED funding. The NED is a dynamic, flexible, and cost-
effective means of furthering U.S. interests by promoting the
development of stable democracies in strategically important parts of
the world. The U.S. cannot afford to disarm unilaterally in the
international war of ideas.
<P>
     The NED's Role. The National Endowment for Democracy is a
private, non-profit organization established by Congress in 1983 to
strengthen democratic institutions and foster democratic values
throughout the world. Through its grant program, NED enlists the help
of private American groups to assist democratic reformers abroad. It
is active in almost 100 countries, working through some 75 American
grant recipients, including NED's four "core" institutions, the Center
for International Private Enterprise, the Free Trade Union Institute,
the International Republican Institute, and the National Democratic
Institute for International Affairs.

     The NED has played a vital role in providing aid to democratic
movements in the former Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, China, Cuba,
Iran, Iraq, Nicaragua, Vietnam, and elsewhere. It has dispatched
experts to help emerging democracies assemble the building blocks
necessary to sustain a stable democratic system: representative
political parties, a free market economy, independent trade unions,
and a free press. NED-affiliated advisers help formulate election
laws, train poll workers, monitor elections, and teach activists how
to build political parties.
<P>
     Critics of the NED claim that the NED is no longer needed because
of the collapse of Soviet communism. They neglect the fact that
communist dictatorships still control China, Cuba, North Korea, and
Vietnam. Moreover, ex-communists masquerading as nationalists continue
to dominate several of the Soviet successor states. The NED can play
an important role in assisting those countries in making the turbulent
transition to democracy. 
<P>
     The NED's job is far from over. More than half the world's people
live under authoritarian rule today. While communism has collapsed in
many countries, democracy will take many years to become firmly
rooted. Moreover, democracy is not the inevitable outcome of political
evolution in post-communist societies. Economic difficulties,
international conflicts, and the emergence of long-repressed ethnic,
national, political, and social tensions could trigger backlashes
against democratic reforms and generate significant setbacks for
democracy. After all, the Russian Bolsheviks and German Nazis both
seized power after their countries undertook abortive democratic
experiments. 
<P>
     The NED's role in consolidating the potentially fragile gains of
democratic reformers remains especially important. The reason:
Backsliding in one or more of the post-communist societies moving
toward democracy could encourage authoritarian movements in other
societies to escalate their opposition to democracy.
<P>
     The Clinton Administration: Asleep at the Switch. Ironically, the
NED's existence is threatened by Congress at the same time that the
Clinton Administration is trumpeting the importance of democracy in
American foreign policy. The Administration requested a $20 million
increase in the NED budget for fiscal 1994. Yet when the NED's very
existence was jeopardized in the June 22 vote in the House, Roll Call
reported that the Administration deployed only one lobbyist to defend
it. If the Administration expects its rhetorical commitment to foster
democracy to be taken seriously, it now must back it up with a strong
and concerted effort to convince Congress that:
<P>
Promoting democracy furthers U.S. national interests. <P>
     The historical record shows that democracies rarely go to war
against each other. While the U.S. need not embark on an open-ended
crusade for democracy, it should promote democratic institutions in
the former Soviet Union, Central and Eastern Europe, Latin America,
and other places where it is in the U.S. interest to do so.
Consolidating democracy in formerly hostile states enhances America's
long-term security. Democratic reforms also facilitate free market
economic reforms that often offer international trade and investment
opportunities.
<P>
The NED is a cost-effective vehicle for promoting democracy.<P>
     Funding the NED is a prudent investment because it is far less
expensive to aid friendly democrats than it is to defend against
hostile dictatorships. Giving the NED $50 million of democratic
"venture capital" could obviate the need to spend billions of dollars
on defense in the future, if Russia should revert to a hostile
dictatorship, for example. The NED's aid to grass roots organizations
also is cost-effective in comparison to government-to-government aid,
which often is siphoned off by foreign or American bureaucrats. The
NED's low overhead, in fact, got the agency in trouble with the
General Accounting Office (GAO), which issued a 1991 report
criticizing NED's grant monitoring, oversight procedures, and
financial controls. Subsequent NED procedural reforms led the GAO in
1992 to give a positive assessment of NED planning and evaluation
reforms.

<P>
The NED has capabilities unmatched by other aid programs. <P>
     The NED has the flexibility to adjust its programs to a rapidly
changing political situation in a particular country and create new
programs to address new political developments. It is adept at working
effectively with grass roots organizations in a manner that cumbersome
government agencies cannot match. Moreover, as a non-governmental
organization, the NED can assist democratic reformers in repressive
countries where official U.S. government support could provoke
diplomatic complications. Local political activists often prefer
receiving assistance from a non-governmental source, since aid from a
U.S. government agency may undermine their credibility in the eyes of
their countrymen.  
<P>
     Some NED critics argue that other private groups can perform some
of the same functions as the NED. They also maintain that the NED
could continue its programs with private funding. While it is true
that private democracy-building institutions, such as the Washington,
D.C.-based Krieble Institute, deliver effective assistance to
democratic reformers, there are few such organizations with the vision
and resources to exert a significant influence. Deprived of federal
funds, the NED would be forced to gut many of its programs for lack of
alternative funding sources.
<P>
Shrinking or abolishing the NED would be a dangerous signal. <P>
     Cutting back NED programs at a time when crucial democratic gains
have yet to be consolidated would signal that the U.S. is succumbing
to isolationism. This not only could demoralize reformers who have
taken risks to further democracy but could embolden opponents of
democracy to step up their own activities.
<P>
     Although the Cold War has ended, the global war of ideas
continues. Democratic institutions and ideals are and will remain
under attack from non-communist sources. Fundamentalist politico-
religious movements, authoritarian political forces, military coups,
and agressive dictators will continue to attack democracies and
undermine American interests. Given these realities, funding the
National Endowment for Democracy is a prudent investment for
safeguarding the future. The U.S. cannot afford to discard such an
important weapon in the international war of ideas.

<B> INTRODUCTION</B>
<P>
     The early days of the war against Iraq confirm that high-
technology weapons are America's trump card against Saddam Hussein.
America's top-of-the-line warplanes and missiles have destroyed much
of Iraq's air, industrial, nuclear, and chemical military power, and
they have given allied forces air supremacy over the 700-strong Iraqi
air force. Now these weapons are hammering Saddam's ground forces,
cutting their supplies and weakening their ability to fight a land
battle. The defensive Patriot missile, meanwhile, has spread a
protective shield over Saudi and Israeli populations. Hundreds and
perhaps thousands of lives have been saved by the Patriot's ability to
knock almost all Iraqi Scud missiles out of the sky.
<P>
     Had many members of Congress had their way, however, America
would not have these weapons which are winning the war against Saddam
Hussein. Critics in the 1980s charged that aircraft carriers, F-15
Eagle fighters, Patriot air defense missiles, and other high-tech
weapons were too expensive or unworkable. Yet Ronald Reagan and George
Bush continued to push for these weapons against strong and often
contemptuous opposition, ensuring that America's best technology found
its way from the laboratory to the battlefield.
<P>
     Critics' Challenges. Critics in Congress of the Reagan military
build-up challenged many weapons critical to the Gulf war effort.
Former Senator Gary Hart, then Democrat from Colorado, claimed that
the aircraft carriers now sending waves of planes over Iraq, and the
battleships now launching volleys of Tomahawk cruise missiles against
Baghdad, were obsolete. The M-1 Abrams tank -- America's answer to
Saddam's 5,000 Soviet tanks -- was called "vulnerable" and a
"questionable buy" by Representative Ron Dellums, the Democrat from
California. Dellums also charged that the top-of-the-line aircraft
like the F-15 Eagle were "gold plated." (Congressman Ronald V. 
Dellums, Defense Sense:  The Search for a Rational Military Policy
(Cambridge, MA:  Ballinger, 1983), pp.  147-157.) Military reformer
Sheila Tobias in 1982 wrote of the F-15 that once in battle, "the
confusion of mass combat [would] cancel out qualitative superiority."
(Sheila Tobias, et al., What Kind of Guns Are They Buying For Your
Butter?  (New York:  William Morrow, 1982).) The score in air-to-air
combat so far in Iraq: 28 Iraqi planes downed, zero for the U.S. Who
now can say that superior technology does not matter in battle? 
<P>
     Proven Worth. Many of the weapon systems once criticized already
have proved their worth in combat against Iraq. Among these: Patriot
anti-missile defenses against Iraqi Scud missile attacks; aircraft
carriers from which thousands of air "sorties" have been launched over
Iraq; and Tomahawk cruise missiles that have destroyed Iraqi command
and control sites with pinpoint accuracy from a distance of over 500
miles. Others such as the JSTARS airborne radar, which is designed to
locate enemy armored forces, and the Army Tactical Missile System
(ATACMS), which is a newly produced anti-armor missile system, are
contributing to America's success against Iraq only months after an
August 1990 House Armed Services Committee report recommended their
cancellation. Other systems strongly criticized in the 1980s,
including the Apache attack helicopter, the M-1 Abrams tank, Bradley
infantry fighting vehicles, and Maverick anti-tank missiles, have not
yet seen widespread use against Iraqi forces, but they likely will
acquit themselves well once the ground war is joined. (This
Backgrounder will focus on systems already used in combat.) 
<P>
     Reagan and Bush cannot take sole credit for these weapons. The
research, development, and production for many of today's advanced
systems began under Presidents Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford, Richard
Nixon, and even before. Yet Reagan and Bush provided the funding and
the tireless political backing needed to get the new technology into
the field, where today it is winning the war and protecting the lives
of American GIs deployed in the Persian Gulf. In many ways the war
against Iraq is the first real test of the Reagan and Bush military.
The battle is far from over, but so far Reagan and Bush are passing
with flying colors; their critics are flunking completely.
<P>

<B> THE HERO OF THE GULF WAR: THE PATRIOT MISSILE</B>
<P>
     No weapon used so far in Operation Desert Storm has performed so
surprisingly well as has the Patriot missile system. It is an anti-
aircraft missile system first deployed in Europe in 1984. The system
consists of an advanced phased-array radar for tracking targets in
flight, canisters containing the missiles themselves (usually in
blocks of four), and a launch, or "fire-control," center. 
<P>
     100 Percent Success Rate. In Operation Desert Storm, Patriots
specially modified to shoot down missiles, not just aircraft, have
seen combat for the first time. The Patriot has struck every one of
the 34 Scud missiles against which it was fired, a 100 percent success
rate. In some cases people were injured from falling debris after the
Scuds were hit. The Iraqis have launched a total of 57 Scuds at both
Israel and Saudi Arabia. The 23 remaining missiles were not
intercepted either because the Patriots sent to Israel were not
operational at the time of attack, or because the Scuds were flying
toward unpopulated areas and intentionally were left alone. Patriot
batteries were able to deflect a five-missile barrage against the
allied airbase in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, on January 20. This
demonstrated the ability of the Patriot system to perform the
technically difficult mission of intercepting several missiles
simultaneously. 
<P>
     In the 1980s there was strong congressional opposition to
transforming the Patriot anti-aircraft missile into a weapon capable
of destroying ballistic missiles in flight -- precisely the mission it
now serves in Israel and Saudi Arabia. The House Armed Services
Committee on April 19, 1984, voted to slash funding for modifying the
Patriot into a missile interceptor, reducing the Reagan Administration
request of $92.3 million to $15 million. (U.S.  House of
Representatives, Committee on Armed Services, Report on the Department
of Defense Authorization Act, 1985, 98th Cong., 2nd sess., H.Rpt. 
98-691 (Washington, D.C.:  GPO, 1984), p.  152.) The majority on the
House Armed Services Committee voted on April 15, 1987, to delete all
funds for testing the Patriot missile as an anti-missile system. (U.S. 
House of Representatives, Committee on Armed Services, Report on the
Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1988 and 1989, 100th Cong.,
1st sess., H.Rpt.  100-58 (Washington, D.C.:  GPO, 1987), p.  109.)
The Senate, however, approved funding for the program, which allowed
it to go forward.
<P>
     Saddam Hussein has used Scud missiles to terrorize the citizens
of Israel and Saudi Arabia, and to attack U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia.
If Patriot missiles in Israel and Saudi Arabia had not intercepted
Iraqi Scuds, surely thousands more Israeli and Saudi men, women, and
children would have died or been injured. The early Scud attacks on
Israel, before the Patriots were deployed, injured scores of people
and killed seven. If the Patriot had not been sent to Israel to
protect Israeli citizens from Scud attacks, moreover, Israel surely
would have been forced into the war. This could have splintered the
anti-Iraq coalition if other important members of the coalition
opposing Iraq -- including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Syria -- did not
want be seen as siding with Israel against another Arab country.

<P>
<B> THE NAVY'S SILVER BULLET: THE TOMAHAWK CRUISE MISSILE</B>
<P>
     Over 250 Tomahawk cruise missiles have been launched against Iraq
since the start of Operation Desert Storm. This is the first time this
weapon has been used in combat. Cruise missiles are unmanned
projectiles propelled by air-breathing engines and capable of
sustained flight very close to the ground. These missiles have hit
their targets (although not necessarily destroying them) 94 percent of
the time. The Tomahawks used in Operation Desert Storm are armed with
conventional high explosive warheads, although they can carry nuclear
warheads. Military commanders typically fire cruise missiles against
targets too well defended for manned bombers. Such targets include
bunkers housing Iraqi political and military leaders. The first shot
fired by U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf War was a Tomahawk.
<P>
     The Tomahawk program ran into congressional opposition in the
early 1980s. The Senate Armed Services Committee in 1983 threatened to
terminate the program. (U.S.  Senate, Committee on Armed Services,
Report on the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1984, 98th
Cong., 1st sess., S.Rpt.  98-174 (Washington, D.C.:  GPO, 1983), pp. 
66-68.) The committee charged that the Tomahawk cost too much. Arms
control considerations also prompted opposition to the cruise missile
program. In the House, Representative Les Aspin, the Wisconsin
Democrat who is now Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee,
offered an amendment on May 31, 1984, blocking the deployment of
nuclear-armed Tomahawks. (Congressional Record., May 31, 1984, p. 
H5049.) He claimed that nuclear-armed Tomahawks would hinder arms
control agreements with the Soviets. A similar effort was made in the
Senate by Republicans David Durenberger of Minnesota and Charles
Mathias (now retired) of Maryland, on June 19 of the same year.
(Congressional Record.,  June 19, 1984, p.  S7555.) The sponsors
wanted nuclear-armed Tomahawks banned through an agreement with the
Soviets.
<P>
     Despite statements that it was not their aim to ban conventional
Tomahawks, Mathias and the others endangered the entire Tomahawk
program in trying to ban the nuclear missiles. Under any feasible arms
control verification plan, it is virtually impossible to distinguish
between nuclear and conventional cruise missiles. Thus any outright
ban on nuclear Tomahawks would have generated political pressure to
ban the conventional version as well. This is precisely what happened
with the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, which
banned all ground-based cruise missiles -- conventional and nuclear --
with ranges between 300 and 3,400 miles. The U.S. and the Soviets
agreed to eliminate all ground-based cruise missiles because they
could not be sure which were armed with nuclear and which with
conventional warheads.
<P>
     Follow-Up Killed. Even today Congress is trying to hamper cruise
missile development. The logical follow-up to Tomahawk, the Long-Range
Conventional Stand-Off Weapon, was opposed by the Senate Armed
Services Committee in its report accompanying the fiscal 1991 Defense
Authorization Bill. This program would design a long-range
conventional cruise missile to be deployed on ships and airplanes. The
Senate report charged that the long-range missile was a "...
technology in search of a rationale." (U.S.  Senate, Committee on
Armed Services, Report on the Department of Defense Authorization Act,
1991, 101st Cong., 2nd sess., S.Rpt.  101-384 (Washington, D.C.:  GPO,
1991), p.  136.) The Department of Defense terminated the program in
the fiscal 1992 budget. 
<P>
     Absent the Tomahawk cruise missile, Navy and Air Force pilots
would have been forced to attack heavily defended bunkers housing the
Iraqi military leadership. Cruise missiles can fly through dangerous
air defense systems and destroy their targets with no risk to the
lives of American pilots. Without cruise missiles, more American
pilots would have been killed, wounded, or taken as prisoners of war.
Fighting a war without cruise missiles also would have meant more
expense to the American taxpayer. A Tomahawk cruise missile costs
about $1.3 million. Losing an Air Force F-15 Strike Eagle attack
aircraft to enemy fire would cost $50 million, while losing a Navy
F/A-18 Hornet would cost $30 million. Finally, the highly accurate
Tomahawk also results in fewer civilian deaths or injuries. Because it
is so accurate -- it can land within 50 feet of a target -- it can
strike precisely at military targets. 
<P>

<B> JSTARS RADAR SYSTEM DIRECTS PRECISION ALLIED BOMBING</B>
<P>
     Originally designed to meet an overwhelming Soviet armored threat
in Central Europe, the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System
(JSTARS) was rushed to the Persian Gulf after performing well in tests
in Europe last summer. Until the war against Iraq, it had not seen
combat. JSTARS is a radar and information processing system for U.S.
artillery, aircraft, and missiles. Installed on a modified Boeing 707
aircraft, it scans the ground day or night and in all weather seeking
enemy tanks and armored personnel carriers (APCs) up to 56 miles away.
Once it detects enemy tanks or APCs, it passes targeting information
to U.S. artillery, aircraft, and missile commanders on the ground,
enabling them to destroy them. It also can assess the damage caused by
U.S. attacks. Since being brought into the Persian Gulf, JSTARS has
helped to gauge the extent of damage caused by allied planes to enemy
supply lines. It is probably also monitoring the location and movement
of Iraqi tanks and armored vehicles. 
<P>
     The House Armed Services Committee voted in 1990 to terminate the
JSTARS program. The August 3, 1990, committee report said: "The
requirement for this system is unique to the U.S. European Command....
Given the changes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union and the
balancing of NATO/Warsaw Pact force ratios that will be driven by
unilateral reductions, the requirement for JSTARS is no longer valid."
(U.S.  House of Representatives, Committee on Armed Services, Report
of the Committee on Armed Services House of Representatives on the
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991, 101st Cong.,
2nd sess., H.Rept.  101-665 (Washington, D.C.:  GPO, 1990), pp. 
170-171.)
<P>
     The war with Iraq shows how wrong this assertion is. Saddam
Hussein has 5,000 tanks and 8,000 armored personnel carriers, most of
them the same Soviet-made weapons which JSTARS would have confronted
in a war in Europe. If JSTARS were not available for Operation Desert
Storm, the air campaign would have more trouble stopping Iraqi armored
forces. The tanks and armored vehicles not destroyed in the air
campaign would be used by Saddam against allied forces if a ground
campaign begins.
<P>
     Armored forces are the heart of the Iraqi military. If the air
campaign fails to destroy large portions of these forces, a ground
campaign is certain to be a bloody one. U.S. Army and Marine deaths in
a ground campaign, under these circumstances, could easily run into
the thousands. JSTARS not only can help reduce allied casualties, but
help destroy Saddam's armored columns, making victory more likely.
<P>
<B> NEW AIRCRAFT CARRIERS PROVIDE FIREPOWER</B>
<P>
     One of the most important high-technology weapons employed by
U.S. troops in the Middle East are aircraft carriers. The U.S. has six
aircraft carriers in the region supporting Operation Desert Storm,
including the USS America, the USS John F. Kennedy, the USS Midway,
the USS Ranger, the USS Saratoga, and the USS Theodore Roosevelt.
<P>
     The attack and fighter aircraft based on these carriers,
including A-6 Intruder bombers, F-14 Tomcat fighters, and F/A-18
Hornet fighter bombers, have played a major role in the air campaign
that began on January 17. About one-third of all sorties flown in
Operation Desert Storm have been flown by these carrier-based
aircraft. Each carrier is launching about 150 aircraft per day. They
have attacked such important strategic targets in Kuwait and Iraq as
nuclear and chemical weapons production facilities, command and
control centers, and airbases. 
<P>
     Despite its ability to project American air power worldwide, the
aircraft carrier often has been the target of criticism in and out of
Congress. Large carriers were derided as obsolete "sitting ducks" by
Carter Administration Central Intelligence Agency Director Admiral
Stansfield Turner and others. These critics urged that America deploy
"smaller carriers." Yet the carriers that they advocated could not
have handled the sophisticated, fixed-wing aircraft, such as F-14
Tomcats and F/A 18 Hornets, now flying missions over Kuwait and Iraq. 
<P>
     Representative Dellums offered an amendment to the fiscal 1983
Defense Authorization Bill on July 22, 1982, eliminating $6.9 billion
for two aircraft carriers. While his amendment was defeated in the
House by a vote of 303 to 83, Democratic Representatives Les AuCoin of
Oregon, Don Edwards of California, Patricia Schroeder of Colorado, and
Timothy Wirth of Colorado (now a Senator) voted for the amendment.
(Congressional Record, July 22, 1982, pp.  H4515-H4522.) That year,
too, former Senator Hart offered an amendment in the Senate to
substitute smaller carriers for a large one. Senator Edward Kennedy of
Massachusetts led an effort in the Senate Armed Services Committee in
May 1987 to delete funds for the initial purchase of components,
primarily for nuclear reactors, for two carriers. The Kennedy
amendment failed. (Pat Towell, "Critical Showdown Over SDI Under Way
on Capitol Hill," Congressional Quarterly Weekly Report, May 16, 1987,
p.  980.)
<P>
     Making A Difference Early. Aircraft carriers have been critical
to the Gulf operation from the day Iraq invaded Kuwait on August 2.
Only large aircraft carriers could have delivered the airpower needed
to deter Iraq from moving against Saudi Arabia last fall. While two
squadrons of F-15 fighters were ordered to Saudi Arabia after the
invasion of Kuwait, the bulk of U.S. airpower in the days after
Saddam's invasion of Kuwait came from three aircraft carriers. If
Iraqi forces had not been deterred from attacking Saudi Arabia, allied
forces would have had to force their way into Saudi territory already
partially occupied by Iraqi forces. This would have been a far more
bloody operation than the war now underway. Aircraft carriers also
enforce the embargo the United Nations imposed on Iraq. The
effectiveness of the embargo has weakened Iraqi forces by cutting off
war supplies imported to the country.
<P>
     If Dellums, Kennedy, and the others who tried to block funding
for aircraft carriers had been successful, U.S. forces would likely
lack the firepower in the Middle East to pummel Saddam Hussein's
forces. The U.S. Navy now has fourteen active aircraft carriers. If
the Navy had cut back on carriers -- Dellums believed six might be
enough -- it could not have spared the six carriers now used in
Operation Desert Storm. Even if the U.S. had cut back to twelve
carriers, Desert Storm would have been a tight squeeze, since three
carriers now are in port for maintenance and overhauls. Only three
would have been available to operate outside the Persian Gulf to
patrol the entire Pacific, the Atlantic, and the Mediterranean.
Normally, the U.S. stations three carriers in the Pacific, three in
the Atlantic, and one or two in the Mediterranean. The Indian Ocean
would have been left without carriers at all. 
<P>
     Fewer Carriers, Fewer Sorties. Rather than leaving so much of the
world's oceans defenseless, the Navy likely would have dispatched
fewer aircraft carriers to the Gulf War. Fewer aircraft carriers would
have diminished U.S. airpower against Iraq. Thus, the air campaign
against Iraq would have been less efficient and consumed more time
because of the fewer allied aircraft available for combat. Example:
with two fewer carriers in the Gulf, the U.S. would fly up to 300
fewer sorties a day. Fewer of Saddam's command and control centers in
Iraq and Kuwait, fewer of the bridges he uses to resupply Iraqi troops
in Kuwait and fewer of his forces in the field would be targeted each
day. Without the extra carriers, Saddam's ground forces ultimately
might have been able to mount a stronger defense of Kuwaiti territory.
<P>

<B> NEW MISSILE COULD BE A KEY PLAYER IN A GROUND CAMPAIGN</B>
<P>
     Another high-tech U.S. system that may prove critical in a ground
war is the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS). ATACMS is an Army
surface-to-surface missile designed to strike large concentrations of
tanks and armored personnel carriers behind enemy lines. It is well-
suited for countering Iraq, which has thousands of tanks and armored
personnel carriers in southern Iraq and Kuwait. If the air campaign
does not break Iraq's hold on Kuwait, a ground campaign will be
necessary. Among the highest priorities in such an attack will be to
destroy the armored forces not yet knocked out by the air war. The
highly accurate ATACMS, armed with cluster bombs or special armor-
piercing warheads that are deadly against armored forces, can destroy
Iraq's armor before it threatens U.S. troops. The first ATACMS missile
was fired against Iraqi forces on January 28, but the Army has not
released a report on its performance. 
<P>
     The House Armed Services Committee, chaired by Representative
Aspin, tried to kill the ATACMs program last year. The Committee
reported on August 3 that the withdrawal of large portions of Soviet
armored forces from Europe would eliminate the need for a system
capable of "striking large concentrations of armored vehicles." (U.S. 
House of Representatives, Committee on Armed Services, Report of the
Committee on Armed Services House of Representatives on the National
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991, 101st Cong., 2nd
sess., H.Rept.  101-665 (Washington, D.C.:  GPO, 1990), p.  35.) Iraq,
with its over 5,000 tanks, has likely deployed armored systems in
large numbers in Kuwait and southern Iraq. This is just the sort of
force ATACMS is designed to counter.
<P>
     There is no report yet how well ATACMS is doing in the field, but
successful tests indicate that it will perform well. Critics took aim
at the system because they said that it would not be needed, not
because they claimed that it would not work. Saddam's armored war
machine shows how wrong they are. If allied ground forces cannot
destroy Iraqi armored forces with ATACMS, Iraq could better direct its
armored forces to stop an allied ground attack. Free of ATACMS' fire,
Saddam could better maneuver his tank forces to stop attempts by
allied tanks to break through strongly defended Iraqi positions. 
<P>

<B> CONCLUSION
</B><P>
     America's success thus far in the war against Iraq is the result
mainly of the bravery and tenacity of America's fighting forces. It
also is the result of tireless efforts over the years by the White
House, many members of Congress, U.S. Armed Forces, and American
taxpayers to provide GIs with the best weapons the country can design.
America managed to achieve this despite intensive debates about which
weapons were best and how much should be spent on them.
<P>
     Enduring Lessons. If Congress had reduced drastically the numbers
of aircraft carriers, the U.S. would have lacked the airpower needed
to stop Iraqi forces without leaving U.S. interests dangerously
vulnerable elsewhere around the globe. Another lesson of the war is
that missile defenses are crucial. Without the anti-missile Patriot,
which the House Armed Services Committee tried to terminate in the
mid-1980s, thousands of Israeli and Saudi civilians would have been
victims of Saddam Hussein's Scud attacks. Other lessons: conventional
cruise missiles are key weapons in the U.S. arsenal; and even if the
Cold War ends, such advanced combat systems as the JSTARS airborne
radar and the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) are critical
against enemy tanks, even those deployed by Third World foes.
<P>
     Technology is the "force multiplier" that allows U.S. forces to
shoot farther and more precisely than their enemies. The best always
is expensive, but the price for deploying anything less ultimately
will be paid in the lives of American soldiers, sailors, and airmen.
This lesson will endure well after the fighting in the Persian Gulf
ends.

<center><h2>LIFT THE ARMS EMBARGO ON BOSNIA</h2><p>
by <a href="/heritage/staff/phillips.htm">James Phillips</a><br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
<b>Executive Memorandum 421</b><br>

July 18, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%><p>
</center>
<p>

	The July 11 seizure of the Bosnian Muslim enclave of Srebrenica by Bosnian Serb forces
has underscored the failure of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia. 
UNPROFOR peacekeeping troops once again have been taken hostage, unable to defend
themselves, let alone Bosnian civilians, against aggression by the Bosnian Serbs.  The fall of
Srebrenica, the first "safe area" to be declared by the U.N. in Bosnia, and the ongoing Serb
assault against the Zepa safe area highlight the vulnerability of the four remaining safe areas in
eastern Bosnia.  As the fighting in Bosnia continues to escalate, it is time for the Clinton
Administration to abandon its doomed policy on Bosnia, accept the inevitable withdrawal of the
ineffectual U.N. peacekeeping mission there, and lift the ill-considered arms embargo on the
Bosnian government.  <p>

<p>

	Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole has proposed that the U.S. do just that.  The Senate
this week will vote on his bill, S. 21, co-sponsored with Senator Joseph Lieberman (D-CT), that
will terminate the arms embargo after UNPROFOR withdraws or 12 weeks after it is requested
to do so by the Bosnian government.  The Clinton Administration has criticized Dole's proposal
as risking expansion of the fighting, overlooking the fact that the fighting already has raged out
of control despite the limp efforts of U.N. peacekeepers to contain it.  The Administration
stubbornly clings to the illusion that there is a peace to keep in Bosnia, when it is clear that both
sides are spoiling for a fight.<p>

<p>

	The sad truth is that President Clinton's policy zigzags have made a tragic situation in
Bosnia worse.  By repeatedly promising resolute action, such as U.S. air strikes or the
commitment of U.S. ground troops, and then retreating, Clinton has eroded U.S. credibility and
undermined NATO cohesion without appreciably slowing the steady slide of U.N. peacekeeping
forces into near-irrelevance.  The increasingly truculent Bosnian Serbs have steadily undermined
the U.N.'s three goals in Bosnia: to provide humanitarian aid to Bosnian civilians, to moderate
the ferocity of the fighting, and to encourage a diplomatic settlement. Peace efforts have failed
primarily because the Bosnian Serbs have concluded, based on their military superiority to date,
that they have more to gain by fighting than by negotiating.<p>

<p>

	The Serbs have been aided by the arms embargo on Yugoslavia imposed by the U.N. in
1991.  The arms embargo allowed the 80,000 man-Bosnian Serb militia, armed and supported by
neighboring Serbia, to retain control of the territory that it has conquered, roughly 70 percent of
Bosnia, in large part due to a near monopoly of heavy weapons.  The Bosnian government can
mobilize up to 200,000 men but has been unable to arm them because of  the embargo.  Less
than one in three of its potential fighters has weapons, and it is outgunned by the smaller Serb
force.  Nevertheless, the increasingly effective Bosnian army has scored some military successes
in recent months over Serb forces stretched thin along the 1,600-kilometer front.  This has
prompted the Serbs to step up their efforts to eliminate the isolated pro-government enclaves in
eastern Bosnia so that they can consolidate their forces.<p>

<p>

	As the situation in Bosnia continues to deteriorate, the Clinton Administration should:<p>

<p>

	<b>* End the failed U.N. peacekeeping mission in Bosnia</b>.  The 24,700-man UNPROFOR
contingent clearly has lost its credibility with all Bosnian factions. Withdrawal would be better
sooner than later.  If a pull-out is to be completed before winter snows clog the rugged Bosnian
road network, a decision to withdraw must be made by the end of August.<p>

<p>

	<b>*  Rule out the commitment of U.S. ground troops, except to extract UNPROFOR.</b> 
French President Jacques Chirac has asked President Clinton to deploy U.S. troops to reinforce
the remaining U.N. safe areas.  Clinton rejected this, but the Administration reportedly still is
considering providing logistical support for U.N. troops in the safe areas that would involve the
dispatch of heavy-lift and combat helicopters over Serb-held territory.  This would be a
dangerous mistake.  It would raise the stakes of U.S. involvement without significantly changing
the situation on the ground.  If France and other nations involved in the failed peacekeeping
effort unwisely choose to escalate their involvement, they should do so without counting on
American backing.  The U.S. has no vital interest at stake in Bosnia.  U.S. troops therefore
should be committed only in an emergency to save U.N. peacekeeping troops that are being
withdrawn, not risked to help them prolong their ill-fated mission.<p>

<p>

	If called upon to fulfill President Clinton's promise to provide up to 25,000 U.S. troops
as part of a 60,000-strong NATO force to extricate UNPROFOR, the U.S. should do so only if
its troops are under exclusive NATO command, free from U.N. interference and equivocation. 
Moreover, U.S. troops should operate under rules of engagement which allow for massive
retaliation, instead of  half-hearted pinprick reprisals, if U.S. forces are attacked.  Although the
Bosnian Serbs probably will not seek to block the withdrawal of U.N. forces, they will seek to
capture U.N. military equipment.  No U.S. troops should be risked to retrieve equipment. 
Instead, the countries that contributed peacekeepers should warn the Serbs that they will provide
the Bosnian government with three times the amount of military equipment that the Serbs seize
during the withdrawal.  Sadly, many of the problems related to a withdrawal are likely to come
from Bosnian Muslims embittered by the U.N.'s failure to live up to their high expectations.  The
U.S. should warn the Bosnian government that any prospects for future cooperation will rest on
its full cooperation during the withdrawal of U.N. forces.  President Clinton should appear on
national television to state clearly the limited and temporary nature of the U.S. military
commitment and warn the warring Balkan factions against interfering with the extraction
operation.<p>

<p>

	<b>*  Lift the arms embargo on Bosnia</b>.  After U.N. forces have been withdrawn, there
should be no excuse for preventing the Bosnian government from arming itself in self-defense.  
The U.S. should terminate the embargo because it contravenes Bosnia's right of self-defense, a
violation of  Article 51 of the U.N. Charter. The U.S. and NATO then should consider arming
the Bosnian government, but should rule out air strikes or logistical support that could entangle
NATO in the war.  Washington must be careful not to feed Bosnian hopes of increased U.S.
backing, for that will encourage the Bosnian government to form unrealistic expectations that
will make it less amenable to the hard compromises that will be required of both sides if there is
to be a negotiated settlement.<p>

<p>

	<b>*  Maintain economic sanctions against Serbia until it helps push through an
acceptable settlement in Bosnia.</b>  Economic sanctions and the arms embargo should not be
lifted until Serbia has forced its proxies in Bosnia to accept a settlement that will return most of
Bosnia to government control.<p>

<p>

<b>CONCLUSION<p>

</b><p>

	The withdrawal of  U.N. forces and lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnia will lead
to greater bloodshed in the short run. But the risks of this course of action are outweighed by the
risks of continuing the current policy of bluster and retreat, which has led the U.N.
"peacekeepers" to become impotent bystanders as war rages around them.  By lifting the arms
embargo, the U.S. can help the Bosnians to defend themselves without becoming inextricably
bogged down in the Balkan quagmire.  Moreover, by allowing the Bosnians to build their
military strength and increase their ability to recover lost territory, the U.S. can help lay the
groundwork for a viable political settlement in the long run. <p>

By Lawrence T. DiRita

     American voters on November 8 gave the new majority in the U.S.
House of Representatives a mandate to address a variety of urgent national
priorities as outlined in the Republican Contract With America. Among the
ten specific items of legislation that comprise the Contract is H.R.7, The
National Security Revitalization Act, which promises to improve America's
military strength and enhance its overseas credibility. Speaker of the House
Newt Gingrich has committed the Republican majority to voting on this and
the other items in the Contract within the first 100 days of the 104th
Congress, or by April 14, 1995.
<P>
     The National Security Revitalization Act (NSRA) addresses many of
the issues that have led to the public perception of Bill Clinton as a weak
and even inept foreign policy President. The Administration's recent
agonizing over the release of the Army aviator shot down in North Korea
is the latest example of the vacillation and indecision that have
characterized American foreign policy for the past two years. By passing the
NSRA, Congress will take an important first step toward changing this
image and restoring America's reputation as a superpower that will defend
-- independently, if necessary -- its national security interests around the
world.
<P>
     The legislation is substantial, and passage as it stands would mark
an immediate improvement in U.S. foreign and defense policy. Specifically,
the Act: 
<P>
 Acknowledges the decline in American military readiness that has occurred
since 1992.
 <P>
 Restricts future participation by U.S. troops in United Nations military
operations.
 <P>
 Commits the United States to developing defense against ballistic missile
attack, which is the most serious threat facing the nation.
Pledges continued American leadership of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), reaffirming support for eventual expansion of the
alliance.
<P>
     The House International Relations and National Security Committees
will begin marking up the legislation in late January. Both committees
should use that opportunity to strengthen some provisions and clarify others.
Before passing the National Security Revitalization Act, Congress should
consider amendments that would:
<P>
Repeal the War Powers Resolution of 1973. Democratic and Republican
Presidents alike have considered this Watergate-era legislation an
encroachment on their constitutional authority as Commander in Chief.
<P>
Prohibit the appropriation of Department of Defense funds for non-defense
purposes. Nearly $5 billion was spent in 1994 from the Pentagon's budget
for activities clearly unrelated to defense, including $50 million for the
Kaho'olawe Island Trust Fund and $10 million for Los Angeles Youth
Programs. This insidious practice, which has increased by over 300 percent
in the past five years, threatens to consume the defense budget from within.
Congress should seek every legislative tool to end it.
<P>
Impose a moratorium on negotiations to revise the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile (ABM) Treaty. The Clinton Administration is negotiating with
Russia and other republics of the former Soviet Union to restrict research,
development, and testing of missile-defense systems not covered in the
original treaty. Reaching an agreement in these negotiations would frustrate
an expressed objective of the Contract With America: to develop effective
missile defenses.
<P>
Refocus and reconstitute the Commission on Roles and Missions of the
Armed Services. Established by the 103rd Congress to reassess the fifty-
year-old division of labor among the armed services, the Commission is
required to report to Congress by May 1995. But it is encumbered by a
hodgepodge of some 25 objectives, including a review of Pentagon health
care benefits and supply procedures, that go well beyond an examination of
service roles and missions. Moreover, its membership was determined by the
former Democratic majority in Congress. Of the five civilian commissioners,
three are former Carter Administration officials; former Clinton Secretary
of Defense Les Aspin is one of the other two civilians.
<P>
THE CONTRACT'S NATIONAL SECURITY REVITALIZATION
ACT
  <P>   The National Security Revitalization Act calls on Congress to take
action in four broadly defined areas of foreign and defense policy.
<P>ISSUE #1: Military Readiness and Defense Spending
 <P>    The legislation commits Congress to reversing "the downward
spiral of defense spending." It determines that the Clinton
Administration has projected defense reductions of over $156 billion
through 1999 -- more than twice as much as Clinton promised when he
was campaigning for office in 1992. A standard element of his stump
speech when trying to demonstrate his "new Democrat" credentials was
that he would cut defense spending by just $60 billion more than
President Bush had proposed in his last five-year defense plan.
<P>
     At the same time, the NSRA criticizes the Administration for
creating the conditions for a return to the "hollow force" of the 1970s,
when the force looked impressive "on paper" but was in fact poorly
trained and equipped. The legislation cites "one-third of the units in the
Army contingency force and all of the forward-deployed and follow-on
Army divisions... reporting a reduced state of military readiness"
because of "the significantly increased pace of... operations,"
particularly U.N. peacekeeping. It also finds that the tempo of
operations is such that U.S. troops are not maintaining the standard
respite between overseas deployments.
<P>
     In addition, the Act cites a 12.8 percent gap between military pay
and comparable civilian pay that has resulted in as many as 17,000
active duty personnel and their families becoming eligible to receive U.S.
government food stamps. This is just one indication of a bigger problem
of Pentagon underfunding. The legislation refers to a General
Accounting Office estimate that the force outlined in the Clinton five-
year defense plan could be short by as much as $150 billion.
<P>
     The National Security Revitalization Commission. The House
Contract specifically calls for assessing "the adequacy of the current...
defense plan in fully funding" the Clinton force structure, outlined in the
Administration's 1993 "Bottom-Up Review." The Contract acknowledges
the General Accounting Office conclusion that there is a funding shortfall
of as much as $150 billion; the new majority in the House of
Representatives commits itself to confirm the shortfall and determining a
method of "maintain[ing] adequate funding for military readiness... without
sacrificing modernization programs."
<P>
     The House Republican alternative budget developed by
Representative John Kasich (R-OH) in 1994 provides for some $60 billion
of that amount, or nearly one-third. To determine how best to allocate that
amount and to restore the remaining shortfall, the NSRA will establish a 12-
person commission, consisting of four members appointed by the President,
Speaker of the House, and President Pro Tem of the Senate. The chairman
of the commission will be designated jointly by the Speaker and Senate
majority leader.
<P> 
     The commission will have until January 1996 to "conduct a
comprehensive review of the long-term national security needs of the United
States." It will be the commission's responsibility to, among other things,
review the Clinton Administration's National Security Strategy, which
affirms U.S. commitment to global peacekeeping operations while ostensibly
calling for sufficient forces to fight in two major overseas wars "nearly
simultaneously." It is precisely these ambitious objectives that the General
Accounting Office has determined to be underfunded by as much as $150
billion.
 <P>
     In addition to considering the merits of such a strategy, the
commission will be charged with defining new policies for the assignment
of U.S. troops to peacekeeping and other non-traditional missions. It also
will be tasked with developing a defense budget strategy that restores
balance between near-term readiness and longer-term modernization through
research and development. The Clinton Administration has paid for its
expanded peacekeeping responsibilities and other immediate requirements
by purchasing fewer new weapons systems and spending less on research
and development. This must stop, or American forces will lose their
technological superiority against potential future adversaries. The new
majority in Congress understands this. The commission will be charged with
developing "a new funding system to avoid diversions from military
readiness accounts to pay for peacekeeping and humanitarian deployments
such as Haiti and Rwanda."
<P>
ISSUE #2: The U.S. and the United Nations
 <P>    The second major area of U.S. foreign policy that the Contract
addresses is the relationship between the United States and the United
Nations. Much of the discomfort Americans have had with the Clinton
foreign policy stems from the Administration's involvement in military
operations of the world body that have gone awry in Somalia, Haiti, and
elsewhere.
<P>
     The Contract criticizes the Clinton Administration's expansion
of U.S. military commitments, noting that at the end of 1994 "[o]ver
70,000 United States troops were serving in such regions as Iraq,
Bosnia, Macedonia, the Adriatic Sea, Rwanda, and the Caribbean Sea
for missions involving Haiti and Cuba." It also notes that "[t]he United
States is assessed 31.7 percent of annual United Nations costs for
peacekeeping and other United Nations missions. The next highest
contributor, Japan, only pays 12.5 percent."
 <P>
     No U.S. Troops Under U.N. Command. The Contract With
America seeks to remedy these problems in a variety of ways. First, it
places significant restrictions on the President's ability to subordinate U.S.
troops to foreign control. It does so by restricting the funding that would be
required for U.S. forces engaged in such activity. Flexibility is allowed the
Commander in Chief, though, if he certifies to the Congress that putting
U.S. troops under U.N. command "is necessary to protect vital national
security interests of the United States." 
<P>
     But in a clear indication that the new majority in Congress is
skeptical about U.N. military operations in general, the Contract also would
require the President to explain -- even before certifying that a particular
operation is in the national interests of the U.S. -- "why the placement of
elements of [U.S.] Armed Forces under the command... of a foreign national
acting on behalf of the United Nations does not violate the Constitution."
<P>
     The legislation also makes the sensible recommendation that the cost
to the United States of any U.N. peacekeeping activities be applied as a
credit toward the annual U.N. assessment of dues from the United States.
Such a scheme would blunt substantially the unfair criticism that the U.S.
is a "deadbeat" in paying its U.N. dues, a charge belied by the significant
amount the U.S. pays in peacekeeping costs that is not credited toward its
dues. Moreover, the Contract would impose a cap on U.S. support for U.N.
peacekeeping activities. If passed, the legislation would restrict the U.S.
from paying more than 25 percent of the total U.N. peacekeeping bill, down
from the current 31.7 percent but still more than double the next-largest
contributor.
<P>
     Dramatic Budgetary Reforms. The Contract also imposes a
limitation on the use of Pentagon funds for U.N. peacekeeping. According
to the legislation, "[n]o funds available to the Department of Defense shall
be available for payment of any United States assessed or voluntary
contribution for United Nations peacekeeping activities." Such activities
often have as much to do with diplomacy as with military might. It therefore
makes sense that the State Department and other agencies -- which in the
Clinton Administration have been strong proponents of peacekeeping, often
against military opposition -- should have to bear more of the financial
burden.
<P>
     Finally, the Contract ties U.S. financial support to the U.N., including
U.N. peacekeeping activities, to significant management reforms. The
President will be required to certify annually that "the United Nations has
an independent office of Inspector General to conduct and supervise
objective audits, inspections, and investigations relating to programs and
operations of the United Nations." Specific additional responsibilities of
the Inspector General position -- which does not now exist -- are identified,
with the objective of improving the budgetary and management activities of
the U.N.'s bloated and wasteful bureaucracy.
<P>
     The Contract puts teeth behind these requirements. Pending the
President's annual certification that this aggressive position has been created
and is carrying out the duties expected by Congress, 20 percent of the
general U.N. assessment and 50 percent of the peacekeeping assessments
will be withheld.
<P>

ISSUE #3: Ballistic Missile Defense for the United States
<P>     The new majority in Congress has an approach to ballistic missile
defense that is manifestly different from that of the Clinton Administration.
The NSRA states that "[i]t shall be the policy of the United States to...
deploy at the earliest possible moment an antiballistic missile system that is
capable of providing a... defense of the United States against ballistic missile
attacks." 
<P>
     This is in sharp contrast to the policies of the Clinton Administration,
which has cut funding for ballistic missile defense by some 80 percent from
the amount projected by the Bush Administration in its last defense budget.
At the same time, the Administration has embraced the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile (ABM) Treaty, seeking to expand its provisions to the point that,
according to the House Contract, the U.S. would be prohibited "from testing
or deploying our most effective missile defense systems."
To reverse this trend, the NSRA requires the Secretary of Defense to submit
to Congress within 60 days of its enactment "a plan for deployment of an
antiballistic missile system."  The Secretary also would be required to
intensify efforts to provide so-called theater missile defense for U.S. allies 
and American forces deployed overseas.
<P>
ISSUE #4: NATO Expansion
 <P>    The NSRA reaffirms the importance of continued U.S. leadership of
a strong Atlantic Alliance to guarantee "the security, freedom, and prosperity
of the United States.... " But it also acknowledges that, with the defeat
of the former Soviet Union in the Cold War, there is a "fundamentally
changed security environment" in Europe. Thus, while the new majority
in Congress sees NATO as the best means of defending vital U.S. interests,
it also recognizes that the organization must adapt to the reality of post-Cold
War Europe. As a result, the NSRA commits the U.S. to work with its
European allies to expand the alliance.
<P>
     The legislation focuses on the so-called Visegrad countries of Poland,
the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia. These countries have made the
most progress reforming their economies and political systems. Therefore,
they are in the best position to "contribute to the security of the North
Atlantic area" in the foreseeable future. The NSRA, recognizing this,
seeks to encourage the deeper integration of these countries into the West
by bringing them into NATO.
<P>
     The House Contract calls for the gradual expansion of the alliance
to include these countries by no later than January 1999. The legislation
authorizes the President to facilitate this integration with a program of
security assistance that includes, among other things, 1) the transfer of
excess U.S. defense-related, non-lethal equipment; 2) support for
international military education and training, and financing for arms
purchases; and 3) joint planning, training, and military exercises. The
legislation further allows the President to designate other countries to
receive such assistance if he can certify that they have made the same type
of progress toward democratic capitalism as have the Visegrad countries.
<P>
     The Contract With America's provisions regarding NATO draw
heavily on the NATO Participation Act. This legislation has many of the
same objectives as the Contract provision and passed the 103rd Congress by
overwhelming margins late last year. Significantly, the chief sponsor of the
bill in the House was Representative Ben Gilman (R-NY), now Chairman
of the House International Relations Committee, which will take a lead in
marking up the NSRA of 1995 for the 104th Congress. In the Senate, a
bipartisan coalition led by Senators Hank Brown (R-CO) and Paul Simon
(D-IL) sponsored the NATO Participation Act for the 103rd Congress. Given
the margin of victory last session, expanding NATO is expected to be the
least contentious element of the Contract With America.
<P>
STRENGTHENING THE CONTRACT WITH AMERICA
<P>     The NSRA is a serious and responsible effort to restore American
strength and credibility. The House of Representatives will begin reviewing
this element of the Contract in late January. Before bringing the Act to the
floor for a vote, the Chairmen of the House International Relations and
National Security Committees will have the opportunity to clarify some
provisions and strengthen others. As they do so, these committees should
consider modifying the NSRA to:
<P>
Repeal the War Powers Resolution of 1973. 
<P>    Among other things, the War Powers Act requires the President to
obtain congressional permission for the use of force within 60 days of
deploying American troops. This restriction was imposed by Congress as a
backlash against the unpopularity of the Vietnam war.
<P>
     The War Powers Resolution diminishes the President's ability to deal
with foreign policy crises and enables Congress, through mere inaction, to
interfere with the discharge of the President's constitutional responsibilities
as Commander in Chief. The Constitution gives the President the inherent
authority to respond to attacks on U.S. citizens and property and to resist
armed aggression against the U.S. and its allies. The War Powers Resolution
incorrectly assumes that any use of the U.S. military invariably amounts to
waging war and thus requires congressional consent.
 <P>
     On the first day of the 104th Congress, Senate Majority Leader
Robert Dole (R-KS) introduced a bill that would repeal the War Powers
Resolution. That legislation, the Peace Powers Act of 1995, includes many
of the same restrictions as the House Contract With America regarding the
commitment of U.S. troops to United Nations peacekeeping operations and
subordinating them to foreign command. It thus draws a distinction between
the commitment of U.S. troops to trouble spots in defense of vital national
interests and the participation by American forces in vaguely defined
operations at the behest of a global body not subject to the U.S.
Constitution.
<P>
     In the first instance, the Constitution provides guidance on the "war
powers" of each branch of government, and additional legislation is
unnecessary and confusing. In the case of U.N. peacekeeping, where U.S.
troops may find themselves in combat unrelated to American interests, the
Constitution offers scant guidance, and the proposal outlined in both the
Contract and the Peace Powers Act provides much-needed clarification.
 <P>
     For example, the President's authority to defend American lives and
property with force is inherent in the Constitution, and he should be free to
discharge this authority without having to ask Congress to declare war or
otherwise approve of the action. It is less clear that this authority extends
to protecting Haitian lives and property as part of a U.N. peacekeeping
mission. Under such circumstances, it is appropriate that Congress consider
in advance the wisdom of sending American troops to perform such a
mission. The House should consider amending the NSRA to include repeal
of the War Powers Resolution, harmonizing its legislation with that
introduced in the Senate.
<P>
Prohibit the appropriation of Department of Defense funds for non-defense
purposes.
 <P>
     The new majority in Congress will find no task more difficult to
execute than restoring additional spending to the Department of Defense.
This promise is contrary to the bulk of the Contract, which calls for
reducing government through dramatic budget cuts.
<P>
     One way to begin restoring American military readiness without
appropriating a single new dollar would be to eliminate the pork in the
Pentagon's budget. The money saved could be redirected to legitimate
defense requirements. For example, the fiscal 1995 budget for the Army
contained $150 million for breast cancer research. While this is a worthy
cause, it should not be the business of the U.S. Army. Breast cancer
research does not contribute to U.S. national security and should not be in
the defense budget. Sponsors of such programs should be forced to justify
them on their own merits, rather than hide them in a defense budget they
believe is too large for detailed scrutiny.
<P>
Impose a moratorium on negotiations to revise the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile (ABM) Treaty. 
 <P>    The NSRA provisions regarding missile defense will be moot if the
Clinton Administration agrees with Russia to extend the ABM Treaty to
cover many of the very systems addressed in the legislation. These include
the theater missile defense systems designed to defend American troops
overseas, even though the architects of the original treaty never intended that
such systems be restricted. Key members of the House, including Speaker
Gingrich, National Security Committee Chairman Floyd Spence (R-SC), and
Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston (R-LA), expressed
their skepticism about extending the treaty in a letter to President Clinton
on January 4, 1995. They noted their concern about the negotiations and
asked him to delay final agreement "until the new Congress has had an
opportunity to examine these questions with care."
<P>
     The NSRA will be improved if the House includes a provision that
directs the Administration not to participate in negotiations with the
Russians that lead to any substantive modification of the ABM Treaty. Such
modification would include any restriction on research, development, testing,
or deployment of anti-missile systems designed to counter theater ballistic
missiles, such as the Scud-C missiles used by Saddam Hussein in the Gulf
War.
<P>
     The House also should consider amending the Contract to express its
view that imposing new restrictions on theater defense is contrary to the
national security interests of the United States. During the moratorium
Congress can enact new goals for the negotiations with Russia and other
nations on missile defense, which the Administration will be required to
honor.
<P>
Refocus and reconstitute the Commission on Roles and Missions of the
Armed Services. 
<P>     Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Colin Powell
conducted a review of service roles and missions in 1992. His study resulted
in a number of initiatives to streamline the joint activities of the armed
forces and reduce some redundancy, particularly regarding training for
common activities such as aviation. But to many, including then-Senate
Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-GA), Powell's reforms
did not go far enough. Nunn established the Commission on Roles and
Missions (CORM) to determine what additional reforms can be
accomplished.
<P>
     The CORM has been meeting since mid-1994 and is required to
report its findings by May 1995, but it has become bogged down by trying
to do too much. In addition to considering such questions as which service
should be responsible for combat aviation, strategic mobility, and space
systems, the CORM is venturing far afield from roles and missions to
examine such issues as the Pentagon's health benefits and the organization
of "foreign constabulary forces."
<P>
     Many of these subsidiary issues are important and deserve
consideration. Indeed, by streamlining Pentagon purchasing procedures and
eliminating bureaucratic waste, they could lead to substantial cost-savings
that will make the new Congress's job of restoring America's defenses
without breaking the budget much easier. But its limited mandate and
impending deadline in only five months make the CORM an unlikely body
to conduct a review of these issues. The House should reaffirm the limited
objectives of the Commission on Roles and Missions and extend its
reporting deadline to the end of the current fiscal year on September 30. At
the same time, the National Strategy Revitalization Commission established
in the Contract With America should be tasked with examining some of the
issues withdrawn from the Roles and Mission Commission's agenda.
<P>
     Finally, the new majority in Congress should reconstitute the
Commission on Roles and Missions. The CORM is chaired by former Carter
Administration Assistant Secretary of Defense John White and includes
members identified with many of the ideas repudiated by the voters in
November. In fact, Clinton's former Secretary of Defense, Les Aspin, is a
Commissioner. If the CORM's report is to have merit, Congress -- which
commissioned the study in the first place -- should ensure its membership
more accurately reflects the results of last November's elections. 
<P>
 CONCLUSION
<P>     The 104th Congress is poised to "reinvent government" in ways
never envisioned when the term became fashionable two years ago. One
critical element of the mandate the people gave to Congress last November
is to restore America's military strength and credibility abroad. The
American people hold President Clinton accountable for his failure to lead
on the global stage. Passing the National Security Revitalization Act is a
credible first step toward imposing this accountability and guaranteeing
American safety and prosperity at the dawn of the new millennium.

Issue Bulletin #173<BR>
April 3, 1992<BR>

            


<P>INTRODUCTION

<P>      It is time for federal regulators to obey the Bill of Rights.
This is the message of the Private Property Rights Act (S. 50),
introduced in the Senate by Steve Symms, the Idaho Republican. Symms's
bill would give teeth to the Fifth Amendment's requirement that no
"private property be taken for public use, without just compensation."
Targeted by the bill is the mounting practice of government
regulations to deprive individuals and businesses of the use of their
property without compensating the owners for the loss of their
property.
<P>      The Symms bill would codify and make permanent Executive Order
12630, signed by Ronald Reagan in 1988, which requires federal
agencies to consider whether their actions might infringe on property
rights and, if they do, to seek alternative ways to achieve their
goals. The Symms bill also would give the President a legislative
weapon to use in his fight to make all federal agencies fully and
consistently put the right of property ahead of the power of
bureaucrats.

 <P>     Just Compensation. The Fifth Amendment's requirement that when
the government takes private property the government must compensate
the owner is referred to interchangeably as the "Just Compensation
Clause," the "Eminent Domain Clause," or the "Takings Clause." Thus,
if the government needs land on which to build a road, it must pay the
owner for the land. The Fifth Amendment also applies to other
infringements of property rights that fall short of total
confiscation; on these, however, the courts have upheld the right to
compensation only inconsistently. 

 <P>     In recent years property owners have found the use and enjoyment
of their property more and more restricted by regulators, often in the
name of environmental protection. Thus, for example, individuals have
bought land for houses only to be told that they are no longer allowed
to build. Farmers have bought land for farming only to be told that
they are not allowed to farm because their land must be left in its
natural state. Businesses have been told to shut down mining
operations not, as it turns out, to prevent them from polluting, but
because their mining property has been designated as a "wetland" that
must be preserved. Typically in such cases, the government has not
voluntarily compensated the owners for their losses.

 <P>     Shift in Court. Since 1987, however, the Supreme Court has
started to recognize that regulation is often used as a substitute for
the power of eminent domain: Instead of buying land outright, the
government often tries to avoid the requirement of paying compensation
by simply commanding property owners to use their land in whatever
manner the government wishes. In the face of this practice, however,
the Supreme Court has begun to hold that regulation, as much as
outright confiscation, can be subject to the constitutional
requirement of just compensation. In response to this shift in the
Supreme Court's treatment of regulatory takings, Ronald Reagan in 1988
issued Executive Order 12630, which requires federal agencies to
determine in advance if their actions may prompt a claim for
compensation. The purpose of the Order is twofold: to protect private
property owners from the inadvertent, de facto confiscation of their
property through regulation, and to control and limit the amount that
taxpayers have to pay in just compensation awards to people whose
property has been taken by federal regulation. Such awards will soon
become a major budget item. The total amount of all such outstanding
claims is over one billion dollars and growing rapidly.

 <P>     The Executive Order has been applied diligently by some
government agencies but has been resisted by others. A future
President, moreover, could rescind the order. Symms's bill would make
permanent the protection offered by the Executive Order and require
that the Attorney General certify that each agency is in compliance
with the Order's principles.

  <P>    The Symms legislation could be improved if it required that
compensation be paid out of the budget of the agency at fault in
taking private property without compensation. This would give agencies
a strong incentive to avoid unnecessary takings of the property rights
of the citizens.


<P>THE FIFTH AMENDMENT
<P>
      The federal government and the states have the power to condemn
and take over land for such public uses as roads, parks, post offices,
or military bases. The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution
stipulates that in such cases, which are called "takings," the owner
must be compensated for the loss of the property. As the Supreme Court
has explained, "The Fifth Amendment's guarantee that private property
shall not be taken for a public use without just compensation was
designed to bar Government from forcing some people alone to bear
public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by
the public as a whole." (Armstrong v. United States, 364 U.S. 40, 49
(1960).) Since the general public thus benefits, the Court has
declared, "the public at large, rather than a single owner, must bear
the burden of an exercise of state power in the public interest."
(Agins v. City of Tiburon, 447 U.S. 255, 260-61 (1980).) 

  <P>    Although the Just Compensation Clause in the Fifth Amendment is
mainly concerned with land, it applies to any kind of property.
Example: If in a military emergency the government were to confiscate
airplanes or ships from private owners, or simply require that they be
turned over to the government for the duration of the emergency, the
government would have to compensate the owners.

 <P>     Government can take an interest in property short of complete
ownership, moreover, and still be required to pay compensation for
what it has taken. Thus, for example, where flights of government
aircraft over private property are so low and frequent as to
constitute a direct and immediate interference with the use and
enjoyment of the land, the government has taken a flight easement for
which it must pay damages to the landowner. (United States v. Causby,
328 U.S. 256, 267 (1946).) 
<P>
REGULATORY TAKINGS

<P>      The government also takes property rights by imposing
restrictions on the use of property. Suppose, for example, the
government wants to preserve a forest or a wetland in its natural
condition, either for recreational use or for a wildlife refuge. If
the government were to condemn the land outright, there would be no
question about its obligation to compensate the landowner. 

 <P>     Yet, suppose further that the government decides to leave legal
title to the land with its private owner and passes a regulation
prohibiting the owner from developing the land, or from farming it, or
from doing anything else that changes the land's natural state. In
this case the government would be compelling the private landowner to
devote the land to whatever use the government desires. In effect, the
government here takes away from the owner the right to use the land.
The private owner of the land would be owner in name only; the
effective owner would be the government, although in almost all
instances the private owner would still be liable for the payment of
property taxes on the land. This would be an attempt to circumvent the
Fifth Amendment and to achieve the same ends as would outright
condemnation, but without paying compensation. 

  <P>    Common Law Rights. Not all regulations, of course, infringe on
private property rights. Under the common law of property and tort, a
landowner's property rights are defined and limited by the property
rights of his neighbors. If a regulation merely prevents someone from
engaging in activities that would violate the rights of others under
the common law of nuisance or trespass, (The common law kept clear the
important distinction between inflicting a harm and withdrawing or
denying a benefit. In general, only physical invasions counted as
injuries and could give rise to a cause of action. See Richard A.
Epstein, Takings: Private Property and the Power of Eminent Domain
(Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1985), pp. 107-125.) such
as polluting a river that runs through a neighbors's land, then the
landowner has no right to compensation, even though the value of the
landowner's land may be diminished as a result of the prohibition.
This is because the landowner has no right to engage in such
activities to begin with. (See, e.g., Office of Legal Policy, U.S.
Department of Justice, Economic Liberties Protected by the
Constitution, March 16, 1988, pp. 7-11, 32.) Regulations in such cases
actually would protect private property rights.

  <P>    The Easement Option. By contrast, if a particular activity would
not violate the property rights of others as defined under the common
law of trespass or nuisance and would not give others any legal ground
to sue, then a landowner has the right to engage in the activity on
his or her own land. If a neighbor wants to prevent the landowner from
engaging in some activity that does not violate the neighbor's
property rights, the neighbor must pay the landowner to abstain from
the activity; and if the neighbor wants to stop the activity
permanently, he or she must purchase an easement from the landowner.
(An easement is a right over the property of another. An affirmative
easement is a right of use, such as a right of way allowing one to
pass over the land of another to access a road or a beach, or a right
to discharge water onto neighboring land. A negative easement is a
restriction on the use of land by its owner, prohibiting him from
doing something which would otherwise be lawful. A negative easement
may also be called a "restrictive covenant" or a "negative servitude."
Black's Law Dictionary, Fifth Edition (St. Paul, Minn.: West
Publishing Company, 1979), pp. 457-58, 1182, 1229.) 

  <P>    This means that any regulation that prevents people from
engaging in activities on their land that do not violate the property
rights of others abridges the property rights of the landowners whose
activities are restricted. Specifically, such a regulation takes away
some of the landowners' rights in the use and enjoyment of their land,
in effect taking an easement that should have been theirs to sell.
Even if many other desirable uses are still permitted to the
landowners, the regulation is a partial taking. As such, the
landowners deserve to be compensated for whatever property rights they
have lost. 

  <P>    Computing Compensation. Whenever a regulation takes away private
property rights, the proper measure of compensation is the difference
between the value of the property with and without the regulation;
this difference is the value of the easement the government has taken.
Of course, if the property is worth just as much with the regulation
as it is without it, then no loss in value has been caused, and no
compensation is owed. Similarly, some government actions may reduce
the value of land without taking away property rights, and hence do
not give rise to an obligation to compensate. Example: A decision to
close an exit along a particular highway, or to build a new highway
someplace else, may diminish the value of hotels and restaurants along
the original highway. If the landowners' property rights in the use of
their land have been left fully intact, however, then they are not
entitled to compensation out of taxpayer funds. 

 <P>     The mere fact that a regulation amounts to a taking does not
mean that the government cannot go forward with the planned
regulation. It simply means that the government must pay compensation
in order to do so. The only issue properly involved in regulatory
takings cases under the Fifth Amendment is the right to compensation,
not the validity of the regulations.
<P>

PROBLEMS IN THE CASE LAW

 <P>     Although the Supreme Court has recognized for at least 70 years
that regulations can constitute a taking of private property for
public use, (Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393 (1922). The
Court considered but rejected a regulatory taking claim some 35 years
earlier in Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U.S. 623 (1887).) it has awarded
compensation only rarely. Often the Court found procedural or
technical reasons to avoid ruling on regulatory taking claims. In many
cases, the Court has denied compensation on the ground that the
regulation is an exercise of the "police power" of the federal
government or of the state governments, even though the Fifth
Amendment contains no "police power" exception. ( For examples of
regulations that have been upheld on "police power" grounds, see
Office of Legal Policy, op. cit., p. 35; Epstein, op. cit., pp.
112-15, 121-25, 130-34, 140-41.) 

 <P>     Police power originally referred only to government action that
sought to guard against genuine threats to health, safety, or
property. Examples of this might include zoning laws that ban toxic
waste dumps or nuclear reactors from residential areas. Over the
years, however, the term "police power" has been expanded to cover
virtually any government action. As a result, any action that is for a
public use or purpose usually constitutes an exercise of the police
power in the eyes of the court. 

 <P>     In cases in which the plaintiff seeks to invalidate a
regulation, the "police power" doctrine can be appropriate. (For
example, in Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U.S. 365
(1926), the first case to uphold zoning against a constitutional
challenge, the plaintiff did not even seek just compensation under the
Fifth Amendment in his appeal before the Supreme Court (although he
had sought just compensation in the courts below), but instead merely
sought an injunction against enforcement of the zoning ordinance on
the ground that it took his property without due process of law, in
violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.) But it is not appropriate in
cases where the plaintiff is merely seeking compensation. The fact
that a regulation that takes private property rights may fall within
the police power, as that power has come to be defined by the courts,
only suffices to show that the regulation is consistent with the Fifth
Amendment's requirement that takings be for public use; it cannot
eliminate the requirement that just compensation be paid. Before it
clarified matters in 1987, (See Keystone Bituminous Coal Ass'n v.
DeBenedictis, 480 U.S. 470, 491 n. 20 (1987).) the Supreme Court often
acted as though the issue before it was whether a regulation was
valid, when in fact the proper constitutional issue was whether a
constitutionally valid regulation nonetheless required payment of just
compensation. 

  <P>    Confusing the Issue. The Supreme Court also has held sometimes
that a regulation is not a taking of property unless the regulation
leaves the property owner with no remaining "economically viable use"
of his property. (E.g., Agins v. City of Tiburon, 447 U.S. 255, 260
(1980); United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc., 474 U.S. 121,
127 (1985). Other cases have explicitly or implicitly rejected this
view. E.g., Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393 (1922);
Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419 (1982). The
Court has never specified just how remunerative a remaining use must
be in order to count as "economically viable.") This has meant that a
regulation must render the affected property essentially worthless
before the Supreme Court will recognize a taking and award
compensation. In these cases, the Court seems to have confused the
issue of whether a taking has occurred with the issue of how much
should be paid as compensation. 

  <P>    Obviously, if a regulation leaves a property owner with some
remaining "economically viable use" of his property, then the owner is
not entitled to receive the full pre-regulation value of his property
as compensation. The owner is entitled, however, to compensation for
the drop in value resulting from the regulation, regardless of whether
the property's remaining value is great or small, so long as it is
less than the pre-regulation value. There is a middle ground between
paying the full value of the affected property as compensation and
paying nothing. This middle ground consists of paying the value not of
the property in its entirety, but of the easement that de facto has
been taken.
<P>

REVERSING THE TREND

 <P>     In 1987 the Supreme Court's treatment of the Fifth Amendment's
Just Compensation Clause began to change significantly. First, the
Court made clear that the "police power" doctrine, which it often had
used to uphold the validity of statutes, does not apply to takings
claims brought under the Fifth Amendment, and hence does not
constitute an exception to the Just Compensation Clause. (See Keystone
Bituminous Coal Ass'n v. DeBenedictis, 480 U.S. 470, 491 n. 20
(1987).) The Court also explicitly rejected the notion that the only
remedy for a regulatory taking is invalidation of the regulation,
making clear that compensation is an appropriate remedy (When the
government formally seeks to condemn a piece of land, compelling the
owner to sell, it institutes an eminent domain proceeding. When a
landowner whose land has been invaded or restricted by government, but
who has retained legal title in his land due to the government's
failure to invoke the power of eminent domain, wishes to obtain
compensation by compelling the government to buy the land (or at least
an easement therein), he institutes an inverse condemnation
proceeding.) even for a partial or temporary taking. (First English
Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, 482
U.S. 304 (1987). First English dealt with a temporary taking, but the
underlying principle is equally applicable to permanent takings of
partial interests in property.) The Court further explicitly
recognized that easements are a form of partial taking of property
that can arise in the context of regulation or a permit-application
process. (Nollan v. California Coastal Comm'n, 483 U.S. 825 (1987). In
Nollan, the Court found a taking where the California Coastal
Commission refused to grant a building permit to owners of beachfront
property unless they agreed to convey to the government an easement
for public access to the beach over their land.) Finally, the Court
explicitly rejected the notion that "economically viable use" of a
landowner's remaining property rights will always necessarily bar an
award of just compensation for an easement that was taken. (Nollan,
483 U.S. at 830, 834-37. See also Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan
CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419 (1982). Both of these cases involved
regulatory actions requiring landowners to submit to physical
invasions of their land or buildings by others. However, the principle
of providing partial compensation for a partial taking should apply
regardless of the nature of the easement taken.) 

 <P>     These rulings all made it easier for landowners whose property
rights are taken by regulation to obtain just compensation, prompting
an attorney with the Congressional Research Service to proclaim the
emergence of "a court trend supporting increased protection of private
property against government controls." (137 Cong. Rec. S684 (daily
edition, January 14, 1991) (statement of Senator Symms) (the
identities of the CRS attorney and the publication quoted are not
provided).) 

 <P>     This trend appears likely to continue. The Supreme Court late
last year agreed to hear two cases that will give it an opportunity to
strengthen Fifth Amendment protections of private property. (The Court
heard oral arguments in both cases earlier this year.) The more widely
publicized of the two involves a South Carolina law that prohibits new
building on oceanfront property. (Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal
Council, 112 S. Ct. 436 (cert. granted Nov. 18, 1991) (No. 91-453).)
In this case, a man had bought two beachfront lots in 1986 for a total
of $975,000, planning to build a house for his family on one lot and
to build a house to sell on the other lot. Two years later, South
Carolina passed a law prohibiting new building near the beach. This
law has prevented the man from building a house on his land -- even
though such a house would pose no threat to his neighbors and would be
no closer to the beach than many other nearby lots in the same
development, including those on either side of his, that were built
before the 1988 law was passed. As a result of the law, the two lots
have been rendered virtually worthless.

 <P>     The fact that the Supreme Court has accepted the two cases leads
many observers to predict that the Court will reinvigorate the
constitutional right to just compensation. (The other Fifth Amendment
just compensation case that the Court has agreed to hear involves a
challenge by the owner of a mobile-home park in Escondido, California
to a local rent control ordinance. Yee v. City of Escondido, 112 S.
Ct. 294 (cert. granted October 15, 1991) (No. 90-1947).)

  <P>    Substantial Awards. The trend toward granting compensation for
regulatory takings also has been reflected in the United States Claims
Court, the special federal court in Washington, D.C., that hears all
just compensation claims against the federal government. In 1990, for
example, for the first time ever, the Claims Court held that two
landowners who had been denied permits under the federal Clean Water
Act to use their land in various ways because the government had
classified the land as a "wetland" were entitled to just compensation
because the government failed to prove that the substances that would
have been discharged into the wetlands would have lowered water
quality. (In the vast majority of cases under the Clean Water Act, the
decision to deny a landowner a permit to fill in a wetland has nothing
to do with any polluting properties of the substance that would be
used to fill the wetland; often this substance consists simply of dirt
taken from one part of the wetland and deposited onto another. See
William G. Laffer III, "Protecting Ecologically Valuable Wetlands
without Destroying Property Rights," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder
No. 840, July 15, 1991.) The Claims Court awarded the respective
landowners over $1 million dollars in one case (Florida Rock
Industries v. United States, 21 Cl. Ct. 161 (1990) (involving the
mining of limestone). This case is now on appeal before the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.) and over $2.6 million in another,
(Loveladies Harbor, Inc. v. United States, 21 Cl. Ct. 153 (1990)
(involving the building of houses). This case is now on appeal before
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.) specifically
basing its decisions on the distinction between tortious and
nontortious uses of land. (See Florida Rock Industries, 21 Cl. Ct. at
166-68. The only damage that is done when a wetland is filled with
chemically harmless material is to the landowner's own property, the
wetland; there is no physical invasion of anyone else's land or water
such as would give rise to a common-law nuisance action. See Epstein,
op. cit., p. 123.) In each case, it was clear that the decision by the
Army Corps of Engineers to deny a permit under the Clean Water Act had
nothing to do with the prevention of water pollution, but instead was
motivated purely by a desire to preserve the wetlands in question as
wetlands. Therefore, the Corps of Engineers was really confiscating an
easement on the landowners' land, taking away some or all of their
development rights.

<P>      While these two cases are on appeal, there is evidence that
higher courts will side with property owners. In a bellwether case,
(Whitney Benefits, Inc. v. United States, 18 Cl. Ct. 394 (1989),
modified, 20 Cl. Ct. 324 (1990), aff'd, 926 F.2d 1169 (Fed. Cir.),
cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 406 (1991).) the Claims Court in 1989 awarded
over $150 million to a company that had been prohibited by the
Department of the Interior from mining coal on its own land. The Court
of Appeals last year affirmed the decision, and the Supreme Court
declined to take the government's appeal, thereby allowing the lower
court decisions to stand. The Supreme Court's decision not to review
the lower courts' rulings in this case is widely viewed as solid
evidence that it will decide the cases currently before it in favor of
justly compensating the landowners. (See, e.g., Moore, "Showdown on
Property Rights," National Journal, November 30, 1991, p. 2940;
"Environment Laws Face a Stiff Test from Landowners," The New York
Times, January 20, 1992, p. A1.)

<P>
PAYING FOR REGULATORY TAKINGS

 <P>     The increased ability of property owners to secure just
compensation when their property rights are taken by regulations means
that the government, and hence the taxpayers, can expect to pay more
in coming years for actions that restrict property rights. As a
consequence of the court rulings of the past five years, and of the
explosive growth in regulation over the past twenty years, the number
of takings claims filed against the government, the frequency with
which property owners seeking just compensation win, and the average
dollar amount awarded to successful claimants all have increased.
<P><UL><UL>
      Consider the following:
<P>
      52 cases alleging the taking of property and seeking
      compensation were filed with the Claims Court last year, the
      most in at least a decade, and possibly the most ever. ( Ibid.)
<P>
      Nearly 200 takings cases are pending in the Claims Court. (Ibid.
      ) The total compensation that the U.S. would have to pay if
      those seeking redress were to win and receive the full amount
      that they are seeking is well over $1 billion.</UL></UL>
<P>
      Although the United States surely will win and thereby avoid
paying compensation in many of these cases, the frequency with which
property owners seeking just compensation win has risen sharply in
recent years. Property owners won more than half of all regulatory
taking cases decided by the federal courts in 1990, the most recent
year for which figures are available. In contrast, the federal
government wins nine out of ten times in other areas of the law.

 <P>     The growth in federal regulation in the past three years, and
the trend in the courts toward protecting private property owners,
means that the government can expect to pay more in the future to
compensate for regulatory takings.

<P>
EXECUTIVE ORDER 12630

 <P>     On March 15, 1988, in response to the Supreme Court's 1987
takings decisions and the perceived increase in the likelihood of the
federal government having to pay increased just compensation awards,
Ronald Reagan issued an Executive Order dealing with "Government
Actions and Interference With Constitutionally Protected Property
Rights." (Exec. Order No. 12630, 53 Fed. Reg. 8859 (March 18, 1988).)
This detailed Executive Order basically requires each department or
agency in the Executive Branch:
<P><UL><UL>
      to consider in advance whether any contemplated action might,
      under the Supreme Court's case law as it stands at the time of
      the agency's or department's determination, be a taking of
      private property, and hence lead to an eventual judgment against
      the U.S. that must be paid by the Treasury;
<P>
      to estimate the potential cost to the federal government of any
      contemplated action regulating the use of private property, in
      the event that a court later determines that the action
      constituted a taking;
<P>
      to look for alternatives that would achieve the same ends but
      would not involve takings or would impose less on private
      property;
<P>
      to decide in advance whether a particular action that may result
      in a taking is worth what it is likely to cost; and 
<P>
      to set regulatory priorities.</UL></UL>
<P>
      The Executive Order also gives the departments and agencies
detailed and specific instructions on how to minimize the burdens
imposed on private property and the resulting liabilities imposed on
the Treasury. These instructions include: 
<P><UL><UL>
      avoiding undue delays in granting or denying permits, and in
      making other decisions affecting private property;
<P>
      ensuring that permits are granted or denied based on the same
      standard; (This requirement has been violated often in the past.
      The Army Corps of Engineers, for example, routinely abuses its
      enforcement authority under the Clean Water Act, which is purely
      an anti-pollution statute, by granting permits for discharges of
      materials that pose no threat to water quality only on the
      condition that the landowner set aside land for wildlife
      protection at his own expense.)
<P>
      ensuring that restrictions imposed on the use of private
      property are not disproportionate to the contribution of the
      restricted uses to the overall problem that the restrictions are
      imposed to redress.</UL></UL>
<P>
      The purpose of all these measures is to avoid taking private
property inadvertently, and thereby to avoid incurring unanticipated
costs to the taxpayers.

 <P>     Executive Order 12630 does not add to or alter the Fifth
Amendment's requirement that just compensation be paid, the
probability that those landowners whose property is taken will be
paid, or the amount that they will recover if they are paid. It simply
requires Executive Branch agencies and departments to anticipate the
potential fiscal consequences of their actions. 

 <P>     Given the recent changes in the Supreme Court's standards for
awarding just compensation, if federal officials fail to conduct such
an inquiry before acting, they run a significant risk that the federal
government will get stuck with an unexpected bill several years later.
This also would mean that the government could end up being compelled
to pay for properties that it would not have chosen to buy if it had
thought about its priorities in advance. Thus, the Executive Order is
really just a "look before you leap" provision designed primarily to
protect the taxpayers. It mainly is a budgetary tool -- a device for
controlling spending.
<P>
      Paying Costs of Regulation. Yet, the Executive Order also
protects property owners. Since regulators will be forced to refrain
from taking actions that they cannot afford to pay for, many
regulatory takings of private property will be deterred. Regulators no
longer will be able to treat private property as a free good, usable
without limit and without cost. Instead they will have to decide how
much regulation they can afford. 

 <P>     Thus, even though the Executive Order does not affect the
ability of those whose property is taken to obtain compensation, it
will still protect landowners. After all, landowners who have their
property taken without their consent and who receive court-determined
compensation almost always would prefer to forego the compensation and
keep their land. (Presumably even then they would still be entitled to
receive compensation for any temporary taking that had occurred.)
There are two reasons why this is so. First, if the compensation
provided were worth as much in the eyes of the landowner as the
property taken, the landowner would sell voluntarily, and the
government would gain nothing by taking rather than buying. Second,
compensation is risky and uncertain, and difficult and expensive to
seek and obtain. (However, under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and
Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, 42 U.S.C. 4654(c),
those who succeed in obtaining an award of compensation for the taking
of property by a federal agency also receive, as part of their award,
reimbursement for any "reasonable costs, disbursements, and expenses,
including reasonable attorney, appraisal, and engineering fees," that
they are forced to incur in order to obtain their compensation from
the government.) Therefore, although court-determined compensation is
better than nothing, landowners generally would be better off if their
land had not been taken in the first place.
<P>
BEYOND THE EXECUTIVE ORDER: THE NEED FOR A STATUTE
<P>
      Although the Executive Order is a major step toward protecting
private property rights, it lacks the force of law. Officers and
employees of the Executive Branch have no statutory obligation to
comply with the order. Any President, moreover, may rescind the order
at any time. Explains Senator Malcolm Wallop, the Wyoming Republican:
<P><UL><UL>
      But the order is not without shortcomings. It has no teeth.
      Without the possibility of judicial review or the
      requirement of disclosure, the executive branch can ignore
      the order with impunity. Moreover, as with all executive
      orders, it can be withdrawn on a whim. (136 Cong. Rec.
      S10917 (daily edition, July 27, 1990) (statement of Senator
      Wallop).)</UL></UL>

  <P>    To date, some parts of the Executive Branch have been more
diligent and enthusiastic in complying with the Executive Order than
others. Regulators in the EPA, for example, have resisted the
Executive Order because they view it as a threat to their ability to
regulate. (Specifically, the EPA opposed adoption of the Executive
Order, attempted to soften its requirements as much as possible,
attempted to soften the guidelines for implementing the Executive
Order, and actively lobbied against legislation aimed at reinforcing
the Executive Order until the Administration had officially endorsed
the legislation.) In practice, the easiest way to circumvent the
Executive Order is routinely to find "no takings implications" when
performing the "Takings Implication Assessment" required by the
Attorney General's guidelines for implementing the Executive Order.
Existing Supreme Court and lower court precedents are sufficiently
open-ended to allow such a conclusion to be reached in many instances
without an obvious breach of good faith. The Executive Order,
meanwhile, does not limit the government's ability to regulate. The
Takings Clause and the Executive Order allow regulation, but merely
require that it be budgeted before the fact, in the case of the
Executive Order, and paid for after the fact, in the case of Takings
Clause. 

 <P>     To strengthen the Executive Order and give it the force of law,
Senator Symms introduced his Private Property Rights Act, S. 50. The
Bush Administration strongly supports S. 50, and the Senate approved
the bill last year. The House of Representatives, however, has not yet
even considered the measure. The proposed legislation states that:
<P> <UL><UL>
      No regulation promulgated after the date of enactment of
      this Act by any agency shall become effective until the
      issuing agency is certified by the Attorney General to be
      in compliance with Executive Order 12630 or similar
      procedures to assess the potential for the taking of
      private property in the course of Federal regulatory
      activity, with the goal of minimizing such taking where
      possible. (S. 50, 102nd Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1991).)</UL></UL>
<P> 
This language would prevent any new regulation from taking
effect unless the agency issuing the regulation:
<P> <UL><UL>
1)    has adopted procedures for assessing the potential impact of its
      regulatory activity on private property, as required by the
      Executive Order; and 

2)    has had its compliance with the applicable procedures certified
      by the Attorney General.</UL></UL>

 <P>      Not only would the Symms bill force the bureaucracies to take
the Executive Order more seriously by putting conditions on their
ability to regulate, but it would make permanent the protection
afforded to private property by the Executive Order. Executive
departments and agencies would not be able to regulate until the
Attorney General had certified their compliance with the applicable
procedures for assessing the impact of regulatory activity on private
property. And the Attorney General cannot certify such compliance if
such procedures do not exist. Therefore, no subsequent President could
rescind the Executive Order without replacing it with something
equivalent. 

<P>       By making the bureaucrats' ability to regulate conditional upon
their compliance with the Executive Order, or with any similar
procedures that might be adopted in the future, the legislation
proposed by Senator Symms would give regulators an incentive to
respect private property rights.

 <P>      Holding Agencies Accountable. The Symms bill, however, goes only
part way in defending the Fifth Amendment. To prompt regulators to
take the greatest care when regulating property, for example, a bill
could require all just compensation awards to come out of the budget
of the agency or department that had imposed the regulations.
Currently all such judgments come out of a "Judgment Fund"
appropriated separately from any individual agency's or department's
budget. The Executive Order requires the Office of Management and
Budget to "take action to ensure that all takings awards levied
against agencies are properly accounted for in agency budget
submissions." But this requirement is not binding on Congress and may
be repealed by the President at any time. Last year the Bush
Administration proposed legislation that would require agencies and
departments to reimburse the Judgment Fund out of their individual
budgets, but not Representative or Senator has yet introduced the
Administration's bill.
<P> 
CONCLUSION

 <P>      A fundamental goal of government is to protect the property of
its citizens. Each American correctly considers it her or his
birthright to be free to acquire land on which to build a home or to
use however she or he sees fit, so long as this use does not interfere
physically with the rights of neighbors. Businesses acquire land for
productive use, providing goods, services and jobs for Americans.

 <P>      Reducing the Regulatory Burden. When the government takes or
restricts the use of property for some public good, it must compensate
the owner. This is stated plainly in the Fifth Amendment. Without this
compensation, the government ceases being the protector of property
and instead becomes its violator. In America, based as it is on
individual rights and private enterprise, the government should go out
of its way to assure that property rights are strictly protected. The
Symms bill will make certain that property owners are compensated for
government restrictions or takings of their property. And it will help
stem the growth of regulations that not only affect individuals but
impose a heavy burden on a currently staggering economy as well.

<H3><I> CLINTON DEFENSE INCREASES:<br>
GOOD START,
                       BUT NOT ENOUGH </I></H3>

             By Lawrence T. DiRita and Baker Spring<P>
             (Published at 2 pages, December 12, 1994)
<P>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>

          
 President Bill Clinton on December 1 recognized publicly what others
have long known: America's armed forces are woefully underfunded to
perform the missions that have been assigned to them. Clinton
announced a plan to ask Congress for some $2 billion in supplemental
appropriations for defense in fiscal 1995 to pay for peacekeeping
operations in Haiti and elsewhere. He also outlined an additional $25
billion for the six years from 1996 through 2001.
<P>
     Clinton's announcement is a good first step toward correcting the
decline in military readiness that has occurred during his tenure, but it
does not go far enough. Outside estimates of the shortfall in defense
spending range from The Heritage Foundation's $100 billion to the
General Accounting Office's $150 billion. Military pay has fallen behind
comparable civilian pay by as much as 12 percent. Funds needed for
day-to-day operations and maintenance are now being used to pay for
unexpected and unfunded peacekeeping operations like the one in Haiti.
Future force modernization is threatened both by a drastic decline in
procurement spending and by a significant reduction in research and
development spending. And the size and organization of the armed
forces are inadequate to meet the Administration's official goal of being
able to fight and win two major regional conflicts "nearly
simultaneously."
<P>
Opening for Congress.
<P>
Clinton's defense spending increases are not enough to correct all of these
problems. Only declining military pay is addressed by the Administration's
plan. More must be done. Congress must now step in and solve the many
problems caused by Clinton's underfunding of America's armed forces.
 <P>
     Much of this will be done if Congress passes the "Contract With
America," the GOP's campaign platform in the last election. One of the bills
in the Contract is the National Security Restoration Act, which
acknowledges the Clinton Administration's defense planning shortcomings,
particularly the shortfalls in defense spending. The bill raises concerns about
the impact of defense cuts on combat readiness, force structure, weapons
modernization, and ballistic missile defense programs.
<P>
     The supplemental appropriations bill Clinton intends to introduce will
give Congress a chance to get an early start on addressing issues in the
Contract. Thus, Congress should:
<P>
Add $8 billion to $10 billion to the $2 billion requested by Clinton for fiscal
1995, most of which should go for modernization. This additional funding
should be used to replace aging weapons with modern ones and to develop
new ones. Because of funding cuts, many weapons are being kept
operational longer than they should be. For example, the average age of the
Army's main battle tank will have more than doubled by the end of the
decade. On top of that, defense cuts are inhibiting the Pentagon's ability to
develop new generation weapons to replace old ones. Research and
development funding has dropped by 10 percent in real terms since
President Clinton took office. This reduction has had a severe impact on the
program to develop anti-missile defenses. Unless something is done to
reverse these trends, American soldiers will be relying on aging weapons
that may be not only worn out, but also outdated. U.S. forces need modern
weapons and equipment to prevail on the battlefield and to reduce casualties,
as was demonstrated during the Persian Gulf War.
 <P>
 Place strict limits on U.S. participation in "operations other than war,"
including peacekeeping. The National Security Restoration Act in the
Contract With America ensures a great deal more congressional oversight
of U.S. participation in U.N. peacekeeping than has been the case. This will
include a requirement that the President specify "the source of funding for
the [U.S.] share of the costs" prior to committing forces. This should stop
what has become the common practice of diverting funds intended for fuel,
training, and routine maintenance. But Congress should consider applying
similar constraints to peacekeeping operations for the remainder of fiscal
1995. The options include asking the Pentagon in advance for a proposed
budget for an operation, limiting the portion of the force that may be
committed to such operations, and requiring that the Secretary of Defense
certify that all military combat units are in the highest readiness status
before new peacekeeping or humanitarian missions are undertaken.
<P>
     As these measures are undertaken, Congress should specify that no
action taken to constrain the participation of U.S. forces in United Nations
operations should be construed as a restriction on the President's freedom
to dispatch U.S. forces in defense of U.S. interests or in a national
emergency. In doing so, Congress would be drawing a clear distinction
between legitimate constraints on U.S. participation in U.N. operations and
inadvisable restrictions on presidential prerogatives as imposed by the War
Powers Resolution of 1973. This Resolution unwisely interferes with the
President's authority as commander in chief to deploy forces in defense of
American interests. 
<P>
Remove non-defense spending from the Pentagon's budget.
The Congressional Research Service has identified $5.8 billion in the 1995
defense authorization bill for "items that may not be directly related to
traditional military capabilities." This includes $10 million for "U.S.-Japan
Management Training" and nearly $300 million for AIDS, prostate, and
breast cancer research. When environmental clean-up and research programs
are included, this figure rises to more than $11 billion. This list is a good
starting point for obtaining funds within the defense budget to apply
improving readiness.
 <P>
Restore the ballistic missile defense program.<P>
The Contract With America places a high priority on restoring America's
missile defense program, which has been practically decimated by Clinton's
cuts. A good first step would be to spend between $1 billion and $2 billion
of the $8 billion to $10 billion in additional funding for ballistic missile
defense in fiscal 1995. Programs targeted for increased spending should be
1) the space-based interceptor program, 2) the Lightweight Exo-Atmospheric
Projectile (LEAP) interceptor program, 3) the "Brilliant Eyes" sensor
satellite for detecting and tracking enemy missiles in flight, 4) the advanced
light-weight satellite program, 5) the Navy's Upper-Tier Interceptor
program, 6) the space-based laser program, and 7) the Boost-Phase
Interceptor program.
<P>
     Congress should also consider passing an amendment directing the
Administration to observe a moratorium on negotiations with Russia or other
countries regarding the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty. This
treaty, which bans the deployment of strategic defenses, is outdated and
should be abandoned. An agreement with the Russians to change the
agreement cosmetically would only perpetuate a treaty that does not serve
American security interests.
<P>
CONCLUSION <P>
President Clinton's decision to increase defense spending is an
acknowledgment of what many have known for over a year: The Clinton
Administration has been underfunding America's armed forces. It also is an
acknowledgment of a central premise of the Contract With America:
Sending U.S. forces on peacekeeping and other U.N. errands while
drastically cutting the defense budget is a recipe for declining military
readiness. The $25 billion supplemental spending request for the Pentagon
is a good start in correcting this problem. But the job of restoring America's
military strength is not done. It is up to the 104th Congress to resolve a
problem which the President allowed to get out of hand.

 <H3><I> TEN STEPS TO ADDRESS NORTH KOREA'S NUCLEAR THREAT </I></H3>
By Richard V. Allen<br>                       
Exeuctive Memorandum #378<BR>
 3/31/94<BR>
(published at 2 pages)

<P>


     North Korea's ambition to build an arsenal of nuclear weapons
threatens not only America's ally, the Republic of Korea (ROK), and
the 37,000 American troops in that country, but also America's vital
interest in preserving peace in Asia.  The crisis escalated in mid-
March, when North Korea refused to allow international inspectors to
examine a suspected North Korean nuclear fuel reprocessing facility --
a vital component in nuclear weapons production -- and then, when in
response, South Korea and the United States decided to upgrade and
augment their military forces.  The current impasse will not likely
lead to war, but a protracted period of intense confrontation with
North Korea is possible.  During this difficult time, the United
States must now exercise the leadership to derail and ultimately end
North Korea's nuclear ambitions.  A strategy to achieve these
objectives would incorporate ten recommendations:
<P>
1) Lead the Allied Coalition.  
 <P>    The United States must be ready to lead its allies, especially
the ROK and Japan, in what may become a protracted and tense
confrontation with North Korea.  The goal should be to convince North
Korea to dismantle its nuclear weapons-making facilities.  Washington
must not defer leadership to any other country or to the United
Nations.  North Korea's nuclear weapons program is a threat to vital
American interests.  A failure of American leadership may invite
conflict or cause other states in Asia to consider building their own
nuclear weapons. 
<P>
2) Stop Japanese Funding.  
  <P>   Washington should tell Tokyo that it must do its utmost to stop,
as soon as possible, the flow of cash from Japan to North Korea.  As
much as $1 billion a year flows into North Korea from Koreans living
in Japan.  This money comes mainly from gambling profits made in
popular pachinko parlors, and is North Korea's most important source
of foreign exchange to purchase fuel and other supplies.
<P>
3) Understand the Risks of Sanctions.  
 <P>    Washington should be prepared to seek broad economic sanctions
against North Korea, such as calling for the termination of all trade
with that regime.  However, the U.S. government needs to inform the
American people and its allies that economic sanctions could result in 
greater tensions with North Korea, and that the risk of war would be
increased. 
<P>
 4) Bolster Allied Military Forces.  
  <P>   The U.S. and South Korea should immediately correct any
deficiencies in their respective military forces in order to deter a
North Korean attack.  Washington should accelerate the deployment of
Patriot missiles to defend against North Korean SCUD missiles. 
America also should systematically dispatch additional attack aircraft
and ground-support helicopters to counter North Korea's large
advantage in artillery and armor.  Plans should be made to augment the
Pacific Fleet, including the deployment of one more aircraft carrier,
for a total of two on station in Northeast Asia.  Washington should
urge Seoul to reinforce its counter-artillery capability, upgrade its
minefields, and increase its ammunition stocks. 
<P>
5) Increase Intelligence Capabilities.  
<P>     Washington should review the adequacy of America's intelligence
collection to improve the quality of intelligence assessments
available to decision makers, especially those that go to President
Clinton.  North Korea is the most isolated regime on earth, and
accurate intelligence about that country, its leadership, and their
intentions is very scarce.  The President has a critical need for
timely intelligence on the prospect for a North Korean invasion of
South Korea, which would constitute the first major national security
crisis of his term.  Washington cannot rely exclusively on "national
technical means" such as satellites, which are unable to locate
underground nuclear facilities in North Korea.  In addition,
Washington should increase intelligence coordination with Tokyo and
Seoul. 
<P>
6) Seek Bipartisan Expertise.  
<P>     The Clinton Administration should tap into an underutilized
resource: the many people with extraordinary knowledge and experience
on Korea who have served in previous Administrations and in the
Congress.  These experienced Americans would be more than willing to
help, and ought to be consulted. 
<P>
7) Build U.S. Public Support.  
<P>     The Clinton Administration urgently needs to build a bipartisan
consensus and to seek broad public support for its Korea policy.  The
President and Administration spokesmen should explain candidly and in
much greater detail to the American people the threat posed by North
Korea.  In addition, they should explain the value of America's long
alliance with the Republic of Korea and contrast the progress in
democratization made by ROK President Kim Young Sam with the brutal
totalitarian regime of North Korea's Kim Il Sung.
<P>
8) Do Not Rely on China or Russia.  
  <P>   The U.S. should not rely on surrogates such as China and Russia
to carry out its policy objectives in the region.  Nevertheless,
Washington should consult with Russia and even formulate military
contingency plans.  As for China, an important maxim must be kept in
mind: Beijing does not have allies, only interests.  Today, China
prefers a divided Korean Peninsula and cannot be relied upon to take
action to stop North Korea's nuclear weapons program.  Beijing is
Pyongyang's most important friend, supplying 75 percent of its oil. 
If political and economic sanctions are necessary to stop North
Korea's nuclear weapons program, the U.S. should make clear to China
that its cooperation is expected and then establish consequences for
Chinese non-compliance.  Moreover, the U.S. should not yield the
command of its military forces to the United Nations.
<P>
9) Interdict North Korean Missile Sales.  
<P>  The U.S. should be prepared to interdict North Korean missile sales
and transfers of technology.  It should also seek Russian and Chinese
cooperation in stopping its citizens from assisting North Korean
missile or nuclear weapons development programs.
<P>
10) Do Not Cut the U.S. Defense Budget.  
 <P>   Cutting the U.S. defense budget is the wrong message to send to
North Korea at this time.  The Clinton Administration should make up
any defense budget shortfalls, such as the $50 billion shortfall
identified by former Defense Secretary Les Aspin.
<P>
     North Korea's nuclear challenge poses the first real foreign
policy crisis for President Clinton.  He deserves the support of all
Americans as he tries to resolve this crisis.  Taking these steps
would help President Clinton strengthen American leadership and help
defuse North Korea's threat.  Strong, principled American leadership,
based on a clearly articulated strategy with broad bipartisan
congressional and public support is necessary because the stakes are
so high.  North Korea's misreading of American resolve might lead to
the outbreak of war on the Korean Peninsula, with far reaching
consequences for South Korea's 42 million people, and for peace in
Asia.  For the long run, a failure to pressure North Korea now may
result in its acquiring nuclear weapons and eventually transferring
them to other dangerous regimes.  Hence, postponing decisive action
now may invite a larger crisis in the future.

WHY BUDGET DEBATE MUST NOT SIDELINE AGRICULTURAL REFORM

<h3><i>WHY BUDGET DEBATE MUST NOT SIDELINE AGRICULTURAL REFORM</h3></i>
<p>
By John E. Frydenlund<br>
Director, Agricultural Policy Project<br>
Executive Memorandum No. 417<br>
June 16, 1995<br>
</center><hr size=3 Width=30%>
<p>

    Conferees are working now to resolve differences between the House and Senate versions of
the FY 1996 budget resolution (H.Con.Res. 67). One area they need to address more boldly is
agriculture. Decisions made during the budget process about funding for U.S. agriculture programs
will have an impact far beyond budget deficit considerations. It may be politically expedient to make
only minor modifications in farm programs, but this would be harmful to farmers in the long run.
Congress must not allow the budget process to thwart the bold reforms needed to enhance U.S.
competitiveness, increase farm income, and revitalize the rural economy. More specifically, Congress
should not make agricultural policy decisions in budget reconciliation that preclude pursuing real
reform in the 1995 farm bill.
<p>
     While the need for serious deficit reduction should spur agricultural reform, Congress resists
change. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici (R-NM) initially sought farm program
reductions of $35 billion-$50 billion over the next five years. However, after intense lobbying by
opponents of reform, the final Senate budget resolution reduced the planned savings to only $28
billion. In addition, a non-binding resolution limits savings from commodity programs to no more
than 20 percent of the total, so Congress must find $22.5 billion in savings from nutrition programs.
In the House budget resolution, nutrition programs must absorb more than two-thirds of the
reductions -- $21 billion -- and commodity programs less than one-third. Senate Agriculture
Committee Chairman Richard Lugar (R-IN) has suggested that $15 billion in savings could be found
in the  commodity and export programs, which would be an even split with nutrition programs. 
<p>
    Being required to find significant savings in commodity programs might force Congress to
adopt real reform. However, if the budget conferees settle on a lower level of savings, perhaps only
$9 billion or less, they are likely to wind up merely tinkering with existing ineffective programs, and
the opportunity for real reform will be lost. Opponents could thwart real reform, particularly in the
House, by incorporating the farm bill into budget reconciliation and bringing it to the floor with rules
that prevent either amendments or votes on specific programs. This would prevent the rest of
Congress, particularly advocates of fundamental reform, from voting for elimination of the sugar,
peanut, and supply control programs, for example, or a much-needed phaseout of the commodity
subsidies upon which supply controls are built.
<p>
    Opponents of fundamental reform claim they are protecting the interests of America's farmers.
But central planning has worked no better in agriculture than it has anywhere else it has ever been
tried. It holds back   farmers and makes them work to satisfy bureaucrats, not consumers. Nor do
farm programs protect small family farmers:  payments go overwhelmingly to the wealthiest farmers. 
<p>
    The most absurd argument put forward by opponents is that structural reform actually would
result in budgetary costs to the government. This contention rests on two fallacies:
<p>

<b>Budget Fallacy #1:</b>  Eliminating acreage reduction programs would cost the government money.
<p>
    Eliminating acreage reduction programs would cost the government money only if the
additional acres planted were eligible to receive the current level of deficiency payments and there
were only modest reductions in the subsidy level per acre. 
<p>
    Proposals such as those advanced by The Heritage Foundation, however, would eliminate
acreage reduction programs and phase out deficiency payments. Rather than receive payments for
crops planted on this additional acreage, farmers would be free to plant whatever it made sense to
produce for the market. This proposal would save the taxpayer billions of dollars, allow farmers to
produce what they want on these additional acres, increase farm income, and stimulate the rural
economy. Under any credible analysis, eliminating acreage reduction programs increases farm
income. The new export opportunities made possible under the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, among other factors, allow output to increase substantially with only a short-term weakening
of prices. The result:  revenue per farm increases.
<p>
    The static economic analyses preferred by defenders of the status quo erroneously assume that
relatively  modest increases in production result in extreme reductions in the market price, inevitably
concluding that eliminating acreage reduction increases government costs. But this ignores recent
bumper crops that did not result in lower prices, as well as evidence that there will be a rapid growth
in the future global demand for food.
<p>

<b>Budget Fallacy #2:</b>  Some programs, such as sugar, are important revenue producers. 
<p>
    By imposing duties on strictly limited imports of sugar, the federal government did indeed
raise about $3   million in the last fiscal year. Proponents of the sugar program also point to
government receipts for assessments on domestic sugar production. These amounted to only $24
million in FY 1994, while the extra costs to consumers was $1.4 billion. This is a heavy economic
price to pay for a program that gives a small cartel of sugar processors and landlords the power to
parcel out the right to grow sugar.
<p>
    For Congress to buy these fallacious arguments would be to allow the special interests to stop
reforms that would help America's farmers and rural communities. Congress has a rare opportunity
this year to demonstrate to American farmers, consumers, and taxpayers that it truly is working in
their best interests. Current commodity programs not only are expensive for taxpayers, but also hold
down farm income. Moving toward a free market would permit farmers to produce for the consumer
rather than for the government.
<p>
    A free market reform of agricultural policy would:
<p>
<ul> <li>Eliminate all authority for acreage reduction and set-aside programs;<br>

<li>Eliminate the sugar and peanut programs;<br>

<li>Phase out deficiency payments for wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice and phase out the dairy
program; and<br>

<li>Phase out the Conservation Reserve Program.</ul> 
<p>
     The 1995 farm bill is an historic opportunity to develop market-oriented reforms of
agricultural policy. The budget reconciliation process should not be used to block such reform. If
Congress allows this to happen, the U.S. share of world agriculture markets will continue to shrink,
eroding farm income and hurting rural communities. But if the 1995 farm bill eliminates government
subsidies and controls, America's farmers will be able to   outproduce and outsell the rest of the
world, with their expanded output generating a tremendous growth in farm income. This freedom to
produce will also mean a large boost to the rural economy as supply and distribution industries retool
and reinvest to meet the new demands of a larger farm economy. In fact, according to  Heritage
estimates, rural America would get a $35 billion shot in the arm, which would include an increase in
farm income of more than $14 billion over the next five years. Many communities that are dying
under today's command-and-control programs would spring back to life.1

<title>Setting the Record Straight on the Albanian Elections -- Heritage</title>

<h3> SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON THE ALBANIAN ELECTIONS</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/phillips.htm">James Phillips</a><br> 
Senior Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 453<br>
June 14, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;



Albania's May 26 parliamentary elections, which produced a landslide political victory for President Sali Berisha's Democratic Party, have come under fire. Opposition parties, led by the former communists of the Socialist Party, charge that the pro-Western Berisha government rigged the elections. While some international election observers have supported the opposition's charges of systematic voter fraud and intimidation, many of these observers -- particularly some of those in the election monitoring delegation of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe-Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (OSCE-ODIHR) -- held a pronounced political bias in favor of the Socialists. Other monitors, such as those from the Washington-based International Republican Institute, have concluded that election violations were not widespread. This interpretation seems borne out by the fact that the election results were roughly similar to exit polls conducted by independent pollsters. The U.S. should avoid being stampeded into a rush to judgment against a friendly government based simply on unsubstantiated charges by anti-American Albanian leftists and their supporters in Western Europe.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

That Albania's parliamentary elections were a rough and tumble affair is hardly surprising, considering that they were only the third free elections since the fall of the Albanian dictatorship. The elections pitted President Berisha's Democratic Party, which has been the driving force behind Albania's political and economic reforms, against the Socialist Party, the renamed successor to the communist party whose iron rule had lasted from 1944 to 1992. The contest was especially bitter because President Berisha had led the opposition forces that toppled the communists from power, and the Socialists were bent on political vengeance. When it became clear to them on election day that their efforts had fallen short, the Socialists withdrew from the elections in the late afternoon, charging that the elections had been a charade. Ironically, this cynical critique of Albania's nascent democracy was vigorously promoted by some of the same communists who had formed the backbone of the Stalinist regime of Enver Hoxa, who had plunged Albania into brutal repression and isolation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

President Berisha, a physician, is far from a dictator. He is a charismatic conservative leader who courageously spoke out against the communists, decisively defeated them in the 1992 elections, and pushed through a popular reform program that has brought great economic benefits to Europe's poorest country. Berisha's privatization reforms have spawned a flourishing private sector that has spearheaded Albania's economic growth, which has averaged about 10 percent annually in recent years. Given his popularity and the success of his political and economic programs, he had little need to rig the elections. Moreover, he had respected the workings of the democratic process in the past, such as the defeat of his proposal for a new constitution in a 1994 national referendum.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The first round of parliamentary elections on May 26 brought an impressive turnout of 89 percent of the Albanian electorate. Berisha's Democratic Party garnered approximately 68 percent of the vote, compared with 65 percent in the 1992 elections. Because the remaining votes splintered among six opposition parties, the Democratic Party won 95 of the 115 directly elected seats in the 140-seat parliament. The Socialist Party claimed that the election results were the product of systematic ballot box stuffing, electoral fraud, and intimidation, but by pulling out of the election monitoring commission on election day, it made it all but impossible to determine the scale of these alleged voting abuses.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The election monitors of the OSCE-ODIHR, who have been the most inclined to support the opposition's claims of vote fraud, may be the least credible of the more than 100 international observers that monitored the elections. Mark Almond, a member of the British Helsinki Human Rights Group election monitoring team, turned up evidence that one team accredited by the OSCE-ODIHR monitoring mission was compromised by direct cooperation with the Socialists, who he suspects organized angry crowds of demonstrators at polling stations visited by the OSCE-ODIHR group. The team in question comprised nine members of a left-wing Norwegian group, Workers' International Solidarity, which enjoyed close relations with the Socialists and even requested translators and transportation from them. The OSCE-ODIHR mission also accredited other Socialist supporters, including a Dane who had organized tours of Albania for sympathetic foreigners during the communist era and a German, accused of a pro-Socialist bias in the German press, whose briefings of other election monitors were tendentious and highly emotional.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Significantly, several other monitoring groups contradicted the bleak picture of the elections presented by the OSCE-ODIHR group. The British Helsinki Human Rights Group found the elections to be free and fair. Jonathan Sunley, a member of the group who also had witnessed the 1991 Albanian elections, was struck by the vast improvement in political conditions, particularly "the orderliness and apparent impartiality surrounding the conduct of the election."  Sunley also noted that "compared with the elections held over the last 12 months in Armenia, Georgia, Belarus, and Russia, all of which were issued a clean bill of health, the infringements and irregularities in Albania were minor."  Election observers from the European Democratic Union also found the Albanian elections to be fair.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The International Republican Institute (IRI), which also deployed an election monitoring team, released a report asserting that "IRI observers did find that in most voting centers they visited the voting procedures were orderly, voter identification was being checked and stamped, and voters had the opportunity to cast a secret ballot in a calm atmosphere."  However, IRI observers did find some irregularities in a few voting centers, which led it to conclude that the results of certain parliamentary races -- but not the elections as a whole -- may have been compromised: "While not widespread, observed voting irregularities raise serious questions about the conduct and integrity of a number of Albania's 1996 Parliamentary contests."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

IRI commissioned an independent American-Albanian polling firm to conduct a survey of voters on election day that found that 62 percent of voters expressed approval of President Berisha and 71 percent were satisfied with the development of democracy. IRI's exit poll predicted that the Democratic Party would win 56 percent of the vote, the Socialists would win 22 percent, and the remainder would be split among a number of smaller parties. This exit poll, with a margin of error of 3.5 percent, is not out of line with the 68 percent of the votes claimed by the Democratic Party, especially considering that many Socialist voters may have foregone voting after the Socialists decided to boycott the elections late on election day. Clearly, if there was cheating, it did not decisively affect the outcome of the elections.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Nevertheless, the Albanian government has taken steps to remove doubts about the integrity of the elections. In an apparent concession to the opposition, President Berisha has ordered new elections to be held on June 16 in 17 parliamentary constituencies where there had been reports of significant irregularities. Berisha also ordered prosecutors to investigate charges of police brutality at a Socialist demonstration held in Tirana on May 29. Seven police officials subsequently were fired for failing to rein in police at the banned demonstration.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

This undoubtedly will not satisfy the Socialists, who seek to enlist foreign support to have the elections annulled, undermine President Berisha, and drive a wedge between Washington and Tirana. The Clinton Administration should not allow itself to be drawn into the Socialists' plans for what amounts to a coup d'etat against the pro-Western government. Washington should not be more supportive of the former communists than the Albanian people themselves have been. Seeking to appease the opposition by forcing more concessions from the Berisha government will only play into the hands of the Socialists, further polarize Albania, and jeopardize the long-term stability of a friendly country that has been one of the few beacons of hope in the volatile Balkan region.

INTRODUCTION  
<P>
     During the Cold War, the main purpose of the U.S. Navy was to
counter the Soviet Navy and to dominate the high seas. Today, of
course, the global threat once posed by the former Soviet Navy has
diminished. No other navy can challenge America's "blue water" fleet.
Instead, the main threat to U.S. national interests arises from
regional conflicts and violence in all corners of the world. This new
strategic reality for America, coupled with the declining number of
U.S. bases overseas, has changed the Navy's primary role. That role is
now to project American military power from ship to shore. 
<P>
     The Navy released a new naval strategy in late 1992, entitled
"... From The Sea," which reflects this fundamental shift in
priorities. ( "... From The Sea: Preparing the Naval Service for the
21st Century," Department of the Navy, Washington, D.C., September
1992.) In this strategy, naval expeditionary forces will be used in a
wide range of responses to crises around the globe. Should the
presence of these forces fail to deter aggression, they must be able
to prevent the U.S. from losing the conflict until the full combat
power of the Army and Air Force can arrive. Naval forces must also be
able to conduct a full-scale naval campaign in support of a land
force.
<P>
     In assuming the lead in projecting American power, the Navy must
focus on three areas: aircraft carriers, projecting land forces
ashore, and submarines.
<P>
AIRCRAFT CARRIERS. The Navy needs at least twelve carriers to maintain
a credible presence around the globe. In addition, the Navy needs an
aircraft carrier dedicated to training pilots and flight deck crews.
The aircraft on these carriers must be able to support ground forces
and defeat enemy air threats along the world's coastlines. To do this,
the Navy needs aircraft capable of operating day or night and in all
kinds of weather. An aircraft with these capabilities must be
developed as a replacement to the A-6 Intruder, the Navy's most
capable attack bomber, which is soon to be retired from service.
<P>
     The Navy must also develop new aircraft capable of threatening
targets deep in enemy territory. To be sure, cruise missiles and long-
range Air Force aircraft fulfill much of this requirement, but the
Navy also needs long-range carrier-based "stealth" aircraft which can
evade enemy radar and strike over great distances, day or night, in
all types of weather. The Experimental Attack/Fighter (A/F-X) had all
these capabilities, but was canceled by the Clinton Administration as
a cost-saving measure. This aircraft, or an alternative with the same
features, must be developed and eventually deployed. 
<P>
PROJECTING LAND FORCES ASHORE. Most of the world's industry,
technology, and population is found within 50 miles of the ocean;
nearly half is within 20 miles of a coastline. ( Charles E. Myers,
Jr., "Littoral Warfare: Back to the Future," U.S.Naval Institute
Proceedings, November 1990, p. 49.) The Navy must be able to control
these coastal, or "littoral" areas in time of war. ("... From The
Sea," p. 6.) To do so, the Navy must: 
<P>
Increase and modernize the Marine Corps' ability to move from ship to
     shore. ( For an earlier analysis of Marine Corps requirements and
     capabilities, see David Silverstein, "As the Military is Cut,
     America Still Needs the Marines," Heritage Foundation
     Backgrounder No. 871, January 13, 1992.)This will require that
     the Navy procure:
<P>
     seven additional helicopter carriers (LHD-1 class) and twelve
     next-generation amphibious ships already in research and
     development (LX class);
<P>
     507 V-22 Osprey aircraft, which combine the hover features of a
     helicopter with the range and speed of a fixed-wing aircraft;
<P>
     950 Advanced Amphibious Assault Vehicles (AAAV), heavily armed
     and armored vehicles that transport Marines from ship to shore
     and around the battlefield; and
<P>
     84 LCAC-class hovercraft, which carry heavy cargo at high speeds
     from ships and then glide ashore on a cushion of air. 
<P>
Overcome the mine threat. To further enhance its ability to operate in
     coastal regions, the Navy must develop equipment and tactics that
     can defeat enemy mines. Thus, as outlined in its 1993 Mine
     Warfare Plan, the Navy should procure:
<P>
     twelve mine detection ships (MHC-51 class) and fourteen mine
     destruction ships (MCM-1 class);
<P>
     one mine warfare command and control ship (MCS), using a
     converted amphibious ship until a new ship can be constructed by
     the turn of the century; and
<P>
     the heavy lift ships, obtained through leasing or new
     construction, needed to transport the smaller mine detection and
     destruction ships rapidly to a crisis area.
<P>
Support landing operations with effective fire support. In addition to
     these measures, the Navy must also improve the ability of its
     ships to provide fire support for troops ashore during the early
     stage of combat operations. Naval guns and ship-launched missiles
     must protect these forces until their own artillery has been
     brought ashore. The Navy should thus hasten development of new
     five-inch ammunition for its naval guns to replace aging ordnance
     developed prior to the Vietnam war. Together with the Army it
     should also develop new gun systems based upon new electro-
     thermal chemical and liquid propellant technology, which promises
     to increase the range and accuracy of both ship-based and ground-
     based weapons. Finally, the Navy can complement its use of gun
     systems with missiles such as the Tomahawk Land Attack (cruise)
     Missile (TLAM), which was used so effectively during the Persian
     Gulf war. New systems should be developed, including a naval
     variant of the Army's Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), which is
     a surface-to-surface missile that would fit into the existing
     vertical launch system (VLS) aboard many surface ships. Another
     related system that should be developed is the Joint Standoff
     Weapon (JSOW), a "cluster" bomb that would spread a number of
     smaller bombs over enemy tanks or other formations when dropped
     by an aircraft.
<P>
SUBMARINES. Submarines can carry cruise missiles and mines, travelling
the world's oceans undetected and delivering their deadly payload to
the enemy's doorstep. This makes them a critical asset to the Navy's
new coastal warfare strategy. The collapse of the former Soviet Navy,
with its several hundred advanced submarines, has diminished the
underwater threat to U.S. and allied vessels. Nevertheless, submarine
technology has begun to proliferate to potential Third World hotspots,
including Iran and North Korea. (For example, Iran recently received
the first of three Kilo-class diesel-electric attack submarines
purchased from Russia.) The U.S. must remain unchallenged in submarine
warfare and underwater detection technology. 
<P>
     To do so, its first priority must be to replace the Los Angeles-
class attack submarines. The first of these were designed and built
over twenty years ago and are approaching the end of their thirty-year
service lives. The Seawolf was developed during the 1980s as the Cold
War successor to the Los Angeles-class submarine. Its advanced
capabilities are no longer required given the collapse of the Soviet
Navy. The Navy should thus develop the so-called New Attack Submarine
(NAS), based on advanced nuclear propulsion and composite metals
technology. Although an advanced design, this submarine is somewhat
less capable, but cheaper than the Seawolf-class attack submarine it
will replace. 
<P>
     The NAS is nonetheless several years from production. Until then,
America's ability to build such advanced weapons systems must be
preserved. The only way to ensure that this submarine industrial base
can be maintained is to build submarines. (For a full discussion of
America's defense industrial base, see Baker Spring, "Supporting the
Force: The Industrial Base and Defense Conversion," Heritage
Foundation Backgrounder No. 964, October 22, 1993.) Given current
estimates of when the NAS will be available for delivery, though,
there will be a gap between the date of delivery of the last Los
Angeles-class submarine and the completion of the first NAS. (Delivery
of the first NAS is expected in 2006.) To fill that gap, the Navy
should complete the three Seawolf-class submarines that are now under
construction. 
<P>
     The Navy should also continue to develop the ability of attack
submarines to deliver cruise missiles and special operations forces.
The submarine's natural "stealth" characteristics make it an ideal
platform for both of these tasks. In the Persian Gulf war, submarines
launched cruise missiles at targets in Iraq; submarines are also used
regularly to put U.S. Navy special operation forces (SEALs) and Marine
Corps reconnaissance teams secretly on enemy shores. Subs should
continue to augment surface ships and aircraft in these roles.
<P>
Funding the Post-Cold War Navy. To develop these weapon systems, and
hence to perform the mission assigned to it, the Navy will require 400
ships, thirteen aircraft carriers (including one specifically
dedicated to training,) and 177,000 Marines. To fund this force, the
Department of Defense must spend approximately $101 billion (not
adjusted for inflation) in 1997, the year when current force
reductions will be completed. In each year thereafter, the budget must
increase to keep pace with inflation. 

<P>

PILLAR #1 OF NAVAL POWER: AIRCRAFT CARRIERS 
<P>
     Since World War II, aircraft carriers have been involved in two
out of every three of America's military crises. From the evacuation
of embassy staff from Somalia in January 1991 to early airstrikes on
Iraq a few days later, political and military leaders have reacted
instinctively to overseas crises by calling for the nearest carrier.
The aircraft carrier's foremost advantage is its capability to project
power from the relative safety of the open ocean. It also can remain
at sea for months at a time. For these reasons, the aircraft carrier
is a versatile and irreplaceable tool of American power.
<P>
     The U.S. has fourteen carriers today, none of them idle. At any
given time, there are three or four carriers steaming around the
world. Three or four are training for deployment, another three or
four are in port, having returned from overseas assignments, while
about the same number are undergoing routine maintenance and overhaul.
The Clinton Administration proposes reducing the number of carriers to
eleven with an additional reserve carrier available for emergency
overseas deployment.

    <P> This is insufficient. In addition to their use during war and
other crises, carriers provide regular peacetime military presence in
critical regions of the world -- the Western Pacific Ocean, the
Mediterranean Sea, the Indian Ocean, and the Persian Gulf. Such
presence is indispensable to protect America's vital global interests.
It reassures allies, intimidates potential aggressors, and offers
opportunities for naval forces to train in places where they might one
day have to fight. Keeping one carrier constantly on station in these
regions requires that the Navy has enough carriers to allow for
training, personnel turnover, transit time to and from overseas areas,
and maintenance. This so-called rotation base is between four and
eight additional carriers for each carrier deployed. (Ronald O'Rourke,
"Naval Forward Deployments and the Size of the Navy," CRS Report for
Congress, November 13, 1992, p. 5.)
<P>
     In 1991, the Bush Administration began a policy of "flexible
presence." This allowed carriers to spend less time on station in
regions critically important to U.S. interests. Adopting this policy
was an acknowledgement that even with fifteen carriers, which the Navy
had at the time, the U.S. could not maintain a continuous naval
presence overseas. With only eleven carriers, as the Clinton
Administration plans, America's naval presence will be much less. 
<P>
     Allowing such huge gaps in naval coverage is a risky strategy. It
amounts to accepting that at some point the U.S. may not be able to
defend a vital interest. Adopting a force of eleven aircraft carriers
means that regions where the U.S. has vital interests could be
unprotected for a month or more. Such delays in deploying military
force could endanger the lives of American troops by giving an enemy
more time to prepare. Moreover, an "on-again, off-again" naval
presence will increase uncertainty among U.S. allies and raise the
risk that potential adversaries might doubt America's resolve. It also
will encourage a dangerous arms race as allies and adversaries alike
adjust their own military force structures to respond to the absence
of U.S. power.
<P>
     Former Secretary of Defense Les Aspin released his plan to reduce
the Navy's power projection capability in September 1993. (For a full
discussion of the Clinton defense plan, see Lawrence T. Di Rita, et
al., "Thumbs Down To The Bottom-Up Review," Heritage Foundation
Backgrounder No. 957, September 22, 1993.) In that plan, known
officially as the Bottom-Up Review of defense requirements, he stated
that ten carriers will be sufficient to fight in two major regional
conflicts "nearly simultaneously." The Aspin plan calls for an
additional carrier; however Aspin himself noted that "the presence
requirement drives the number of aircraft carriers more than the
regional contingencies." ("Navy Study Tries To Match 'Enlargement'
Policy, Force Structure," Inside The Navy, November 22, 1993, p. 2.) 
<P>
     Unfortunately, these eleven active carriers in Aspin's plan will
be inadequate for that purpose. Even with twelve carriers, there will
be gaps in peacetime forward presence; should a conflict arise, those
gaps may become dangerously wide. In the Persian Gulf war alone, for
example, six carriers were employed in Operation Desert Storm. If a
war had broken out in Korea at the same time, which would have
required an additional four or five carriers, the U.S. would have been
left dangerously short of naval air power. 
<P>
     The Navy will need a minimum of twelve aircraft carriers to
respond quickly and effectively to overseas crises, and to maintain an
adequate presence in regions important to U.S. interests. Even at this
level of force, the Navy could not support the nearly simultaneous two
major regional conflicts as envisioned by the Aspin Bottom-Up Review
plan. Congress wisely has supported development of the Navy's newest
carrier, the CVN-76, as a means both of modernizing the fleet and
maintaining the carrier-building industrial base. This support must
continue. But Congress also must continue to fund a force of at least
twelve active and one reserve aircraft carriers.
<P>
The Functions of Naval Aviation 
<P>
Carrier-based aircraft are assigned three types of offensive combat
missions. These are:
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
     Strike and interdiction: using aircraft to attack important
     ground targets or concentrations of enemy forces in and around
     the battlefield;
<P>
     Close Air Support: using attack aircraft to provide direct fire
     support for ground units by engaging enemy ground forces.
<P>
     Air superiority: using fighter aircraft to clear the skies of
     enemy aircraft which threaten friendly ships, aircraft, and
     ground forces.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     In today's Navy, the F-14D Tomcat fighter fills the air
superiority role, while the A-6E Intruder attack bomber provides the
long-range, all-weather capability needed for strike/interdiction
missions and close air support. In addition, the F/A-18C/D Hornet
fighter-bomber can carry out any of these missions, depending on how
it is armed and equipped. The aircraft complement on a carrier has
roughly 24 F-14s, 24 F/A-18s, and 12 A-6s. These are accompanied by
twenty or so additional aircraft for such missions as refueling,
airborne radar, and electronic "jamming" and other combat support
functions. 
<P>
     For the foreseeable future, carrier-based aircraft must continue
to be able to perform each of these functions. However, the A-6 saw
extensive service in the Vietnam war, and has been in the fleet for
thirty years. The F-14 has been in service for twenty years. Current
plans to retire both of these aircraft mean that the F/A-18 will be
the only current carrier aircraft remaining by 2010. 
<P>
     New aircraft programs are expensive and can take at least fifteen
years before aircraft are actually produced. The Navy must make wise
decisions today about developing successors that will preserve all of
the capabilities embodied in existing aircraft. These decisions must
also account for significant changes in the threats against which
naval aircraft will be used. The demise of the Soviet Union's large,
sophisticated air force has reduced the air-to-air threat, while
regional conflict and the proliferation of air defenses and surface-
to-surface missiles make ground attack missions increasingly more
difficult. Thus, as the Navy plans for its next generation of
aircraft, it should procure:
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
     a stealthy, all-weather attack aircraft capable of long-range
     strike/interdiction and close air support missions; this would
     replace the A-6 Intruder.
<P>
     multirole aircraft for air superiority and for attack missions
     which are less demanding than those flown by the A-6's
     replacement; 
<P>
     an Advanced Short Takeoff, Vertical Landing (ASTOVL) aircraft to
     replace the current AV-8B Harrier II "jump jet."
<P></BLOCKQUOTE>

PILLAR #2 OF NAVAL POWER: PROJECTING POWER ASHORE
<P>
     The Marine Corps serves as America's principal "force-in-
readiness," available for deployment anywhere in the world at a
moment's notice. They are the ground-force equivalent to aircraft
carriers, designed to project American power quickly. Marines provided
General Norman Schwarzkopf with the first combat-ready ground forces
in Operation Desert Shield, with 16,500 Marines and more than fifty
Marine tanks on the ground in Saudi Arabia just nineteen days after
President Bush order the build-up of American power in the region. (
Department of Defense, Conduct of the Persian Gulf War, April 1992,
Appendix E, pp. 20-21.) In the past two years, Marines also have
evacuated Americans from Liberia and Somalia, and provided disaster
relief in Bangladesh and the Philippines. When President Bush decided
to send humanitarian relief to the people of Somalia, he turned to the
Marines; within three days, hundreds of Marines were ashore. 
<P>
     While the primary responsibilities of the other services will
diminish with the end of the Cold War, most of what the Marine Corps
does will become even more important in the future. This was reflected
in the Clinton Administration's Bottom-Up Review, which calls for
reductions in the Army, Air Force, and Navy while holding the Marine
Corps at 174,000 active troops, up from the 154,000 proposed by the
Bush Administration. 
<P>
     Marine units are deployed regularly on amphibious ships to the
Western Pacific Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean.
Marine forces, organized in Marine Air-Ground Task Forces (MAGTF),
range in size from Marine Expeditionary Units (MEU), which contain
roughly 2,500 troops, to Marine Expeditionary Forces (MEF) of 55,000.
Each MAGTF has tanks, cannon and rocket artillery, engineers, attack
and transport helicopters, and logistics support such as
transportation, medical teams, fuel, and food. 
<P>
     The September 1992 Navy and Marine Corps white paper "... From
The Sea" emphasizes the importance of projecting Marine forces ashore.
The new naval strategy was approved in October 1992 when a new
Expeditionary Warfare Directorate was created on the Navy staff.
Headed by a Marine two-star general, this directorate is responsible
for developing weapons and tactics for coastal or littoral warfare,
mine warfare, and special operations. ( "Navy Announces Creation of
Expeditionary Warfare Division," Inside the Pentagon, October 8, 1992,
p. 16.) With its new emphasis on amphibious and littoral operations,
the Navy now must make a commitment to increase and modernize the
Marines' ability to reach the shore from ships located out of sight of
land. To do this, the Marine Corps needs to:
<P>
IMPROVE AMPHIBIOUS SHIPPING CAPABILITIES. 
<P>
     The centerpiece of Marine Corps power projection is the Navy's
fleet of amphibious ships. Equipped with flight decks for launching
and recovering helicopters, these ships carry V-22 Osprey troop
transport aircraft and AV-8B Harrier attack jets. They also have well
decks from which smaller landing craft like the advanced amphibious
assault vehicle (AAAV) and the Air Cushioned Landing Craft (LCAC) are
launched.
<P>
     The Navy will have two new amphibious ships for the 21st century.
The first of these are seven amphibious assault ships of the LHD-class
now being build, which will augment the five LHA amphibious assault
ships now in service. These so-called big-deck ships are over 800 feet
long and carry roughly 2,000 Marines. They contain the bulk of the
ground forces and nearly all of the air forces of the Marine task
force.
<P>
     The second new amphibious ship, called the LX-90I, is on the
drawing board. The LX will be roughly 700 feet long and can carry 700
Marines. The LX's improved design will enable one LX to provide the
same capabilities now furnished by two older ships, the troop
transport and docking ship (LPD-class) and tank landing ship (LST-
class). The LST will soon be retired.
<P>
     The amount of lift capacity needed by the Marine Corps is
determined by two factors. The first is wartime contingency plans,
which call for enough amphibious ships to land simultaneously two-and-
a-half Marine Expeditionary Brigades (MEB) of between 13,100 and
16,500 combat troops each. This wartime requirement can be satisfied
by deploying approximately thirty ships, including ten of the large
"big deck" amphibious assault ships such as the LHD or LHA.
<P>
     In addition to wartime contingency planning, peacetime plans
dictate that three 1,500-man Marine Expeditionary Units be
continuously deployed, one each in the Western Pacific Ocean, the
Indian Ocean, and the Mediterranean Sea. To maintain these forward-
deployed forces, the Marine Corps must have twelve such units for
training and to serve as a rotating pool of replacements. ("Amphibious
Shipping," Concepts and Issues, Requirements and Programs Division,
Headquarters, United States Marine Corps, 1993, p. 26.) Some twelve
"big deck" (LHD and LHA) ships and 24 of the smaller LX and LPD
amphibious ship will be needed, for a total amphibious fleet of 36
ships. 
<P>
     The Navy must begin now to develop the amphibious fleet of the
next century. There are sixty amphibious ships in the fleet today, but
scheduled retirements will reduce that number to 23 by 2008. (Ibid.)
As a result, amphibious shipping capacity will shrink 38 percent by
1995. (Captain Carlton W. Meyer, USMCR, "Amphibious Battle Groups,"
U.S. Naval Institute Proceedings, September 1992, p. 104.) 
<P>
     The Marine Corps shipping requirements cannot be met without an
aggressive shipbuilding plan. To achieve the required lift capability,
the Navy's plan to build seven "big deck" amphibious aircraft carriers
(LHDs), supported by Congress in the fiscal 1994 defense authorization
bill, must stand. In addition to the already approved twelve "big
decks," at least twelve of the smaller and newly designed LX-90Is also
must be purchased, beginning in 1996. These new ships, along with
twelve of the newest LPD amphibious ships in service, will provide the
36 ships the Marines need in 2008.
<P>
FIND A REPLACEMENT FOR AGING TROOP TRANSPORT HELICOPTERS.
<P>
The primary mode of air transport for the Marines is the helicopter.
The CH-46 Sea Knight troop transport helicopter, which currently fills
this role, is reaching the end of its service life. The last CH-46 was
built in 1971, and the entire fleet has become expensive to maintain
and faces safety restrictions in operations. As a result, training is
being curtailed, and Marines will face a growing risk of peacetime
accidents, as revealed by recent crashes in the Mojave Desert, the
United Arab Emirates, and off the coasts of Somalia and California.
Left without adequate training, Marine helicopter crews will surely
lose their wartime effectiveness.
<P>
     To replace the CH-46, the Marines are building the V-22 Osprey
tilt-rotor aircraft. This remarkable machine was designed to meet
Marine Corps troop-carrying requirements for a number of missions. The
Osprey's revolutionary tilt-rotor enables the aircraft to take off and
land like a helicopter. This allows it to fly to and from the ships
and small landing zones where Marines generally operate. Once aloft,
it flies like an airplane at speeds in excess of 300 miles per hour,
far faster than any helicopter. It can carry 24 combat troops 400
miles and return without refueling. 
<P>
     The Osprey will enable the U.S. to deploy Marine combat troops
swiftly over great distances. Its speed and flexibility make it less
vulnerable than a helicopter to detection and hostile fire. Cuts in
U.S. forces and reductions in overseas deployments are shrinking the
presence and availability of American military power around the world,
making the Osprey's high speed and long range all the more important.
It can rush more troops to a conflict faster, and from farther away
than any helicopter. ( In a recent Livermore National Laboratory
analysis of a combat scenario involving a Marine Expeditionary Unit,
"the use of a V-22 fleet increased combat power throughout the battle
and delivered reinforcements more than twice as fast as an
all-helicopter alternative." Defense Daily, June 19, 1992, p. 457.) 
<P>
     The V-22 is also cost effective. Cost estimates range from $37
million to $39 million per plane. When considering total costs of
replacement, maintenance, and operation, the Osprey will cost only
slightly more than such helicopter alternatives as the CH-53E Super
Stallion or a sea-going variant of the Army's UH-60 Blackhawk. The
Washington-based Institute for Defense Analyses, moreover, has
determined that the V-22 will actually cost less than either of these
helicopters over the 20-year life-cycle of the aircraft. Moreover, the
1,200-page study concluded that "the V-22's speed, range, and
survivability advantages" made it more effective "than all of the
proposed helicopter alternatives in each of the four Marine missions
examined" ( "Assessment of Alternatives for the V-22 Assault Aircraft
Program," Institute for Defense Analysis, Alexandria, VA, Vol. 1, p.
13.)
<P>
     Although there is widespread support in Congress, the
Administration, and the Pentagon for developing the V-22, how fast and
in what numbers the Osprey should be fielded remains in dispute. The
Marine Corps must begin retiring the aging CH-46 in 1998; to field the
V-22 by 1999, the Marines must begin buying the aircraft in fiscal
1996. ( "Navy, Marine Corps Debate What Year To Begin Buying V-22,"
Inside the Navy, August 16, 1993, p. 3.) However, the Navy proposes
buying the V-22 beginning in fiscal 1997, which would mean that it
would not become operational until 2001. To prevent this delay, the
Clinton Administration should seek funding from Congress for 507 V-22s
beginning in fiscal 1996. Buying the aircraft earlier than planned
would lower the program's total cost by $7.2 billion.
<P>
PROCURE A NEW ADVANCED AMPHIBIOUS ASSAULT VEHICLE (AAAV).
<P>
     The new advanced amphibious assault vehicle also will play a
vital role in Marine Corps power projection strategy. This landing
craft is used for moving Marines from ship to shore. As a high-speed,
well-armed armored personnel carrier, the AAAV also will be the
Marines' primary means of mobility once ashore. The AAAV offers
significant improvements over older assault vehicles in range,
mobility, firepower, armor protection, night fighting capability, and
the ability to fight when under attack from chemical weapons. Its 45-
miles-per-hour land speed will enable infantry forces to keep up with
tanks, allowing the formation of a powerful and mobile combined force.
<P>
     Although war plans call for a fleet of approximately 950 AAAVs, (
"AAAV Becomes The Marines' Silver Bullet; Program Heads Toward DAB,"
Inside the Navy, July 26, 1993, p.3) a reduced defense budget has
forced the Marine Corps to consider other alternatives. Under one
approach, the Marines would buy a smaller number of the new vehicles
and continue to rely heavily on the current amphibious assault
vehicle, which is slower and has less lift capability than the new
AAAV. A better option, however, is to buy 950 AAAVs, but give a high-
speed capability to only a part of the fleet. Among the many
improvements found in the AAAV, one of the most expensive is its
ability to travel at high speeds of over 30 miles per hour through the
water, which is more than three times faster than the current version.
While the high-speed feature should be included in the one-third of
the AAAV fleet that will launch from ships at sea, the other two-
thirds do not need a high-speed water capability because they will be
brought to a conflict through port facilities. 
<P>
     Both the Senate and House versions of the fiscal 1994 Defense
Authorization bill supported continued development of the AAAV
program; the Senate report noted that "the program is central to
making the Marine Corps capable of meeting its... mission of
conducting opposed amphibious operations in the next century." (United
States Senate, Report 103-112, "National Defense Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 1994" (Washington, D.C., Government Printing Office, June
30, 1993), p. 75.) The fiscal 1994 Defense Authorization bill, passed
by Congress in November, adopted the Senate's proposal for an
additional $5.9 million for advanced technology engines for the AAAV.
("Conferees Fund Trident Missile Program, Seawolf, Centurion," Inside
The Navy, November 11, 1993, p. 15.) Congress must continue to fund a
fleet of 950 AAAVs, one-third of which should have the high speed
capability necessary for rapid transit from ship to shore.
<P>
ENHANCE CAPABILITIES FOR MOVING EQUIPMENT FROM SHIP TO SHORE.
<P>
     The Marines use large hovercraft traveling at speeds up to 50
knots to ferry weapons and equipment from ship to shore. Called
Landing Craft Air-Cushioned (LCAC), these ships can carry one main
battle tank, four light armored vehicles, or 150,000 pounds of cargo.
They have been in service aboard amphibious ships since 1985, and
demonstrated their effectiveness in humanitarian relief operations in
Bangladesh in 1991, as well as in Operation Desert Storm. The LCAC
program has been fully funded, with a total of 84 craft to be built by
1995. 
<P>
     Although the LCAC performs well at a relatively fast speed (25-50
knots), and can deliver heavy equipment such as tanks, artillery, and
trucks, it is unarmed and cannot carry troops. Moreover, it is noisy
and vulnerable to hostile fire because of its large size. It also has
limited mobility on land. Thus its tremendous lift capacity must be
coupled with the speed and range of the V-22 Osprey in the air, and
the speed, armor, and firepower of the AAAV once ashore. Together,
these systems can move Marines effectively to and around the
battlefield.
<P>
PROVIDE ADEQUATE NAVAL FIRE SUPPORT COMBAT OPERATIONS ASHORE.
<P>
     The Navy's new strategy requires that the Navy and Marine Corps
be able to launch a variety of combat missions against targets well
inland. To support these missions, Marines rely on ships and aircraft
to fire on enemy formations and fortifications until their own tanks
and artillery come ashore. Since the turn of the century, the Navy's
primary gunnery platform has been the battleship, which could fire
1,000 tons of shells in an hour, reaching targets 23 miles away and
penetrating 27 feet of reinforced concrete. However, the USS Iowa, the
last of the World War II-vintage battleships, was decommissioned in
1992. 
<P>
     Several factors led to the battleships' retirement. First,
advanced surface-to-surface missiles and carrier-based aircraft are
more accurate than the 16-inch guns of battleships. Moreover, these
huge ships require a large crew of roughly 1,500, and they are
expensive to operate, costing about $45 million per year. As they
aged, battleships were continuously in need of repair and spare parts.
<P>
     These reasons notwithstanding, the decision to retire the
battleships without an adequate replacement was questionable. In the
spirit of the Navy's new strategy, Navy leaders must pursue a
combination of naval guns and ship-launched missiles which together
can meet surface fire support requirements. 
<P>
     To do this, the U.S. needs naval guns. Instead of relying on the
less accurate 16-inch guns of battleships, the Navy could improve the
capability of the 5-inch guns that are found on nearly all surface
combatant ships. Recent studies indicate that improvements in the 5-
inch warhead are possible, despite its small payload. These include:
extending the range to 70 nautical miles from a current maximum of 15;
a more explosive warhead; a more aerodynamic projectile to stabilize
flight and improve accuracy; and, most important, miniature satellite
and radar guidance systems which can direct a round to its target. In
many cases, one accurate and improved 5-inch warhead may prove as
effective as a full barrage from older 16-inch guns. Steps such as
these will dramatically improve the performance of a weapon which
already exists in large numbers throughout the Navy.
<P>
     For a long-term solution, the Navy must look toward new types of
guns. Two systems currently being researched are the liquid propellant
gun (LPG) and the electro-thermal chemical (ETC) gun. Both methods
increase the muzzle velocity of the round, thereby increasing its
range by up to four times that of the current Mk 45 5-inch gun. The
Navy plans to have the electro-thermal chemical gun operating in the
fleet by 2004. ("Electothermal Chemical Gun Tests Aimed At NSFS
Solution," Inside The Navy, November 22, 1993, p. 4.) Congress has
shown support for the program by providing $24.7 million in fiscal
1994, $7.5 million more than the Pentagon requested. ("Conferees Fund
Trident Missile Program, Seawolf, Centurion," Inside The Navy,
November 11, 1993, p. 15.)
<P>
     In addition to naval guns, missiles also will play an important
role in future naval fire support, primarily against targets such as
buildings and bridges. The Navy is considering several options based
on programs already being developed. One is a variant of the Army
Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), a surface-to-surface missile that
would fit into the existing vertical launch system (VLS) aboard many
surface ships. The Navy plans to spend $23 million this year to
develop and test a "navalized" version of this missile. ("Navy Will
Test Army Tactical Missile For Ship-To-Shore Fire Support," Inside the
Navy, June 21, 1993, p. 9.) Another option is a modification of the
Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW), a "cluster" bomb that is dropped from
the aircraft on tanks and troops. Finally, the Navy should continue
pursuing a variant of the Tomahawk, known as Assault Hawk, for use
against tanks and other tactical targets. ("Navy Considers Ship-Fired
JSOW For Surface Fire Support Mission," Inside the Pentagon, July 22,
1993, p. 15.) Each of these programs should be continued.
<P>
IMPROVE MINE WARFARE CAPABILITIES.
<P>
     Two Gulf war incidents served warning of the threat from hostile
mines. On February 18, 1991, the amphibious assault ship USS Tripoli
and the guided missile cruiser USS Princeton each struck Iraqi mines
in the northern Persian Gulf. These were the only ship casualties
during the Persian Gulf war. Both ships suffered millions of dollars
in damages and were out of action for the remainder of the war. Beyond
this specific impact, the threat of mines served Saddam Hussein's
broader strategic purposes by helping to discourage a U.S. amphibious
assault on Kuwait. 
<P>
     If the Navy is to enter and operate in coastal areas, it must
significantly improve its capability to counter enemy mines. These
weapons are the greatest threat to the Navy's ability to project power
in coastal areas. While chemical weapons have been called the poor
man's nuclear weapon, mines are the poor man's submarine. For one
thing, they are cheap and cost-effective: the Princeton, a billion-
dollar warship, suffered $15,000,000 in damages from a $25,000 mine.
(Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, Department of the Navy, Mine
Warfare Plan, January 29, 1992, p. 28.) For another, there are over a
million mines around the world, and this number will grow as mines
from the loosely controlled Soviet stockpile and other sources spread.

<P>
     Since the Gulf war, the Navy has begun to pay greater attention
to the mine threat. During the Cold War, such NATO allies as Belgium,
Britain, and France were given primary responsibility for mine-
sweeping. As a result, U.S. capabilities waned. To beef up its
countermeasures against mines, the Navy should follow through on its
procurement plans for mine warfare ships, as outlined in its 1993 Mine
Warfare Plan. This calls for fourteen Avenger-class (MCM-1) mine
countermeasures ships capable of destroying mines and permitting other
ships to transit a minefield. In addition, the Navy will need twelve
Osprey-class MHC-51 minehunters. To support this expanded minehunting
and destruction capability, the Navy should develop a Mine Warfare
Command and Control ship. Moreover, since minesweeper ships are slow
and cumbersome, they must either be deployed in or close to areas
where they may be needed, or carried by sealift to a crisis zone. If
minesweepers arrive late to a battle, Marine forces and ships full of
Army reinforcements will be unable to move ashore. Therefore, the Navy
must also lease or build heavy lift ships to transport the smaller
Avenger and Osprey mine warfare ships rapidly to a crisis area.
<P>
     In addition to new ship construction, advanced mine-warfare
technology must be developed and deployed. As a result of its
experience in the Persian Gulf war, the Pentagon began a program to
change the characteristics of ship and submarine hulls to make them
less likely to detonate mines. The Navy requested $210 million for
fiscal 1994 to pursue the new materials and construction technologies
need to do this. However, the House Armed Services Committee cut this
budget by $30 million in 1994. (Thomas Duffy, "Navy S&T Thrust
Developing 'Quieting' Construction Technologies," Inside the Navy,
August 9, 1993, p. 7.) This was a mistake; the program should be fully
funded so that warships will be less vulnerable to mines that cannot
be located or avoided.
<P>
     Advanced technology may also make mine detection and sweeping
faster and less dangerous. The Navy is considering new programs to
deploy and control underwater unmanned vehicles. These would enable
the Navy to conduct systematic mine searches very quickly at depths
ranging from 10 to 200 feet. By using unmanned vehicles, human divers
could not be endangered. ("Navy Eyeing Several Underwater, Unmanned
Vehicle Programs," Inside the Navy, August 30, 1993, p.2.) Airborne
and space surveillance systems designed to detect and keep track of
mines are feasible, but it will be more than a decade before they are
operational. These programs should be fully funded as well.
<P>
     Finally, the Navy should focus its intelligence efforts on
detecting mine threats worldwide. The best way to combat mines is to
know who has them, what type they are, and where and when they are
being laid. This capability was neglected during the Cold War, mainly
because of the need to devote limited intelligence resources to such
higher priorities as Soviet submarines. The best way to fight mines is
to prevent them from being sown in the first place. Accurate
intelligence will make this more possible. 
<P>

PILLAR #3 OF NAVAL POWER: SUBMARINES
<P>
     Although the U.S. Navy is unchallenged on the high seas, its
submarines still will need to perform their traditional mission of
destroying enemy submarines and intimidating enemy naval forces. Early
in the Falklands war the Argentine cruiser General Belgrano was sunk
by a British submarine. Fear of further attacks kept the Argentine
Navy from sailing against the Royal Navy task force en route to the
islands. (Vice Admiral Roger F. Bacon, USN, "Submarine Warfare It's
A-Changing," Proceedings, June, 1992, p. 52.)
<P>
     This type of submarine warfare is very much alive despite the end
of the Cold War. For example, Russia last fall delivered the first of
three Kilo-class attack submarines to Iran. The Kilo is one of the
quietest submarines in the world. It can operate in virtual silence on
battery power for up to six days, and can carry 18 torpedoes or 24
mines. Russia continues to produce at least two submarines a year,
including at least one Kilo a year for export. (John J. Fialka,
"Danger at Sea; Iran's New Submarine, Built by Russia, Stirs Concern
in U.S. Navy," The Wall Street Journal, November 16, 1992, p. 1.) It
was reported in December 1993 that Moscow has concluded a deal to sell
three more Kilos to China, to be delivered in 1996-1997. ("China To
Buy Three Russian Kilo Subs," Sea Power, December 1993, p. 27. As part
of this sale, Russia may also include technology transfers and a
license for future Kilo production in Chinese shipyards.) 
<P>
     In 1987, when President Ronald Reagan demonstrated America's
commitment to the free flow of oil from the Persian Gulf by re-
flagging and escorting Kuwaiti oil tankers, Iran was using patrol
boats and mines to threaten shipping lanes. Today, with its torpedoes
and mines, an Iranian submarine patrolling the Persian Gulf would pose
a much more serious danger to the West's oil supply. 
<P>
     Iran's submarine purchase is but the clearest example of a new
threat -- the growth of submarine fleets in volatile regions of the
world. Because of the threat, U.S. nuclear attack subs began operating
in the Gulf for the first time in history. Other ambitious countries
are certain to obtain submarines in the future. Today, China has close
to fifty attack subs, India has fifteen, (These figures are found in
The Military Balance 1992-1993, International Institute for Strategic
Studies, London, 1992.) and even the Serbian Navy is reported to have
at least four relatively modern diesel submarines armed with torpedoes
and mines. (Joris Janssen Lok, "NATO Arms Against Serbian Submarines,"
Jane's Defence Weekly, August 14, 1993, p. 8.) Even with their
relative inexperience, these and other Third World submarine fleets
could seriously threaten American or allied naval forces operating off
their coasts. 
<P>
     To meet this new challenge, the Navy must move beyond the Cold
War strategy of tracking nuclear attack and ballistic missile subs on
the high seas. Instead, it must focus on finding and destroying quiet
diesel submarines in shallow water. This is difficult because standard
anti-submarine warfare techniques, which use such characteristics as
temperature, pressure, magnetic disturbances, and salinity, are less
reliable in shallow water. There are also more obstacles and small
craft, which can distract the crews and distract the instruments used
to find these submarines. (Lieutenant Commander P. Kevin Peppe, USN,
"Submarines in the Littorals," Proceedings, July 1993, p. 46.) The
best weapon against this threat is an American nuclear attack
submarine, which has sophisticated anti-submarine warfare technologies
and can, with nuclear power, remain underwater for days while
monitoring enemy submarine movements. 

<P>
Cruise missile strikes and other special operations. The Navy's Los
     Angeles-class nuclear attack submarines can carry up to twelve
     Tomahawk cruise missiles; the newest sub, Seawolf, can carry 24.
     While surface ships will serve as the primary means of delivering
     Tomahawks, the submarine's advantage as a cruise missile carrier
     is the stealth it enjoys under water. It can maneuver undetected,
     fire at will, and disappear without fear of retaliation. This is
     certainly a disconcerting prospect for any would-be regional
     aggressor. Submarines can also transport and insert special
     operations forces, such as Navy Sea-Air-Land (SEAL) teams and
     Marine force reconnaissance units, without ever surfacing. With
     the growing threat of terrorism and the greater likelihood of
     small, localized conflicts, deploying special operations forces
     in this manner will become even more important. 
<P>
Submarine Force Structure. The Navy must maintain enough nuclear
     attack submarines to contain any submarine threat, regardless of
     its origin, and to conduct other coastal warfare missions such as
     cruise missile attacks. The typical service life of a submarine
     is between fifteen and twenty years. The Navy has about 75 attack
     submarines, mostly Los Angeles-class (SN-688) vessels, which were
     first commissioned in 1976, and which will reach the end of their
     service lives in 2000. Testifying before the House Armed Services
     Committee in 1988, Vice Admiral Bruce De Mars, then Deputy Chief
     of Naval Operations for Undersea Warfare, stated that the Los
     Angeles-class had undergone over 25 major and some 4,000 minor
     changes. As a result, he concluded that the potential for further
     improving the class was "exhausted." (R. J. Daniel, "Submarines:
     Is Modernization Cost Effective?" (Part 2), Naval Forces, Vol.
     XI, No. IV (1990), p. 54.) 
<P>

     The Pentagon's Bottom-Up Review Force calls for a total reduction
of the attack submarine fleet to between 45 and 55 by the end of the
decade. During the Cold War, the U.S. generally followed a formula of
building one American sub for every two-and-a-half Soviet subs.
Current trends indicate that the Russian navy will possess 100-130
boats into the next century. (Conversation with Mr. William
Bonvillian, legislative director for Senator Joseph Lieberman (D-CT),
July 1993.) Although the threat from Russia has diminished, the one
for two-and-a-half formula is still relevant because the boats freed
from countering Russian forces will now have to keep tabs on the Third
World nations developing their submarine fleets. Thus the Navy should
seek a mix of 70 Los Angeles and Seawolf subs by 1997, and 55 Los
Angeles, Seawolf, and New Attack Submarines (NAS) by 2008. 
<P>
     The Submarine Industrial Base. During the 1980s, the SSN-21
Seawolf was developed to augment and ultimately replace the Los
Angeles class. But the end of the Cold War makes the Seawolf's
intended purpose of combatting Soviet attack and ballistic missile
boats on the high seas much less important. As a result, critics
question the need for more than the two Seawolfs now in production. At
a unit cost of roughly $3 billion, it is impossible to justify
continued Seawolf production on strategic grounds alone. Instead, the
Navy plans to procure what it calls the New Attack Submarine (NAS), a
smaller nuclear-powered submarine, beginning in 1998. While less
capable than the Seawolf, the NAS will still outclass any potential
enemy vessel. It will join the fleet beginning in 2006, at a unit cost
of $1.5 billion, and will be primarily designed for surveillance, mine
detection, and delivery of up to 200 special operations troops ashore.
( "Navy Sub Chief Touts Multiple Missions For New Attack Sub," Defense
Daily, December 1, 1993, p. 310.) The NAS will be the main U.S. attack
boat from 2006 through the 2020s. ( Pamela Hess, "DAB For New Attack
Submarine Delayed Again, This Time Until January," Inside The
Pentagon, December 9, 1993, p. 1.) 
<P>
     To maintain the industrial base for the eventual construction of
the NAS, the technological skills and expertise in the submarine
building community must be maintained. Unless U.S. design research and
technology continues to advance, America's qualitative lead in
submarine quieting technology will erode. While nuclear reactor
technology can be maintained by building other nuclear-powered ships,
such as Nimitz-class aircraft carriers now in production, certain
skills, such as hull design and welding, sonar design and development,
and underwater weapons system engineering, can only be maintained by
building submarines. 
<P>
     The Clinton Administration has decided correctly to build a third
Seawolf in order to maintain the industrial base. The Seawolf is the
most sophisticated submarine ever built, having double the deep strike
capability, three times the sonar capability, ten times the silent
running capability, and double the weapons tube capacity of the Los
Angeles-class submarine. ( Capt. Richard Sharpe, RN, Jane's Fighting
Ships (1992-93), Jane's Information Group Ltd., Surrey, U.K., p.731.)
Having three Seawolfs will improve the combat capabilities of the
Navy. It also will preserve the industrial base needed to design and
develop the New Attack Submarine well into the 21st century. 
<P>
Nuclear Ballistic Missile Submarines. If the Strategic Arms Reduction
     Treaty II (START II) is ratified and implemented as expected, the
     U.S. will be required to reduce the number of submarine-launched
     ballistic missiles (SLBMs) in its arsenal to 1,750. Since START
     II imposes an overall warhead limit of 3,500, submarine-launched
     warheads will thus contribute close to half of all the strategic
     nuclear warheads deployed in the U.S. arsenal. To provide a base
     for the missiles, the Navy must preserve the most modern
     strategic submarine and missile force possible. This means
     completing the procurement of the planned eighteen Trident
     submarines and deploying the eight-warhead Trident D-5 missile on
     all the submarines, including those now carrying the older,
     eight-warhead C-4 missile. The result of such a policy will be a
     strategic submarine force that includes:
<P>
          18 Trident submarines
<P>
          432 Trident D-5 missiles
<P>
          1,728 SLBM warheads (This will require that the number of
          warheads deployed on the Trident D-5 missile be reduced from
          eight to four.)
<P>

NAVY FORCE STRUCTURE
<P>
     The size of the Navy in the 21st century must be determined by
its activity to perform two functions: maintaining a forward presence
and projecting power overseas. Like the Army and the Air Force, the
Navy's force structure is based primarily on the need to prevail in
battle. But the size of the Navy also is determined by the expanse of
the world's oceans and the long distances it must sail. As America's
first line of defense, the Navy and Marine Corps must have enough
ships, aircraft, and personnel to remain overseas for long periods of
time. (During the 1970s, a shortage of ships and personnel which led
to extensive deployments, damaged morale, reduced readiness, and hurt
retention of experienced personnel. In the 1980s, the Chief of Naval
Operations established "personnel tempo" rules intended to reduce the
amount of time a sailor was deployed overseas. These important
restrictions are still followed by the Navy; they limit deployments to
six months in length, require two months in a non-deployed status for
every one month deployed, and require 50 percent of a ship's time over
a five-year average to be spent in home port.)
<P>
     Although naval forces will play a critical role in any major
regional conflict, they must also routinely maintain a peacetime
military presence around the world. Patrols and port visits reassure
allies, intimidate potential aggressors, and permit training in places
where soldiers and sailors one day might have to fight. Keeping a
carrier battle group plus a Marine force on station requires enough
ships and people to allow for training, personnel turnover, transit
time, and maintenance. For example, each forward-deployed aircraft
carrier is drawn from a rotation base of at least four additional
carriers. (Ronald O'Rourke, "Naval Forward Deployments and the Size of
the Navy," CRS Report for Congress, November 13, 1992, p. 5.) A
similar ratio applies to all Navy vessels.
<P>
     The Bush Administration in 1991 began a policy called "flexible
presence," which reduced the time ships stayed on station in the
Western Pacific Ocean, Mediterranean Ocean, Indian Ocean, and Persian
Gulf. This practice was an acknowledgement that continuous forward
presence could not be achieved with the fourteen carriers available in
1991. The Heritage Foundation published in May 1993 A Safe and
Prosperous America: A U.S. Foreign and Defense Policy Blueprint. A
naval force of twelve active aircraft carriers, 400 ships (for a total
force of 400 ships and 177,000 active-duty Marines) was recommended in
that study. While this number of carriers will produce short gaps in
U.S. naval presence, they will not be nearly as severe as those
created by the eleven-carrier force planned by the Clinton
Administration. Moreover, the Heritage force rests on the assumption
that a relative increase in the number of surface combatants --
cruisers, destroyers, and frigates -- with advanced power projection
capabilities such as Tomahawk cruise missiles will be able to
compensate for a carrier's absence from time to time. 
<P>
     Given the modernization and procurement recommendations contained
in this study, it will be possible to further reduce the size of the
Navy, to 370 ships by 2008. Modernization of the amphibious and
submarine fleets, as described above, will make smaller numbers of
these types of ships possible with no loss of amphibious or submarine
capability. Still, a twelve-carrier, twelve-ARG force structure will
remain the building block for the 370-ship fleet of 2008. (see Chart
3)

<P>
THE NAVY'S BUDGET
<P>
     The Clinton Administration's fiscal 1995 defense budget request
allocates $78.4 billion for a Navy with 373 ships and 760,000 active
and reserve sailors and Marines. However, the Administration's Bottom-
Up Review Force would reduce the Navy even further by 1999, to a total
of eleven active carriers and no more than 346 ships. These cuts go
too far, and will make it impossible for the Navy to carry out its
responsibilities for forward presence and warfighting.
<P>
     The Heritage force of 400 ships and 804,000 personnel will enable
the Navy to do its job. This force would cost approximately $101
billion in current dollars in 1997, when post-Cold War force
reductions will be complete. Moreover, the priorities of the Heritage
plan are quite different from those revealed by the Clinton budget.
The Heritage budget would double the amount Clinton proposed to spend
for procurement, to buy the new systems recommended above and to
maintain a fleet of 400 ships. To man this larger Navy, the percentage
of total funding devoted to military salaries would increase slightly
from the Clinton fiscal 1995 request. To keep the fleet at sea and
well-trained, the percentage devoted to operations and maintenance is
also increased by nearly 6 percent over Clinton's 1995 budget.
Clinton's proposed spending percentages on research and development
(11.4 percent) and military construction (30.6 percent) for fiscal
1995 are as low as they should go (see Chart 4)

<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
     Before any "peace dividend" is spent anywhere else, it should be
applied to the task of sustaining naval forces which can preserve
peace. Although both the Navy and Marine Corps have established a
strong tradition of regional power projection, this capability will
decline if sufficient funds are not provided. The United States must
continue to develop and support a Navy and Marine Corps which can best
preserve its security throughout an unpredictable 21st century by
projecting American power to distant regions of the globe. 
<P>
     To perform its critically important mission, the Navy must focus
its planning on six goals. They are to:
<P>
Maintain a minimum of twelve active aircraft carriers. Aircraft
     carriers must continue to be capable of performing a wide range
     of missions, from controlling littoral airspace and supporting
     ground operations, to conducting precision strikes against enemy
     targets far inland. 
<P>
Improve the ability of the Navy to land Marines ashore.  Because much
     of the Navy's capability to project power rests with the Marines,
     the Navy must make a commitment to increase and modernize the
     Marines' ability to move from ship to shore. The Navy must
     procure 507 V-22 Ospreys, 950 Advanced Amphibious Assault
     Vehicles, and seven LHD and twelve LX-90 amphibious assault
     ships. With these the Marines can maneuver from the sea and
     accomplish their mission once ashore.
<P>
Enhance the capability of Navy ships to provide fire support for
     Marines going ashore. The Navy's expanding responsibility for
     littoral warfare demands a balanced fire support package of ship-
     launched missiles and naval guns. Near-term improvements in 5-
     inch gun ammunition must be accompanied by investments in such
     new gunfire technologies as the electro-thermal chemical (ETC)
     and liquid propellant gun (LPG) systems. Programs such as the
     Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) and Tomahawk Land Attack Missile
     (TLAM) should also be continued.
<P>
Counter enemy mines that block access to coastal regions. The Navy
     must end its institutional neglect of mine warfare. It should buy
     more minesweepers, make them more available to battle group
     commanders and pursue advances in mine warfare technology. The
     Navy needs fourteen Avenger and twelve Osprey-class mine warfare
     ships, one Mine Command and Control ship, and heavy lift ships to
     transport Avenger and Osprey mine warfare ships rapidly to a
     crisis area.
<P>
Retain America's unchallenged superiority in submarine warfare. The
     Navy's submarine fleet must continue to track Russian ballistic
     missile submarines, and contend with a growing proliferation of
     submarines around the Third World. Submarines will also be used
     more often in strike warfare and special operations. To meet
     these requirements, the Navy will require a fleet of 55 attack
     submarines by 2008. The Navy must preserve an adequate sub-
     building capability by procuring a third Seawolf attack
     submarine, until the next generation sub -- called the New Attack
     Submarine -- enters the fleet early in the next century. 
<P>
Maintain a fleet large enough and modern enough to meet America's
     maritime security requirements. The Navy must maintain a fleet of
     400 ships, twelve active and one training carrier, and 177,000
     active-duty Marines to meet both its forward-presence and wartime
     force requirements. In 1997 when current force reductions are
     complete, this force will cost approximately $101 billion, or at
     least $25 billion more than Clinton's budget plans currently call
     for. 
<P>
     The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union
have made the world a safer but less predictable place. With no other
single power able to challenge it on the battlefield or on the high
seas, America's need for an Army, Air Force, and Navy designed to
fight a large and extended campaign is greatly reduced. The U.S. can
begin to restructure its armed forces and reduce their permanent land-
based presence around the world. At the same time, the greater
uncertainty of today's security environment puts a premium on mobile,
flexible forces. Such forces can be tailored to a specific crisis,
transported to it quickly, kept at the scene of a crisis for an
extended period, and reinforced with heavier forces if necessary.
Naval forces best provide this combination of forward presence,
mobility, endurance, and flexibility.

In a startling decision that calls into question whether some
congressional appropriators heard the message of the 1994 elections,
House and Senate negotiators have scuttled an apparent agreement
to curb welfare for lobbyists. The decision to sidetrack action
on proposals to limit politicking by federal grant recipients
was intended to free the appropriations legislation providing
funds for the White House, IRS, and numerous other federal agencies.
Instead, it may impede further progress on that bill.
<P>
When the conferees on the FY 1996 Treasury-Postal appropriations
bill met on October 25, it was widely expected they would adopt
compromise grant reform language crafted by Senator Alan Simpson
(R-WY) and Representative Ernest Istook (R-OK) with the guidance
of House and Senate leadership. The compromise would have liberalized
the provisions of an amendment adopted by the House by allowing
&quot;true charities&quot; (direct service providers) to spend
considerably more money on political advocacy than the original
proposal would have permitted.
<P>
However, the conferees agreed to issue a conference report that
left the issue of welfare for lobbyists unresolved. As a result,
the House and Senate must vote separately on the appropriations
and grant reform language. Failure to agree on both items would
stop final action on the conference report.
<P>
<B>The Message.</B> With the decision to scuttle the House-Senate
agreement on curbing welfare for lobbyists, the appropriations
committees decided that funding the White House, IRS, Post Office,
and lobbyists was more important than fiscal responsibility. The
effect of the conference committee's action was to say to the
voters that, simply to appease the White House, Congress will
continue to require American taxpayers to subsidize advocacy by
special-interest lobbyists.
<P>
<B>The Simpson-Istook Compromise.</B> The compromise reached by
House and Senate negotiators permits &quot;true charities&quot;direct
service providers, particularly those with small budgets that
serve people at the local level  to comply with its provisions
easily.
<P>
For example, a small local charity that raises $500,000 a year
from private sources could spend $25,000 on political advocacy
under the original House proposal offered by Representatives Istook,
David McIntosh (R-IN), and Bob Ehrlich (R-MD). The compromise
language now permits that same charity to quadruple its advocacy
to $100,000or one out of every five private dollars  while still
remaining eligible for federal grants.
<P>
This dramatic change is accomplished by liberalizing the Istook-McIntosh-Ehrlich
formula to one that mirrors the restrictions placed on 501(c)(3)
charitable organizations that elect to engage in lobbying (the
&quot;501(h) election&quot;). Independent Sector, a leading opponent
of the reform efforts, advises its members to use this provision.
<P>
The compromise formula is a sliding scale that permits the following
to be spent on political advocacy:
<P>
<b><UL>
<LI> 20 percent of the first $500,000 in private funds, plus
<P>
<LI> 15 percent of the next $500,000, plus
<P>
<LI> 10 percent of the next $500,000, plus
<P>
<LI> 5 percent of the remainder, up to an overall cap of $1,000,000
for advocacy.
</UL></b>
<P>
The Simpson-Istook compromise also protects small charities by
exempting organizations that spend less than $25,000 a year on
political advocacy from its prohibitions. This permits even the
smallest organizations to spend a significant amount of money
on advocacy without being ensnared by these needed reforms. Small
and large organizations alike would be required to disclose basic
information about how they spend taxpayer funds and the extent
to which they engage in political advocacy.
<P>
While loosening restrictions on smaller charities, the compromise
recognizes the significant abuse of the current system by larger
taxpayer-subsidized lobbying organizations. To address the issue
of fungibility of taxpayers' funds and curb present abuses, the
compromise would:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> <b>Place</b> a firm $1,000,000 cap on political advocacy to compensate
for the more liberal formula at lower levels;
<P>
<LI> <b>Limit</b> heavily subsidized grantees (those that depend on the
taxpayers for more than one-third of their budgets) to no more
than $100,000 in political advocacy; and
<P>
<LI><b> Prohibit</b> 501(c)(4) nonprofits that can engage in unlimited lobbying
from receiving federal grants if their annual budget exceeds $3
million. The Senate originally voted to ban all grants to any 501(c)(4)
group, regardless of size.
</UL>
<P>

<P>
<B>A Test of Leadership. </B>The decision by the congressional
appropriations club to sidetrack needed reforms in a rush to keep
federal grants flowing to lobbyists represents business as usual
in Washington. To allow the insidious practice of taxpayer-subsidized
political advocacy to continue would be a victory for special
interests over fiscal responsibility and accountability to the
taxpayer.
<P>
The House and Senate leadership now must decide how to proceed
with this vitally important issue. The activities of reformers
and the leadership over the next several weeks will determine
the outcome of this commonsense reform.

<H2>Address at the U.S.-French Ceremony at Omaha Beach on the
40th Anniversary of D-Day.</H2>
<HR>

<P>
President Ronald Reagan, June 6, 1984. Normandy, France. <HR>

<P>
We stand today at a place of battle, one that 40 years ago saw
and felt the worst of war. Men bled and died here for a few feet
of - or inches of sand, as bullets and shellfire cut through their
ranks. About them, General Omar Bradley later said, &quot;Every
man who set foot on Omaha Beach that day was a hero.&quot;
<P>
Some who survived the battle of June 6, 1944, are here today.
Others who hoped to return never did.
<P>
&quot;Someday, Lis, I'll go back,&quot; said Private First Class
Peter Robert Zannata, of the 37th Engineer Combat Battalion, and
first assault wave to hit Omaha Beach. &quot;I'll go back, and
I'll see it all again. I'll see the beach, the barricades, and
the graves.&quot;
<P>
Those words of Private Zanatta come to us from his daughter, Lisa
Zanatta Henn, in a heart-rending story about the event her father
spoke of so often. &quot;In his words, the Normandy invasion would
change his life forever,&quot; she said. She tells some of his
stories of World War II but says of her father, &quot;the story
to end all stories was D-Day.&quot;
<P>
&quot;He made me feel the fear of being on the boat waiting to
land. I can smell the ocean and feel the sea sickness. I can see
the looks on his fellow soldiers' faces-the fear, the anguish,
the uncertainty of what lay ahead. And when they landed, I can
feel the strength and courage of the men who took those first
steps through the tide to what must have surely looked like instant
death.&quot;
<P>
Private Zannata's daughter wrote to me, &quot;I don't know how
or why I can feel this emptiness, this fear, or this determination,
but I do. Maybe it's the bond I had with my father. All I know
is that it brings tears to my eyes to think about my father as
a 20-year old boy having to face that beach.&quot;
<P>
The anniversary of D-Day was always special to her family. And
like all the families of those who went to war, she describes
how she came to realize her own father's survival was a miracle:
&quot;So many men died. I know that my father watched many of
his friends be killed. I know that he must have died inside a
little each time. But his explanation to me was, `You did what
you had to do, and you kept on going.&quot;
<P>
When men like Private Zannata and all our Allied forces stormed
the beaches of Normandy 40 years ago they came not as conquerors,
but as liberators. When these troops swept across the French countryside
and into the forests of Belgium and Luxembourg they came not to
take, but to return what had been wrongfully seized. When our
forces marched into Germany they came not to prey on a brave and
defeated people, but to nurture the seeds of democracy among those
who yearned to bee free again.
<P>
We salute them today. But, Mr. President [Francois Mitterand of
France], we also salute those who, like yourself, were already
engaging the enemy inside your beloved country-the French Resistance.
Your valiant struggle for France did so much to cripple the enemy
and spur the advance of the armies of liberation. The French Forces
of the Interior will forever personify courage and national spirit.
They will be a timeless inspiration to all who are free and to
all who would be free.
<P>
Today, in their memory, and for all who fought here, we celebrate
the triumph of democracy. We reaffirm the unity of democratic
people who fought a war and then joined with the vanquished in
a firm resolve to keep the peace.
<P>
From a terrible war we learned that unity made us invincible;
now, in peace, that same unity makes us secure. We sought to bring
all freedom-loving nations together in a community dedicated to
the defense and preservation of our sacred values. Our alliance,
forged in the crucible of war, tempered and shaped by the realities
of the post-war world, has succeeded. In Europe, the threat has
been contained, the peace has been kept.
<P>
Today, the living here assembled-officials, veterans, citizens-are
a tribute to what was achieved here 40 years ago. This land is
secure. We are free. These things are worth fighting and dying
for.
<P>
Lisa Zannata Henn began her story by quoting her father, who promised
that he would return to Normandy. She ended with a promise to
her father, who died 8 years ago of cancer: &quot;I'm going there,
Dad, and I'll see the beaches and the barricades and the monuments.
I'll see the graves, and I'll put flowers there just like you
wanted to do. I'll never forget what you went through, Dad, nor
will I let any one else forget. And, Dad, I'll always be proud.&quot;
<P>
Through the words of his loving daughter, who is here with us
today, a D-Day veteran has shown us the meaning of this day far
better than any President can. It is enough to say about Private
Zannata and all the men of honor and courage who fought beside
him four decades ago: We will always remember. We will always
be proud. We will always be prepared, so we may always be free.
<P>
Thank you.

<h3>THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR DEMOCRACY:  A PRUDENT INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURE</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/phillips.htm">James Phillips</a><br>
Senior Policy Analyst and<br>
<a href="/heritage/staff/holmes.htm">Kim R. Holmes</a><br>
Vice President and Director of Foreign Policy and Defense Studies<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 461<br>
September 13, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The National Endowment for Democracy (NED), the leading American organization promoting democracy throughout the world, is in danger of being gutted. On August 1, the Senate Appropriations Committee eliminated all funding for the NED after the House voted in favor of the Clinton Administration's entire budget request of $30 million. The NED's future now is in the hands of the full Senate, which has an opportunity to restore funding for NED when it takes up the Commerce, Justice, and State Department appropriations bill in the next few days.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Senate Appropriations Committee's action against the NED is shortsighted. The NED is a valuable weapon in the international war of ideas. It advances American national interests by promoting the development of stable democracies friendly to the U.S. in strategically important parts of the world. The U.S. cannot afford to discard such an effective instrument of foreign policy at a time when American interests and values are under sustained ideological attack from a wide variety of anti-democratic forces around the world. The NED deserves the full funding already approved by the House.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>NED Is Still Needed.</b> The National Endowment for Democracy is a nonprofit grantmaking institution created in 1983 to strengthen democratic institutions and foster democratic values around the world. It is not an official  U.S. government agency, although it does receive federal funds. The NED supports nongovernmental groups in 90 countries. It funds democratic activists through direct grants, or works through American grant recipients, including four "core" institutions:  the Center for International Private Enterprise, the Free Trade Union Institute, the International Republican Institute, and the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The NED has played an important role in providing aid to democratic movements in the former Soviet bloc, China, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Nicaragua, Vietnam, and elsewhere. It has provided material support to grass root organizations to help emerging democracies assemble the building blocks necessary to sustain a stable democratic system:  representative political parties, a free-market economy, independent trade unions, and a free press. The NED's  timely support has served as a lifeline to dedicated democratic reformers battling a wide variety of anti-American dictatorships. For example, the NED has aided Lech Walesa's Solidarity movement in Poland, Harry Wu's human rights efforts in China, and independent media outlets in the former Yugoslavia. Russian political activists affiliated with the NED also played a major role in President Boris Yeltsin's successful re-election campaign against the reinvigorated Communist Party earlier this year.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The principal argument cited by the NED's critics is that the NED is no longer needed because the Cold War has ended. But the promotion of democracy is an American interest that transcends the Cold War. The Reagan Administration's creation of the NED was not a cynical tactic for undermining U.S. adversaries, but a reflection of the core American values of liberty, democracy, and free enterprise. Ronald Reagan correctly perceived that the U.S. needed to address the Soviet ideological challenge as well as the Soviet military threat. The NED was a cost-effective way to encourage captive nations to liberate themselves without committing the U.S. to a prohibitively risky and costly military crusade to free them from communism. While there is no monolithic security threat or ideological challenge to the U.S. at the present time, supporting democratic forces abroad remains both a moral and a practical imperative.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Soviet communism has collapsed, but communist regimes continue to dominate China, Cuba, North Korea, and Vietnam. And ex-communists masquerading as nationalists still control several of the Soviet successor states. Moreover, new-style communist parties have sprung up to compete with pro-Western democrats in recent elections inside the old Soviet bloc. Communists have been voted back into power in Hungary, Lithuania, and Poland. Despite the wishful thinking of the "end of history" triumphalists, democracy is not the inevitable outcome of the political evolution of post-communist societies. In the words of former Lithuanian President Vitautas Landsbergis, who was defeated by ex-communists in Lithuania's 1994 elections, "There is no guarantee that democracy will flower in the soil that was polluted for fifty years by communism."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The NED's job is far from finished. Despite the considerable progress made in recent years, two-fifths of the world's people continue to live under authoritarian rule. While communism has collapsed in many countries, democracy will take many years to become firmly rooted. Economic problems, international conflicts, and the growth of political, ethnic, national, and social tensions could trigger backlashes against democratic reforms. Embryonic democracies remain vulnerable not only to communists, but to military coups, fundamentalist politico-religious movements, and authoritarian parties. Both the Russian Bolsheviks and the German Nazis seized power after their countries undertook failed democratic experiments.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Promoting Democracy Furthers U.S. National Interests.</b> The U.S. has a stake in the promotion of democracy and the rule of law. Western-style democratic governments are the least likely to threaten American interests. Their political pluralism and focus on commercial activities tend to encourage international stability. In the past, democracies rarely have fought wars with other democracies. Therefore, consolidating democracy in formerly hostile states, such as Russia, helps to enhance America's long-term security. Democratic reforms also facilitate free-market reforms that lead to international trade and investment opportunities.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Funding the NED is a prudent investment because it is far less expensive to aid friendly democrats than it is to defend against hostile dictatorships. By contributing $30 million of democratic "venture capital" to the NED, the U.S. government could forestall the need to spend billions of dollars for defense in the future -- for example, in the event Russia reverted to a hostile dictatorship. The NED's aid to grass-roots organizations also is more cost-effective than direct government-to-government aid, which often is siphoned off by foreign or American bureaucrats. The NED is not a big government bureaucracy. It has the flexibility to channel aid to effective grass-roots organizations for short-term projects that can be adjusted quickly to adapt to changing political conditions.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The NED's strong track record led the seven immediate past Secretaries of State to support continued funding in a joint letter to congressional leaders in September 1995. The case for funding the NED remains a compelling one. As House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) has noted, the NED "represents the American people's bipartisan commitment to a world in which the principles of democracy prevail."  Slashing NED funding would signal to a world hungry for American leadership that the U.S. is withdrawing from active engagement in international affairs. This not only could demoralize reformers who have taken heavy personal risks to advance the cause of democracy, but could give encouragement to anti-democratic regimes and movements.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although the Cold War has ended, the global war of ideas continues to rage. American interests and ideals remain threatened by deeply entrenched communist regimes, neocommunists, aggressive dictatorships, radical nationalists, and Islamic fundamentalists. Given this reality, the U.S. cannot afford to surrender the ideological battlefield to these enemies of a free and open society. The National Endowment for Democracy deserves continued funding as a prudent investment for safeguarding the future.

By John Shanahan<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder #896<BR>
May 21, 1992
</CENTER>
<P>

INTRODUCTION 
<P> In the first week of June, an international "Earth summit" will
convene in Rio deJaneiro, Brazil, to discuss environmental issues and
their relationship to economic development. (For an analysis of the
circumstances leading up to the conference see Christopher M. Gacek
and James Malone, "Guidelines for the U.N. Environmental Conference,"
Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 874, January 28, 1992.) The
leaders of the majority of the world's countries are expected to
attend. Last week, President Bush announced that he will attend. 
<P> This summit, formally called the United Nations Conference on
Environment and Development, or UNCED, will discuss issues ranging
from the distribution of wealth among nations and women's rights to
deforestation. But the topic that will attract the most attention and
controversy is the claim that the Earth is subject to steady and
potentially damaging rise in temperature -- a phenomenon known as
"global warming" -- and that this condition is in large part a
byproduct of Western industrial growth. 
<P> While recent preparatory negotiations did not include binding
agreements on targets and timetables for reducing emissions of carbon
dioxide (CO2) and other so-called "greenhouse gases," the U.S. will
come under enormous pressure at the conference, from other countries
and many environmental groups, to sign a treaty curbing greenhouse gas
emissions. These greenhouse gases occur in nature but also are caused
by human activity, such as by burning fossil fuels. They are
responsible for making the earth sufficiently warm to permit the
existence of life, and are thus essential. The concern is that the
build-up of these gases in the atmosphere could warm the planet more
than would otherwise be the case, and that this global warming could
lead to adverse changes in the world's ecology. At the extreme, some
environmentalists say, parts of the Earth could become subject to
flooding and tidal waves because of rising sea levels caused by
melting polar ice caps, and drought-induced crop failures could
trigger global famine. 
<P> In spite of these fears, the accumulated scientific data do not
support such dire predictions, showing the cataclysmic results to be
either highly improbable or simply wrong. Moreover, there is enormous
uncertainty associated with the scientific methodology used to predict
future climate changes. Among the difficulties: 
<UL>
      Climate change computer models that predict warming often rely
      on assumptions and simplifications that raise questions about
      their reliability. Example: one model effectively moved the
      Earth's orbit 2 million miles closer to the sun.

<P> Models do not accurately account for the influence of important
      climate factors, such as the behavior and effect of clouds and
      oceans.

<P>      There are shortcomings in the data. Example: temperature records
      over the last century may incorrectly suggest warming because
      many weather stations are close to growing cities.

  <P>    Temperature observations over the last century are inconsistent
      with the predictions of global warming theories.
      
  <P>    A competing theory, based on the hypothesis that solar activity
      may be the major factor in climate change, is more consistent
      with temperature observations in the northern hemisphere during
      the last century.

  <P>    Furthermore, even if most scientists and policy makers were
      convinced that some level of warming is occurring and will
      continue, three questions have to be answered.
 </UL>     
<P>Question #1: Is the Earth warming as a result of human-caused
      greenhouse gases or because of natural phenomena?

<P>Question #2: If the planet is experiencing a major warming trend, 
      in what way will this warming take place? Will the Earth warm 
      up substantially at night with days cooling slightly? Will the
      warming occur in the tropical regions, or only in the high
      latitudes around the poles? Will the warming occur in the summer
      or the winter? These questions are important because a single
      figure suggesting the average temperature of all regions of the
      world for all times of day and night during the entire year is a
      meaningless statistic. It ignores variations amid the warming
      trend that would have very different -- and not necessarily
      harmful -- effects in different regions.

<P>Question #3: What will be the effect of any changes in the climate?
      Will the ocean levels rise, resulting in worldwide flooding? Or
      will they fall, expanding earth's landmass? Will worldwide
      agricultural production increase thanks to more crops in areas
      now too cold for major cultivation -- helping to alleviate world
      hunger -- or will it decrease, prompting famine in some regions?
       
<P> The existing scientific evidence does not give clear answers to
these questions. But the decisions made by policy makers at the United
Nations conference and elsewhere could have enormous implications for
the Earth's inhabitants. Moves to slow down economic growth in the
western industrialized countries, for instance, could have the
unintended effect of slowing economic growth also in the poorest
countries. Indeed, poor countries would be disproportionately
affected.

<P> The economic costs to Americans from enacting policies to
address the perceived problem of global warming would be less
dramatic, yet significant. Consider one proposal -- imposing a "carbon
tax" of $100 per ton, designed to reduce industry's carbon emissions
to the 1990 level by the year 2000. The Congressional Budget Office
estimates this tax would reduce the Gross National Product (GNP) of
America by two percent. This would result in a loss to the economy of
approximately $100 billion per year, or about $1,200 per household.
Further, the increase in unemployment by the year 1997 would be an
estimated 700,000 jobs.

<P> To be sure, if the economic, environmental, and health costs
associated with global warming are as large as some fear, then the
side-effects of reducing CO2 might be smaller compared with the
dangers of inaction. This leads to the question asked by many
environmentalists and policy makers: "Isn't it worth buying an
insurance policy against global warming regardless of cost, since the
consequences could be so severe?" 

<P> This is a reasonable question, but the answer is not necessarily
"Yes." The decision to buy an insurance policy depends not only on the
possible consequences of not doing so, but on the probability of those
consequences. With a high level of uncertainty, such as that
associated with global warming, other measures might be more prudent. 

<P> To determine if the world should buy an expensive insurance
policy against global warming, the probability of harm occurring must
be multiplied by the likely magnitude of the harm. If the resulting
expected harm is higher than the economic and social cost, then buying
an insurance policy makes sense. If the expected harm is lower than
the cost, it does not make sense to do so. Although it is difficult,
if not impossible, precisely to quantify the expected harm from global
warming, lawmakers must attempt this calculation if they are to
develop sensible, cost-effective policies.
<P>

WHAT IS GLOBAL WARMING?

<P> One of the main subjects to be addressed at UNCED is global
warming. While most Americans have heard of the phenomenon, few
understand it, and there is widespread confusion between global
warming and another term -- the "greenhouse effect." 

<P> The greenhouse effect, on the one hand, refers to the fact that
the earth releases gases, called greenhouse gases, which enable the
atmosphere to retain some of the heat received from the sun rather
than reflecting all of it back out into space. These gases thus have
the same effect as glass in a greenhouse, which is to keep the Earth
at a higher average temperature, and a more even temperature, than
would be the case without the gases. These gases include carbon
dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxide, and water vapor. The greenhouse
effect maintains the Earth at a temperature which allows plant and
animal life to exist. Contrary to popular belief, all scientists agree
that the greenhouse effect is desirable. Indeed, without it, life as
we know it on Earth would cease because global temperatures would
average -18C, or 0F. Explains Patrick Michaels, State Climatologist
for the Commonwealth of Virginia, the statement that all scientists
agree that the greenhouse effect is real "is about as profound as a
statement that all scientists agree that the Earth is round." (Patrick
Michaels, "Apocalypse Not Now: Science, Politics, and Global Warming
(Part 1)," National Chamber Foundation, U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
March, 1992.)

<P> Global warming, technically known as the "enhanced greenhouse
effect," on the other hand, is a term used to describe temperature
increases allegedly caused by humans over some period of time. This
theory rests on the claim that certain gases released by human
activity warm the planet significantly. These gases include carbon
dioxide and other greenhouse gases that are released naturally into
the atmosphere. (Water vapor, which is the primary greenhouse gas, is
not increased by human activity. Water vapor and clouds account for
about 98 percent of the greenhouse effect.) Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)
are an exception. These are man-made gases, chiefly associated with
refrigeration, which do not occur in nature.

<P>
THE DEBATE AT UNCED

<P> Many of the delegates at UNCED will demand action to reduce the
levels of human-generated greenhouse gases on the grounds that a large
rise in the Earth's temperature would be harmful. Among the studies
generating these demands is a report to the United Nations Environment
Programme (UNEP) by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC). ("The Scientific Assessment of Climate Change," The
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, August 1990.) This summary
concluded that global warming had already occurred, would continue to
occur, and was causing a rise in the ocean levels. (The executive
summary, however, was not representative of the body of the report,
according to 40 percent of the scientists who worked on the document,
and was termed "misleading" by half of those scientists. "Survey of
U.S. Participants in the IPCC Report," The Science and Environmental
Policy Project, August 1991.) 

<P> If an agreement to set targets and timetables for reducing man-
made greenhouse emissions is reached at the conference, the most
popular method to reduce emissions is likely to be a carbon tax. A
carbon tax is a tax placed on every ton of carbon dioxide emitted by
industry. This would encourage factory owners to reduce CO2 emissions
-- which is considered the leading human-caused greenhouse gas. 

<P> The U.S. position throughout the discussions leading up to the
conference has been that all greenhouse gases should be considered,
not just CO2. Only half of the potential warming due to human activity
would be caused by CO2, the rest would be due to the other greenhouse
gases. The U.S. position has been that the other human-generated
greenhouse gases also should be reduced if CO2 is reduced. Putting the
burden purely on CO2 disproportionately affects the emerging poor
countries and the U.S. economically. 

<P> Further, the U.S. has insisted throughout the preparatory
negotiations that specific targets and timetable not be included in
any treaty. On May 9, 1992, the U.S. position was formally adopted by
the International Negotiating Committee (INC). Nevertheless, the
negotiated language does state the general proposition that greenhouse
gases should be cut.

<P> One of the official concerns has been that the conference will
turn into an effort aimed at redistributing the wealth from richer
countries, such as the U.S., to poorer nations. Further, the U.S. and
other industrialized countries may be pressed to change the
foundations of their economic systems and lifestyles to help the less
developed countries. Indeed, Maurice Stong, General Secretary of
UNCED, claims that industrialized countries have developed and
benefitted from unsustainable patterns of production and consumption
which have produced the present dilemma, and thus, industrialized
countries primarily have the means and responsibility to change these
patterns. (Ironically, many environmental ills have not been brought
on by industrialized countries. For instance, rainforest destruction
is cited as one reason for this conference, but the policies of
Brazil, the host country, and World Bank programs are largely
responsible for the destruction. Brazil requires homesteaders to
clear-cut the land in order to gain title. Likewise, the World Bank
provided funds to build roads through the jungle to encourage
agriculture. Thus, simple policy changes have the potential to curb
much of the destruction.)

<P>
THE ORIGINS OF GLOBAL WARMING CONCERNS

<P> The theory of global warming was first put forward by Swedish
chemist Svante Arrhenius in the late 19th century. Arrhenius theorized
that the rise in CO2 emissions caused by increased coal burning during
industrialization would warm the Earth considerably. Arrhenius
predicted that a doubling of CO2 would increase the temperature by 5C.
(Svante Arrhenius, "Philosophical Transactions," 1896. Arrehenius
further states that "[t]he influence is in general greater in the
winter than in the summer, except in the case of the parts that lie
between the maximum and the pole. The influence...is in general
somewhat greater for land than ocean. On account of the nebulosity of
the southern hemisphere, the effect will be less there than in the
northern hemisphere. An increase in [CO2] will of course diminish the
difference in temperature between day and night. A very
important...secondary effect will probably remove the maximum effect
from lower parallels to the neighborhood of the poles.") The enhanced
greenhouse effect theory, or global warming, was given new life in the
1950s because the summers were hotter than usual, and was championed
by Roger Revelle, then director of Scripps Institution of
Oceanography. (Jonathan Laing, "Climate of Fear: The Greenhouse Effect
May Be Mostly Hot Air," Barron's, February 27, 1989.) 

<P>
The Ice Age Theory

<P> The 1960s and 1970s, however, were substantially cooler than
previous decades in the northern hemisphere. The global warming theory
lost favor and a new theory emerged to supplant it. Many scientists
and environmentalists then believed that in fact global warming never
had been a real threat and that the concern should be about global
cooling. Just as many supporters of the global warming theory argue
today, the culprit was said to be human economic activity -- chiefly
dust. And just as global warming predictions today are usually stated
as fact, so the coming "Ice Age" was presented to the public as fact
in the 1960s and 1970s. The only question, according to numerous
nationally recognized proponents, was not whether an Ice Age would
occur if man continued his destructive activities, but how soon it
would come and how devastating the cold would be. (For examples of
colorful and forceful quotes by nationally recognized proponents of
global cooling, see Anna Bray, "The Ice Age Cometh," Policy Review,
No. 58, Fall 1991.)

<P>
The Shift Back to Global Warming Theory

<P> The international fear about an apocalyptic Ice Age waned as
quickly as it had arisen as soon as the trend of temperatures turned
upwards again in the late 1970s. The first computer-simulated climate
model to gain attention by suggesting a warming trend, known
technically as the General Circulation Model (GCM), was first
published in 1975, and revised in 1980. This model predicted that the
Earth would warm 4C with a doubling of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

<P> The global warming theory gained enormous support after James
Hansen, a physicist and the chief of NASA's Goddard Institute for
Space Studies, testified before the U.S. Senate in June 1988 that the
full force of human-induced global warming had arrived. (Testimony
before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, June 23,
1988.) Hansen stated that "global warming is now sufficiently large
that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause and
effect relationship to the greenhouse effect." (Ibid.) In support of
his conclusions, Hansen declared that 1988 would be the warmest year
on record, barring any "remarkable and improbable" cooling. This
statement was readily accepted by the press and the general population
because the previous winter had been unusually warm and the spring and
early summer were much hotter than normal. The remarkable and
improbable cooling nevertheless occurred (even as Hansen was
testifying) in the tropical Pacific Ocean. A cold front the size of
the U.S. Great Plains also settled over Siberia later in the year,
bringing average northern hemisphere temperatures downward. In fact,
despite the unusual temperatures in the summer of 1988, one out of
every six summers since 1895 has been hotter in the U.S., the most
recent being 1963. (Jonathan Laing, "For 1989, a Drought Encore?"
Barron's, February 27, 1989.) 

<P> Since his 1988 testimony, Hansen's vision of global warming has
come under increasing attack. (Hansen also testified that the observed
warming in the past century was 0.6C to 0.7C. This is 20 to 40 percent
higher than any objective trend analysis using the global records
considered most reliable. See Michaels, op. cit.) Reid Bryson, a
respected expert in climate research and Emeritus Professor of
Geography, Meteorology, and Environmental Studies at the University of
Wisconsin at Madison, dismissed the Hansen testimony as a "phenomenal
snow job" and the global warming theory as "a triumph of sociology
over science." (Laing, "Climate of Fear," op. cit.) In fact, the
theory that substantial global warming will occur is bitterly disputed
by many highly respected scientists. Global warming is not a fact. It
is a theory that is widely challenged. In a recent survey of
atmospheric physicists and meteorologists, for instance, almost all of
the scientists agreed that catastrophic global warming predictions are
unsupported by scientific evidence and that climate models showing
warming cannot be relied upon. ("Survey of U.S. Participants in the
IPCC Report," op. cit.) There are several reason why so many
scientists are uncertain about the theory.
<P>
Reason #1: The science involved in the global warming theory is 
      very complex. 

<P> Scientists generally agree on many of the fundamental concepts
behind the greenhouse theory, which is crucial to the catastrophic
global warming theory. Where they part company is in making the jump
between one theory and the other. 

<P> The reason why there can be deep disputes among scientists
investigating climate change is that climatology is perhaps one of the
most complex and uncertain of all scientific fields. It is not
possible to run controlled experiments for the whole planet in a
laboratory test tube. Climate conditions cannot be created and changed
at will, and then studied. Thus scientists are forced to use models to
predict the consequences of various influences, and to try to
disentangle the effect of one factor from a myriad of others.
Necessarily, such models attempt to include all significant variables
and exclude the insignificant ones. The problem is to decide which is
which, and if all the variables have in fact been considered.

<P> Given the inherent difficulties in the science of climatology,
it is crucial that models are continually tested against data being
collected and that scientists accept that conflicts throw their models
and theories into question. Unfortunately this does not always happen.
For example, Christopher Folland of the United Kingdom Meteorological
Office, who was one of the senior authors of the 1990
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report to the U.N. that
predicted global warming of 2.5C, recently was asked if the data
collected to date (which showed substantially different results from
those predicted by models) would alter recommendations for CO2
emission reductions. Folland responded that "the data don't matter,"
adding that "[w]e're not basing our recommendations on the data; we're
basing them upon the GCM [General Circulation Model] climate models."
(Presentation by Patrick Michaels at the National Chamber Foundation,
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, April 10, 1992.)

<P> Clinging to a model in the face of conflicting data is bad
science, and generally leads to bad policy. But the data gathering and
modeling problem is made even more difficult because of systematic
warming biases of the data on which the models are based.

<P> "Heat Island" Effect. For instance, past observations indicate a
global temperature increase of 0.5C over the last 100 years. (It
should be noted that almost all of the warming occurred more than 50
years ago, prior to the emission of more than 67 percent of
human-generated greenhouse gases. Since 1941, the temperature dropped
and then rose about 0.1C.) But questions have arisen over the
reliability of even such a basic trend, because recording stations
have been placed in areas, such as near cities, that have experienced
growing populations over the decades. The buildings and roads which
accompany an increasing urban population retain warmth from the sun.
This may have exaggerated the long-term temperature rise -- or even
suggested one where none exists. This is known as the "heat island"
effect. 

<P> Extremely accurate and more reliable temperature records do
exist -- but only since 1979. Satellite temperature readings,
according to Roy Spencer of NASA, and John Christy of the University
of Alabama, are accurate within 0.01C, because the satellites use a
different method to calculate temperature. Just as important, the
satellites are not affected by the heat island effect and the readings
cover the entire globe uniformly, unlike ground-based stations which
are clustered and sporadic. Significantly, these satellite
temperatures show that the ground-based stations records may not be
very accurate. The ground-based records show a warming in the southern
hemisphere of 0.3C over the past decade, but the highly reliable
satellite data contradict this warming trend. In fact, the satellites
show that the southern hemisphere temperatures actually dropped 0.02C.
This calls into question the wisdom of relying on questionable data
accumulated earlier this century as the basis for costly policy
changes.

<P> But even if the ground-station records were correct, the results
would squarely contradict the global warming theory, which predicts
that the northern hemisphere will warm much faster than the southern
hemisphere. Northern hemisphere temperatures have not changed
significantly. This means that global warming advocates are faced with
the prospect of pursuing their theories although the data are suspect
and do not support their assertions, or re-examining their theories in
light of new satellite data, which show no warming trend where models
predicted it should have occurred. Unfortunately they have chosen the
first course. 

<P> Reason #2: Many models use questionable or incorrect parameters.

<P> Some of the models predicting global warming have been
discovered to have included incorrect parameters. Parameters are
variables or arbitrary constants in mathematical expressions that
generally try to reflect real world conditions which restrict or
determine the outcome of the mathematical expression. Sometimes
adjusting these parameters can have bizarre results. A prime example
is the first influential GCM model, developed in 1975. This model,
devised by Sukryo Manabe and Richard Wetherald of the Geophysical
Fluid Dynamics Laboratory at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA), indicated that the Earth would warm by 4C with
a doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere. Unfortunately for the model, it
also predicted background temperatures (that is, the temperatures that
would occur if there had been no CO2 increase) that would have to be
5C lower than today. It is interesting to note that since the last Ice
Age was between 4C and 6C colder than today, an ice age would have
occurred if the background model was correct. To correct for this
problem, the researchers revised the level of the sun's radiation
reaching the Earth's atmosphere upward by 6 percent. But this is
equivalent to moving the earth's orbit 2 million miles closer to the
sun. (The researchers also used incorrect parameters in another
instance in the study. The original study predicted that the polar ice
caps would melt at approximately today's temperatures. In the
subsequent report, they corrected this error, but left the accelerated
warming which is the direct result of ice cap melting in the model.) 

<P> A study of Hansen's GCM computer model, which predicts
catastrophic warming by the year 2100, found that a one percent
difference in the initial conditions or parameters was enough to
create totally different predictions of global temperatures over the
last half of the period 1991-2100. (A. Tsonis, "Sensitivity of the
Global Climate System to Initial Conditions," Eos, No. 30 (July 23,
1991), p. 313.)

     <P>Other examples of questionable or incorrect parameters include:

<P> Oceans. The theory that oceans retard the warming caused by
greenhouse gases is generally accepted, and incorporated into most
newer models. Unfortunately, the magnitude of the ocean effect is
poorly understood and roughly estimated. This could introduce
significant errors into models. For instance, many researchers claim
that it takes 50 years or more for carbon emissions to affect
temperatures. Other researchers, however, concluded recently that 75
percent of the full effect of carbon dioxide emissions on sea
temperatures is experienced within ten years. (S. Manabe, K. Bryan,
and M.J. Spelman, "Transient Response of Global Ocean Atmosphere Model
to a Doubling of Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide," Journal of Physical
Oceanography, Volume 20 (1990), pp. 722-749.)

<P> Clouds. The problem of determining the effect of clouds is even
more complicated, and consequently climate models often contradict
each other in the characteristics that they assign to clouds. One
theory is that as the temperature increases, because of a rise in
greenhouse gases, the relative humidity drops and fewer clouds form.
Thus, sunlight reaching the earth increases, causing more warming, or
"positive feedback." But another scientific school of thought
maintains that clouds have a cooling effect, or "negative feedback."
The cloud feedback problem is crucial to a full discussion of the
global warming issue, since the models show a range of warming from
less than 1C to as much as 5C, depending on the extent and sign
(positive or negative) of cloud feedback alone. (George C. Marshall
Institute, "Two Environmental Issues" (Washington, D.C. December
1991).)

<P> Recent studies seem to support the view of scientists who
theorize a negative feedback from clouds. James Angell, a research
meteorologist at the NOAA Air Resources Laboratory, found that between
1950 and 1988, the number of cloudy days increased by 3.5 percent.
(J.K. Angell, "Variations and Trends in Tropospheric and Stratospheric
Global Temeratures, 1958-1987," Journal of Climate, Vol. 1, No. 12
(December 1988), pp. 1296-1313. The number of cloudy days increased 2
percentage points from approximately 56 percent to 58 percent of total
days. This is a 3.5 percent increase in the number of cloudy days.) In
addition, other research finds that human-generated sulfates,
contributing to atmospheric pollution, also have the effect of
enhancing the brightness of clouds. This increases the amount of sun
radiation reflected back into space, thus cooling the earth. ("When
fossil fuel is burned, both carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide are
added to the atmosphere. The former should cause warming of the lower
atmosphere by enhancing the greenhouse effect, whereas the latter, by
producing sulphate aerosols, may cause a cooling effect. The
possibility that these two processes could offset each other was
suggestd many years ago...but during most of the intervening period,
attention has focused on the greenhouse effect...Over the next 10-30
years, it is conceivavble that the increased radiative forcing due to
SO2 concentration changes could more than offset the reductions in
radiative forcing due reduced CO2 emissions." Virginia Climate
Advisory, Volume 15, Number 1, Spring 1991, (quoting T.M.L. Wigley,
"Could Reducing Fossil-Fuel Emissions CauseGlobal Warming?" Nature,
Vol. 349 (1991), pp. 503-505.) 

<P> Many scientists have theorized that sulphate aerosols are
primarily responsible for the increase in cloud cover, but this theory
is challenged by new evidence. In the southern hemisphere, where there
are virtually no sulphate aerosols, new evidence shows that cloudiness
has increased. (Telephone interview with Patrick Michaels, State
Climatologist for the Commonwealth of Virginia, May 13, 1992.)
Contends Patrick Michaels, State Climatologist for the Commonwealth of
Virginia, this lends credence to another theory "that increased
cloudiness is one of the natural responses to a greenhouse
enhancement, and therefore, a disproportionate amount of warming
occurs at night." (Ibid.)

<P> Cooling Effect. Clouds are probably more important than
greenhouse gases in their influence on global climate change by a
factor of 4. A study by V. Ramanathan, a professor of geophysical
sciences at the University of Chicago, has shown conclusively that
clouds have a cooling net effect on the planet. (V. Ramanathan, R.D.
Cess, E.F. Harrison, P. Minnis, B.R. Barkstrom, E. Ahmad, D. Hartmann,
"Cloud-Radiative Forcing and Climate: Results from the Earth Radiation
Budget Experiment," Science, Vol. 243, January 6, 1989.) While clouds
do create some warming effect as well as a cooling effect, the cooling
effect is larger by 13.2 watts per square meter of planet surface.
(Ibid. The heating effect of clouds, caused by longwave cloud forcing
resulting from the greenhouse effect, is 31.3 watts per square meter.
The cooling effect, caused by shortwave cloud forcing resulting from
enhanced planetary albedo, is -44.5 watts per square meter.) This
cooling effect is approximately four times the expected warming from
enhanced greenhouse gases (almost 4 watts per square meter) predicted
by catastophic global warming models, according to the study.
Moreover, "[t]his cooling effect is large over the mid- and high-
latitude oceans, with values reaching -100 watts/square meter."
(Ibid.) Thus, a small increase in cloudiness could offset potential
warming from enhanced greenhouse gases.

<P> Perhaps even more important than the change in the effect of
clouds on the overall change of temperature is the effect they may
have on day-time and night-time temperatures. This is important
because the dangers often cited by alarmists are generally predicated
on the fears of rising day temperatures, which they claim will cause
drought-induced crop failures, global flooding from the melting polar
ice caps, and other catastrophes. If only night temperatures increase,
then these dangers are extremely unlikely because rising night
temperatures would not cause these problems. Alarmists rely on the
1990 IPCC report that states "there is no compelling evidence for
general reduction in the amplitude of the diurnal cycle" from
greenhouse gases. Yet this important assumption has been recently
contradicted by government scientists. A 1991 study of the U.S., the
former Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China by Thomas Karl
and other scientists of the National Climatic Data Center at NOAA have
found that night temperatures over the time periods available in each
country have increased, but day temperatures have not. This phenomenon
is found to be directly related to increased cloud cover. (T. Karl, G.
Kukla, V. Razuvayev, M. Changery, R. Quayle, R. Heim, Jr., D.
Easterling, Cong Bin Fu, "Global Warming: Evidence for Asymetric
Diurnal Temperature Change," Geophysical Research Letters, Volume 18,
No. 12 (December 1991), pp. 2252-2256.)

<P> This study concludes that either models have overpredicted day
temperature (underpredicted night temperatures) or that the slight
warming over the last century is due to "factors unrelated to an
enhanced anthropogenically-induced greenhouse effect." (Ibid.) 

<P> Solar Activity. Cycle variations in solar activity may be a much
bigger determinant of Earth temperature variations than previously had
been assumed. While not without problems, this research is extremely
promising as an alternative explanation of global temperature changes,
and -- if correct -- means that variations in man-made greenhouse gas
emissions may have little or no impact. A study by Danish scientists
E. Friis-Christensen and K. Lassen of the Danish Meteorological
Institute has gained enormous attention recently. This study, released
in November 1991, found that variations in the sunspot cycle are
correlated extremely closely with northern hemisphere temperature
fluctuations. (E. Friis-Christensen and K. Lassen, "Length of Solar
Cycle: An Indicator of Solar Activity Closely Associated with
Climate," Science (Vol. 254), November 1, 1991. Sunspots are
relatively dark spots that appear in groups on the surface of the sun.
They have approximately eleven-year cycles and are associated with
strong magnetic fields. The variations in the eleven-year cycle
correlate to increasing and decreasing temperatures over the last 130
years, according to the Danish study.)

<P> Some experts have even theorized that solar magnetic activity
may account almost completely for the changes in the Earth's
temperature in the last 130 years. (See Marshall Institute, "Global
Warming Update: Recent Scientific Findings" (Washington, D.C. 1992).)
Indeed, the remarkably close relationship seems to suggest that other
possible influences, such as greenhouse gases, could not influence
temperatures beyond a few tenths of a degree over the period. There is
further evidence that solar activity may be the dominant factor in
climate change. (For a thorough explanation, see George C. Marshall
Institute, op. cit.) For example, carbon analysis of trees, which is a
reliable indicator of levels of solar magnetic activity, indicates
that solar activity has risen and fallen significantly every 200-300
years for the last 6,000 years. Geologic evidence of the size of past
glaciers reveals that when solar activity increased in the past, as
indicated by carbon analysis, the Earth's temperatures also increased.
When solar activity decreased, temperatures decreased.

<P> Needless to say, the solar theory, like the global warming
theory, is still a theory and must be subjected to vigorous testing.
Moreover, the theory also leaves several questions unanswered.
Although the theory explains the northern hemisphere temperature
changes extremely well, for example, it fails completely to explain
temperature changes in the Southern Hemisphere. It also does not yet
adequately explain how solar radiation warms night temperatures but
not day temperatures. Nevertheless, the Danish study lends
considerable weight to the argument that much more research on climate
change is needed before fundamental changes in energy and economic
policies should be enacted. If solar activity turns out to be the
principal cause of climate change, the world would be needlessly
throwing away its wealth and enduring hardship if it sought to control
other minor factors.

<P>
WHAT WOULD BE THE CONSEQUENCES OF GLOBAL WARMING?

<P> Even if it appears likely that a significant increase in global
temperatures will occur, and even if human activity is the principal
cause, there is still the question of whether any changes in global
temperature would be beneficial or detrimental. Again, the ability of
science to predict with confidence the results of a climate change is
very limited. Still, there are some indications of what might happen.
<P>
The Impact on Crops

<P> Nights may become warmer without any major change in daytime
temperatures. Historical data show that the temperature increases in
the past 100 years have all been at night, and that day temperatures
basically have remained constant. (The large increase in warming that
is often cited as having occurred in the last 100 years actually
occurred between 50 to 100 years ago, before the large increases in
CO2 emissions. Obscuring this fact often leads to the false conclusion
that the Earth has been steadily warming. In fact, it has oscillated.
The last fifty years showed very little overall warming.) This pattern
has important implications. The crop-growing season is affected most
by the timing of the last spring frost and the first fall frost. If
night temperatures increased, these frosts would occur earlier in the
spring and later in the fall, thereby extending the growing season and
boosting food production in many regions.

<P> It is widely believed that global warming would lead to droughts
while increasing the water requirements of plants. But this theory
does not stand up to scrutiny. First, droughts are not likely to
increase with global warming if the primary effect is to raise only
night-time temperatures. (Part of the confusion stems from the
improper use of a crude drought index, known as the Palmer Drought
Index, to gauge not only the level of drought that has occurred, but
to further predict the amount of drought that would occur in the
future from increases in the mean temperature. Proponents of future
drought base their predictions on the presumption that precipitation
will decrease while mean temperatures will increase. The problems with
this methodology are two-fold. There is no indication that
precipitation will decrease (past records show no change). Further,
using increased mean temperatures to estimate drought will
systematically overstate the problem or find problems where they do
not exist if the increase occurred at night. Simply stated, if
precipitation and day temperatures remained constant while night
temperatures increased, thereby raising the mean temperature, the
evaporation rate would not change very much because evaporation is
caused primarily by high day temperatures.) Second, since water
evaporation from plants mainly occurs during the day, plants would not
experience greater heat stress simply from warmer nights.

<P> The increased CO2 associated with the global warming theory may
also actually improve agricultural production. Studies conducted by
the Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service (ARS)
show that doubling the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere would
improve cotton yields by 80 percent, wheat and rice by 36 percent,
soybeans by 32 percent, and corn by 16 percent. (Laing, "Climate of
Fear," op. cit.) Increased CO2 in the atmosphere also would
significantly reduce the amount of water necessary for plants because
plants could breathe easier, thus losing less moisture through their
pores during the breathing process. 

<P> Another probable effect of global warming would be to expand the
world's agricultural belt. More of Canada and the former Soviet Union,
as well as the northern latitudes of Europe and the northern states of
America, could become more abundant producers. But lower latitudes
would not necessarily experience an equivalent fall in production. The
enhanced greenhouse, or global warming, theory predicts that future
warming will occur primarily in higher latitudes. Moreover, if warmer
nights were the main effect of global warming, this would mean higher
yields in lower latitudes that now experience frosts by extending the
growing season.

<P> Flooding. Some proponents of the global warming theory predict
worldwide flooding. The theory is that as the earth warms, the polar
ice caps will begin to melt and sea levels could rise to dangerous
levels. Some projections in the early 1980s theorized huge tidal waves
and a sea level rise of as much as 25 feet above the current sea
level. Even the more conservative models suggested a rise of two to
three feet. Projections have been revised down considerably in the
last decade, however. (The 1990 IPCC report found that the "best
estimate" predicted a sea level rise of 66cm, or just over 2 feet.)

<P> Evidence released this year suggests that even these recent
predictions may be wrong and that sea levels could even fall. A team
of Canadian and American scientists studied the geological record of
the ice caps over the last 130,000 years. (G. Miller, and A. deVernal,
"Will Greenhouse Warming Lead to Northern Hemisphere Ice Sheet
Growth," Nature, Volume 355 (1992), p. 245.) The team discovered that
as global temperatures rose, the size of the ice caps became larger.
The explanation? The Arctic and Antarctic air normally is too cold to
hold much moisture. (Marshall Institute, "Global Warming Update," op.
cit.) Consequently, the poles experience very little snowfall. But as
the temperature rises, the air becomes warm enough to hold moisture
and snow falls -- increasing the size of the polar caps and leading to
a drop in the sea level. 

<P>
THE COST OF DOING SOMETHING

<P> Many less developed countries are just beginning their slow
ascent out of poverty, thanks to their adoption of free market
economic policies favoring strong growth. These policies will bring
material prosperity and improvements in the quality of life of their
inhabitants. But rapid growth requires large amounts of inexpensive
energy, and for underdeveloped countries, this generally means burning
fossil fuels, such as oil and coal. If restrictions on the use of such
fuels are enacted, these countries will have to forego some of the
benefits of increased wealth and the associated improvements in
health.

<P> Some proponents of slower economic growth maintain that slower
growth means better environmental protection. But a Princeton study of
42 countries, released late last year, shows that air pollution is
inversely related to wealth above the $4,000 to $5,000 Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) per capita level. In other words, as a country grows
wealthier, its residents tend to be more prepared and can afford to
devote financial resources to reducing air pollution. (G.M. Grossman
and A.B. Krueger, "Environmental Impacts of a North American Free
Trade Agreement," Discussion Paper No. 158, Discussion Paper on
Economics, Woodrow Wilson School, Princeton University, November 1991.
It must be noted that between $0 to $4,000 GDP per capita, the amount
of air pollution increases as GDP per capita rises. Since Lesser
Developed Countries fall into this range, this provides an additional
reason to allow these countries to break past the wealth barrier as
quickly as possible, rather than slowly increasing in wealth or
remaining economically flat.) Action to improve the environment is a
characteristic of rich countries, not poor ones.

<P> Huge Costs. Although the economic impact of curbing man-made
greenhouse gas emissions would be greatest in less-developed
countries, American families also would be hard hit. One proposal is
to reduce CO2 by 20 percent by the year 2000 by imposing a carbon tax.
According to a 1991 Department of Energy report, this would cost
approximately $95 billion annually, or $1,200 for every American
household. ("Limiting Net Greenhouse Gas Emissions in the United
States," U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Environmental Analysis,
Deputy Under Secretary for Policy, Planning and Analysis, September
1991.) America currently spends approximately $125 billion annually,
or about $1,500 per family, on environmental protection. The carbon
tax proposal would almost double that cost, and might lead to demands
from business and households to reduce other spending to protect the
environment. In preparatory conference negotiations concluded this May
9, the U.S. and 142 other countries adopted non-binding vague language
that urged greenhouse emissions to be returned to their 1990 levels by
some unspecified date and to attempt unspecified reductions by the
year 2000.

<P> However, according to a 1990 study by the Congressional Budget
Office (CBO), even if emissions were kept at 1990 levels, America
would "risk several years of economic stagnation and high
unemployment," depending on how a carbon tax was implemented.
(Congressional Budget Office, "Carbon Charges as a Response to Global
Warming: The Effects of Taxing Fossil Fuels," August 1990.) Even if
the tax were phased in gradually, an estimated 700,000 jobs would be
lost as a direct result of the carbon tax by 1997, according to the
CBO. 

<P> Another report, a Department of State memorandum issued last
month, suggests the cost of reducing carbon emissions would be very
small, but this report contains doubtful assumptions. ("U.S. Views on
Global Climate Change," United States Department of State, Bureau of
Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, April
23, 1992.) For instance, the State Department memorandum assumes that
over one-quarter of all households and up to almost two-thirds of all
U.S. businesses will replace their lighting fixtures with more energy
efficient fixtures by the year 2000. This unlikely assumption accounts
for as much as 46 percent of the total voluntary carbon reductions the
State Department predicts will occur.

<P>
A PRUDENT POLICY AMID UNCERTAIN SCIENCE

<P> When faced with uncertain science, as is the case with the
theory of global warming, one of four basic strategies can be adopted.
(S. Fred Singer, "Environmental Strategies with Uncertain Science,"
Regulation, Winter 1990, p. 65.) These are: 
<UL>
<P>Option #1: Take no action, not even research. This option has the
      advantage of being costless, since it requires nothing but
      waiting until the threat, if any, is clearer. But it introduces
      the danger of not dealing with a potential problem and not
      increasing knowledge concerning the threat and the consequences
      of inaction.

<P>Option #2: Conduct more research, but take no other action. This
      option has the advantage of being relatively inexpensive
      compared with other possible actions, while increasing the
      knowledge of the scope and likelihood of a potential problem. It
      risks, of course, the consequences associated with having
      delayed action if the threat turns out to be real.
      

<P>Option #3: Take limited action to control greenhouse gas emissions,
      phased in over a period of time. This option has the advantage
      of being less expensive than tackling the problem -- if it
      exists -- completely and immediately. But it suffers from being
      much more expensive than research, and the result may be huge
      expenditures on a problem that does not exist.


<P>Option #4: Undertake full control of emissions on an emergency
      timetable. This option has the advantage of addressing potential
      harm as quickly and thoroughly as possible. But it is very
      expensive, and may address a mythical problem.
</UL>

<P> The threat posed by global warming, if it is real, is large
enough to rule out the first option as the prudent policy. Policy
makers then must consider the risk in delaying action while acquiring
more scientific understanding on which to base a policy. Two studies
completed last year strongly contradict the "must act now" view that
maintains there is no time to delay, according to a scientific panel
of the George C. Marshall Institute, which is a Washington, D.C.-based
public policy institute focusing on scientific matters. According to
the panel's findings:
<UL>
 The calculations [of both studies] show that a five-year delay
      in limiting carbon emissions will make the world warmer in the
      next century by at most one tenth of a degree, compared to how
      warm it would be if there were no delay. (Marshall Institute,
      "Global Warming Update," op. cit.)
</UL>
<P> At the same time, the research data made possible by stepped-up
global climate research means knowledge is increasing rapidly, so
delay may significantly increase the chances of taking the right
course of action without incurring serious damage to the Earth's
environment if the global warming theory is found to be substantially
correct.

<P> Thus rather than agreeing to targets and timetables for
controlling greenhouse gas emissions, which may not be needed and
which would impose enormous costs on developed and less-developed
countries, the U.S. would be wise to pursue an intensive program of
research and urge other countries to do likewise.

<P> The U.S. has set the pace in research on global change, and this
has produced huge amounts of new data -- much of it raising serious
questions about the global warming theory. The U.S. has spent $2.7
billion since the global change research project was initiated three
years ago, and the Administration has proposed increasing the annual
global change research budget next year by 24 percent to almost $1.4
billion. The rest of the world combined spends about the same amount
as the U.S. currently. The U.S. should commit to increases in the
research budget of $300 million, or 25 percent, annually for the next
five years. To pay for this research, the federal government should
sell the Naval Petroleum Reserve, which is no longer needed for the
Navy's security.

<P> The Search for an Answer. New climate change research could be
supplemented by allowing scientists greater access to non-sensitive
intelligence information accumulated in the past. This would be useful
because surveillance satellites and aircraft, submarines, and
oceanographic vessels have collected mountains of data that can be
used to accelerate research on questions such as past contours and
thaw rates of polar ice caps, ocean chemistry and temperatures, and
scores of other issues. Subject to legitimate national security
concerns, such as sources and methods of intelligence gathering and
existing programs, President Bush should announce that he will
authorize U.S. intelligence agencies to begin opening their relevant
archived files. (The authorization for opening the archives should be
limited to global research only.) Not only could this prove very
beneficial to the search for an answer to the questions implicit in
the global warming theory, but such an action would demonstrate that
the President takes the potential threat of global warming seriously
-- without prematurely engaging in a potentially harmful and costly
policy. (As Alton Frye, Vice President and Washington director of the
Council on Foreign Relations, states: "Given the pressures on the
President to join the commitments projected for the Rio conference, a
program of cooperation between environmental and national security
communities could be a political windfall for the Administration. The
President should tell the world at the Earth Summit that he has sent a
clear order to the national security community: ' subject only to
safeguarding current programs, open the archives.' Few steps would do
more to demonstrate commitment to vigorous action on the global
warming issue.... " Alton Frye, "How to 'Spy' on the Environment," The
Washington Post, May 4, 1992, p. C4.) 
<P>
CONCLUSION

<P> Climate change is an extremely complicated field of scientific
research. Although understanding of the probable effects of greenhouse
gas emissions is rapidly improving, the level of uncertainty remains
high and the predictive power of climate models is poor. The models
now used vary in their predictions enormously. 

<P> Moreover, recent studies and analyses of past studies indicate
that many of the underlying assumptions in the computer models showing
warming are wrong and lead to erroneous predictions. Models of climate
change also fail to explain the discrepancy between predicted climate
change in the last 100 years and actual change. 

<P> In addition, even if the elements of the global warming theory
are accepted, the forecasted effects are overblown and may in some
cases be completely wrong. In particular, the evidence suggests
strongly that widespread flooding from the melting of the ice caps
will not occur. Further, agricultural production is likely to
increase, not fall. 

<P> And while there is a plausible ring to the argument that it
would be wise for countries to take action, "just in case," the costs
of government-mandated reductions in CO2 would be enormous. Such
reductions would impose heavy costs on American families and raise
unemployment. Less developed countries would be especially hard hit.

<P> Thus, given the shaky science, the uncertain effects, and the
enormous cost of taking precipitous action, the U.S. should not agree
to binding targets and timetables on emissions at the Rio conference
next month. Any agreement should be limited to a commitment to treat
the threat seriously, with reductions in greenhouse gases voluntary
for each country. 

<P> What the U.S. should do is emphasize the importance of research
on global climate change. The U.S. should pledge to increase its
climate research budget, which accounts for half the total spent by
all countries, and challenge the other nations at the conference to
step up their research. The U.S. also should open up the relevant
archives of U.S. intelligence agencies, subject to legitimate national
security concerns, to accelerate global climate research.

<P> Global warming may pose a huge danger to the Earth. Or it may
turn out to be just as much a false alarm as the "Ice Age" panic
twenty years ago. If the science of climate change was more precise
than it is, and all the evidence consistent with the dire predictions
of some proponents of the global warming theory, then it could make
sense for the U.S. and other countries to take urgent, expensive
action in an effort to deal with the potential threat. But the science
is uncertain. Rather than rush to "do something," the wiser course
would be to find out what is actually happening to the Earth's
climate.

<title>The U.N. Tax: Not Now, Not Ever -- Heritage</title>

<h3>THE U.N. TAX: NOT NOW, NOT EVER</h3>

Thomas P. Sheehy<br>

Executive Memorandum No. 445<br>
February 9, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;United Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali 
wants to give the U.N. the authority to tax Americans and others around the world. In expressing 
frustration over the perilous state of his organization's finances, the U.N. chief made known his 
support for U.N. taxes during a January lecture and follow-up media discussion at Oxford 
University. Soon afterwards, several prominent Members of Congress made clear their opposition 
to this scheme. In the Senate, Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS), Foreign Relations Committee 
Chairman Jesse Helms (R-NC), and several other Senators have sponsored a bill which bars U.S. 
payments to the U.N. if it attempts to implement a tax. Similar legislation has been introduced in 
the House.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Senator Dole and others are right to oppose U.N. taxes on 
Americans. They recognize that the problem with the U.N. is not a lack of funding. Years of U.N. 
funding by America and its allies have allowed the organization to become bloated and poorly 
managed. The real problem with the U.N. is twofold: its resistance to reform and its subtle yet 
growing infringement upon national sovereignty.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Seeking Independence.</b> The U.N. is in a state 
of financial crisis. It is owed roughly $2.5 billion in overdue assessments from its member states. 
The U.S., the U.N.'s largest financial supporter (paying 25 percent of its budget), accounts for some 
$1 billion of this amount, but Washington is not alone. Roughly half of the U.N.'s 185 member 
states have not paid their full U.N. dues. Under Secretary General for Administration and 
Management Joseph Connor admitted a few weeks ago that the U.N.'s financial situation is 
"precarious and headed for the brink."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Boutros-Ghali believes that giving the U.N. taxing power 
could eliminate or minimize the problem of overdue bills from member states. He also thinks it 
would give the U.N. a greater degree of financial independence. At Oxford University, the 
Secretary General said, "It is time to seriously address the need for a United Nations that can 
operate on a secure and steady independent financial foundation."  The Secretary General discussed 
a range of international taxes, including taxes on fossil fuels, international travel, and currency 
transactions -- for example, a tax of a British pound on every non-domestic airplane ticket. This is 
not the first time the Secretary General has expressed sympathy for a U.N. tax. In 1992, he 
suggested that the U.N. tax either international arms sales or international air travel to pay for its 
peacekeeping operations. At Oxford, the Secretary General told the British Broadcasting Company, 
"I'm sure we will win in the end and that we will obtain from the international community [an 
understanding] that we need to have our own income."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Secretary General's proposals were not made off the 
cuff. The idea of giving the U.N. financial independence through taxing power is supported by 
some member states and the U.N. bureaucracy. Numerous proposals to tax international goods and 
services, the use of the oceans and outer space, and international financial transactions have been 
made in the General Assembly. The <i>Human Development Report</i>, a publication of the 
United Nations Development Program, a foreign aid organization, has championed a global tax to 
fund the U.N. system. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad, Australian Foreign 
Minister Gareth Evans, and Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto have publicly endorsed 
various U.N. tax ideas. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>U.N. Ambitions.</b> The Secretary General's 
confidence is in keeping with the expansive course he has set for the world body. As the first post-
Cold War Secretary General, Boutros-Ghali assumed office at a time of high expectations for the 
U.N. This was the era of the "New World Order," as pronounced by President George Bush in 
1991. In his 1992 report <i>Agenda for Peace</i>, the Secretary General suggested that national 
sovereignty was weakening now that the Cold War had ended. This climate of opinion set the stage 
for the U.N. peacekeeping operation in Somalia, which essentially assumed sovereignty over that 
war-wracked country. Boutros-Ghali also supports the creation of a U.N. standing army that would 
be under his command. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The ability to control territory and command an army, like 
the ability to tax, represents the exercise of sovereign power. The U.N. should never have this 
power; it would be a usurpation of the constitutional rights of the American people. These rights are 
protected by the U.S. government, not the U.N. The U.N. does not represent the interests of 
Americans; it represents the interests of its 185 member states, many of which are undemocratic 
and repressive.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The Real Problem at the U.N.</b>The real 
problem at the U.N. is not a lack of funding. In fact, U.N. spending has been mushrooming, and 
that is the real problem. The U.N. regular budget has increased 20 percent since 1991. 
Peacekeeping costs have ballooned to $3.5 billion a year in 1994; in 1990, peacekeeping cost less 
than $700 million a year. As might be expected, such increases in spending have been accompanied 
by serious waste. In fact, the U.N. system wastes much of its approximately $10 billion budget. For 
example:
<p><ul>
<li> In 1995, the U.N. scrapped a never-used $1 million turnstile security system at its New York 
headquarters. The reason: The turnstile clocks would have tracked the arrival and departures of 
U.N. employees.
<p>
<li> Various agencies of the U.N. spent approximately $1 million a day at the height of the Somalia 
peacekeeping operation in 1993. This included renting hundreds of apartments equipped with air 
conditioning. After all this, the Somalia mission was a failure.
<p>
<li> In 1995, the U.N. spent some $500,000 for a two-week conference on the Sustainable 
Development of Small Island Developing States. The U.N. spent $15,000 to fly representatives 
from the Western Sahara to this conference in Barbados. No one explained how the Sahara Desert 
qualified as a "small island developing state."
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The U.N.'s problems go beyond waste and corruption. The 
U.N. needs a major organizational overhaul, and its bureaucracy needs to be trimmed. But the 
Clinton Administration has not been successful in promoting reform at the U.N. The U.N. Inspector 
General office it supported has been limited in scope and characterized as a "disappointment" by 
Representative Lee Hamilton (D-IN) and Senator Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS), two Members of 
Congress who have long championed U.N. reform. More telling is the Administration's admitted 
failure to keep the U.N. budget in check. In December, a high-ranking U.S. official at the U.N. 
noted that the organization's 1996-1997 budget is "higher than we would have preferred and 
recommended."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Even if the Administration did push for fundamental 
reform, however, it would not find an ally in the Secretary General. Boutros-Ghali has not 
demonstrated any desire for real change. He ordered that a 1993 report critical of U.N. reform 
progress, written by then Under Secretary General for Administration and Management Richard 
Thornburgh, be suppressed. If given more independence from critical review, which Boutros-
Ghali's tax proposal implies, the Secretary General presemably would become even less interested 
in reform.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Conclusion.</b> Senator Dole, Senator Helms, and 
others were right to oppose the U.N. tax idea. The Clinton Administration also was right to reject 
Boutros-Ghali's tax proposal. But U.N. bureaucrats have not given up hope. In September 1996, the 
U.N. Working Group on Finances will submit a report on financing to the U.N. General Assembly. 
This report may very well recommend a U.N. tax scheme. If it does, the proposal may gain support 
from other countries, leaving the U.S. once again in the position of being pressured by other nations 
to adopt U.N. proposals that harm American interests. If this happens, the Clinton Administration 
needs to make clear to the U.N. and other countries that U.N. taxes are unacceptable. The last thing 
the U.N. needs is more money and less accountability.

<title>Give Netanyahu A Chance - Heritage</title>

<center>
<h3>GIVE NETANYAHU A CHANCE</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/phillips.htm">James A. Phillips</a><br>
Senior Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 452<br>
June 7, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Prime Minister-elect Binyamin Netanyahu's stunning victory in Israel's May 29 elections has jolted Washington. The conventional wisdom holds that Netanyahu's election spells trouble for the Arab-Israeli peace process and inevitably will generate increased frictions in Israel's relations with the Palestinians, neighboring Arab states, and the United States. This is not necessarily so. In fact, the Clinton Administration can help make sure that this does not happen by reformulating its peace strategy to adjust to the new situation in Israel.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Contrary to the prevailing opinion in the American media, which often demonized Netanyahu's Likud Party, the Israeli elections were not a referendum on Arab-Israeli peace. By electing Netanyahu, Israelis did not vote against peace, they voted for security. The Israeli public has grown increasingly embittered in recent months by the deteriorating personal security situation. Sadly, the 217 Israelis killed by terrorists since the September 1993 Israeli-Palestinian accord exceeds the 209 killed in the entire decade before the accord was signed on the White House lawn. Clearly, the peace negotiations launched by the Yitzhak Rabin-Shimon Peres government failed to safeguard Israeli security against terrorist attack. If the prevailing trends had continued, support for the peace talks inside Israel would have eroded to such an extent that they would have been doomed to failure.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Netanyahu pragmatically has pledged to continue the peace negotiations. But instead of obsessively advancing the "peace process," he has spoken of making progress on the "peace and security process."  Netanyahu declared that the Likud would not have signed the 1993 Oslo agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organization, but he has accepted it as a diplomatic <I>fait accompli</I> that must be respected as long as the Palestinians live up to their commitments under the agreement. He is expected to be much more forceful than his predecessors in insisting on total Palestinian compliance with the interim agreements negotiated thus far. In particular, he has expressed great dissatisfaction with the Palestinian Authority's failure to crack down systematically on terrorists and to extradite terrorists that have murdered Israelis.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The precise outlines of Netanyahu's policies will not become clear until he forms a government and drafts a coalition agreement that spells out government policy on critical issues. The Prime Minister-elect hopes to complete this process and present his cabinet to the new parliament when it convenes on June 17. The Likud's 32 parliamentary seats leave it 29 seats short of a majority in the 120-seat Knesset. This means Netanyahu will have to strike deals with at least four other political parties to bring them into a governing coalition, a political necessity that will substantially shape the policies of his government.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
During the election campaign Netanyahu promised two major changes in policy toward the West Bank and Gaza: He would revive the settlement program frozen by the Rabin-Peres government and he will give the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) full freedom of action in combating terrorism inside autonomous Palestinian areas. Each of these policies could disrupt the negotiations if pursued too vigorously, but if pursued judiciously may become a useful bargaining chip in the final status talks with the Palestinians that began in May.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The first major test of Israeli-Palestinian relations under the new government is likely to come over the question of Israeli military withdrawal from Hebron, the last Palestinian city under direct Israeli control. The Labor government had agreed to withdraw Israeli forces from most of the city, except for an area inhabited by 450 Israeli settlers, by mid-June. Netanyahu had criticized this decision during the election campaign, but stated noncommittally after the election that he had requested a "study" on the issue.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While Israel's negotiations with the Palestinians are likely to proceed at a more deliberate pace than in the past, Israel's relations with Jordan, another peace partner, may actually improve. Jordan's King Hussein, who defeated Yasser Arafat's PLO in a bloody civil war in 1970, was known to be nervous about the close cooperation between Israel's Labor government and his Palestinian rival, which he feared would come at his expense. King Hussein already has publicly proclaimed support for Netanyahu and expressed confidence that the new Prime Minister will continue Israel's peace efforts.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The biggest change in Israel's foreign policy is likely to come in its strategy toward Syria. Netanyahu has ruled out a military withdrawal from the strategic Golan Heights, Israeli-occupied territory that dominates the Syrian-Israeli border area. But he has pledged to make diplomatic efforts to reach incremental agreements that could greatly improve Syrian-Israeli relations. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Adjusting U.S. Policy.</b> Despite the Clinton Administration's open efforts to boost Peres's re-election campaign, Netanyahu assured President Clinton after the election that Israeli-American relations are "as stable as a rock."  The relationship between Netanyahu's government and the Clinton Administration probably will pass through an initial honeymoon period that could last through the November U.S. elections. But friction is likely to develop on a number of fronts: the Hebron withdrawal issue, Netanyahu's plans to boost settlement activities, disagreements over security issues, and clashes over peace negotiations. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To minimize tension in bilateral relations and improve diplomatic cooperation on peace and other issues, the Clinton Administration should:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Sound out Netanyahu.</b> The Prime Minister-elect has accepted President Clinton's telephone invitation to visit Washington shortly after he forms his governing coalition. During the visit, the Administration should explore with an open mind Netanyahu's suggestions for new approaches to the peace negotiations, strategic cooperation, and other issues. 
<P>
<li><b> Rethink the Administration's approach to Arab-Israeli peace negotiations.</b> The May 29 elections demonstrated that Israelis increasingly are reluctant to take greater security risks in exchange for Palestinian promises that often go unfulfilled. The two-year experiment in coexistence before the commencement of final status negotiations last month was supposed to allow the two sides to build confidence in each other, which would allow both to show more flexibility in the difficult final status talks. But for Israelis the experiment in coexistence has been a nightmare. To salvage the chances for a genuine long-term settlement, the negotiating timetable for the final status agreement should be stretched out past the current 1999 deadline. This would give the Palestinian Authority more time to prove it is willing and able to stamp out terrorism. Moreover, it will take at least a generation to lay a solid foundation for a stable and lasting peace. Pressing the two sides to rush to meet the 1999 deadline, when most other deadlines set up by the September 1993 accord have been missed, is unrealistic and could undermine the chances for a genuine peace. 
<p>
<li><b> Toughen U.S. policy toward Syria.</b> Syrian dictator Hafez al-Assad has used his perfunctory negotiations with Israel as a diplomatic figleaf to avoid Western pressure to halt his long-standing support of terrorism. The Administration should end its coddling of Assad and lead an international campaign to impose economic and diplomatic sanctions on Damascus until it ends its support for Palestinian, Lebanese, and Turkish terrorists. As long as Syria continues to support such terrorist groups, it is unrealistic to expect it to function as an acceptable negotiating partner at the peace table.
<p>
<li><b> Pressure Yasser Arafat to suppress terrorism.</b> Terrorism is the chief threat to peace. The Clinton Administration should warn Arafat that, if the Palestinian Authority is incapable of halting terrorism, the U.S. will support Israel's right to self-defense in the event that Netanyahu orders the IDF to strike at terrorists in the autonomous areas. Moreover, Washington should warn Arafat that it will halt its $100 million per year in foreign aid if the Palestinian Authority continues to shirk its commitment to suppress terrorism.
</ul> <p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Contrary to what passes for conventional wisdom in Washington, Prime Minister Netanyahu will be a pragmatic leader with a realistic foreign policy. Unlike the Peres and Clinton Administrations, which have made the peace process an end in itself, Netanyahu sees peace negotiations as a means to an end -- building a stable and genuine peace based on hardheaded security arrangements.

<h3>TRADE WITH ASIA MEANS JOBS FOR AMERICA</h3>

By John T. Dori<br>
Research Associate<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 119<br>
September 16, 1996<br>

<p></center>
<font size="-1"><a href="/heritage/library/categories/trade/fyi119t1.gif">Table 1</a>: U.S. Exports to Asia and Jobs Supported by Those Exports: State-by-State Analysis</font>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

U.S.-Asia trade grew dramatically in 1995: The 25.8 percent rise in exports to East and South Asia outpaced the growth in exports to all other regions of the world. At almost $193 billion, U.S. exports to the Pacific Rim and South Asia exceeded U.S. exports to Europe by more than $50 billion and accounted for more than 3.8 million American jobs in 1995. Overall, exports to this dynamic region have created in excess of a million American jobs since 1993 alone.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Individual U.S. states that saw dramatic increases in their exports to Asia in 1995 include South Dakota (81.4 percent more than in 1994), Vermont (49.7 percent more), Georgia (46.5 percent more), Delaware (45.3 percent more), Indiana (45.2 percent more), Louisiana (44.3 percent more), and Texas (40.3 percent more). Also noteworthy was California, the first state to top the one million mark in numbers of workers employed as a result of exports to East and South Asia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Asian demand for American products was particularly high in sectors like transportation equipment, agriculture products, and intellectual property (such as computer software). The good news for American exporters is that these are growth industries. As Michael Walton, chief World Bank economist for East Asia and the Pacific, puts it, "The U.S. and Asia are complementary. The U.S., in terms of its farm sector, technological capability and service sector strength, will experience a rising beneficial integration with East Asia that will be a source of growth for both sides. Asia is growing 8%, but the market there for the kinds of goods and services the U.S. provides is growing in the teens."<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In more good news for the United States, it is predicted that the economies of Asia will continue to grow at high rates for the foreseeable future. As these countries become more prosperous, their demand for American products will increase commensurately. Thus, the U.S. should focus on the tremendous promise offered by the Asia-Pacific region. As the following <a href="/heritage/library/categories/trade/fyi119t1.gif">table</a> clearly demonstrates, Americans from all 50 states stand to benefit greatly from closer trade relations with the vital and dynamic Asia-Pacific region.

     If Congress is serious about reform -- cutting spending, staff,
and the undergrowth of overlapping committees -- there is no better
place to start than by eliminating "select committees."  Organized
around hot-button issues, these panels have large budgets and staff,
but lack authority to pass legislation to solve the problems they
examine.  Tomorrow the House is scheduled to consider H.  Res.  52,
which would provide funding for the four existing House select
committees to operate for an additional year.  Last Tuesday, January
26, the House on a 237-180 vote defeated a resolution to reauthorize
one of the select committees (on narcotics) for two years.  Startled
House leaders pulled resolutions on the other three committee from the
House schedule.  H.  Res.  52 is a compromise proposal designed to
keep the select committees alive until the Joint Committee on the
Organization of the Congress reports broader reform proposals.  But
the reform study should not be used as an excuse to delay needed
reforms, and there are convincing arguments to abolish the select
committees now.
<P>
     Eliminating select committees will advance the important reform
objectives of emphasizing the legislative mission of Congress, cutting
staff, eliminating overlapping committees, reducing spending, curbing
special interest influence, and limiting incumbents' electoral
advantages.  These goals are elements of The Heritage Foundation's
congressional reform program, and are included in many other reform
proposals.
<P>
     Focusing Congress on Legislating. Traditionally, select
committees are formed for a limited time and a specific purpose: 
panels to investigate Iran-Contra and October Surprise allegations and
the joint reform committee are recent examples.  In the mid-1970s,
however, the House began creating bodies with vague mandates to look
into broader social problems, resulting in the existing four select
committees on Aging, Narcotics, Hunger, and Children, Youth and
Families.  Rather than forming definite plans for action in these
areas, the committees have sought renewed authority every other year
(the House can only authorize the committees for the two-year length
of a Congress) for as long as eighteen years now.  Because select
committees cannot consider legislation they cannot, by definition,
take steps to address the problems they investigate.  The lack of real
purpose has caused the committees to drift beyond their mandates, with
the Aging Committee, for instance, involving itself in health care for
all ages, the environment, and even programs for farm workers.
<P>
     Getting Congress to concentrate on its central, legislative
mission is the key to effective reform.  Eliminating select committees
would remove a needless distraction and encourage Congress to focus
its energies on legislative solutions to pressing problems.
<P>
     Reducing the Budget and Staff. There is a broad consensus on the
need to reduce congressional spending and staff.  President Clinton
has called for a 25 percent staff cut.  The select committees employ
91 staffers; their combined budgets total $3.65 million.  Eliminating
select committees would trim House committee staffs by 4.5 percent. 
This represents a useful first step toward President Clinton's 25
percent target, and would allow the House to concentrate staff in more
important areas, even as it reduces overall numbers.
<P>
     Eliminating Overlapping Committees.  Reformers agree that
Congress has too many committees, often with overlapping
responsibilities.  Multiple assignments make it difficult for Members
of Congress to attend properly to committee business, and
jurisdictional conflicts make passing legislation difficult.  The
select committees themselves attempt to justify their existence by
citing the large numbers of regular (standing) committees that have
responsibility in their area of concern:  eight of 22 standing House
committees in the case of the Hunger panel.  But addressing
overlapping committee jurisdictions by creating yet another committee
is like trying to cure a hangover with Scotch.  If committees are not
organized appropriately to address major national problems, overall
committee jurisdictions should be reformed.  The select committees
have a total of 172 members, so their elimination would be a major
step forward in reducing scheduling conflicts and dissipation of
Member and staff efforts.
<P>
     The Joint Committee on the Organization of the Congress is
examining the committee structure in hopes of reducing the number of
committees and subcommittees and rationalizing jurisdictional
divisions.  Eliminating select committees now would aid the reform
process by removing one issue from the joint committee's overburdened
platter.  Reauthorizing the select committees for a year in hopes of a
reprieve would send a very damaging signal that Congress intends to
use the joint committee to construct a facade of reform while
attempting to continue business as usual.
<P>
     Curbing Electioneering and Special Interests. Because the select
committees have no authority to consider legislation or otherwise
change programs or policies, they have become publicity and lobbying
organizations, often allied with special interest groups which benefit
from the programs the committees push.  A large budget item for most
select committees is for "field hearings."  Even more than most
congressional hearings, these travelling shows are more about
publicity than about legislation.  Members of the committees visit
sites outside of Washington supposedly to hear from ordinary citizens. 
But the real objective is for constituents to hear from their
Congressman:  almost all field hearings are in districts represented
by members of the select committee.  The shows dominate local media
while they are in town.  So appealing is this posturing that the
select committees have swollen to become among the largest in
Congress.  The Aging Committee, with 69 members, is larger by far than
any of the House's standing committees.  But since the committees
cannot approve legislation, they are guaranteed to do nothing about
the citizens' concerns.  As such, they represent, at best, hollow
expressions of concern and can be of no real assistance to those in
need.
<P>
     Reform Now. The House has an opportunity tomorrow to demonstrate
a commitment to real congressional reform.  The House should follow
through on its decision last week to eliminate the Narcotics Committee
by voting this week to eliminate all four select committees.  Allowing
the congressional leadership to keep these panels alive for another
year by approving H.  Res.  52 would represent a big step backward for
congressional reform.

INTRODUCTION
  <P>   "Our new security strategy will... ensure our defense industry
can supply the weapons and technologies America may need in the
future." So promised then-candidate Bill Clinton in an August 13,
1992, speech before the World Affairs Council of Los Angeles. But just
a few moments later in the speech, Clinton charged that: "There is
today no plan to help our defense workers and military personnel make
a transition to a civilian economy. I have such a plan." Candidate
Clinton thus promised to preserve America's military industrial base
while at the same time converting it to civilian production. Therein
lies a serious contradiction. The weapons and technologies America may
need in the future cannot be made if too many defense industries are
converted to manufacture gas-saving automobiles, for example, instead
of tanks and armored personnel carriers.
<P>
     President Clinton's defense industrial policy has been marked by
two initiatives. On March 11, during a speech outside Baltimore, he
announced a $20 billion defense conversion program. Two weeks later,
he took a step that was tantamount to abandoning the defense
industrial base: he proposed reducing defense budget authority by over
3.5 percent per year over the next five years. (This figure is
calculated in so-called real terms, accounting for the expected rise
in inflation.  Department of Defense, "FY 1994 Defense Budget Begins
New Era," News Release No.  126-93, March 27, 1993.  The news release
is accompanied by a package of supporting materials that provides
total defense budget figures for the period covering fiscal years 1994
through 1998 and detailed information on the fiscal 1994 defense
budget request.) This budget proposal doubles the $60 billion cut
Clinton promised during the campaign. The largest decreases in the
fiscal 1994 defense budget will come in accounts for the procurement
of weapons and equipment. Not having these funds will especially
weaken the defense industrial base because they are the main fuel for
industrial production. The budget authority for procurement spending
will diminish by over $8 billion, or 17 percent in real terms, from
the 1993 level to $45.5 billion in 1994. (Ibid.) Reductions of this
magnitude will make it impossible for the defense industry to produce
an adequate supply of weapons and technologies for America's defense
needs.
<P>
     For Clinton to avoid devastating the military industrial base and
the nation's military posture, he must reverse course. He should:
<P>
     Concentrate his long-range defense planning above all on the
     industrial needs of the armed forces, and not on converting the
     defense industrial base to civilian production.
<P>
     Eliminate the $20 billion defense conversion program. 
<P>
     Focus defense planning on the building and buying of the next
     generation of weapons.
<P>
     Give governmental support to specific defense industries only as
     a last resort. There may be times when the government will have
     to support a particular defense industry -- one which
     manufactures submarines, for example -- which may not appear to
     be needed in the short run, but which may be needed to meet some
     future threat.
<P>
CLINTON'S DEFENSE CONVERSION POLICY
<P>
     The Clinton defense conversion plan was developed during the 1992
presidential campaign and the first months of his Administration. The
policy was announced on March 11 in a speech by the President to the
employees of Westinghouse Electronics Systems, outside Baltimore. The
$20 billion program is based on four principles: 
<P>
Principle #1: America's so-called defense economy needs to be
     converted tocivilian production. 
<P>
     Clinton believes that the Cold War produced a U.S. economy
heavily burdened by defense expenditures. Supposedly all this spending
on defense deprives the economy and the government of funds for
domestic programs. Also it supposedly distorts the economy toward non-
productive purposes.
<P>
Principle #2: The federal government should play a central role in
     managing defense conversion. 
<P>
     Of the $20 billion that the Clinton Administration proposes to
spend over a five-year period on defense conversion, $10 billion will
go to so-called investments in government-selected civilian
technologies. This is predicated on the notion that the government
knows better than the businesses already operating in the market which
civilian technologies will sell. Another $4 billion of Clinton's
program will go to government-sponsored retraining programs for
displaced defense workers. And $1 billion will provide federal
assistance to local communities hurt by defense cutbacks. Only one-
fourth of the funds, about $5 billion, will be spent on programs that
have potential military utility. These funds will go to developing
"dual-use" technologies, meaning those that have both military and
civilian applications.
<P>
Principle #3: The primary purpose of the defense conversion is to
     preserve defense production capabilities for the civilian
     economy. 
<P>
     In making his announcement at the Westinghouse facility, Clinton
extolled the facility's effort to increase civilian production from 16
percent of total output in 1986 to a projected level of 50 percent by
1995. He hopes to encourage this type of conversion around the
country. As the President said in his Westinghouse speech: "What you
have done here [at Westinghouse] is what I wish to do nationally --
take the most talented people in the world who've produced some of the
most sophisticated military technology and put that to work in the
civilian economy."
<P>
Principle #4: The impact of defense conversion on national security
     will be marginal. 
<P>
     Clinton says: "With the dwindling Soviet threat, we can cut
defense spending over a third by 1997." The President clearly believes
that these levels of defense cuts can be made without weakening
national security. By the same token, Secretary of Defense Les Aspin
argues that poor economic performance -- supposedly caused partly by
too much defense spending -- is itself a national security threat.
"The danger here," says Aspin, "is the failure to see our national
security interests in a way that includes our economic success.
Economic well-being is vital to our security." Seen in this way,
spending on domestic programs can be said to have some bearing on
national security.
<P>
CLINTON'S DEFENSE DRAWDOWN IN PERSPECTIVE
<P>
     The defense budget began declining well before the end of the
Persian Gulf War and the election of Bill Clinton. In fact, defense
budget authority in real terms peaked in fiscal 1985, well before the
end of the Cold War. This downturn in defense spending has been
gradual. But critics of the armed forces, including President Clinton,
argue that the American economy is suffering from massive dislocations
because of a rapid "demilitarization" of the economy. While some
communities are suffering severe economic problems as a result of the
defense drawdown, the economy as a whole has not been greatly damaged
as a result of the defense cuts. This is because defense is not a
large segment of the economy and because defense expenditures impose
only a modest burden on the economy.
<P>
     President Clinton, though, is trapped by his belief that he
inherited what he terms a "defense economy." He is wrong. The money
the government will actually spend on defense in 1993 -- so-called
outlays -- will constitute only 4.7 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP). Clinton's budget will reduce that burden to around 3 percent by
1998. By focusing on the marginal improvements to the economy that may
be obtained by "making a transition to a civilian economy," Clinton
ignores the impact of his decision on the U.S. military posture. While
the Clinton defense reductions affect only 1.7 percent of GDP over a
five-year period, they will result in a defense budget reduction of 18
percent and reductions of perhaps 50 percent by 1998 in the amount the
Pentagon spends on weapons and equipment. (The Clinton Administration
has not released defense procurement budget figures for the years
beyond fiscal 1994.) When coupled with budget reductions already
imposed under Ronald Reagan and George Bush, the defense spending
trend under Clinton is even more disturbing. After accounting for
inflation, the fiscal 1993 procurement budget is only 43 percent of
what it was at its peak in 1985. (Department of Defense, National
Defense Budget Estimates for FY 1994 (Washington, D.C.:  Department of
Defense, 1993), p.  80.)
<P>

The Defense Drawdown After World War II 
<P>
     During World War II, the nation truly had a defense economy. In
the war's last year, 1945, over 39 percent of the nation's GDP was
devoted to defense. By 1948, less than 4 percent of GDP was spent on
defense. (Ibid., p.  140.) Defense spending in 1945 was $714 billion
in 1987 dollars; by 1948, it was under $65 billion. Thus, in only
three years, defense spending had fallen by 90 percent. (Ibid., p. 
128.)
<P>
     By contrast, defense accounted for just 6.5 percent of GDP in
1986. Today it is 4.7 percent. (Ibid., p.  141.) Current projections
are that around 3 percent of GDP will go for defense in 1998.
(Department of Defense, National Defense Budget Estimates for FY 1994
(Washington, D.C.:  Department of Defense, 1993), p.  141; and
Department of Defense, "FY 1994 Defense Budget Begins New Era," News
Release No.  126-93, March 27, 1993.) Defense spending peaked in 1989
at $285.9 billion (in 1987 dollars), and under the Clinton budget will
fall to about $185 billion (also in 1987 dollars) in 1998. (The figure
for 1989 was obtained from Department of Defense, National Defense
Budget Estimates for FY 1994 (Washington, D.C.:  Department of
Defense, 1993), p.  129.  The 1998 figure was calculated by taking the
1998 outlay figure for defense provided by the Department of Defense
and deflating it according to the Department's own deflators.) Thus,
the government will spend 35 percent less in 1998 than in 1989.
Compared with the post-World War II drawdown, the current decline in
the defense budget will result in nowhere near the level of the
economic dislocations seen the late 1940s.
<P>

The Impact on the Armed Forces
<P>
     The true measure of whether a defense policy protects national
security adequately is not how much is spent on defense, but rather
whether the armed forces will have the means to fight and win when
conflict arises. From this perspective, Clinton's approach is
alarming. The Bush Administration by February 1992 had already
recommended terminating over 100 weapons programs in fiscal years 1991
and 1992. For fiscal 1993, it identified another seventeen programs
for termination. (Department of Defense, "Complete Set of Briefing
Charts on the FY 1993 Budget," 1992.) While it is impossible to
quantify precisely the combat value that has been lost by ending these
programs, the Navy faces the likelihood of not having an all-weather
attack aircraft to replace the aging A-6 Intruder. The Clinton
Administration has not yet announced a complete hit list of programs
beyond those announced by the Bush Administration, but it will include
the A/F-X fighter, the Multi-Role Fighter (MRF) aircraft and the F-16
Falcon fighter. (Secretary of Defense Aspin announced these program
terminations when he announced the findings of the "Bottom-Up Review"
on September 1, 1993, at the Pentagon.)
<P>

The Macroeconomic Impact 
<P>
     What will be the impact of Clinton's defense cuts on the economy
as a whole? What will be the effect on economic growth and employment?
The short answer to these questions is very little.
<P>
     On the spending side, government social spending is a far greater
burden than defense spending. Social and economic spending has jumped
in recent years and is likely to continue to explode. Federal social
and economic spending in fiscal 1993 will amount to $945.8 billion
(current dollars) and absorb over 15 percent of GDP (see Chart 2 on
following page). (Department of Defense, National Defense Budget
Estimates for FY 1994 (Washington, D.C.:  Department of Defense,
1993), p.  127.) By these standards, the most important conversion
problem the Clinton Administration faces is not from a defense economy
to a civilian economy, but from a public-sector welfare economy to one
based on private-sector production.
<P>
     Reductions in defense-sector jobs are likely to be offset by
growth in those in the civilian economy. A study by the Defense Budget
Project estimates that the defense drawdown could eliminate as many as
1.791 million defense sector jobs, both private and public, during the
period from fiscal 1992 through fiscal 1998. (Richard A.  Bitzinger
and Steven Kosiak, Potential Impact of Defense Spending Reductions on
the Defense Related Labor Force By State (Washington, D.C.:  Defense
Budget Project, 1993), p.  3.) This higher estimate constitutes about
1.5 percent of all the jobs in the U.S. as of 1992. But since some of
this job loss will result from retirement and normal attrition, other
sectors of the economy will not have to absorb all these positions to
avoid higher unemployment throughout the entire economy.
<P>
     In terms of growth, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated
that defense cuts smaller than those envisioned by Clinton could
encourage growth after the turn of the decade. As a result, by 2002
the annual gross national product (GNP) could be only 0.6 percent
higher than it otherwise might be. (Congressional Budget Office, "The
Economic Effects of Reduced Defense Spending," February 1992, pp. 
13-14.) 
<P>
     The upshot is clear: Clinton is wrong to assert that defense is
an unacceptable burden on the U.S. economy. His defense conversion
program thus becomes little more than a thinly veiled attempt to craft
a government industrial policy. 

<P>
The Impact on the Military Industrial Economy 
<P>
     While the curtailment of defense spending will have only a
marginal impact on the economy as a whole, its impact on the defense
industrial sector will be severe. In addition to the procurement cuts,
Clinton plans to lower the research and development account to $38.6
billion in 1994 (1994 dollars) from a 1985 high of $41.5 billion (also
1994 dollars). (Ibid.) In all, procurement and research and
development under the 1994 Clinton budget will be only 45 percent in
real terms of what it was in 1985 (see Chart 3).
<P>
     As a result of these cuts, U.S. defense industries could lose as
many as 1.052 million people in the period 1992 through 1998 because
of the drawdown. (Richard A.  Bitzinger and Steven Kosiak, Potential
Impact of Defense Spending Reductions on the Defense Related Labor
Force By State (Washington, D.C.:  Defense Budget Project, 1993), p. 
3.) In 1992, these industries employed 2.761 million people. (Ibid.)
Thus, employment in defense industries could fall by as much as 48
percent during this period.

<P>
PRESERVING AMERICA'S MILITARY INDUSTRIAL BASE
<P>
     Maintaining America's military strength requires a strong
military industrial base that can produce a sufficient number of
modern weapons to sustain the U.S. armed forces during combat. The
Clinton Administration risks undermining the industrial base through
defense budget reductions that not only are too deep, but too focused
on decreasing the procurement budget for the purchase of weapons and
equipment. America's soldiers, sailors, and airmen will pay a steep
price in future conflicts as result of this policy. A more sensible
policy would be to:
<P>
Concentrate long-range defense planning above all on the industrial
needs of the armed forces and not on converting the defense industrial
base to civilian production. 
<P>
     The best measure of whether the nation is managing its military
industrial base appropriately is whether its armed forces receive the
latest in technology. Reagan's emphasis on the technological
modernization of the armed forces led directly to the quick victory
and low casualties in the Persian Gulf War.
<P>
     The Clinton Administration should focus on producing weapons that
are now in research and development and represent the next generation
of weapons capability. Some of these are the CVN-76 aircraft carrier,
the V-22 Osprey transport aircraft, the F-22 advanced tactical
fighter, the Light-weight Exoatmospheric Projectile (LEAP) anti-
missile interceptor, the Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)
missile system, the Brilliant Eyes sensor satellite, and the dual-use
Single-Stage Rocket Technology (SSRT) space launch system. These
cutting-edge systems may provide the margin of victory needed in
America's next war. Redirecting the funding in this way will help fund
a new generation of weapons to be put in the hands of America's
soldiers, sailors, and airmen, while at the same time maintaining the
military industrial base. 
<P>
Eliminate the $20 billion defense conversion program. 
<P>
     The Clinton defense conversion program offers $20 billion in
financial incentives to individuals, businesses, and local governments
that are adversely affected by defense budget reductions. This
approach will cause inestimable damage to the defense sector of the
economy by encouraging defense firms to abandon defense production.
<P>
     This $20 billion can be put to better use. It can be recycled
into the procurement account of the defense budget to build new
weapons and equipment, thereby improving the combat capability of the
U.S. armed forces.
<P>
     Even on its own terms, the Clinton defense conversion program is
likely to be a failure. Its central goal is to induce defense
contractors to diversify into non-defense fields. But many defense
companies are already diversified. Further diversification is not
always the best solution for defense companies seeking to adjust to a
reduced defense market. Some defense companies are not well positioned
to penetrate an already saturated consumer market. Others have
invested heavily in products that are unique to defense, and if forced
from the defense business, will lose their investments. Defense
companies should seek solutions that best suit their needs. The
government has no way of knowing what these needs are.
<P>
Focus defense planning on the building and buying of the next
generation of weapons. 
<P>
     Implicit in Clinton's defense plan is the assumption that a high
technology force can be maintained through research and development
alone, without actually buying the weapons systems. This is deceptive,
for three reasons:
<P>
1) Not all advances in weapons technology are derived from research
     and development. Many breakthroughs are realized through the
     production and deployment cycles, particularly those related to
     efficient and reliable production. For example, fighter aircraft
     produced at the end of a production run are frequently more
     reliable and cheaper because of what has been learned by the
     manufacturer in the course of production.
<P>
2) Weapons systems that are in the development stage cannot be used
     effectively in combat. For example, a prototype tank may
     represent the cutting edge in armored technology, but it is of
     little use if not enough have been produced for use in combat and
     if it has not been available to troops for training.
<P>
3) A policy that emphasizes research and development at the expense of
     procurement will undermine production capabilities and the
     industrial base. The sustained production capability needed to
     turn out large numbers of a weapons system cannot be maintained
     if the Pentagon has only prototype models. For example, the C-17
     transport aircraft prototype cost over $1 billion to produce. The
     production models will cost about $300 million each, depending on
     the number purchased. Given the unpredictable nature of regional
     crises, which will be the primary concern of the U.S. military in
     the future, weapons that are not already in production cannot be
     manufactured in large enough numbers to support large combat
     operations. 
<P>
     Furthermore, sharp cuts in procurement funding will adversely
affect the production of existing weapons systems. For example, tight
budgets raise the question of whether to upgrade existing weapons,
such as the F-14 Tomcat fighter aircraft, or to build new systems,
such as the AFX aircraft now in development. Moreover, budget
pressures are forcing decisions to curtail the procurement of existing
weapons systems. The Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and the F-16
Falcon fighter jet are two such systems. But ending production
prematurely may result in a gap in military capabilities as older
systems are retired before the new systems are ready. Besides, once a
decision is made to stop the production of a weapon, the capability to
produce it quickly atrophies. Production line employees are laid off,
the tooling is discarded, and managers are assigned to new tasks.
<P>
     The most disturbing problem associated with sharp reductions in
procurement funding, however, is that it may force the Pentagon to
cancel new weapons programs altogether. The Clinton Administration has
not yet announced a complete list of the new programs it plans to
terminate. The casualty list is likely to be long and is certain to
include the A/F-X aircraft and the Multi-Role Fighter (MRF) aircraft
now in development. As assaults on the procurement budget force
decisions to withhold the production of new weapons, the industrial
base is weakened. The effort to maintain a modern military is likewise
weakened. This is why money restored to the defense budget from
defense conversion should be targeted to the procurement account.
<P>
Give governmental support to specific defense industries only as a
last resort.
<P>
     Even if all of the $20 billion Clinton has earmarked for defense
conversion is returned to military modernization programs, some vital
defense sectors -- nuclear shipbuilding, for example -- may be in
danger of disappearing. This result is predictable for areas where the
perceived threat is limited for the near term. But because the near-
term threat is diminished, it does not mean that the military
capability to counter that threat will never again be needed. For
example, the primary mission for Navy attack submarines during the
Cold War was defending against Soviet submarines armed with submarine-
launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). That mission is less important
today. However, as hostile Third World countries capable of
challenging vital American interests obtain their own submarines, the
U.S. will have to retain a submarine force to deal with this new
threat. For example, Iran has taken delivery of two submarines from
Russia and could challenge U.S. access to Middle East oil. Given poor
planning and reduced defense budgets, however, there may be no nuclear
submarine manufacturers in business when the Navy needs to replace its
aging fleet of attack submarines.
<P>
     Thus the Navy should continue building a third Seawolf submarine,
even though there is little near-term military justification for doing
so. The reason: to keep the shipbuilding capability intact until the
Navy is ready to build its new submarine Centurion. 

<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
     The nation's military industrial base does not exist to bolster
the nation's economy. Nor does it exist to expand employment
opportunities. Its purpose is to provide the U.S. with the world's
strongest, most well-armed military. 
<P>
     President Clinton should remember these truths when formulating
his defense plans. Clinton's defense conversion plan will decimate the
defense industrial base of this country. A strong military industrial
base is built carefully over a long period of time. While it can be
dismantled quickly, it is not easily rebuilt. Ultimately, the price
will be paid when President Clinton, or more likely a future
President, is required to order the American military into battle
without the most modern technology or without an adequate number of
weapons and equipment. The nation learned a grim lesson when it
disarmed too quickly after World Wars I and II. American forces thus
were unprepared for World War II and the Korean War and as a result,
many American lives were needlessly lost. 
<P>
     This is a lesson that Clinton should remember not only the next
time he visits Arlington Cemetery, but the next time he makes a
decision affecting the industrial base of this country.

America's Unfair Trade Practice," July 21, 1992.)<P>

     To implement the new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT) agreement, which was signed on April 15 by the United States
and 124 other governments in Marrakech, Morocco, Congress will need to
make a number of changes in current U.S. trade law. This will be done
in the form of a "fast track" bill. (The provision for "fast track"
consideration of the GATT Uruguay Round implementing legislation is
found in P.L. 103-49, July 2, 1993. ) Such a bill essentially is
negotiated between congressional leaders and the White House, and it
will be put to Congress for an up-or-down vote without amendment.
<P>
     Unfortunately it now seems likely that Congress will be asked to
include measures to "strengthen" the U.S. antidumping law in the bill.
(See Committee on Ways and Means, "Draft Legislative Language for the
Administration's Implementing Proposals on the Uruguay Round
Antidumping Agreement and Corresponding Provisions in the Subsidies
Agreement," July 12, 1994. For a summary of current U.S. antidumping
law, see Committee on Ways and Means, Overview and Compilation of U.S.
Trade Statutes (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office,
1993), pp. 62-71. See also, "Administration AD/CVD Proposals," Inside
U.S. Trade, Special Report, June 21, 1994, pp. S2-S22, and "Summary of
AD/CVD Proposals," Inside U.S. Trade, Special Report, June 17, 1994,
pp. S2-S8.  Lobbying to influence the antidumping sections of the GATT
implementing legislation is reported in Robert Keatley, "More
Protectionism May Be the Result As Congress Studies Dumping Laws," The
Wall Street Journal, July 1, 1994, p. A10; "Dumping on Importers," The
Journal of Commerce, June 30, 1994, p. 10A; and Helene Cooper,
"Corporate America Finds Devil Is in the Details As Its Lobbyists
Press Congress to Change GATT," The Wall Street Journal, June 27,
1994, p. A14.) But if enacted, the antidumping provisions actually
would result in increased trade barriers worldwide and undermine the
intent of the new GATT agreement. By including these provisions, the
White House and protectionists in Congress seem determined to go
against the sound observation of the President's Council of Economic
Advisers, which reported earlier this year that "Both in the United
States and elsewhere, antidumping laws go beyond preventing
anticompetitive practices -- which should be their rationale -- and
often have the effect of protecting domestic industries from foreign
competition." (Council of Economic Advisers, Economic Report of the
President, February 1994, p. 239. Emphasis in original.)
<P>
     The U.S. antidumping law has become the primary legal tool
invoked by domestic industries supposedly to protect themselves from
unfair trade by imports, but in reality to shield themselves from
competition. Dumping is the practice of selling goods in one market at
a price below that charged in another market. The notion of a "fair
value" is usually associated with the higher price by industries
competing against the lower price, and the antidumping laws are used
to impose a tariff on the "unfair value" of the lower-priced goods.
Seasonal department store clearance sales and promotional price
cutting are normal business practices in domestic commerce, and may
lead to prices that are lower than "costs" figured in certain ways.
But under the antidumping laws, the same price and cost structure used
by an exporter to the United States could be considered a violation of
U.S. law.
<P>
     Around the world, this kind of protectionism has been growing as
tariffs and other non-tariff barriers have come down. Indeed, more
dumping cases have been filed annually against U.S. exporters around
the world in recent years than against any other country. (In the
period 1988-1992, 166 cases were filed against the United States,
compared to 98 against Japan, 75 against Korea, 69 against Brazil, and
13 against Canada. A total of 1,196 were filed worldwide. U.S.
International Trade Commission, The Year in Trade: Operation of the
Trade Agreements Program, Reports 40-44 (1988-1992).) The U.S. economy
produces the world's largest volume of exports, and therefore is the
most vulnerable to the abuse of antidumping laws. Instead of
benefiting the U.S. economy, "strengthening" the antidumping laws in
this country would not only raise costs for American consumers, but
also likely would trigger more antidumping cases against U.S.
exporters worldwide, through similar antidumping rules adopted by
other governments in future years.
<P>
     The new GATT Antidumping Agreement (Office of U.S. Trade
Representative, Final Act Embodying the Results of the Uruguay Round
of Multilateral Trade Negotiations [cited hereafter as MTN/FA]
(Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1994), II-A1A-8.)
was drafted in the spirit of fair and open trade, but individual
governments still will determine what they regard as the unfair
pricing of imports. The new agreement cannot eliminate the bias in
favor of domestic industries in every country, but the new rules are
intended to improve the transparency and fairness of national
antidumping laws. The GATT agreement requires governments to follow
certain rules in determining when dumping cases may legitimately be
filed by domestic producers, and specifies some procedures that must
be followed in calculating whether goods are being sold "at less than
fair value." A primary goal in the Antidumping Agreement is for
governments to make their antidumping laws compare real market
conditions in a producer's home country and its export markets, and
not to bias the process of finding whether dumping has occurred by
resorting to unrealistic accounting rules. Countries also are supposed
to reexamine antidumping orders at least every five years and revoke
those that are no longer valid. This provision of the Uruguay Round
agreement has been criticized by some as "weakening" the U.S. trade
laws.
<P>
     When an antidumping case in the United States is decided against
an accused importer, the Commerce Department imposes a tariff on the
imported product, in effect raising its price to a "non-dumping"
level. The amount of the tariff is calculated by using accounting
procedures spelled out in the antidumping law. Advocates of
"strengthening" the law in Congress and the Administration would amend
the technical accounting procedures in ways that would help domestic
producers more easily win antidumping cases. But if that happens,
other countries will toughen their antidumping rules as well. The
result: a general increase in tariffs by means of case-by-case
litigation, as industries in the United States and around the world
file charges against each other alleging "less than fair value"
pricing. This would perversely close markets to competition rather
than opening them.
<P>

Comparing Foreign and Domestic Prices
<P>
     One of the most serious problems under current U.S. antidumping
law is the Commerce Department's method of comparing an importer's
prices charged in the United States with prices in its home country.
An average home-market price is computed by obtaining sales data. The
average price is then compared with individual sales transactions (not
the average) in the United States. Any U.S. sales that are above the
average home-market value are disregarded. (The comparison of "price"
to "value" is not a simple exercise because the calculations are not
simple. Note that "value" is based on the producer's cost-accounting
data according to statutory rules, and it is thus the second major
area where arbitrary, unfair results can be mandated by law or
administratively imposed by a government favoring a domestic industry.
Cost accounting depends far more on judgmental factors than accounting
for financial reports because of different ways a producer's general
fixed costs might be allocated to individual products.) But if any
U.S. sales are found to be below the average home-market value, the
Department concludes the imported product has been dumped, and a
"dumping margin" is calculated on the basis of the price differences
between the two countries.
<P>
     The Uruguay Round Antidumping Agreement requires that this unfair
method be changed to use average transaction prices in both markets
(an "apples to apples" comparison). (MTN/FA, II-A1A-8, 2.4.2, pp.
3-4.) The proposed legislation, however, specifically creates a
loophole to evade this requirement. Parties to an antidumping case may
request an annual review of a dumping order and the new GATT
requirement for comparing average prices would not apply to an annual
review. This deliberate omission would permit the Commerce Department
to conclude there has been a significant increase in a product's
dumping margin after such a case review, through an "apples to
oranges" comparison based on individual below-average transaction
prices only.
<P>

Dumping When the Importer and Exporter are Related
<P>
     Increasingly in international trade, companies produce components
of products in one country and bring them to a second country for
further work or modification before sale. Cost accountants and
economists employed by a company use various methods to allocate
indirect selling costs, including such things as advertising and
promotion costs, and to set the selling price depending on how
managers view market conditions.
<P>
     The new GATT agreement does not require any change in current
U.S. law in this area. But the Administration has proposed to change
the current practice, which is complicated enough but in general tries
to determine the price at the factory gate. The proposal is to
determine the price to the first unrelated purchaser in both the U.S.
market and the exporter's home market. This change would give the
Commerce Department more power to disregard the way international
companies allocate their indirect costs. (Ways and Means Draft
Legislative Language, op. cit., pp. 96-100.) But there is also a
strong lobbying effort by domestic producers who compete in the U.S.
market with foreign companies that built factories here in the 1980s
on behalf of a different method, which would require the Commerce
Department to treat indirect costs in a specific way that would bias
the comparisons in favor of alleged dumping. (The so-called Exporter
Sales Price (ESP) methodology as described in the Administration's
memorandum: "This is perhaps the most technical and obtuse issue in
implementing the AD agreement. Unfortunately it is also one of the
most important." Inside U.S Trade, June 17, 1994, p. S3. ) 
<P>
     The 1980s saw a significant increase in direct foreign investment
in the United States, which created millions of jobs, but both
foreign-owned and domestic companies that import component parts from
foreign affiliates are vulnerable to the abuse of antidumping laws.
Competitors could accuse internationally diversified companies of
dumping and win cases that would require the government to impose
punitive tariffs. Even the threat of such litigation would jeopardize
future foreign investment in the United States and the benefits of
competition and lower prices, which would not only affect U.S.
consumers but also thousands of U.S. companies that depend on
international suppliers to produce their own goods and services for
export.
<P>
     More careful economic study should be done before Congress
changes the rules in these cases. It is unclear how the
Administration's proposal would work, and any change in the U.S.
antidumping law in this area would be a minefield, with consequences
that may increase protectionism. The United States economy depends
critically on the free movement of investment, both to enable foreign
companies to establish factories here and for U.S. companies to
diversify abroad. The Administration's proposal would give the
Commerce Department sweeping powers to determine the way business must
allocate costs. The investment decisions of business worldwide could
be affected, after the fact, by arbitrary bureaucratic decisions in
antidumping cases. It might no longer be prudent for many companies to
invest in the United States.
<P>
Antidumping Duty as a Cost
<P>
     Another proposed change that would also strongly bias the U.S.
antidumping laws against imports, in cases where the foreign exporter
and domestic importer are related, involves the accounting treatment
of money deposited with the U.S. Treasury. The proposal would
effectively double the tariffs in these related-party cases. Under
current U.S. law, dumping duties are calculated retrospectively, but
importers accused of dumping have to deposit their potential dumping
duties with the U.S. Treasury until a review determines the actual
amount, if any, of the tariff. Later, when a subsequent review of the
dumping charge is made, the deposit is used to pay the duty or
refunded.
<P>
     Under the proposal, during the period the Treasury is holding an
importer's deposit, the Commerce Department would calculate the
imported product's price in the United States (which determines if
"dumping" has occurred) by subtracting the deposited amount from any
actual sales prices, treating it as a cost rather than a financial
asset. Thus the only way an importer could avoid being found guilty of
dumping -- and being stuck for the duty twice -- would be to increase
its U.S. price by twice the amount of the duty to avoid any risks,
which would mean no price competition at all. The issue is further
biased against importers by the Administration's proposal specifically
not to follow the new GATT requirement to use average market prices
during the review period, as discussed above.
<P>
     This measure was not contained in the Administration's published
draft proposal, but Congress is likely to insist it be in the
implementing legislation put before lawmakers because it resembles a
practice in the European Union and Canada, which do not use a
retrospective system to calculate dumping. Under the system used by
other countries, dumping duties are paid in advance and not later
modified by a review of the case.
<P>

Captive Production
<P>
     The International Trade Commission (ITC) decided a case last year
involving flat steel products, including steel at different stages of
manufacturing. At each stage as a product is processed, it can be sold
to customers or used by the same firm for further processing. The
steel industry petitioners failed to obtain the dumping protection
they sought last year because, as the ITC analyzed the facts of the
case, the test of harm to the domestic industry was deemed not to have
been met. But if steel that was further processed by the same firm had
been artificially excluded from the total amount of domestic
production, the test might have been met.
<P>
     A proposed alteration to the Administration's draft legislation
by some in Congress is to mandate the methodology the ITC must use in
these cases, so that domestic production of intermediate products
consumed within the same company to make another product cannot be
counted. As a result, the ITC would be stripped of its current
discretion to exclude such production, or not, in its analysis if it
is appropriate given the facts of each case. The Administration did
not include this very parochial proposal sought by lobbyists for the
steel industry in its recommendations. It is contrary to the
traditional requirements of international law in determining injury,
and contrary to the Uruguay Round agreement. (MTN/FA, II-A1A-8, 4.1,
p. 6 and 3.4, p. 5.) The ITC is not an agency so biased against U.S.
domestic producers that its analysis of the facts of each industry's
conditions of competition needs to be dictated by Congress.

<P>
Compensation for Petitioners
<P>
     Under current law, antidumping duties are general revenue to the
Treasury. Two proposals in Congress (H.R. 4206 sponsored by
Representatives Ralph Regula (R-OH) and Norman Mineta (D-CA), and H.R.
4716 sponsored by Representative Nancy Johnson (R-CT).) would provide
for the payment of dumping duties into a special fund that would then
be used to compensate companies supporting an antidumping petition for
various alleged injuries. Aside from providing a subsidy to domestic
industry petitioners, which could be illegal under the GATT rules,
payments to any company that supported a petition for dumping relief
would amount to a private right of action, and a lucrative source of
new income for trade lawyers. In addition, the proposal would provide
a powerful incentive to domestic industries to harass importers by
bringing petitions, increasing the probability that American consumers
would ultimately have to pay higher prices for a wide range of
products as a result of higher tariffs.
<P>

Conclusion
<P>
     There is a confusion between the advocacy of antidumping measures
to promote trade on equal terms and the actual use of these laws as a
smokescreen for protectionism. A prominent critic of antidumping is J.
Michael Finger, Lead Economist for Trade Policy at the World Bank. In
his recent book, Antidumping, How it Works and Who Gets Hurt, Finger
concludes:
<P>
    <UL> Antidumping, as practiced today, is a witches brew of the
     worst of policy-making: power politics, bad economics, and
     shameful public administration. Antidumping law is an
     oxymoron. Expansion of the power of the state to act against
     imports in the name of antidumping has been built on the
     meanest of violations against the principles of rule of law.
     Antidumping is a particularly insidious threat in that it
     appears to bring systemic justification to the trade
     restrictions it creates: it is as if the GATT system were
     programmed to destroy itself. (Ann Arbor: University of
     Michigan Press, 1993, p. 57. Emphasis in the original.)</UL>
<P>
     Since a fast track bill is being put together by congressional
leaders and the White House, it may already be too late to have a full
and open debate about the way in which the United States should comply
with the new GATT Antidumping Agreement in the Uruguay Round
implementation legislation. But before they try to "improve" on the
GATT agreement by modifying the antidumping laws, lawmakers should
carefully investigate the costs and purported benefits of the U.S.
antidumping laws. Because amendments are not permitted, the fast track
legislative process tends to invite back room negotiations between the
Administration and advocates of particular trade law changes that have
no general economic benefits, because the White House and
congressional leaders want to assure wide support for the bill when it
is finally introduced in Congress. Some of the proposals discussed
above could have extremely serious economic consequences on the U.S.
economy, and the "back room" nature of negotiations have given
protectionists a rare opportunity to insist on measures to gain their
support.
<P>
     Supporters of the Uruguay Round of GATT and its objectives of
more open world trade should insist that the fast track implementing
legislation be narrowly drafted to make only those changes in U.S. law
necessary to adopt its specific provisions. The antidumping laws are,
after all, U.S. domestic statutes that Congress could debate and amend
in the future in a more open manner, without the constraint of the
fast track process. That debate is needed. Hopefully, the more the
American people learn about how "antidumping" laws are used to raise
prices to some U.S. companies for the profit of others, to violate the
spirit of GATT rules, and to reduce American competitiveness, the more
likely will be the eventual repeal of the largely protectionist
antidumping rules.

<h2>THE U.N. AT FIFTY: NO KEY TO PEACE</h2><br>
By <br>Thomas P. Sheehy<br>
Jay Kingham Fellow in International Regulatory Affairs<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum #419<br>
June 9, 1995<br>

<hr size="3" width="50%"><br></center>


	President Bill Clinton will be in San Francisco on June 26 to participate in the 50th anniversary celebration of the signing of the United Nations Charter. It was in June of 1945 that war-weary America took the lead in founding the U.N., harboring high hopes that it would become a major force in advancing world peace. But the U.N. has failed to live up to these expectations. After 50 years it has become clear that the U.N. is only a marginal player in establishing international peace.<p>

	President Clinton apparently believes otherwise. In his recent New Hampshire discussion with House Speaker Newt Gingrich, President Clinton suggested that the U.N. had been instrumental in keeping the peace during the Cold War. The President soon after corrected himself by noting "that the United Nations didn't keep all the peace in the last 50 years." <p>

	While in San Francisco the President should be careful not to exaggerate the U.N.'s importance. The U.N. has been, and will continue to be, of only marginal relevance to international peace and security. Suggesting otherwise only sets the stage for future policy debacles involving the U.S. military. The President also should resist committing U.S. support to anything other than traditional U.N. peacekeeping operations, such as in Cyprus, where peacekeepers act as buffers between parties who have ceased hostilities.<p>

	Flawed Premise. U.N. peacekeeping turns disastrous when it takes the form of "peacemaking."  Many factors have contributed to U.N. peacekeeping failures in Somalia, Bosnia, and elsewhere, including poor U.N. organization and inevitable disagreements over objectives among nations contributing troops. These shortcomings have led many to suggest such reforms as upgrading U.N. peacekeeping facilities in New York and establishing a standing U.N. army. The problem with peacemaking, however, is more fundamental.<p>

	When trying to deter one or more combatants from achieving their goals through the force of arms, the essence of "peacemaking," U.N. forces quickly become just another group of combatants. In Bosnia, for example, U.N. peacekeepers essentially are warring with the Bosnian Serbs. U.N. forces playing this role are unlikely to succeed in coercing combatants into peace. The constrained mandates which the U.N. typically issues, moreover, do not allow for the complete destruction of the military capabilities of combatants, which often is a prerequisite to political settlements.<p>

	More important, the countries providing peacekeepers have considerably less interest in the conflicts than do the forces their troops are fighting. As casualties are incurred, pressure mounts to bring the troops home. The Bosnian Serbs understand this very well. The result is often a half-hearted and ultimately futile operation that suffers casualties in vain, as the U.S. did in Somalia.<p>

	When major states, particularly the U.S., are unwilling to suffer casualties in conflicts of little direct interest to them, they often are derided for a lack of "leadership."  Many critics of Washington's policy on Bosnia have suggested that the U.S. is shirking its international responsibility as a leader by shying away from the inevitable casualties that would result from forcefully intervening in that centuries-old conflict. Some commentators even have suggested that the U.S. hesitancy to intervene in Bosnia and elsewhere, including Somalia before President Bush committed troops there, is immoral. The "immoral" policy, however, is to suffer casualties in a conflict with no bearing to American national security and soon after to abandon the U.S. commitment, as was done in Somalia. <p>

	Calculations of the national interest undermine the notion of global collective security upon which the entire U.N. approach to security is based. The fact is that nations never have, nor will they ever, consider a threat to peace anywhere as a threat to peace everywhere. Members of the League of Nations were unwilling to defend Ethiopia against Italian aggression in 1935; the Europeans and Americans are unwilling to mount a vigorous defense of Bosnia today.<p>

	U.N. Way or No Way? Recognizing global collective security as a myth is not tantamount to saying that no collective action is possible or even necessary. Collective action on a regional basis, such as in NATO and during the Persian Gulf War, whether or not it is sanctioned by the U.N., undoubtedly is the best way to maintain international peace and stability. <p>

	It is a red herring to suggest, as the Clinton Administration does, that without the U.N. the U.S. will be forced "to act alone or not at all."  This represents an odd reading of history. The U.S. has acted in concert with allies in most of its international conflicts. NATO, perhaps the most successful security pact in history, is a multilateral, not international, organization. The real fear of many who raise the "all or nothing" canard is not for American security, but for the prestige of the U.N., which suffers considerably without active American participation.<p>

	The Next 50 Years. Some analysts and politicians argue that the U.S. should use the U.N. only to serve its interests. The archetype is President Bush's securing U.N. approval for the Persian Gulf War. Proponents of this modus operandi must recognize, however, that using the U.N. in this way establishes a precedent for future U.S. action. As a result, bypassing the Security Council has become more politically difficult. <p>

	This trend is particularly troubling because U.S. influence within the Security Council is likely to diminish. The Security Council may be expanded beyond its current five permanent and ten rotating members. Brazil, India, Nigeria, Japan, and Germany have been discussed as possible members to possess veto power. The Clinton Administration has expressed support for granting permanent Security Council seats to developing countries. Any Security Council expansion, of course, will diminish U.S. influence, making the achievement of approval for U.S. actions to defend its national interest more difficult, particularly as many of the states represented in the U.N. today share none of the values enshrined in the U.N. Charter.<p>

	It is wrong to blame the U.N. for foolish American policies. The U.N. cannot force America to act against its security interests. It did not drive President Bush to send U.S. troops to Somalia or order Washington's European allies into their Bosnia quagmire. U.N. influence is more subtle. It is exercised mainly through U.S. policymakers who want either to hide behind the U.N. to avoid action or, conversely, to use it to drag the U.S. into conflicts which it should otherwise avoid.<p>

	While in San Francisco, the President should remember an unassailable fact about international politics:  The U.N. does not transcend "mere" national interests. Rhetoric which belittles the American national interest, however indirectly, only encourages debacles like Somalia. The loss of 30 lives in that failed U.N. operation is a high price to pay for an empty dream.<p>

<TITLE>YET AGAIN, CHINA'S TRADE STATUS SHOULD BE RENEWED -- Heritage </TITLE>

<CENTER><H3><I>YET AGAIN, CHINA'S TRADE STATUS SHOULD BE RENEWED</I></H3>
<P>
By Andrew B. Brick<br>
Backgrounder Update #179<BR>
5/12/92<BR>
(published at 3 pages)<BR>
(Updating Asian Studies Center Backgrounder No. 104, "Washington's
Agonizing Decision: To Extend or Revoke China's Most-Favored-Nation
Status," May 8, 1990, and Backgrounder Update No. 160, "The Case For
Renewing China's Trade Status," May 9, 1991.)<P>
</CENTER><HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>

      The Washington-Beijing relationship is beset by problems. The
People's Republic of China's 1991 trade surplus with the United States
was $12.7 billion, up $2.3 billion from 1990, and could leap to $15
billion by the end of this year. This would make the U.S. deficit with
China greater than with any country except Japan. The trouble with the
mushrooming trade deficit with China is that there is a growing
feeling that it is caused in part by Beijing's refusal to open China's
markets fully to American goods. To make matters worse, the Chinese
apparently use some prison labor in manufacturing to lower the price
of exports. Then there is significant evidence that the Chinese are
peddling missiles and nuclear technology to Algeria, Pakistan, and
other Third World customers in defiance of multilateral efforts to ban
such sales. And Beijing has yet to make a full accounting of the fate
of pro-democracy demonstrators arrested after the 1989 Tiananmen
Square massacre.
<P>
      It is in this environment that George Bush will be challenged to
decide by June 3 whether to renew China's most-favored-nation (MFN)
trading status. Such status, granted to China in 1980 and approved
annually since then, gives Chinese goods exported to the U.S. the same
tariff treatment as that received by the 100-plus other nations to
which Washington accords MFN status, including Iraq and Syria and a
host of other unpleasant regimes.
<P>
      Equal Treatment. Although the expression "most-favored-nation"
suggests that a country is accorded special trading privileges, the
term actually means something quite different. A country that receives
MFN status merely is entitled to those trade benefits and concessions
granted by the U.S. to any other MFN country. MFN thus confers no
special trading status; it simply treats all MFN recipients equally. 
<P>
      Generally, MFN is a permanent status. The only exceptions are
communist countries which, under the Trade Act of 1974, either
annually or semi-annually must seek renewal. Specifically, Title 4 of
the Act, known as the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, named after the late
Senator Henry M. Jackson of Washington and former Representative
Charles A. Vanik of Ohio, both Democrats, states that MFN status can
be given to "non-market economies" if those countries permit
substantially free emigration of their citizens. The law works like
this: If the President wants to extend MFN status he must either
certify to Congress that the country under consideration is not in
violation of the Amendment's human rights criteria or he can waive the
criteria for the country involved on an annual basis because such a
move would "substantially promote the objectives" of Jackson-Vanik.
Once President Bush certifies that China over the past year has
allowed free emigration, Congress effectively has ninety days to
approve or disapprove China's MFN status. Their vote is then subject
to presidential veto.
<P>
      Separate Categories. America's problems with China thus fall
into two categories -- the economic and the political. Washington
should deal with them accordingly: Economic problems should be
addressed with economic mechanisms; political problems with political
ones. 
<P>
      If Beijing employs a complex system of tariff and non-tariff
controls on American goods entering the Chinese marketplace, such as
increasing the number of import licensing regulations and bans, then
China should be identified under the 1988 Omnibus Trade and
Competitiveness Act as a so-called "priority" country that has
established "systematic" barriers to U.S. exports. This law sets
procedures for dealing with unfair "priority" foreign trade practices
through trade retaliation. The Bush Administration, in fact, initiated
an investigation of Chinese market access barriers on October 10,
1991. 
<P>
      Conversely, the current political problems in the Sino-American
relationship should be addressed through political mechanisms. China's
continuing human rights abuses in Tibet, its likely use of some prison
labor to manufacture goods for export, and its sales of advanced
weapons to dangerous nations should elicit vigorous condemnation from
the highest levels of the U.S. government. The agenda during Secretary
of State James Baker's three-day Beijing visit last November was
crowded with such unpleasant items. Under Secretary of State for
Political Affairs, Arnold L. Kanter, arrived in Beijing last week to
press Chinese officials on human rights issues. 
<P>
      What is not warranted is mixing the economic and political
issues. China no more should be punished economically for its
unacceptable political actions than Japan should be exempted for
political reasons from economic punishment for its unacceptable
economic actions against American products.
<P>
      If Beijing violates the Jackson-Vanik amendment's freedom-of-
emigration provision, then China's MFN status should be revoked.
Otherwise, the issue should be subject to the same considerations by
which Washington has deemed it proper to extend MFN to some 180 other
nations.
<P>
      Other factors also argue against ending China's MFN status. To
do so would:
<P>
      <UL>Dramatically raise duties on Chinese exports to America and thus
      hike the prices that Americans pay for these goods. Products
      from China now account for one-third of the American toy market,
      10 percent of the American footwear market, and 15 percent of
      the American imported apparel market.
<P>
      Cost the export industries of South China up to two million
      jobs. It is this area in which the free market and pro-
      democratic forces are strongest. Ending MFN thus would penalize
      those Chinese whom American policy ostensibly seeks to help.
<P>
      Reduce China's access to hard currency, further squeezing
      Beijing's ability to service its $52.5 billion international
      debt.
<P>
      Close Chinese markets to American exporters. Last year, U.S.
      exports to China totaled $6.3 billion, an increase of 30.8
      percent in a single year. Among the biggest American losers
      would be wheat growers, whose 1990 sales approached $1 billion;
      commercial aircraft manufacturers, for whom China has become a
      dependable $500 million a year market; and phosphate fertilizer
      manufacturers, who consistently sell one-sixth of their entire
      annual output to China.
<P>
      Create enormous new problems for Hong Kong at a time when the
      colony can least afford anything that undermines confidence in
      its future. Some 70 percent of American imports from China are
      shipped through Hong Kong. As Hong Kong's largest foreign market
      and one of its principal investors, U.S. interests lie in a
      politically assured and economically healthy Hong Kong.
      Uncertain about their future, 60,000 Hong Kong citizens leave
      the territory each year. Denying China MFN status may well speed
      the exodus.
<P>
      Increase Beijing's dependence on arms sales for cash. Cutting
      off American markets to Chinese goods could force Beijing to
      rely even more greatly on the international weapons market for
      hard currency.</UL>
<P>
      Emotional Issues. Almost three years after the violence in
Beijing, Washington policy makers confront a recalcitrant,
unapologetic, and defiant China. A long and potent list of U.S.
grievances still increases. In such light, it is emotionally easy to
make a case for punishing Beijing. If so, then appropriate punishment
should be sought, and inflicted. Yet ending China's MFN status is not
appropriate. If it is, then Washington must review the domestic
political behavior of scores of other countries and prepare to revoke
their U.S. MFN status. To end MFN for mainland China, moreover, barely
will pinch Beijing's aging leaders who are the authors of the
repression. Instead, it will hurt reformers in China, consumers in
America, and deal a heavy blow to Hong Kong.
<P>
      Washington should recognize this. It should separate the
economic and political issues at stake. And then it should conclude
that there continue to be no grounds for revoking U.S. most-favored-
nation trade status for China.
<P>

<title>The Defense Budget for Defense: Why Nunn-Lugar Money Should Go to the B-2
 -- Heritage </title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><h3><i>THE DEFENSE BUDGET FOR DEFENSE:<br>
WHY NUNN-LUGAR MONEY SHOULD GO TO THE B-2</H3></i>
<P>

By Baker Spring<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Senior Policy Analyst<br>
Executive Memorandum No. 424<br>
August 1, 1995<br>
</center><hr size =3 width =30%>
<P>
    Common sense dictates that the money the government provides to the defense account should
be used to improve America's military capabilities. As with many other things in Washington,
however, common sense does not apply. The defense account is riddled with programs that are either
tangential or completely unrelated to improving America's military capabilities. One is the Nunn-Lugar program to fund the dismantling of weapons on the territory of the former Soviet Union.
<P>
    Later this week, the Senate is likely to begin considering the Defense Authorization Bill for
Fiscal Year 1996 (S. 1026). Included in the bill is an additional $365 million for the Nunn-Lugar
program in fiscal 1996. However, the same bill provides no money to preserve the option of buying
additional B-2 Spirit bombers. More of these bombers will be needed to address both conventional
and strategic threats. Why should the Senate spend money on questionable foreign programs while
depriving the military of even the option of buying more of the most capable bombers ever produced? 
<p>
    Nunn-Lugar is a foreign aid program. The Nunn-Lugar program has been useful in
signaling the new regimes in Russia and other former Soviet states that the United States does not
view them as enemies. Further, it has demonstrated that the U.S. is prepared to make material
assistance available in order to ease tensions.
<p>
    Nevertheless, there are several outstanding questions about the program's effectiveness. The
report to accompany the House version of the Department of Defense Authorization Bill states that
the Administration cannot confirm the proper use of assistance already provided to Russian and other
officials. In fact, the General Accounting Office (GAO) alleges that Nunn-Lugar money has been
used by individuals and institutions working to create new weapons of mass destruction. For example,
the U.S. has committed $46 million to the International Science and Technology Center in Moscow.
The center is designed to employ scientists and engineers, formerly working on weapons projects, in
peaceful pursuits. GAO determined that some of these scientists and engineers are continuing their
weapons-related activities, working for the center only part of the time. If this proves true, the money
will have been used to subsidize the salaries of those working to develop new weapons of mass
destruction. 
<p>
    Regardless of the merits of the Nunn-Lugar program, the question arises as to why it should
be funded out of the defense account. Nunn-Lugar is not a defense program; it is a foreign aid
program. The proper manager of foreign aid programs is the Department of State, not the Department
of Defense. Further, the proper pool of funds from which Nunn-Lugar should be financed is the
foreign aid account, not the defense account.
<p>
    The B-2, a major leap forward in capabilities. The Senate defense bill's funding of the
Nunn-Lugar program becomes even more questionable when the same bill denies funds to maintain
the option of buying more B-2 bombers. The B-2 is needed to fulfill both strategic nuclear and
conventional roles. Its conventional capabilities are particularly important. This sophisticated aircraft
will allow the U.S. to penetrate the airspace of a future regional aggressor, similar to Iraq in the
Persian Gulf War, and destroy the command and control centers such a country's leaders need to
direct their military forces.
<p>
    More B-2s also will be essential to maintain a balanced and capable bomber force. In its 1993
Bottom-Up Review and 1994 Nuclear Posture Review, the Clinton Administration claimed that it
needed up to 184 bombers to perform necessary missions. But this estimate is based on the
assumption that during conventional conflicts bombers can be swung from one combat theater, say in
East Asia, to another, such as the Persian Gulf. Many experts question the wisdom of this "swing
strategy."  In reality, there is no guarantee that the requirements for bomber operations in the first
theater will lessen as they become pressing in the second. Another mistaken assumption by the
Administration is that the B-52 bomber force will meet America's long-term bomber requirements.
The B-52s will be approaching 60 years of age by that time and will be far too old to provide an
effective combat capability, even in conventional conflicts.
<p>
    Finally, the B-2 will be needed to deter Russia's nuclear forces. The backbone of Russia's
future strategic arsenal will be the SS-25 Sickle intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), which is
deployed on mobile launchers. While not yet capable of doing so, an upgraded B-2 could be the only
strategic offensive weapon system able to hold the SS-25 at risk.
<p>
    The B-2 bomber is a major leap forward. It can penetrate the most advanced air defenses and
deliver precision-guided munitions against important military targets. It provides global reach and
reduces dramatically the number of men placed in harm's way compared with other aircraft for
similar missions. Given these capabilities, a decision to forgo even the option of buying more B-2
bombers is dangerously short-sighted.
<p>

<b>Modifying the Defense Authorization Bill</b>
<p>
Given the situation it now faces, the Senate needs to modify the Defense Authorization Bill to
preserve America's military capabilities. It could do so by:
<p><ul>
<li> Deleting Nunn-Lugar funds from the bill. The Nunn-Lugar program is a foreign aid program and
does not belong in the defense account, particularly because it robs money from critical defense
programs.

<li> Using the money saved from the Nunn-Lugar program to maintain the option of buying more
B-2 bombers. Eliminating Nunn-Lugar funding from the bill will make $365 million available to
support the B-2 procurement option. The B-2 program requires $553 million. The remaining $188
million can come from other provisions in the bill that have little or nothing to do with defense. These
include the land mine clearing assistance program ($20 million), support for the Atlanta Olympic
Games ($15 million), weather reconnaissance ($20 million), the Defense Business Management
University ($89 million), and counter-drug activities of the Department of Defense ($44 million).

<li> Reserving the option of restoring some or all of the funding for Nunn-Lugar during
consideration of foreign assistance legislation. A strong argument can be made for a well-run
assistance program to dismantle weapons of mass destruction on the territory of the former Soviet
Union. If the Senate considers a foreign assistance authorization bill later this year, this will provide
an ideal vehicle for extending authorization of the Nunn-Lugar program through the foreign assistance
account. But this funding should be provided only after it has been proven that abuses have not been
committed and that the program is functioning as intended.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
    The defense budget should not be used to fund programs that have little or nothing to do with
improving military capabilities, especially when vital defense programs like the B-2 bomber program
go underfunded. The Nunn-Lugar program to assist Russia and other states of the former Soviet
Union with the destruction of weapons is such a non-defense program. There may be a good
argument for continuing the Nunn-Lugar program, but it should be made during consideration of
foreign aid legislation. In the meantime, the dollars from the defense budget the Nunn-Lugar program
would have consumed should be used to preserve the option of procuring more B-2 bombers.

     Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama's January 11 visit
to Washington offers Bill Clinton a much-needed second chance to
devise a workable policy toward Japan. His first try was ill-conceived,
poorly executed, and ultimately unsuccessful. By badgering Japan to
agree to numerical trade targets, the Clinton Administration not only
has failed to resolve the longstanding trade dispute with Japan, but also
has missed a golden opportunity to work more closely with the
reformers who, like many in the U.S., want a more open Japanese
economy. The best way to resolve this trade dispute without harming
the valuable strategic relationship between the U.S. and Japan is for the
Clinton Administration to drop its managed trade policies toward Japan
and to form an alliance with Japanese who want broader economic
change.<P>
     Clinton's Japan Policy: A Rushed Political Job. The Clinton
Administration came to office committed to building a new U.S.-Japan
relationship. The Administration argued that the existing relationship
resembled an out-of-balance three-legged stool standing on security, politics,
and economics. The economic leg of this stool, Clinton contended, had to
be extended and strengthened to restore proper equilibrium to the
relationship. Originally conceived as but one element in a three-part
strategy, the trade and economic dimension nevertheless rapidly expanded
in terms of time and effort to become almost the entirety of the Clinton
Administration's approach to Japan. By focusing so much on trade, Clinton
did not restore balance to his three-legged stool; he created a new
imbalance, downplaying important political and security elements of the
U.S.-Japan relationship.<P>
     Clinton's new Japan policy culminated in something called the New
Economic Framework. Cobbled together in Tokyo in July 1993, it was a
rush job. The Framework negotiations were essentially short-term in nature,
geared to make good on the President's promise to produce results in
politically sensitive economic sectors such as autos, auto parts, and
computers. From the very beginning the negotiations over the New
Economic Framework were marked by a high degree of mutual suspicion
and distrust. In October 1994, under pressure of U.S. trade sanctions, the
Framework talks concluded with a last-minute, all-night effort which
produced minimum results. In effect, both governments called a time out in
the increasingly frustrating and contentious talks and agreed to kick the can
down the road.<P>
     U.S. Needs A New Approach. Progress on America's and Japan's
respective economic agendas is important if the two countries are to sustain
and build support for their strategically important relationship. The issue is
not whether Japan should become a more open, consumer-oriented society,
but whether the Clinton Administration's policies offer the best hope for
producing the desired results. The meager results of the Framework talks
thus far argue for de-emphasizing differences on trade strategy and
emphasizing instead the commonality of political, security, and even
economic interests. In other words, the U.S. needs to take a broader strategic
approach to Japan.<P>
     What the Numbers Tell. To start, there is no need for the U.S. to
place such a heavy emphasis on trade policy in defining its relationship with
Japan. When it came to office, the Clinton Administration alleged that the
Japan policies of previous Administrations had failed to produce trade
results. The numbers, however, tell a different story. From from 1987
through 1991, the U.S. trade deficit with Japan fell from $57 billion to $43
billion; total exports to Japan rose by 113 percent, and U.S.-manufactured
exports rose by 64 percent.<P>
     The reasons for the decline had less to do with trade negotiations
than with the fact that Japan's economy was booming and pulling in
American goods and services. The deficit began to go up again when
Japan's economy went into recession in the early 1990s. <P>
     Indeed, the President's own Council of Economic Advisers estimates
that even with near total victory in the Framework negotiations, the trade
deficit would still hover between $40 billion and $50 billion. If this is the
case, it makes little sense to focus so much on trade negotiations. It makes
even less sense to adopt numerical trade targets and other so-called objective
indicators of freer trade. Instead, the main focus of U.S. policy should be on
urging Japan to deregulate and liberalize its entire economy. This would
produce the economic growth needed to stimulate Japanese demand for U.S.
goods and to reduce the trade imbalance with the United States. 
  <P>  This strategy would build on the growing trend inside Japan toward
more deregulation and economic liberalization. By working with reformers
instead of against them in contentious trade talks, the Clinton Administration
could get real results. Rather than being cast as the external force
demanding change in Japan, the U.S. should work with Japan's reformers
to bring internal pressure to bear on Japan's bureaucracy. The result would
be a more open Japanese economy.
  <P>   Centerpiece of Security. However, de-emphasizing trade
negotiations is only one part of this new approach to Japan. The other is to
rediscover the strategic importance of the U.S.-Japan relationship, an
alliance based on a congruence of national interests. Both America and
Japan want an open international trading system and peaceful international
change. Both countries also need to prevent the domination of East Asia by
a hostile power. Across the globe, Japan has backed U.S. diplomatic
initiatives: democracy in Central America, economic development in the
Caribbean basin, the peace process in the Middle East, democracy and
economic reform in the republics of the former Soviet Union, building the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum into an institution for regional
trade liberalization, sending peacekeepers to Cambodia, and supporting U.S.
diplomacy to end North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
 <P>    At the same time, the U.S.-Japan alliance serves as the centerpiece
of the Asian-Pacific security system and the foundation of its stability and
economic dynamism. This is of direct and immediate importance to U.S.
economic well-being and national security. Beyond the Western Hemisphere,
America's largest markets are in Asia. Last year, trans-Pacific trade totaled
$361 billion, which is over 50 percent greater than trans-Atlantic trade. And
Asia's economies are the fastest-growing in the world.
   <P>  For Japan, Northeast Asia is a tough neighborhood. The Korean
Peninsula remains a conventional, and potentially nuclear, flashpoint. China
faces a daunting political transition when Deng Xiaoping dies. And the
process of democratization and economic reform in Russia promises to be
both protracted and perilous.
  <P>   To meet these challenges, the U.S. and Japan must stand together.
But they cannot do this if they are constantly bickering over negotiations
which have done little to correct the existing trade imbalance. By focusing
so much on trade negotiations, the Clinton White House has overlooked the
value of the alliance and its importance to U.S. regional and global interests.
Statements of the strategic importance of Japan have been confined largely
to the State Department, which is now largely irrelevant to making Japan
policy. That privilege has been reserved primarily by the White House, the
United States Trade Representative, and the Departments of Commerce and
Treasury, none of which has demonstrated a deep understanding of the
strategic relationship between the U.S. and Japan.
 <P>    To get back on track, the Clinton Administration should revive the
U.S.-Japan Global Partnership initiative, which was begun by President
George Bush and then-Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa in the Tokyo
Declaration of January 1992. The Global Partnership is both a framework
for political and economic cooperation between the U.S. and Japan and an
action plan to strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance. Using the Tokyo
Declaration as his guide, President Clinton should begin to reconstruct and
refocus U.S.-Japan relations. Thus, in the meeting with Prime Minister
Murayama, President Clinton should: <P>
 Reaffirm the U.S.-Japan Global Partnership initiative and the commitments
of the Tokyo Declaration. The Tokyo Declaration committed the U.S. and
Japan to cooperate in shaping a post-Cold War international order based on
"shared principles of political and economic freedom, democracy, the rule
of law, and respect for human rights." It also committed both countries to
"taking effective measures to address factors underlying economic friction,
with a focus on issues in their trading and investment relations." The key is
that the Tokyo Declaration puts the issue of trade in a strategic context. It
recognizes that progress in trade makes little sense if it irreparably severs
the strategic ties linking the U.S. and Japan.<P>
Appoint a binational U.S.-Japan Commission to report on how best to
implement the provisions of the Tokyo Declaration and the Global
Partnership initiative.
Highlight the U.S.-Japan alliance and its continuing relevance to both
countries' security interests. Even in today's post-Cold War world, the
alliance represents a congruence of national interests. It serves as the
cornerstone of stability and security in the Asia-Pacific region. This fact
needs to be at the heart of U.S. policy toward Japan. <P>
 Shift the spotlight of the U.S.-Japan relationship away from trade
negotiations. Instead, the U.S. should focus more on urging the Japanese to
deregulate and liberalize their economy. America will have powerful allies
inside Japan. Taking this approach will be far more productive than
badgering the Japanese over trade targets and other indicators. The Clinton
approach thus far has produced only politically motivated stonewalling
inside Japan.
 <P>    Over the past two years, the Clinton Administration has spent much
time and energy trying to build a new framework for the U.S.-Japan
relationship, one firmly attached to what it calls a "results-oriented" trade
policy. This approach has failed. President Clinton has the opportunity in the
upcoming summit meeting with Prime Minister Murayama to start over. The
first step is to recognize the central importance of the U.S.-Japan alliance
to the strategic interests of the United States. U.S. trade relations with Japan
are very important, but not more so than the relationship itself.
