<a href="tax_relf.gif">Table</a>: A Balanced Budget With Tax Relief Would Add $142 Billion to GDP...
<p>
Some policymakers maintain that tax relief is out of place in the quest for a balanced budget. They 
argue that tax cuts cannot be justified because they make the goal of a balanced budget even harder 
to reach.
<p>
But contrary to this view, the inclusion of tax cuts should be viewed as a critical component of any 
balanced budget plan. The reason is that reducing or eliminating tax relief on income from capital 
would lower potential economic growth significantly and would not in fact make room for new 
spending.
<p>
Economists at The Heritage Foundation recently used one of the principal econometric models of 
the U.S. economy to project the economic and fiscal effects of eliminating the tax relief elements of 
the congressional balanced budget act. This analysis shows:
<p><ul>
<li>The congressional balanced budget plan with tax cuts, as vetoed by President Clinton, would 
add $112 billion more to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) over the next seven years than the same 
congressional plan <i>without</i> tax cuts.
<p>
<li>The reductions in taxes on capital (including the capital gains tax relief) accounts for $66 
billion of this additional GDP and leads to a stronger economy in the long run.
</ul><p>
Heritage Foundation economists conducted this analysis of the congressional balanced budget plan 
using the econometric model developed by Laurence H. Meyer & Associates. Laurence H. Meyer 
& Associates is a nationally recognized consulting firm specializing in economic 
analysis.<sup>1 </sup>  The Meyer model is used by many major public agencies and private firms, 
including the President's Council of Economic Advisers, the Office of Management and Budget, 
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the Congressional Budget Office, the National 
Association of Realtors, and the National Association of Home Builders.<sup>2 </sup>
<p>
The congressional tax relief plan includes a reduction of taxes on families and on capital. The lower 
taxes on family income include primarily the $500-per-child tax credit, a reduction in the marriage 
penalty, and the adoption tax credit. The lower tax rates on income from capital include tax changes 
affecting capital gains, individual retirement accounts, the alternative minimum tax, and the estate 
and gift tax provisions.
<p>

<b>The Benefits of Reducing Taxes on Family Income</b>
<p>
The cornerstone of the reductions in taxes on family income is the $500-per-child tax credit. The 
immediate benefit of the $500-per-child tax credit included in the congressional balanced budget is 
an increase in household disposable income. Although $500 may seem insignificant in light of the 
entire federal budget, it is a substantial benefit to individual families. As demonstrated by previous 
Heritage analysis, a family with a newborn baby could save the entire $500 each year for eighteen 
years and afford the tuition costs at an average public university.<sup>3 </sup>  Alternatively, an 
average family with two children could use the $1,000 credit to purchase one month's supply of 
food and mortgage.<sup>4 </sup>  This additional private sector savings and consumption made 
possible by the $500-per-child tax credit and other reductions in family income taxes will benefit 
the economy.
<p>
<b>The Benefits of Reducing Taxes on Capital</b>
<p>
The cornerstone of the reductions in taxes on capital is the capital gains tax relief. Owners of 
appreciated assets sell those assets largely for one of two reasons: either to meet extraordinary 
expenses (educational, medical, or other large and non-recurring costs) or to move their money 
from an inferior to a superior investment. When government takes less of this income, household 
spending stimulates economic activity and more efficient investment fuels economic growth. 
<p>
Not surprisingly, the impact of a capital gains tax cut on investment and economic growth is more 
important in the long run than its role in allowing households to pay big bills. Two reasons for this 
relative importance stand out. First, reducing the tax on capital gains lowers the cost of moving an 
investment from an average company to one that is exceptionally productive and well run. This 
lowering of the "switching" costs means that investors will play a larger role in promoting well run, 
productive companies. Thus, the economy as a whole is likely to be more efficient. Second, lower 
taxes on capital cause the cost of capital to fall. Lenders, for example, do not require quite as much 
interest on their capital loans in order to recoup the taxes they paid when they made the capital 
available to a borrower. Lower capital costs usually mean more investment by businesses in labor-
saving equipment, which commonly results in increased labor productivity. This increased 
productivity gets translated into higher wages and, through the wonders of the division of labor, 
more jobs.
<p>
The following <a href="tax_relf.gif">table</a> compares the level of various economic indicators that result from the 
congressional balanced budget plan with tax relief and the congressional balanced budget plan 
without tax relief. Specifically,
<p><ul>
<li>Gross Domestic Product would be $13.7 billion more in the year 2002 as a result of the 
congressional plan <i>with</i> tax relief compared to the same plan <i>without</i> tax relief.
<p>
<li>Real disposable income would be $23.1 billion more in the year 2002 as a result of the 
congressional plan <I>with</i> tax relief compared to the same plan <i>without</i> tax relief.
</ul><p>
Removing capital gains tax relief from the congressional balanced budget will not allow increased 
federal spending. The capital gains tax relief element of the congressional balanced budget plan 
actually <i>reduces</i> the deficit in every year through 2002. There are two reasons for this. 
First, a reduction in the capital gains tax rate will produce more declarations of capital gains and 
thus increase government revenue from the capital gains tax. Second, the capital gains tax reduction 
creates a stronger economy, thus increasing the federal tax base. 
<p>
Economists estimate that trillions of dollars in unrealized capital gains (perhaps as high as $7.5 
trillion) exist in the portfolios of American taxpayers.<sup>5</sup> Some economists have 
estimated that significant capital gains rate changes could produce substantial economic benefits 
and create revenue windfalls for federal and state governments. In an article last year for the 
<i>American Economic Review</i>, Leonard Burman and William Randolph, two leading tax 
economists on the staff of the Congressional Budget Office, estimated the response of taxpayers to 
rate reductions as being on the order of 6 to 1. That is, for every one percent drop in the rate, capital 
gains realizations would rise by 6 percent.<sup>6 </sup>  The federal government would collect tax 
revenues on these "windfall" capital gains that under the current tax rate would not have been 
declared.
<p>
The congressional tax relief proposal, including the capital gains tax reduction, would allow 
individuals and owners of capital to keep more of the money they otherwise would have paid in 
taxes. This additional private sector savings and spending would be allocated more efficiently than 
had the federal government spent the money and thus will lead to a stronger economy. A stronger 
economy, in turn, means a larger tax base from which the federal government can draw revenue.
<p>
The important complement to this analysis is that, contrary to popular belief, additional spending 
opportunities for the federal government would not be available if the capital gains tax relief 
element of the congressional balanced budget plan is eliminated. In fact, additional spending 
reductions would be necessary in the future to offset the potential revenue foregone by elimination 
of the capital gains tax reduction.
<p>
<b>TECHNICAL ASSUMPTIONS</b>
<p>
To conduct the simulation of the congressional budget plan, Heritage economists adjusted only 
those elements of the Laurence H. Meyer & Associates baseline forecast that deal with federal 
spending and federal tax policy. 
<p>
The analysis is based on spending reductions specified in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, passed 
by Congress and vetoed by President Clinton on December 6. For specific assumptions concerning 
these spending reductions see, William W. Beach and John S. Barry, <a href="fyi69.html">"What 
a Balanced Federal Budget with Tax Cuts Would Mean to the Economy,"</a> Heritage Foundation 
F.Y.I. No. 69, November 14, 1995.
<p>
The major components of the congressional tax relief package were accounted for in the following 
manner:
<p><ul>
<li>A 50 percent exemption of individual capital gains was assumed for taxation purposes through 
2004. The maximum corporate capital gains tax rate was reduced from 35 percent to 28 percent.
<p>
<li>The average effective tax rate on individuals was reduced according to the annual value of the 
$500-per-child tax credit.
<P>
<li>Other provisions of the congressional tax relief package were accounted for by changing the 
effective tax rates on wages, dividends, and individuals.
</ul><p>
The analysis in this paper is based on the November economic forecast and projection of Laurence 
H. Meyer & Associates. This is the most recent economic forecast available from Laurence H. 
Meyer & Associates.
<p>
Note: Reduction in tax on income includes: family tax relief, the reduction in the marriage penalty; 
and the adoption tax credit. Reduction in tax on capital includes: tax changes affecting capital gains, 
IRAs, the alternative minimum tax, and the estate and gift tax provisions.

<title>How A Capital Gains Tax Cut Would Boost State Revenue -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>BALANCED BUDGET TALKING POINTS #8: 
HOW A CAPITAL GAINS TAX CUT WOULD BOOST STATE REVENUES</h3>

<hr width=50%></center><p>
<a href="gain1.gif">Chart</a>: Estimated One-Time State Revenue Windfall...
<p>
The vetoed congressional budget plan would significantly cut effective taxes on capital gains, both 
for individuals and for businesses. The Heritage Foundation estimates that this important tax cut 
could cause millions of taxpayers to declare billions of dollars in capital gains during the first year 
of the lower effective rates. Because 40 states require taxpayers to report all capital gains declared 
on their federal tax forms, this sudden growth in capital gains may create a one-year state income 
tax windfall of $9.5 billion.
<P>
If taxpayers were to "unlock" appreciated assets during the first year of lower capital gains taxes 
under the congressional budget plan, states that tax capital gains would likely see their income tax 
revenues increase by an average of 11.6 percent.
<p>
Some states might experience an especially high one-time percentage increase in their income tax 
receipts. For example:
<p>
<a href="gain1.gif">Chart</a>: Estimated One-Time State Revenue Windfall...
<p>
The reason for this state tax "windfall" actually is quite simple. Reducing the tax rate for capital 
gains actually increases tax revenues from taxpayers who own appreciated assets. Experience over 
the last 25 years with changes in capital gains tax rates strongly indicates that rate decreases 
produce more declarations of capital gains and more capital gains taxes. Owners of appreciated 
assets who face high tax rates generally hold on to or "lock up" their assets in anticipation of lower 
future rates. When the rates come down, the amount of capital gains declarations goes up.
<p>
Economists estimate that trillions of dollars in unrealized or "locked up" capital gains (perhaps has 
high as $7.5 trillion) exists in the portfolios of American taxpayers.<sup>1 </sup>  Some 
economists have estimated that significant capital gains rate changes could produce substantial 
economic benefits and create revenue windfalls for federal and state governments.<sup>2 </sup> In 
an article last year for the <i>American Economic Review</i>, Leonard Burman and William 
Randolph, two leading tax economists on the staff of the Congressional Budget Office, estimated 
the response of taxpayers to rate reductions as being in the order of 6 to 1. That is, for every one 
percent drop in the rate, capital gains realizations rose by 6 percent.<sup>3 </sup>
<p>
The accompanying table shows three different state "windfall" scenarios, representing the range of 
expert opinion on how declarations are affected by a change in the rate. Each scenario uses the 
actual capital gains declarations by individuals as reported in the IRS's Public Use File for 
1991.<sup>4 </sup> The first set of columns shows the low estimate, which is calculated by 
multiplying the drop in the effective tax rate by 0.17. This means a 50 percent decrease in the 
effective capital gains tax rate results in a 51 percent increase in capital gains declarations. The third 
set of columns shows the high estimate, which multiplies the 50 percent decrease by the "transitory 
tax elasticity" estimated by Burman and Randolph: 6.42. While Burman and Randolph offer solid 
evidence for this strong level of taxpayer response to a change in the capital gains tax rate (which in 
the table leads to a 321 percent increase in declarations), it is probably imprudent for states to 
budget on this optimistic outcome. Thus, the second set of columns shows the midpoint between 
the low and high responses. The midpoint estimates reflect an increase in declarations of 156 
percent for a 50 percent drop in the tax rate.
<p>
As always, the difficult part of estimating tax revenues from capital gains is forecasting the value of 
the appreciated assets taxpayers will liquidate and the time of their liquidation. No particularly good 
and reliable revenue model exists for this purpose. Thus tax analysts are left with calculating 
historical responses to tax changes and assuming that the future will be very much like the past. 
<p>
Thus, these Heritage "mid-point" estimates, based as they are on data from a slow economic year 
and a mid-range level of taxpayer response, should give state revenue officers a reasonable number 
for incorporating into their state income tax forecasts. These middle estimates also illustrate 
conservatively that what happens to capital gains at the federal level has important implications for 
the revenues of 40 states. Besides the good economic effects on state economies resulting from a 
balanced budget with tax cuts, the congressional budget plan actually supplies the states with 
additional revenue that they can use to meet their additional responsibilities. If, on the other hand, 
the capital gains cut were to be pared back or eliminated in the negotiations over a budget, that 
would reduce or eliminate the revenue benefit to states with a capital gains tax.

information extracted from actual tax returns. The Public Use File for 1992 was not available at the 
time Heritage performed this analysis. Thus, Heritage is using the most recent, detailed tax data 
supplied to the general public by the IRS.

<title>What Congress's Balanced Budget, Tax Cuts Would Mean for Housing -- Heritage</title>

<h3>BALANCED BUDGET TALKING POINTS #7:  
WHAT CONGRESS'S BALANCED BUDGET WITH TAX CUTS WOULD MEAN FOR HOUSING</h3>

<a href="chart4.gif">Additional Housing Starts with a Balanced Budget and Tax Cuts</a><br>
<a href="chart9.gif">Conventional Mortgage Rates: Current Law vs. a Balanced Budget</a>

<p>
Congress's plan to balance the budget over seven years with tax cuts, vetoed on December 6 by President Clinton, would significantly improve the housing of many renters and homeowners while lowering their housing costs. According to an econometric analysis by The Heritage Foundation, adopting the spending and tax policy changes contained in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 would likely lead to:
<p><ul>
<li>104,000 additional housing starts worth $11 billion over the period 1996 through 2002;
<p>
<li>New or improved housing for 1.8 million Americans;
<p>
<li>A drop in mortgage interest rates, with total payments on a $100,000 mortgage about $10,000 less in today's dollars over 30 years than a mortgage purchased under current budget and tax law; and
<p>
<li>A 4 percent drop in the cost of housing by 2002 (principally through decreases in the cost of capital and lower interest rates), with the value of existing housing maintained at or near current levels by the growing demand for new homes.
</ul><p>
This good news on housing reflects the stronger economy that economists at The Heritage Foundation predict would result from the vetoed Balanced Budget Act of 1995.<sup>1</sup>  Incomes and output would rise, inflation and interest rates would fall, and the spending and tax cuts proposed by Congress would lead to significant growth in productivity and investment. Each has a positive effect on housing. Specifically, the boost in new home construction would produce widespread benefits, and the tax policy provisions of the Act would lead simultaneously to lower housing costs.
<p>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a> conducted this analysis of the congressional budget plan using an economic model of the U.S. economy developed by Laurence H. Meyer & Associates, a nationally recognized economics consulting firm whose model is used routinely by major private firms and by such public agencies as the President's Council of Economic Advisers, the White House Office of Management and Budget, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Congressional Budget Office.
<p>

<b>Growth in New Home Construction</b>
<p>
For a graphical representation, see <a href="chart4.gif">Additional Housing Starts with a Balanced Budget and Tax Cuts</a>
<p>
The healthier economy that flows from Congress's tax and spending cuts produces two important effects on family housing.
<p>
First, the tax reductions, particularly the cuts in capital gains taxes, would jump start a boom in new investments by households and businesses.<sup>2</sup>  The Meyer model indicates that investors would pour an additional $11 billion (adjusted for inflation) into the housing sector as a result of the congressional budget plan. Without the tax and spending cuts, these new investments in family housing likely would not be made.<p>Home builders would use these new funds to construct an estimated 51,200 new single-family homes and 52,800 new multi-family dwellings over the seven-year period from 1996 through 2002.
<p>
This construction activity would mean employment and income growth in the housing industry, in the banking and real estate sectors, and in thousands of other companies that sell new homeowners everything from telephones to tabletops.
<p>
Second, these new investment dollars would provide improved housing for nearly 700,000 families. The model projects 7,200 starts of 2-to-4-unit dwellings and 45,600 starts of 5-or-more-unit dwellings. Assuming that all dwellings in the 2-to-4 category are actually 2-unit dwellings and all in the 5-or-more category are only 5-unit buildings, then the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 could provide new apartments for 288,000 families. Add to this number the 51,200 families who would be moving into single-family housing, and it becomes apparent that Congress's budget plan will significantly improve the housing of many Americans. Specifically: 
<p><ul>
<li>An additional 339,200 families could move into new housing over the next seven years as a result of the Balanced Budget Act of 1995. Assuming a national average family size of 2.63, this means 892,100 people could enjoy new housing over this period.<sup>3</sup><P><li>Assuming that the 339,200 dwellings vacated by these families who are moving up in housing are purchased or rented by another 339,200 families looking to improve their own housing, the total number of people affected by these new housing starts could be 1,784,200.</ul><p>
<b>Reduced Housing Costs</b>
<p>
While the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 would contribute significantly to the welfare of Americans through its salutary influence on housing, the legislation's benefits for homeowners and renters would not end there. The Act's role in stimulating the growth of investment and reducing the after-tax cost of capital (largely through reductions in the effective tax rate on capital gains) reduces the cost of housing. The Meyer model projects that the cost of housing will be 4 percent lower by 2002 than it otherwise would be under current law. Two factors explain this drop in the relative price of housing.
<p>
First, Congress's budget plan would reduce the costs of capital directly by reducing the effective tax rate on capital gains. For example, if Jones is thinking about cashing out an appreciated asset (say, a company stock) and loaning the proceeds to Smith, who is building an apartment building, Jones will consider the taxes he or she must pay on the capital gain as an important part of making the loan. If Jones paid a high capital gain tax, then he or she will demand a higher rate of return on the investment. Thus, dropping the effective tax rate on capital gains works to lower the cost of capital for those who borrow. The Meyer model predicts that the after-tax cost of capital by 2002 would be a full percentage point lower than it would be under current law.
<p>
Because capital costs are an important part of the costs landlords must cover by the rents they receive, one highly possible outcome of tax cuts is lower than expected rental payments by families in apartments or single-family rental property.
<p>
Similarly, the prices of new single-family homes will rise less rapidly in a world with tax cuts than in a world without them for the very same reason:  Homebuilders will be paying less for the capital they need for home construction.
<p>
Second, the relative price of housing would drop under the vetoed plan because mortgages would be less costly. The Balanced Budget Act of 1995 not only would cut the effective rate on capital gains, but also would permit middle and lower income families with children to keep $23 billion more of their income each year through the child tax credit. The Meyer model indicates that families would use a portion of this money to buy stocks and bonds and to increase their personal savings accounts. These actions would increase the supply of funds available for investment. Thus, the mortgage interest rate (like all of the major interest rates in the Meyer model) would fall because the after-tax cost of capital would decline and the supply of investment dollars rise.
<p>
For a graphical representation, see <a href="chart9.gif">Conventional Mortgage Rates: Current Law vs. a Balanced Budget</a>
<p>
The 0.4 percent drop in the mortgage interest rate from what it otherwise would be means that a $100,000 home loan would cost about $10,000 less in today's dollars over a typical 30-year loan repayment period.
<p>
Lower borrowing costs would allow more families to enter the housing market, which would contribute to price stability in housing and the preservation of household net wealth.
<p>
This important role of lower interest rates -- preserving the value of all homes through the competitive price bidding of home buyers -- explains in part the impressive growth in household net worth by 2002:  The Meyer model projects that, at the end of the seven-year balancing period, households will be worth nearly $200 billion more than they otherwise would have been under current law. 
<p>
It is benefits of this magnitude that President Clinton has foregone through his veto. Not only does the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 inadvertently create a "housing program" of significant proportions; it also contributes to a general improvement in family financial well-being.

<h3><I>BALANCED BUDGET TALKING POINTS #6:
WHAT A BALANCED FEDERAL BUDGET WITH TAX CUTS WOULD MEAN FOR CURRENT AND FUTURE RETIREES</i></h3>

F.Y.I. No. 79<br>
December 11, 1995<br>
<hr width=-50%></center><p>
Congress's balanced budget plan with tax relief, vetoed on December 6 by President Clinton, would expand the purchasing power of today's seniors and allow younger Americans to save more money for their retirement. These are the findings of an analysis by The Heritage Foundation using one of the principal econometric models of the U.S. economy.<sup>1</sup>  According to this statistical analysis, the congressional plan would mean:<p><b>For Current Retirees</b><p>A retiree showing $2,150 in capital gains for 1995 would realize $245 in additional after-tax income from a reduction in the capital gains tax.<p>A senior citizen with only $25,000 per year in nominal dollars for retirement could see an increase of $1,125 in real purchasing power over the next ten years due to decreased inflation.<p><b>For Future Retirees</b>
<p>
A worker saving $500 annually before taxes in the proposed "super IRA" for 40 years would realize an additional $3,070 in today's dollars compared with putting the same amount in a conventional IRA.
<p>
A 25-year-old couple raising one newborn child could save $41,150 in today's dollars for their retirement by saving the $500-per-child annual tax credit.
<p>
A young couple buying a home with a $100,000 mortgage could save $33,890 in today's dollars for their retirement from decreased monthly mortgage payments.
<p>
Economists at The Heritage Foundation conducted an interim econometric analysis of the congressional balanced budget plan using the economic model developed by Laurence H. Meyer & Associates,<sup>2</sup> a nationally recognized economic consulting firm. The Meyer model is used by many major public agencies and private firms, such as the President's Council of Economic Advisers, the Office of Management and Budget, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, and the Congressional Budget Office.<sup>3</sup><p>The positive benefits to current and future retirees from the congressional balanced budget plan are discussed below. These include increased after-tax income from lower capital gains tax rates; expanded purchasing power from lower inflation; and increased potential retirement income from super IRAs, the $500-per-child tax credit, and lower mortgage rates.<p><b>Benefits to Current Retirees</b><p>Increased After-Tax Income from Lower Capital Gains Taxes. The Balanced Budget Act of 1995 lowers the effective tax rate on capital gains by 50 percent for individual tax filers through a deduction of half the net taxable gain. Thus, an individual in the 28 percent tax bracket would see his effective tax rate on capital gains drop to 14 percent.<sup>4</sup>  Contrary to popular belief, the capital gains tax reduction is not a tax break enjoyed primarily by the rich. The typical household declaring a capital gain in 1991 had income from sources <i>other than capital gains</i> of $58,729.<sup>5</sup>  For seniors claiming a capital gain in 1991, the average income from sources <i>other than capital gains</i> was $43,637, with an average gain of $2,151.<p>A reduction in the capital gains tax is particularly important for today's retirees who have invested in capital assets as a means of saving for their retirement. There are two major reasons why the capital gains tax cut is so important to seniors:<p><ul><li>Senior citizens claim a disproportionate amount of capital gains. Households containing taxpayers 
who are over the age of 65 or blind constituted only 3.5 percent of all returns in 1991 but accounted for more than 27 percent of taxpaying households declaring capital gains. 
<p>
<li>Current law imposes a surtax on Social Security benefits. For example, a retiree facing a base marginal tax rate of 15 percent also must pay a surtax of 7.5 percent. This is why many individuals face higher marginal tax rates during their retirement than over the rest of their lifetime.<sup>6</sup>  Thus, the 50 percent exclusion may be more valuable during a taxpayer's retirement years than during his working years.
</ul><p>
To understand the benefits of the capital gains exclusion for seniors, consider a newly retired couple realizing $2,150 in capital gains during 1995. If this couple faces the lowest marginal tax rate of 15 percent and the Social Security surtax of 7.5 percent, they will receive only $1,665 in after-tax income from these gains. Under the congressional balanced budget plan, however, this same retired couple would realize $1,910, an increase of $245 over current law.
<p>
To put this in perspective, an additional $245 amounts to:
<p><ul>
<li>One month of groceries for the average retired household, or
<p>
<li>Six months of housekeeping supplies for the average retired household.
</ul><p>
<b>Increased Purchasing Power from Lower Inflation.</b> Many senior citizens have saved a fixed amount of money for their retirement years. Seniors living on a fixed income are affected directly by inflation because it changes the purchasing power of their money. As inflation increases the prices of goods, consumers are able to purchase less:  Inflation eats away at purchasing power. Because retirees, as a rule, are more likely to be restricted to a fixed income, they will benefit disproportionately from a slower rate of inflation.
<p>
The economic simulation conducted by analysts at The Heritage Foundation indicates that prices likely will increase more slowly in the future because of a more efficient economy spurred by a balanced federal budget and tax relief. By 2002, inflation rates are projected by this analysis to be 0.7 percent below what is expected under current law. This means consumers will be able to purchase more goods with the same amount of money. For example, a retired household living on a fixed income of $25,000 per year will see their purchasing power increase by $1,125 in today's dollars over the course of the next ten years.
<p>
To put this in perspective, an additional $1,125 amounts to:
<p><ul>
<li>The amount an average retired household will spend on laundry and household cleaning over the next ten years,
<p>
<li>The amount an average retired household will spend on fresh milk and cream over the next ten years, or
<p>
<li>One-half the amount an average retired household will spend on furniture over the next ten years.<sup>7</sup></ul><p><b>Benefits to Future Retirees</b><p><b>Benefits from Super IRAs.</b> Current laws allow tax-free deposits of up to $2,000 per year in contributions to Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). However, withdrawals from these IRAs made during retirement years are taxable. The tax provisions of the congressional balanced budget plan would create a new kind of IRA, known as a super IRA. Contributions to a super IRA would be taxable; however, withdrawals could be made tax-free. As Bruce Bartlett, an economist at the National Center for Policy Analysis, notes, "If the tax rate is the same at the time of deposit and the time of withdrawal, taxpayers would be indifferent between the two types of IRAs. However, most middle-income workers will face higher tax rates during the years of their retirement, because of the Social Security benefits tax."<sup>8</sup>  Therefore, retired workers will not face the higher tax rates associated with retirement when making withdrawals from super IRAs.<p>The <a href="fyi_79.gif">table</a> below shows the advantage of the congressional super-IRA provision. Suppose a young worker decides to invest $500 annually in a conventional IRA. Because these annual contributions are tax-exempt under current law, this worker can dedicate the entire $500 in personal savings. After 40 years of $500 annual contributions, this worker's IRA will have accumulated $129,528 in future dollars. However, under current law, this worker must pay taxes on withdrawals from the IRA. If this now-retired worker faces a base marginal tax rate of 15 percent and the surtax of 7.5 percent, he will pay 22.5 percent of the accumulated $129,528 in taxes, leaving him with an after-tax income of $100,384 in future dollars.
<p>
Now suppose this same worker was able to invest the $500 per year in a super IRA. This worker, facing a marginal tax rate of 15 percent, would be able to dedicate only $425 to the IRA because contributions to super IRAs are not tax-free. Every year he would pay $75 in taxes and deposit $425 in the super IRA. After 40 years of $425 annual contributions, this worker's super IRA will have accumulated $110,099. However, this entire amount can be withdrawn tax-free. Thus, by investing in a super IRA he will have $9,715 more after 40 years in after-tax income for his retirement years. This additional future income is equal to $3,070 in today's dollars.
<p>
<b>Extra Potential Retirement Savings from $500-per-Child Tax Credit.</b> The $500-per-child tax credit included in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 would benefit 28 million families raising some 51 million children. A 25-year-old couple that has just had a child and decides to dedicate the entire $500-per-child tax credit every year for 18 years to savings for their retirement, and then leaves the balance to continue earning interest for an additional 22 years, could accumulate $41,150 in today's dollars ($101,820 in future dollars) after the 40 years of savings.<sup>9</sup><p>This additional savings amounts to:<p><ul><li>The total amount an average retired couple will spend on groceries over ten years of retirement, or<li>The total amount an average retired homeowner will spend on mortgage payments, property taxes, and home maintenance costs over ten years of retirement.<sup>10</sup></ul><p><b>Extra Potential Retirement Income from Lower Home-Mortgage Rates.</b> The economic simulation conducted by analysts at The Heritage Foundation indicates that households and businesses would face lower interest rates as a result of a stronger economy spurred by a balanced budget and tax relief. Specifically, the simulation projects mortgage interest rates in 2002 will be 0.4 percent below what they are expected to be under current law. This 0.4 percentage point decrease below baseline means that a new home borrower of $100,000 will save $25 per month in mortgage payments.
<p>
A homeowner who chooses to dedicate the extra $25 per month to retirement savings for every month over the 30-year life of the mortgage, and then leaves the balance to continue earning interest for an additional ten years, will accumulate $33,890 in today's dollars ($80,440 in future dollars) after the 40 years of savings.<sup>11</sup> <p>This additional savings amounts to:
<p><ul>
<li>The total amount an average senior citizen will spend on utility payments over 15 years of retirement,
<p>
<li>The total amount an average senior couple will spend on dining away from home over 20 years of retirement, or
<p>
<li>The total amount an average senior couple will spend on gasoline and motor oil over ten years of retirement plus a modest vacation every year for ten years.<sup>12</sup></ul><p><b>Technical Assumptions</b><p>For assumptions that underlie the econometric simulation of the congressional balanced budget legislation, see William W. Beach and John S. Barry, <a href="fyi69.html">"What a Balanced Federal Budget with Tax Cuts Would Mean to the Economy</a>," Heritage Foundation <i>F.Y.I.</i> No. 69, November 14, 1995.
<p>
For calculations of accumulated savings from the $500-per-child tax credit, it was assumed that the entire $500 was contributed to a super-IRA (as defined by the Congressional Budget Resolution of 1995) earning an annual rate of return of 8 percent. It was further assumed that this accumulated amount was saved for an additional 22 years at an annual rate of return of 8 percent. Inflation was assumed to be 3 percent annually.
<p>
The 0.4 percent decline in mortgage interest rates was projected in the above-cited econometric simulation. It was assumed that the savings from this decline were placed in a super-IRA (as defined by the Congressional Budget Resolution of 1995) earning an annual rate of return of 8 percent. Contributions to the IRA were made over the life of a 30-year mortgage. It was further assumed that this accumulated amount was saved for an additional 10 years at an annual rate of return of 8 percent. Inflation was assumed to be 3 percent annually.
<p>
Middle-income seniors typically face a higher tax rate because of the Social Security surtax on "provisional income."<sup>13</sup>  The effect of this surtax is to place America's middle-income elderly in a special, higher bracket by virtue of their age. For instance, if an individual younger than the retirement age receives $1 from savings, the income tax will take 15 cents in the lowest tax bracket. But some Americans must also pay the Social Security surtax, and a second 7.5 cents on the same $1 of savings could be due under the surtax.

CLINTON'S $300-PER-CHILD TAX CUT PLAN

December 11, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%><br>

<bq><i> Now, what the Congress wants to do is to roll back that working family's [Earned Income Tax Credit], in a way that will impose a tax increase averaging $500 a family on families least able to pay it.  This is a tax hike that literally will push many working families back into poverty.<br>
— President Bill Clinton, October 7, 1995</i></bq></center>

<P>
	The White House charged in October that Congress's balanced budget and tax cut plan would raise taxes on families earning below $30,000, because of the proposed congressional reforms in the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Yet a comparison of President Clinton's just-released budget (with its provision for a $300-per-child tax credit for dependent children below age 13 in families with annual incomes below $75,000<sup>1</sup>) and the Balanced Budget Act vetoed by Clinton on Wednesday (with its $500-per-child tax cut for all children in families earning up to $110,000<sup>2</sup>) shows that the congressional plan would benefit 5.4 million more low-income working families with children than the Clinton plan. This is so even after accounting for the changes in the EITC in the Balanced Budget Act. The group especially hit under the Clinton budget are many families with children earning below $24,000 per year, who would be denied the $300 child credit under the Clinton plan (receiving only the EITC) and who would be eligible for both the $500 child credit and the EITC under the congressional plan.
<p>
	Overall, the $500-per-child tax credit in Congress's balanced budget and tax cut plan would benefit 23 million more children than the Administration's $300-per-child credit. Congress's plan would give tax relief to 10.4 million families with children who would receive no tax relief under the Clinton plan. In addition, there would be millions of families in which at least one sibling would receive tax relief under Clinton but other siblings would not. Taken together, the total number of children not qualifying for any tax relief under Clinton would be 23 million less than under Congress's plan. These children would receive $15.4 billion in tax relief under Congress's plan but nothing under Clinton's plan.
<p>
	There are three major reasons why the Clinton tax cut plan ends up denying tax relief to so many families with children:


<p>
<b>Reason #1: Clinton's tax cut only benefits families with children under age 13.</b>  Since roughly 25 percent of all children are over age 12, millions of families are denied a tax cut just when the cost of raising that child becomes more expensive. This provision alone denies tax relief to the families of at least 2.8 million children earning under $30,000 per year. This restriction also reduces the average tax cut per family because many families have children below age 13 and children age 13 or older. Indeed, the average tax cut per family under the Clinton plan is $442, but the average tax cut under Congress's plan is $856 per family.
<p>
<b>Reason #2: Clinton's tax cut only benefits families earning up to $75,000 per year.</b> While some 88 percent of all children live in families earning below $75,000 per year, this income restriction denies $2.6 billion in tax relief to nearly 6 million families with children, compared with Congress's plan. Many of these families would by no means consider themselves "rich." For example, a federal worker earning $40,000 per year and his school teacher spouse earning $35,000 could easily find themselves denied tax relief under the Clinton plan.  
<p>
<b>Reason #3: The Clinton plan requires low-income families to deduct their EITC benefits from their income tax bill before they can take the $300-per-child tax credit.</b> By contrast, Congress's plan allows a low-income family to take the $500-per-child tax credit first, and then receive the full measure of the EITC on top of the child credit. As the following table shows, as a result of this difference in which the tax credit is taken versus the EITC, a family with two children would have to earn $24,000 annually before becoming eligible for the Clinton credit. By contrast, under the Balanced Budget Act this family would become eligible for the credit at roughly $17,000 in annual income.
<p><bq>




<b>Example:</b> Say a married couple with two children earning $23,000 per year pays $908 in income taxes. To calculate how much of a tax cut they would receive under the Clinton plan, this family must first deduct roughly $1,170 in EITC benefits from their $908 income tax bill, which results in zero available income taxes from which to deduct the $600 tax credit they might otherwise be eligible to receive. However, under Congress's $500-per-child tax credit plan, this family would first take a tax deduction of $908 (although their two children would otherwise give them $1,000 tax credit, the value of the tax deduction cannot exceed their income tax liability). Then they would receive, in addition, their full $1,170 in EITC benefits ($1,514 after the congressional reforms).
</bq><p>
See Chart 1: <a href="fyi78_2.gif">Tax Savings: Married Couple with Two Children</a>
<p> 
	Combined, these three elements of the Clinton plan make it substantially inferior to Congress's $500-per-child tax credit, even considering the reforms in the EITC. Specifically:
<p><ul>
<li>Clinton's $300-per-child tax credit plan would benefit 23 million fewer children, than Congress's $500-per-child tax credit plan. Some 10.4 million families would get no tax relief under Clinton but would under Congress's plan. Millions of other families would receive reduced tax relief because some of their children would qualify under Congress's plan but not under Clinton's. Taken together, these families would be denied $15 billion per year in tax cuts.
<p>
<li>Compared with Congress's $500-per-child tax cut plan, the Clinton plan would deny tax relief to 5.4 million children in families earning below $30,000 per year in income. Under Congress's plan, these same families would receive $2.3 billion in tax cuts.
<p>
<li>Under the Clinton plan, a single parent with one child would have to earn over $18,500 per year to become eligible for the $300-per-child tax cut. Under Congress's plan, this parent would begin getting tax relief with just over $11,500 in annual income. See Chart 2: <a href="fyi78_3.gif">Tax Savings: Single Parent with One Child</a>.
<p>
<li>Under the Clinton plan, a married couple with two children would have to make $24,000 per year to become eligible for the $300-per-child tax cut. Under Congress's plan, this family would begin getting tax relief at $17,000 in annual income.
See Table 1: <a href="fyi78_1.gif">Income at Which Family Becomes Eligible for Tax Cut</a><p></ul><p>
Even after accounting for reforms in the Earned Income Tax Credit, families with two children earning below $30,000 per year would, on average, receive $132 more each year in tax cuts than under the Clinton plan. Single parents with one child earning below $30,000 annually would receive $187 more tax relief on average than under the Clinton plan. Even this assumes that both of these families have children under age 13 (and thus eligible for the Clinton credit). Since 25 percent of all children are above the age of 12, many of these families would receive far less tax relief on average under the Clinton plan. Congress's plan gives an average of $856 in tax relief per family, whereas the Clinton plan gives an average of $442 per family.
<p>
<b>Endnotes:</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>The Administration's $300 per-child credit begins phasing out for families with incomes above $60,000 and reaches zero at $75,000 in family income. The credit increases in value to $500 per child after 1998.

<li>For taxpayers filing jointly with incomes above $110,000 the credit phases out at a rate of $25 for each $1,000 above the threshold (a range of $20,000), thus fully phasing out at $130,000 in income. For families with two children, the two credits this family is eligible for are fully phased out at $150,000 in income. For single filers, the credit begins to phase out at $75,000 in income.

"If you take the $500 a year tax credit, and I figure, you know,
$5 for a bottle of wine, that is 100 bottles of wine for a family...."<sup>1</sup></i><br>— Congressman Jim McDermott (D-WA)<br></center></bq><p>	Contrary to what elitists in Washington would have the public believe, for most hard-working American families raising children a $500 tax cut for each child is not an insignificant amount of money. This is especially true as many families no doubt are wondering how they will be able to afford the $432 some surveys report each household expects to spend this holiday season.<sup>2</sup> Yet the families of 51 million children, or over 28 million families in all, were denied relief from their financial worries when President Bill Clinton recently vetoed Congress's seven year balanced budget and tax cut plan, which had as its centerpiece a $500-per-child tax credit. This tax cut would pump over $22 billion per year into family budgets across the country so that working parents can provide for their children in a way no government program can.
<p>
	As congressional Republicans negotiate with the White House on a compromise plan to balance the budget by 2002 and provide tax cuts, they should resist pressure to scale back the $500-per-child tax credit as a price for cutting a deal. Those who argue that Washington cannot "afford" such generous tax cuts while the government is trying to balance the budget are, in effect, arguing for higher spending. The budget will not be balanced any faster if the amount of the per-child credit is reduced below $500 or if the income for which families are eligible is lowered from its current level of $110,000 for joint filers.<sup>3</sup> Any money not put back in the checkbooks of working families with children through tax cuts, is more money in the checkbook for politicians and bureaucrats to spend while the budget is moving toward balance.
<p>
	Congressional and White House negotiators should keep in mind that for parents with two children, the $1,000 tax cut they would receive under this plan could mean the difference between paying the mortgage and not. Indeed, as the table below shows, a $1,000 tax cut for the typical family with two children is enough to pay one month's mortgage and grocery bills, or 11 months worth of electric bills, or nearly 20 months worth of clothing for the children. In other words, a $1,000 tax cut is a significant amount of money for most families' household budgets. 

<p>
	There are also sound policy reasons to cut taxes for families with children:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Families with children are overtaxed.</b> In 1948, the average American family with children paid only 3 percent of its income to Uncle Sam. Today the same family pays 24.5 percent.
<p>
<li><b>Giving a family of four a $500-per-child tax credit is equivalent to giving them one month's mortgage payment.</b> The average family now loses $10,060 per year of its income due to the 45-year increase in federal taxes as a share of family income. This tax loss exceeds the annual mortgage payment on the average family home. The $1,000 in tax relief the congressional tax-cut plan would give to a family with two children would help this family pay one month's mortgage payment.
<p>
<li><b>Millions of families stand to benefit.</b> The families of 51 million American children, or 28 million taxpaying families, are eligible for the $500-per-child tax cut. 
<p>
<li><b>Family tax relief helps families in every state. </b>The typical congressional district has some 117,000 children in families eligible for a $500 tax credit. Thus families in the typical district would receive $54 million per year in tax relief.
<p>
<li><b>Congress's $500-per-child tax credit would eliminate the entire income tax burden for 3.5 million taxpayers caring for 8.7 million children.</b> These 3.5 million families will receive over $2.2 billion per year in tax relief. Families with two children earning up to $24,000 per year would see their entire income tax burden eliminated by a $500-per-child tax credit, and families with three children earning up to $26,000 also would have their income tax bill eliminated.
<p>
<li><b>Most families are middle-class.</b> The $500 child credit plan will direct 89 percent of all benefits to families with adjusted gross incomes below $75,000 per year --  middle-income by any standard --  and over 96 percent to families with incomes below $100,000.
<p>
<li><b>Cutting taxes for all families --  regardless of income --  is fair.</b> Congress's plan will cut    the income tax burden of a family of four earning $30,000 per year by 51 percent and the income tax burden of a family earning $40,000 per year by 30 percent. Meanwhile, a family of four earning $75,000 would see their tax burden reduced by 12 percent, and a family earning $100,000 per year would receive a tax cut of just 7.4 percent.


</ul><P>
















<center><b>TECHNICAL NOTES ON TABLES</b></center>
<P>
	The following tables represent the best available means of estimating the amount of family tax relief that will go to each state and congressional district from a $500-per-child tax credit. It should be noted that not every eligible family will be able to subtract the full $500 for each child from its tax bill. We have tried to take the following exceptions into account:
<p><ul>
<li><b>The $500 credit is non-refundable.</b>This means that a family cannot get more in tax relief than it pays in income taxes. Example: a family of four earning $20,000 per year owes about $458 in income taxes. Though the $500-per-child tax credit might otherwise get them $1,000 in total tax relief because of their two children, the fact that this credit is not refundable allows them to deduct only what they owe — $458 — from their income tax bill.

<li><b>The $500 credit is phased out for joint filers with incomes above $110,000 per year and single filers with incomes above $75,000 per year.</b> For taxpayers filing jointly with incomes above $110,000 the credit phases out at a rate of $25 for each $1,000 above the threshold (a range of $20,000), thus fully phasing out at $130,000 in income. For families with two children, the two credits this family is eligible for are fully phased out at $150,000 in income. For single filers, the credit begins to phase out at $75,000 in income and is fully phased out at $95,000 in income.
</ul><p>
	The first two tables, showing the number of households and children by state, were calculated using the 1991 IRS Public Use File.  This data is derived from income tax return forms and the number of dependents claimed on those forms.
<P>
	The tables listing family tax relief by congressional district were calculated using the 1990 Census.
<p>
	Because the sources for the two tables are different, the tax relief calculated for each state will not necessarily equal the sum of tax relief for that state's individual counties. In each case, the source is the most accurate data available for that specific level of analysis.  The differences may be caused by the following facts:
<p><ol>
<li>The IRS data are based on tax returns filed with the federal government.  Not every household files a tax return, however.  For some groups this is by law; Native Americans are not required to file a tax return.  Other individuals do not file because they do not have an income to report.  Finally, some people simply do not file for personal reasons.  These same groups may be counted by the Census Bureau but will not be accounted for by the IRS.

<li>Many people maintain a permanent residence in one county or state but live in another.  These people pay taxes in a different county or state  than where they live.  Again the Census and IRS will account for these people in different locations.

<li>Many people file their tax returns late.  Thus, the data from the 1991 IRS files may not include certain families that would be included in the Census count. Alternatively, the IRS records may include more families (because of people filing from past years) than the Census Bureau count

<title>What A Balanced Federal Budget with Tax Cuts Would Mean for Family College Costs -- Heritage</title>

<h3><i>BALANCED BUDGET TALKING POINTS #3:  
WHAT A BALANCED FEDERAL BUDGET WITH TAX CUTS 
WOULD MEAN FOR FAMILY COLLEGE COSTS</i></h3>

<a href="/heritage/staff/barry.html">John S. Barry</a><br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 77<br>
December 4, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
Congress's balanced budget with tax relief legislation will allow families with children to save more money for higher education. A balanced budget with tax cuts also will lead to lower interest rates which will benefit students by lowering the cost of student loans. Both of these consequences of balancing the budget over seven years with tax relief mean more highly skilled Americans for future workforces. These are the findings of an analysis by The Heritage Foundation using one of the principal econometric models of the U.S. economy. 
<p>
According to this statistical analysis, the Balanced Budget Act developed by Congress would mean: 
<p><ul>
<li> American families, over time, could save an additional $14,066 per child in today's dollars to fund college education costs as a result of the $500-per-child tax credit. This would cover the full tuition costs at a typical public university today.
<p>
<li> An average student could save more than $414 over the life of a 10-year student loan as a result of lower interest rates.
</ul><p>
Economists at The Heritage Foundation conducted an interim econometric analysis of the congressional balanced budget plan using the economic model developed by Laurence H. Meyer & Associates, a nationally recognized economic consulting firm.<sup>1</sup>  The Meyer model is used by many major public agencies and private firms, such as the President's Council of Economic Advisers, the Office of Management and Budget, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, and the Congressional Budget Office.<sup>2</sup><p><b>INCREASED FAMILY SAVINGS FROM $500-PER-CHILD TAX CREDIT</b><p>The high cost of a college education prices many families out of the higher education market or forces students and parents to incur large amounts of debt to cover the costs of college.<p>The $500-per-child tax credit included in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 would benefit more than 28 million families raising some 51 million children and could allow many families to save enough money to send their children to college. A family that chooses to dedicate the entire $500-per-child tax credit to savings for higher education would accumulate about $14,066 in today's dollars over 18 years for each child's education. Thus, a family with two children would be able to save an additional $28,132 for college expenses. In today's dollars, an additional $14,066 per child in family savings for education amounts to:
<p><ul>
<li> Five full years' tuition and fees at an average public university; 
<p>
<li> One full year's tuition and fees at an average private university; or
<p>
<li> More than the difference between the four-year cost of an average public university and the two-year cost of an average public community college.
</ul>
<p>
<b>LOWER STUDENT LOAN INTEREST RATES</b>
<p>
The economic simulation conducted by analysts at The Heritage Foundation indicates that households and businesses would face lower interest rates under the congressional balanced budget and tax cut plan than under current budget and tax policy. Lower interest rates also would benefit students with student loans. A student beginning his or her education in 1996 would face interest rates that averaged half a percentage point below what is expected under current law:  a savings of $414 over the life of an average ten-year student loan.<sup>3</sup>  More young Americans will be able to afford a college education as a result of these savings. In addition, some students who otherwise would have to defer their education plans could enter college earlier, thus increasing their lifetime earnings.
<p>
Alternatively, lower interest rates would allow students to borrow more money for education at the same effective cost. In essence, students would be able to purchase more education for the same price. The additional $414 might be used for such things as:
<p>
<ul>
<li> One full year of books and supplies;

<li> Two additional courses at an average public university; or

<li> About one-third the cost of a personal computer. 
</ul><p>

<b>TECHNICAL ASSUMPTIONS</b>
<p>
For assumptions that underlie the econometric simulation of the congressional balanced budget legislation, see William W. Beach and John S. Barry, "What a Balanced Federal Budget with Tax Cuts Would Mean to the Economy," Heritage Foundation <i>F.Y.I.</i> No. 69, November 14, 1995.
<p>
For purposes of calculating the amount of savings from a $500-per-child tax credit, it was assumed that the money was placed in a super-IRA (as defined by the Congressional Budget Resolution of 1995) earning a real rate of return of 5 percent per year.
<p>
The initial rate of interest charged for a student loan was assumed to be 8.25 percent. The 0.5 percent figure is an average decrease below baseline for the life of a ten-year student loan. This 0.5 percent decrease was projected in the above-cited econometric simulation.

<p>
<li>Laurence H. Meyer & Associates long has earned top honors for forecasting accuracy when compared against similar firms. In 1993, it won the "Blue Chip" forecasting award for the years 1989-1992. Laurence H. Meyer & Associates was ineligible for the award in 1994, but again was rated the most accurate forecasting firm in the United States.
<p>
<li>This is based on a student loan of $13,044, the average cost of a public university, at an initial interest rate of 8.25 percent. The Heritage Foundation econometric analysis assumes that the Federal Reserve System makes no change in the reserve requirements of its member banks and refrains from stimulating the economy by increasing the growth of monetary reserves. This assumption means a relatively smaller decrease in interest rates. Thus, the 0.5 percent decrease can be viewed as a conservative estimate of the potential savings to a student from lower interest rates.

<title>Who Will Benefit From Cuts in Capital Gains Taxes -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>
<h3><i>BALANCED BUDGET TALKING POINTS #2:
WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM CUTS IN CAPITAL GAINS TAXES?</i></h3>

<a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William W. Beach</a><br>
Visiting Fellow in Tax Analysis<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 76<br>
December 4, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>

The Balanced Budget Act of 1995 contains important changes in capital gains tax policy. Specifically, the bill lowers the effective tax rate by 50 percent for individual tax filers through a deduction for half of net taxable gain. Thus, an individual in the 28 percent tax bracket would see his effective tax rate on gains drop to 14 percent. For corporations, the bill decreases the capital gains tax rate from a maximum of 35 percent to 28 percent. Both changes are effective after December 31, 1994.<sup>1</sup><p>Proponents of these tax policy changes argue that lower capital gains tax rates will stimulate economic growth, improve the fairness of the tax code, and increase federal revenue from the capital gains tax by encouraging individuals to "unlock" gains that they have been unwilling to realize at the currently high tax rate. Critics of these changes argue that lower effective tax rates on capital gains disproportionately benefit wealthy Americans, thus rendering the federal tax system more unfair. The critics also suggest that the "economic stimulus" produced by the reduction in rates will improve principally the fortunes of the owners of capital, not the incomes of other Americans.<sup>2</sup> <p>The work of most economists who have analyzed capital gains taxes and publicly available government data on who pays these taxes all indicate that the proponents are right and the critics are wrong. There are three major reasons why adopting capital gains tax changes as defined in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 will benefit nearly every American.
<p>
<B>First</B>, the benefits of cutting capital gains taxes go mostly to lower and middle income taxpayers rather than to the wealthy. When critics claim that capital gains go mainly to the wealthy, they mislead the public by including the gain when citing a person's income. In this way, a retiree living on a $12,000 Social Security check who realizes a $30,000 capital gain one year on the sale of his house is classified as a "person with a $42,000 income who receives a capital gain." 
<p>
Contrary to what opponents suggest about who will benefit from these tax cuts, the typical household declaring a capital gain had income from sources <i>other than capital gains</i> of $58,729 in 1991.<sup>3</sup>  The typical capital gain for this household was $973. About 11 percent of all taxpaying households declared a capital gain in 1991.
<p>
About 19 percent of taxpaying households with capital gains in 1991 contained more than one child. These households had an average income of $87,448 and an average capital gain of $1,178. 
<p>
Another 27 percent of taxpaying households with capital gains contained taxpayers over the age of 65 or blind. These taxpayers had an average income of $43,637 and an average capital gain of $2,151. It is particularly important that households containing children and elderly taxpayers be able to liquidate appreciated assets and realize as much after-tax income as possible if they are to pay for increasingly expensive educational and medical services.
<p>
As Table 1 shows, half of all capital gains were earned by households with incomes from other sources under $100,000, which also accounted for 52 percent of all non-capital gain income. 
<p>
<B>Second</B>, economists who have analyzed the economic effects of balancing the federal budget while simultaneously cutting taxes (including the capital gains tax) have all concluded that these policy changes result in widespread economic benefits through a stronger, more productive economy. One of the nation's most independent and celebrated models of the U.S. economy, the University of Michigan's Quarterly Model, found that balancing the budget with tax cuts produced immediate reductions in interest rates and inflation and higher long-term economic activity.<sup>4</sup>  Each of this country's leading private economic consulting firms (DRI/McGraw-Hill, Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates, and Laurence H. Meyer & Associates) recently predicted that balancing the budget with these tax cuts would lead to a much stronger economy with higher wages and more spendable household income.<sup>5</sup><p>The Heritage Foundation recently used the U.S. Macroeconomic Model developed and maintained by Laurence H. Meyer & Associates to determine the economic impact of the balanced budget plan.<sup>6</sup>  While this analysis found that the entire package of budget and tax cuts should result in generally higher economic activity, it also found that most of the economic benefits of the balanced budget plan disappear without cuts in capital gains taxes.
<p>
A Heritage simulation of the U.S. Macroeconomic Model that contained all of the spending and tax cuts for the period 1996 through 2002, except those for capital gains taxes, would result in consistently lower Gross Domestic Product in each of these seven years when compared with a simulation that included cuts in capital gains taxes. A little more than $80.2 billion in potential GDP is lost over seven years without capital gains tax relief.
<p>
According to the same simulation, in addition to lower GDP, the absence of cuts in capital gains taxes would lead to higher unemployment rates and slower household income growth. 
<p>
Critics of the bill should note that without the stimulus to new business activity provided by the capital gains tax cut, the other changes in tax policy are simply not great enough to offset the economic effects of reductions in the rate of government spending leading to a balanced federal budget.
<p>
<B>Third</B>, reducing the tax rate for capital gains actually would increase tax revenues from taxpayers who own most of the appreciated assets. Experience over the last 25 years with changes in capital gains tax rates strongly indicates that rate decreases produce more declarations of capital gains and more capital gains taxes. Owners of appreciated assets who face high tax rates generally hold on to their assets in anticipation of lower future rates. When the rates come down, the amount of capital gains goes up.
<p>
Economists estimate that trillions of dollars in unrealized capital gains (perhaps has high as $7.5 trillion) exist in the portfolios of American taxpayers.<sup>7</sup>  Some economists have estimated that significant capital gains rate changes could produce substantial economic benefits and create revenue windfalls for federal and state governments. Many politicians agree. In an article last year for the <i>American Economic Review</i>, Leonard Burman and William Randolph, the two leading tax economists on the staff of the Congressional Budget Office, estimated the response of taxpayers to rate reductions as being on the order of 6 to 1. That is, for every one percent drop in the rate, capital gains realizations would rise by 6 percent.<sup>8</sup><p>Who would pay most of the additional capital gains taxes?  As Table 1 shows, these new government revenues would come principally from taxpayers with incomes above $200,000. If, indeed, the federal government wants to draw more tax revenue from wealthy Americans, lowering the capital gains tax rate is one of the most effective ways possible to attain this objective.
<P>

<b>Technical Assumptions</b>
<p>
The data about average incomes and capital gains declarations contained in this paper come from the IRS's Public Use File for 1991. This file contains about 115,000 composite tax returns that the IRS has constructed to reflect all 114 million returns filed in 1991. When these returns are multiplied by their statistical weights, the resulting number equals the total national number for a particular tax variable, e.g. capital gains declarations.
<p>
The income numbers contained in this paper were constructed by subtracting all capital gains declarations from adjusted gross income. What remains as income after this subtraction are such things as wages, interest and dividend payments, proprietorship and partnership income, and tax refunds from the previous tax year.

<a href="fyi69c2.gif">Chart 2</a>: Additional Non-Residential Fixed Investment From A Balanced Budget<br><p>


Congress's balanced budget plan with tax cuts will lead over the next seven years to greater business investment, higher earnings per hour, and faster economic growth than under current law. The following are the findings of an analysis by <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a> using one of the principal econometric models of the U.S. economy. According to the model, the balanced budget plan with tax relief would mean:
<p><ul>
<li>An additional $32.1 billion in real disposable income over the period 1995 through 2002.
<p>
<li>An additional $66.2 billion in consumption expenditures over the period 1995 through 2002.
<p>
<li>An additional $88.2 billion in real non-residential fixed investment over the period 1995 through 2002. 
<p>
<li>An additional 103,700 housing starts over the period 1995 through 2002.
<p></ul>
The analysis is important because many critics of the budget plan have expressed the concern that slowing the growth of federal spending to balance the budget in seven years will cause an economic downturn, if not a recession. Many supporters of the plan, on the other hand, claim that a balanced budget will reduce interest rates and spur productive, private-sector investment and economic activity. The Heritage analysis indicates the supporters are correct.
<p>
Economists at The Heritage Foundation conducted an interim econometric analysis of the plan using the econometric model developed by Laurence H. Meyer & Associates. The analysis is based on the Congressional Budget Resolution, as passed by Congress in May, which forms the overall structure of budget legislation now moving through Congress, and the Senate Finance Committee's description of tax policy changes.1  The Meyer model was used to gauge the general effects that key components of the budget would have on the economy. The Heritage Foundation's simulation of the budget plan strongly indicates that the general trend of economic activity will improve significantly during the "glide path" to a balanced budget as compared with a baseline of continued deficits under current law.

Laurence H. Meyer & Associates is a nationally recognized economic consulting firm. The Meyer model is used by many major public agencies and private firms. Among them:  the President's Council of Economic Advisers, the Office of Management and Budget, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the Congressional Budget Office, the National Association of Realtors, the National Association of Home Builders, and the Ford Motor Company.2 
<p>

<b>The Baseline Projection</b>
<p>
Heritage used projections of economic activity under current budget and tax policy prepared by Laurence H. Meyer & Associates as the economic baseline against which the Congress's budget and tax plan is compared. This baseline forecast (dated August 1995) projects that under current law the federal deficit continuously worsens during the projection period, from a fiscal year 1995 level of $162.1 billion to a fiscal year 2002 level of $257.4 billion. According to the baseline forecast and projection, the average annual growth in inflation-adjusted gross domestic product associated with these continuing deficits is 2.48 percent.3
<p>

<b>The Balanced Budget Simulation</b>
<p>
To conduct the simulation of the congressional budget plan, Heritage economists adjusted only those elements of the Meyer baseline that deal with federal spending and federal tax policy. The spending levels embodied in the Congressional Balanced Budget Resolution were introduced into the model in such a way that the resulting simulation mirrored the priorities defined in the resolution. For instance, the growth rates for both Medicare transfers and Medicaid grants were limited to levels called for within the budget resolution. Similarly, welfare spending was limited to a growth rate of 3.5 percent per year after 1997. Increases in national defense spending were applied primarily to Department of Defense procurement programs. And spending decreases in government purchases and transfer payments were assumed until a balanced budget was reached in 2002.4
<p>
With respect to changes in tax policy, the model was adjusted to reflect the new average tax rates that individuals and businesses would face if Congress enacted the changes in tax deductions and allowances defined by the Senate Finance Committee in the Chairman's Mark of October 16, 1995. Heritage calculated the changes in average effective federal tax rates that would result from adoption of family tax relief and various changes in the tax treatment of IRAs, health care costs, and estate taxes. These tax policy changes were used to adjust the model's average rate for individuals. Also incorporated were proposed changes in the taxation of individual and corporate capital gains, principally the exclusion of 50 percent of capital gains for individuals, the capping of the corporate tax rate on capital gains at 28 percent, and other major tax policy changes in the Chairman's Mark that would affect businesses.5
<p>
<a href="fyi69t1.gif">Table 1</a> indicates how balancing the federal budget in seven years while cutting taxes would affect the U.S. economy. Critics of balancing the budget and simultaneously cutting taxes argue that these changes will send the economy into a recession. As <a href="fyi69t1.gif">Table 1</a> shows, the simulation not only results in no such recession, but indicates that the economy would generally grow slightly faster with the proposed budget and tax changes than without them. Over the seven-year forecast horizon, inflation-adjusted gross domestic product grows by $10.8 billion more with these public policy changes than without them, and at no time during this period does the economy become recessionary (see <a href="fyi69c1.gif">Chart 1</a>).
<p>
There appear to be three principal forces behind this growth in economic activity.
<p>
<b>First, the tax cuts add $32.1 billion above baseline to real household disposable income during the period 1995-2002. </b>
<p>
This growth in the real purchasing power of average Americans explains the higher levels of consumption expenditures under the policy of a balanced budget with tax cuts than under the baseline of continuing deficits and high taxes.
<p>
Total real consumption expenditures are above baseline every year after 1996.
<p>
<b>Second, balancing the budget and cutting taxes leads to greater investment in plant and equipment that, in turn, leads to higher levels of productivity (see <a href="fyi69c2.gif">Chart 2</a>). </b>
<p>
The simulation indicates that households and businesses will face lower interest rates under the balanced budget and tax cut plan than under current budget and tax policy.
<p>
For example, the federal funds rate would fall from 5.8 percent in 1995 to 4.1 percent by 2002 in the simulation, which is 0.5 percentage points lower than the baseline. 
<p>
10-year and 30-year government notes would have significantly lower yields by 2002 than in the baseline of continued deficits. 
<p>
The contract rate for first-time mortgages would drop faster under a balanced budget with tax cuts than in the baseline, to 6.1 percent in 2002 rather than 6.5 percent. This means that the budget and tax plan will save a home borrower of $100,000 about $10,000 over the life of a 30-year mortgage.
<p>
All of these downward interest rate movements when combined with lower taxes support higher growth in household and business purchases of durable goods, homes, and factories.
<p>
Total housing starts would be 2.1 percent higher than in the baseline by 2002, according to the simulation.
<p>
Investment in business machinery would be 2.7 percent higher than in the baseline, with the computers component of business durable equipment outgrowing the baseline by 2.3 percent and all other equipment purchases ending 2.9 percent higher in 2002 than in the baseline.
<p>
The increase in capital investment denotes a movement in savings from cash-based accounts to capital-based assets. In other words, households and businesses are increasing their purchases of more productive and longer-term investments. These investments would have several positive effects. In particular: 
<p>
Real compensation per hour for workers would increase faster (and be the same or higher in every year) than the baseline, and industrial production for businesses would be higher. 
<p>
The simulation shows slightly slower growth in GDP than the baseline in 1996. This temporary slower growth is due to reduced federal government purchases. However, the shift in savings from cash-based accounts to capital-based assets generally supports greater economic growth after 1996. The continued purchases of durable goods and equipment by households and businesses more than offsets reductions in government spending.
<p>
<b>Third, the reduction of federal government spending in the private economy leads not only to a stronger macroeconomy, but to one with less inflation.</b>
<p>
Both the Consumer Price Index and the Producer Price Index would grow more slowly with a balanced budget plan and tax cuts than without them. For example:
<p>
The average growth in the CPI, according to the simulation, would be 1.94 percent per year, while the baseline forecast projects an annual average growth rate of 2.29 percent. 
<p>
It should be noted that the simulation also shows a slightly higher unemployment rate than the baseline in each year after 1995. This slight growth in projected unemployment stems from two factors, one of them a normal feature of economic change and the other based on an assumption about monetary policy.
<p>
First, the reduction in government spending would mean layoffs in the public sector and in firms supplying goods and services to the government. Second, the simulation performed by Heritage assumes that the Federal Reserve System makes no change in the reserve requirements of its member banks and refrains from stimulating the economy by increasing the growth of monetary reserves. This assumption means relatively lower levels of growth in consumption expenditures and employment when compared with a simulation, also performed by Heritage and using the Meyer model, that assumes the Federal Reserve reacts to the slowdown in government spending by easing constraints on banks. It is worth noting that this second simulation (where the Fed stimulates short-term economic activity by expanding the supplies of money and credit) yields unemployment rates that are the same or better than the baseline. The unemployment numbers shown are a worst-case scenario when compared to model simulations which assume a reaction by the central bank.
<p>
This interim analysis of Congress's budget and tax plan may surprise both its supporters and its critics. On the one hand, supporters may have expected the economy to respond to a balanced budget with tax cuts more immediately than the analysis shows. But the plan's supporters should take note that, while these changes over the seven-year forecast period are significant, the major impact of these policy changes occurs not immediately, but steadily -- over the period in which the budget is balanced and thereafter. Further, the tax changes, while significant, are only a small adjustment in today's code. Congress would need to enact major reforms of the code to spur the level of capital formation and growth that proponents of, say, a flat tax predict. If Congress were to make pro-growth reforms in federal tax policy (such as enacting a flat tax), the future pattern of the economy likely would improve much more than it would as the result of the relatively modest tax changes now being considered. 
<p>
Critics of the balanced budget plan, on the other hand, should recognize that the plan generally supports their objective of economic growth at lower interest rates and lower inflation.
<p>
<b>Technical Notes</b>
<p>
The following policy assumptions were accounted for:
<ul><p>
<li>Military spending--90% of the spending increases over the next seven years was applied to the procurement account. The other 10% was applied to Department of Defense civilian employment increases. Zero percent real growth was assumed in 2003 and 2004.
<p>
<li>Agriculture--The $13.4 billion savings from decreased agriculture subsidies called for in the budget resolution was spread over seven years in the following distribution:  1996 ($0.6), 1997 ($1), 1998 ($1.6), 1999 and 2000 ($2), 2001 ($2.6), 2002 ($3.6). A reduction of $3.6 billion was assumed in 2003 and 2004.
<p>
<li>Medicare--Reductions in the rate of growth for Medicare follow those in the budget resolution. A growth rate of 7.63 percent was assumed for 2003 and 2004.
<p>
<li>Welfare--Cash aid welfare spending growth rates were capped at 3.5 percent.
<p>
<li>Foreign aid--Transfer payments to foreigners were decreased according to the reductions called for in the budget resolution for account number 150 (international affairs).
<p>
<li>Medicaid--The growth rate in Medicaid was held to the levels called for in the budget reconciliation:  7.2 percent in 1996, 6.8 in 1997, and 4 percent thereafter.
<p>
<li>Civilian and military compensation per person was held constant after 1998.
<p>
<li>Non-defense federal civilian employment was decreased by 20 percent, spread evenly between 1996 and 2000. 
<p>
<li>All other spending-- for government purchases and transfer payments -- was reduced in the same proportion called for in the budget resolution until balance was reached in 2002.
<p>
<li>Capital gains taxes--A 50 percent exemption of capital gains was assumed for taxation purposes through 2004.
<p>
<li>Family tax relief--Federal receipts from individual income taxes were reduced according to the yearly levels in the Joint Tax Committee's score of the Senate's tax package.
</ul><p>
Other provisions of the Senate tax relief package were accounted for by changing the effective tax rates on wages, dividends, and individuals.

<p>
Using a generally accepted and widely regarded model of the U.S. economy, we found that balancing the federal budget between 1996 and 2002 while cutting taxes caused the economy generally to grow more than not balancing the budget and cutting taxes.
<p>
<i>Specifically, according to the simulation, the balanced budget plan with tax relief would mean:</i>
<p><ul>
<li>Gross Domestic Product grows by $10.8 billion more than under current law in the year 2002.
<p>
<li>An additional $32.1 billion in real disposable income over the period 1995 through 2002.
<p>
<li>An additional $66.2 billion in consumption expenditures over the period 1995 though 2002.
<p>
<li>An additional $88.2 billion in real non-residential fixed investment over the period 1995 through 2002.
<p>
<li>A decrease of 0.4 percent in the conventional mortgage rate.  This means that a balanced budget with tax relief would save a home borrower of $100,000 about $10,000 over the life of a 30-year mortgage.
<P>
<li>The additional construction of 104,000 new family homes over the next seven years.
<p>
<li>The additional sales of 600,000 automobiles over the next seven years worth $10 billion.
<p>
<li>A decrease of 0.7 percent in the growth rate of the Consumer Price Index.
<p></ul>
	The Heritage Foundation used the U.S. economic model developed by Laurence H. Meyer & Associates, a nationally recognized economic consulting company, to reach these conclusions. Laurence H. Meyer & Associates are consultants to many government agencies including the Office of Management & Budget, the Federal Reserve Board, the Department of Labor, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Council of Economic Advisors.
<p>
	Heritage made no changes to the Meyer model except to reset federal spending levels to mirror those contained in the Congressional Budget Resolution of May and to reduce tax rates that capture tax policy changes defined by the Senate Finance Committee.  We explicitly continued the assumption of the Meyer model that the Federal Reserve would not act to stimulate the economy in the face of slower than expected growth.  Had we allowed the model to use the assumption of a more active Federal Reserve, all of the numbers reported below would have been significantly higher.
<p>
Specifically, we assumed:
<p><ul>
<li>Reductions in the rate of growth for Medicare and Medicaid follow those in the budget resolution.
<p>
<li>Cash aid welfare spending growth rates were capped at 3.5 percent.
<P>
<li>Increases in national defense spending were applied primarily to Department of Defense procurement programs.
<p>
<li>All other spending -- for government purchases and transfer payments -- was reduced in the same proportion called for in the budget resolution until balance was reached in 2002.
<p>
<li>A 50 percent exemption of capital gains was assumed through 2004.
<p>
<li>Family tax relief and other provisions of the Senate tax package were accounted for by changing the effective tax rates on wages, dividends, and individuals.

<title>How Congress's $245 Billion Tax Cut Repeals Just One-Third of '90 and '93 Tax Hikes -- Heritage</title>

<b>"I think I raised [your taxes] too much, too."</b><p>
<blockquote>		--President Clinton, October 17, 1995</blockquote>
<p>
<a href="tax-cut2.gif">Chart 1: Tax Cut Only One-Third of Combined 1990 and 1993 Tax Increases</a><br>
<a href="tax-cut1.gif">Chart 2: Government Will Still Get Too Much Revenue After Tax Cut</a><br>
<p>
President Clinton claims that the $245 billion seven-year tax cut supported by Congress is excessive. But it actually does not come close to eliminating the huge tax increase levied by the last Congress and is dwarfed by the level of tax hikes approved since Ronald Reagan left office. (See <a href="tax-cut2.gif">Chart 1</a>) Consider:
<p><ul>
<li> The increased tax burden caused by the 1990 and 1993 tax bills totals three times more than this year's proposed tax cut. Taxpayers will still be worse off compared with their tax burden in 1989. <p>

<li> This year's tax cut will reduce federal tax collections by less than 2.2 cents on the dollar. And that is the "worst-case" estimate that assumes no revenue feedback from higher growth stimulated by such things as the proposed capital gains tax cut.
<p>
<li> Even with the tax cut, tax revenues are projected to rise from $1.357 trillion this year to $1.820 trillion in 2002, an increase of $463 billion (an average of $66 billion per year).
</ul><p>
	By any objective measure, the Administration's claim that the tax cut is too big cannot be justified. Set in proper context, these figures instead make a persuasive case that this year's tax cut should be considered a first step. Indeed, when lawmakers next year begin considering a flat tax, they should take whatever steps are needed -- including further limits on the growth of federal spending -- to ensure that tax reform is accompanied by tax reduction.
<p>
	<b>Undoing Damage from 1990 and 1993 Tax Hikes.</b> According to Congressional Budget Office figures, the 1990 tax increase was projected to increase revenues by 0.54 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). The 1993 tax hike, America's biggest, was projected to raise revenues by a further 0.73 percent of GDP. The tax cut now being discussed, by contrast, is estimated to reduce tax collections by a scant 0.4 percent of GDP. Thus, CBO projections suggest that this comparatively modest tax cut at best will reverse only one-third of the damage inflicted by higher taxes in 1990 and 1993.<P>

	<b>No Revenue Shortfall.</b> As <a href="tax-cut1.gif">Chart 2</a> illustrates, the CBO projects that federal tax collections will expand by more than $460 billion if the tax cuts are enacted. These estimates, incidentally, assume that there is no positive effect on the economy from lowering the tax burden. Needless to say, several measures in the proposal, such as reductions in the tax on capital gains, expansion of Individual Retirement Accounts, and partial relief for those subject to the alternative minimum tax, will boost incentives to save and invest and therefore trigger higher wages for American workers. This increase in taxable income will offset some of the projected $245 billion tax cut.
<p>
	Even with the implausible assumption that the economy receives no benefit from lower taxes, the proposed tax cut will have only a tiny effect on revenues. Tax revenues still are projected by the CBO to rise by an average of $66 billion annually between 1995 and 2002. And of the $11.373 trillion in tax revenue the government is projected to collect over that period, the $245 billion tax cut will reduce that amount by less than 2.2 cents for every dollar.
<P>
	<b>The High-Tax Approach Has Failed.</b> The White House claims that lower taxes will be counterproductive. Before criticizing tax cuts, however, the Administration would be well advised to see how the redistributionist goal of higher taxes has backfired.
Tax rates on the "rich" were raised in 1990 and 1993. The result:  As opponents warned, upper-income taxpayers reduced the amount of income they reported.
<P><ul>
<li> The higher taxes from the "rich" from increased income tax rates in 1990 and 1993 were supposed to help boost total income taxes as a proportion of GDP. The result:  Income tax collections actually have fallen from 8.6 percent of GDP in 1989 to 8.2 percent of GDP in 1994.
<p>
<li> Revenues grew by an average of 6.6 percent annually in the "tax-cutting" Reagan years, a rate of growth one-fourth higher than the 5.3 percent annual revenue increases under Presidents Bush and Clinton.
<p>
<li> The budget deficit was less than $155 billion in 1989 and was projected by the Congressional Budget Office in January 1989 to fall every year into the future if Reagan's policies were left untouched. Lawmakers instead imposed large tax hikes in 1990 and 1993. The result:  The deficit this year is $161 billion and now projected by the CBO to rise in future years.
<p>
<li> The tax increases in 1990 and 1993 were intended to spur the economy. The result:  A recession in 1990-1991 was followed by recovery and expansion well below historical averages for job creation and economic growth.
</ul><p>
	In the last five years, taxpayers have been burdened by two major tax increases. These tax hikes have failed to achieve their economic and income redistribution objectives. The result has been lackluster economic growth and persistent budget deficits. To help reverse this failed approach, Congress is preparing what is, in reality, a modest tax cut. The tax relief is only a fraction of the 1990 and 1993 tax increases, and taxpayers will see their tax bills decline by less than 2.2 percent compared to current law. But the proposed changes are at least a welcome step in the right direction of a tax code that would stimulate the economy.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
Later this month, members of the House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee will begin filling in the details of the $245 billion package of tax relief approved in the FY 1996 budget resolution. In addition to finding the savings needed to balance the federal budget by fiscal 2002, the budget resolution requires an additional $75 billion in savings, which combined with the estimated $170 billion "fiscal dividend" produced by the balanced budget plan, is sufficient to finance a substantial package of tax relief to help families with children and to stimulate economic growth.
<p>
Congress must now determine how to allocate a limited pool of $245 billion in tax relief. The committees should begin this process by using the $354 billion House plan as a menu from which to craft a tax relief package. Because the House plan contains roughly $110 billion more tax relief than is now available under the conference agreement, the committees must use some criteria for narrowing their choices. While each of the tax relief proposals in the House-passed plan addresses particular inequities in the tax code or specific weaknesses in the economy, some of the proposals have additional qualities that should make them top priorities for inclusion in the final package.
<p>
The cornerstones of the House-passed plan, which also should form the cornerstones of the new tax relief package, are:
<p>
<ul>
<li>$500 per child tax credit, 

<li>Reduction of the capital gains tax, and 

<li>An IRA-Plus plan. 
</ul><p>
These tax relief proposals have been the core of the House plan because they provide direct tax relief to American families and they would do most to spur economic growth. The other tax cuts in the House plan are far more targeted in their impact on various taxpayers or far more limited in their impact on the economy. To be sure, these other tax cuts are important, but their inclusion in the final tax cut package will rest on the relative merits of each proposal. 
<p>
In the final analysis, however, the answer involves an important and fundamental decision by Congress about who should control spending -- the government or taxpayers. That is why both tax and spending reductions are needed to effectively move control of spending out of Washington and into the hands of ordinary citizens. By including tax relief in this year's budget, Congress is allowing American taxpayers, rather than the government, to keep and spend more of the money they earn.
<p>
<b>Relief for Families.</b> Most important, American families must share in the savings from reduced government spending. Families also are more likely to support such reductions, for example, if they know they can keep $500 for each dependent child. This is especially true as Congress is considering substantial reforms in welfare. For working families earning between $17,000 and $24,000 per year, the $500 per child tax credit (giving a family of four a $1,000 tax cut) will eliminate their entire income tax burden. Indeed, these families would need less government assistance if they did not have to send so much of the money they earn to Washington in taxes. 
<p>
These overtaxed families can also be turned into a powerful constituency for smaller government if Congress directly links the benefits of balancing the budget to family tax relief. The families of 52 million children, or 35 million working families, would be eligible for the $500 per child tax credit. Taking money away from wasteful government programs and placing it in the pockets of working families gives these taxpayers a stake in the budget process and the incentive to stand up to the advocates of big government.
<p>
Overall, the House-passed plan is very "family-friendly," since some 65 percent of all tax relief will go to families or seniors. About 35 percent of the tax relief will benefit the business or investment communities, contributing to economic growth through job creation. Some of the tax relief targeted to "business," such as reductions in estate and gift taxes, also will benefit owners of family businesses and farms. As they craft a new tax relief plan, the House and Senate committees would be wise to maintain the "family-friendly" nature of the House plan by keeping the relative ratio of tax relief targeted to families and to economic growth and businesses.
<p>
Other tax relief proposals contained in the House-passed plan would improve the fairness of the tax system for senior citizens and businesses, too. For instance, seniors will be more likely to accept Medicare reforms if they no longer have to pay today's surtax on their Social Security benefits; and businesses will be more likely to accept losses in corporate welfare programs if they know the tax code will not punish them for capital investments and risk-taking.
<p>
<b>Relieving the Pressure on Spending.</b> Members should also keep in mind that certain tax relief can change the behavior of some taxpaying groups in ways that ultimately reduce federal outlays for specific programs. Two examples in the House-passed plan are the tax credits for adoption and the improved tax treatment of long-term health care expenditures. Studies show that in many states, putting one child in foster care can cost taxpayers $10,000 to $30,000 per year. This cost could be reduced substantially to the extent that the adoption credit encourages more families to adopt foster children. Similarly, Medicaid's nursing home costs are exploding as many seniors are "divesting" themselves of their assets in order to become eligible for this taxpayer financed program. These public costs could be substantially reduced by the improved tax treatment of long-term care insurance and out-of-pocket expenses.
<p>
Members of Congress should understand how different elements of tax relief benefit their states. Many Members opposing tax relief choose to look only at the impact of reduced federal spending on their states or districts. They forget that if Washington does not spend the money, families will have more to buy necessities for their children, seniors will have more to pay for their own medical services, and businesses will have more to invest in their workers. While this private spending is not as politically visible as unveiling a new pork-barrel project, it does far more to improve the lives of citizens back home. 
<p>
The <a href="/heritage/">Heritage Foundation</a> has estimated the benefits of some of these tax relief proposals -- in some cases, as much as $10 billion to $20 billion over seven years -- for each state (see Appendix). Taxpayers do not need more government spending or new social programs to improve their well-being. Shifting the resources from Washington bureaucrats to families, seniors, and businesses should be viewed as a prudent way to reduce future government spending and encourage work saving and investment.
<p>
As Members negotiate over how to allocate the $245 billion in agreed-upon tax relief, they must remember the importance of putting families first. Working families have borne the largest burden for the rampant growth of government spending and stand to feel the greatest pinch as the rate of spending declines. Furthermore, family incomes have been declining since 1989 thanks to large tax increases imposed on them in 1990 and 1993.
<p>

<b>FAMILY TAX RELIEF</b>
<p>
	The House-passed balanced budget plan contains a substantial package of "family-friendly" tax cuts, including a $500 per child tax credit, expanded Individual Retirement Accounts, and tax credits for families who adopt and those caring for elderly relatives. Over seven years, these family tax cut provisions total $184 billion, comprising 50 percent of the overall tax cut plan. Families, especially families with children, will benefit more than any other group of taxpayers from cutting more wasteful government spending. 
<p>

<b>#1) $500 per Child Tax Credit</b>
<p>
The centerpiece of the Republican Contract with America and the centerpiece of the House-passed plan is a $500 per child tax credit benefiting 35 million working families raising some 52 million children. Such tax relief for working families is long overdue. In 1948, the average American family with two children paid only 3 percent of its income to the federal government in taxes. Today the same family pays 24.5 percent. The family income lost in taxes over the past 45 years exceeds the annual mortgage payment on the average family home. Giving the typical family of four a $500 per child tax credit is equivalent to giving them one month's mortgage payment.
<p>
The House plan's $500 per child credit is "non-refundable," meaning the total value of the credit may not exceed a family's income tax bill. But it does provide uniform tax relief to all families with up to $200,000 per year in income, thereby reducing a low-income family's tax burden by a much greater proportion than an upper-income family's. 
<p>
Example:  A $500 per child tax credit would eliminate the entire federal income tax liability for families of four earning between $17,000 and $24,000 per year; cut by 50 percent the income tax burden of a family earning $30,000 per year; and cut by 30 percent the income tax burden of a family earning $40,000 per year. Meanwhile, the same credit would reduce the income tax burden of a family earning $100,000 per year by only 6.8 percent and the income tax burden of a family earning $200,000 per year by just 2.6 percent.
<p>
Based on Census Bureau data, Heritage Foundation analysts have calculated that the typical congressional district has some 117,000 children in families eligible for a $500 credit. This means families in the typical district would receive $59 million per year in tax relief. The Appendix shows the amount of family tax relief by state. It is difficult to imagine that any single federal spending project of similar magnitude could benefit as many constituents at the same time. Thus, the political advantages of family tax relief would more than outweigh the political disadvantages of cutting the federal spending needed to pay for it.
<p>

<b>#2) Tax Credit to Reduce the Marriage Penalty</b>
<p>
Under current law, dual-income married couples who file a joint return can end up paying more taxes than two single taxpayers filing individually. The House-passed bill takes a small step toward reducing this "marriage penalty" by giving these working couples a tax credit with a maximum value of $145 per year. The size of this credit would be determined by Treasury Department tax tables comparing the tax liability of a married couple filing jointly with their liability if they filed as unmarried workers. While the size of this tax credit is relatively small, it is a first step toward removing the tax code's bias against marriage and intact families.
<p>

<b>#3) New Individual Retirement Accounts</b>
<p>
Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) reduce the tax bias against savings by deferring taxes on income (up to $2,000 per year) placed into these special accounts. However, this income and the interest generated by these savings are taxed when retirees begin to withdraw their money. 
<p>
The House-passed plan offers another way for taxpayers to avoid punishing taxes on retirement savings by creating a new IRA called the "American Dream Savings Account" ("ADS account"). Contributions to this account would be made from post-tax income, but the interest from such savings would not be taxed upon withdrawal if the contributions remain in the account for at least five years and the retiree has reached age  59<over>1/2</under>. This new form of IRA would give workers the incentive to save taxed income today in order to reap tax savings in retirement. That is why the ADS account is sometimes known as a "back-ended" IRA. 
<p>
Initially, contributions to the new ADS account would be limited to $2,000 per taxpayer per year ($4,000 for a married couple), but this amount would be indexed to the rate of inflation in subsequent years. The plan also allows penalty-free withdrawals for a first-time home purchase or to pay certain educational or medical expenses.
<p>
The House-passed plan also modifies current restrictions on the amount married spouses may contribute jointly to an IRA. Under current law, and subject to certain restrictions on workers with other retirement plans, individuals may place up to $2,000 into an IRA. However, spouses filing jointly are allowed to contribute only a combined $2,250 to their IRA, not $2,000 for each spouse. The new ADS account allows this same couple to contribute $2,000 for each spouse for a full $4,000, even if one spouse is not working. This provision would greatly assist the retirement plans of families in which one parent chose to stay home with the children. This change also would encourage lower-income taxpayers to save more for their retirement and rely less on Social Security.
<p>

<b>#4) Tax Credit for Adoption</b>
<p>
The estimated two million families ready to adopt children face huge expenses during the adoption process, but current tax law does not allow them to deduct adoption costs from their tax bill. The House-passed plan makes a substantial commitment to encouraging adoption by giving adoptive families a tax credit of $5,000 to offset such expenses as adoption fees, court costs, attorneys' fees, and other related expenses. This credit is available in full to families earning up to $60,000 per year and gradually phased out for families earning up to $100,000 per year.
<p>
This credit could go a long way toward encouraging families who want to adopt less fortunate children but are prevented from doing so by the enormous cost. By encouraging more adoptions by solid middle-class families, this credit could lead to a long-term reduction in the cost of taxpayer-supported social service and foster care programs at both the federal and state levels. According to the American Public Welfare Association, close to 500,000 children were in the foster care system in 1992. Studies show that taxpayers pay an average of $10,000 per child per year for foster care programs and as much as $30,000 per child per year for more intensive shelter care programs.<sup>1</sup>  And while many couples want to adopt, they often are discouraged by the initial costs of the adoption process, especially if they have only a modest income. Thus, to the extent that the credit encourages additional parents to adopt, reductions in state and federal outlays to maintain these children in foster care or institutions would offset the revenue cost.

<p>
<b>#5) Tax Credit for Dependent Parents</b>
<p>
	The current tax code provides little relief to families who choose to care for an elderly parent or grandparent. The standard personal exemption of $2,500 is available for these families, but, as with the dependent child exemption, the value of the credit is greater for middle- and upper-income families than for modest-income families in the 15 percent income bracket. For example, while the standard deduction of $2,500 allows a family in the 15 percent bracket to lower their income tax by $375, the same deduction allows a family in the 28 percent bracket to lower their tax by $700.
<p>
The House plan offers additional -- and more equitable -- tax relief to families who care for their parents and grandparents in the form of a uniform $500 tax credit. Such a credit could help many families who prefer to care for their elderly relatives at home but cannot afford the expense. To avoid burdening their children and grandchildren with this expense, many seniors are divesting themselves of their wealth in order to become eligible for the long-term program funded by Medicaid. This program, which pays for nursing home care for seniors, is quickly becoming the fastest growing program in the federal budget. The $500 tax credit could help reduce this cost by encouraging more families to take an active role in caring for their elderly relatives.
<p>

<b>TAX RELIEF FOR SENIORS</b>
<p>
The House budget proposal contains provisions that are especially important to many retired or terminally ill Americans with particular financial needs. It repeals the "elderly surtax" provisions of President Clinton's 1993 tax increase, which imposed a high tax rate on income from savings, investments, and pensions.<sup>2</sup>  In addition, it provides tax incentives for the purchase of private long-term care insurance, allows terminally and chronically ill people to receive insurance benefits before their death without an income tax penalty, and increases the amount individuals between age 65 and 69 may continue to earn from employment without losing their Social Security benefits.

<p>
<b>#6) Repeal of the Tax Increase on Social Security Benefits</b>
<p>
	Over four million retired Americans were shocked to discover a severe penalty in their 1994 federal taxes, imposed by the 1993 tax bill on their income from savings for retirement. The penalty imposed by Section 86 of the Internal Revenue Code creates a higher marginal tax rate for all Americans over age 65 who supplemented their Social Security pensions with personal savings and pensions earned during their working years. Withdrawals from IRA savings accounts are particularly hard hit, and these withdrawals are mandatory after age 701/2. Retired people above that age cannot avoid turning over significant portions of their retirement savings to the tax collectors.
<p>
The House plan gradually repeals the 1993 increase in this tax on savings over a five-year period but does not eliminate it entirely. It cuts the maximum tax to 75 percent in 1996, 65 percent in 1997, 60 percent in 1998, 55 percent in 1999, and 50 percent in 2000 and later years. The complete elimination of this highly complex section of the tax code should be a top priority in Congress, since it is a direct attack on responsible individuals' ability to prepare for retirement by saving. House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) has identified this tax as a priority for repeal:  "punishing people who work and save all their life...is not only morally wrong, it is bad social policy."<sup>3</sup><p>All Social Security recipients must fill out a complicated worksheet just to calculate whether they are subject to the higher tax rate, which adds to the complexity of the tax code for these senior citizens. The tax computation also obscures the higher rates, since the method of figuring whether it is due has been made extremely confusing and depends on how much income anyone receives from savings. For most Social Security recipients, the additional complicated paperwork this April 15 was simply bothersome, because their calculations placed them below an exempt threshold. But the higher rates hit hard those taxpayers with retirement income greater than $25,000 ($32,000 for married taxpayers) from private pensions, withdrawals from an IRA or 401(k) savings plan, and dividends or interest from investments. Although incomes below the exemption are not subject to the higher rates, the tax threshold amounts are not indexed for inflation, so in a few years most if not all retired Americans with income from savings will be penalized.
<p>
The elderly surtax has two brackets. The first increases the taxpayer's marginal rate by 50 percent (for example, from 15 to 22.5 percent); the second, by 85 percent (from 28 to 51.8 percent). The second bracket applies to individuals with incomes above $34,000 and married taxpayers above $44,000. As the table on the following page illustrates, for taxpayers in the top income tax bracket of 39.6 percent, the elderly surtax imposes an effective marginal tax rate of 73 percent on any funds they withdraw from IRA savings. These high rates begin to wipe out mandatory IRA withdrawals at age 701/2.
<p>
The low savings rate for retirement among middle-income Americans in the prime of life is one of the most serious policy concerns in Congress today. Yet the surtax on savings for Social Security recipients, of which many seniors often are unaware until they start withdrawing their IRA savings, makes a mockery of the incentives to save. It is a cruel joke because the tax rates are higher, not lower as most savers were promised. Repealing this vicious surtax on the savings of elderly Americans is not just good social policy. It is the right thing to do.
<p>

<b>#7) Modify the Social Security Earnings Test	</b>
<p>
	Approximately two million Americans over age 65 supplement their Social Security benefits with income earned through part-time jobs. For many elderly people, retirement is out of the question because it would mean economic hardship. They simply have inadequate savings or no private pension benefits. The Social Security law has cut benefits severely for retirees who continue to work and earn more than $11,280. This limitation applies to those between the ages of 65 and 70 and is indexed annually for inflation. Those who earn more lose $1 in Social Security benefits for every $3 of wages earned. The House of Representatives budget proposal would raise the annual earnings limit to $30,000. The increases would be phased in over five years:  from $15,000 in 1996 to $19,000 in 1997; $23,000 in 1998; $27,000 in 1999; and $30,000 in the year 2000. The earnings limit thereafter would be indexed for inflation.
<p>
The earnings limit requires the Social Security Administration (SSA) to recalculate pension benefits and attempt to collect amounts paid to retired people who earned more than the law permits. Retirees must forecast their year's earnings in advance and have their Social Security cut, but if their estimated income is too low, they must fill out application forms to recover their lost benefits. The SSA estimates that 60 percent of all overpayments and 45 percent of all underpayments occur because of the earnings limit. This limit costs over $200 million per year in administrative paperwork, most of which would be saved by expanding the earnings limit as proposed in the House budget resolution.
<p>
In the next few decades, the generation approaching retirement generally will have inadequate savings to enjoy leisure without supplemental earnings. In addition, the lower birthrate in the past two decades will have tightened the labor market, so many elderly workers may find their experience and skills still very much in demand. The U.S. economy will enjoy higher economic growth and semi-retired workers will have a more adequate standard of living with the proposed modification in the Social Security earnings test.
<P>

<b>#8) Provide an Incentive for Private Long-Term Care</b>
<p>
	As the health of elderly Americans improves and more people live to very old age, the financial burden of providing care for this increasingly dependent group has become a challenge for public policy. Increasingly, middle-class Americans discover later in life that despite the prudent decisions they have made to cover their income and health care needs during retirement, they face unanticipated and staggering costs for nursing home care. Many see the savings and other assets assembled during their working lives disappear rapidly when they become chronically sick or frail and need institutional care. One response to this threat has been for elderly Americans to transfer assets to their children so that they can qualify for nursing home assistance under the Medicaid program. States and the federal government are concerned about the rising cost of the long-term portion of Medicaid, partly because of this "gaming" of Medicaid. 
<p>
In an attempt to control future budget outlays for health and welfare benefits, people should be given effective incentives to provide for their own long-term care. The House budget resolution provides several new tax provisions to encourage individuals and employers to provide long-term care insurance. Starting in 1996, long-term care insurance generally would be treated the same as accident and health insurance, and employers would be allowed to provide their employees with tax-free long-term care insurance just as they now often provide medical benefits. Individuals would be allowed to exchange existing life insurance policies or annuity contracts for long-term care policies without incurring any income tax liability. They also would be permitted to withdraw funds from IRAs and other tax-sheltered retirement plans to purchase long-term care insurance.
<p>
Although medical expenses are deductible from federal taxes when they exceed a certain percentage of income, long-term care expenses today generally are not tax-deductible. Under the House budget resolution, eligible long-term care premiums and expenses for qualified long-term care services would be treated the same as other medical expenses, and benefits received under a long-term care insurance policy would be tax-free (up to $200 per day).
<p>
Placing long-term care benefits on the same basis as health care and financing them under tax provisions similar to those for medical insurance makes good sense, especially in view of the growing elderly population. Delaying the incentives to prepare for an easily foreseen future problem would be shortsighted, making more likely even heavier state and federal spending on nursing home care.
<p>

<b>#9) Accelerated Payment of Life Insurance Benefits for the Terminally Ill</b>
<p>
	Under current law, life insurance benefits are not taxed, but insured individuals and their families have no way to obtain benefits prior to death without a severe income tax liability -- even though many insurance companies are willing to offer such "accelerated benefits."  In the case of lingering illness with no prospect of recovery, an elderly person could exhaust all his savings and apply for Medicaid, unable to claim potentially huge life insurance benefits. And if the elderly person no longer has the means to make premium payments, his policies may be allowed to lapse.
<p>
The House budget includes a provision to facilitate the practice by which some insurance providers pay benefits prior to death if the insured person is terminally or chronically ill. Such payments would be excluded from a taxpayer's gross income, just as payments to a surviving beneficiary now are. In addition, similar tax-exempt treatment is allowed for amounts received from the sale or assignment of a life insurance contract to a qualified settlement provider. In these cases, the insured would receive a payment comparable to the value of insurance benefits, and the settlement provider eventually would collect the insurance. As in the case of long-term care benefits, the tax-exempt amount for someone who is chronically but not terminally ill would be subject to the $200 per day exclusion limit.
<p>
The tragedy of terminal illness and the financial burden of chronic illness ought to be sufficient misery for anyone, but the federal tax code adds a degree of bureaucratic hostility. Life insurance is offered with benefits payable under these circumstances, and older policies can be sold or converted to obtain benefits before death. The income tax code should be made more consistent with this humane and increasingly common practice.

<p>
<b>TAX RELIEF TO PROMOTE JOBS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH</b>
<p>
	In addition to family tax relief provisions, the House-passed budget resolution includes a number of reforms designed to reduce the tax burden on savings and investment. Included in this category are:
<p>
<b>#10) Reduction in Capital Gains Tax</b>
<p>
	The U.S. tax code unfairly and unwisely punishes capital investment by taxing investment income more than once:  twice through the corporate and individual income taxes and again by taxing capital gains. The current maximum tax rate on capital gains is 28 percent, and these gains are not indexed to the inflation rate. By contrast, most of America's major economic competitors, such as Japan or Germany, exempt capital gains from taxation entirely or tax them at a greatly reduced rate while often indexing the basis of the gains to inflation.
<p>
The House bill lessens this penalty in two ways. First, it lowers the maximum capital gains rate to slightly below 20 percent. Second, it permits individuals to index the value of assets to ensure that they are not being taxed on purely inflationary gains. This rewards new investment and risk-taking. As the Appendix illustrates, this provision will reduce the tax burden on investment by an estimated $63.2 billion between 1995 and 2002.<sup>4</sup>  It is a positive, albeit limited, step toward the goal of eliminating capital gains taxes.<p><b>#11) Neutral Cost Recovery </b><p>Under current law, businesses must write off capital investments from their tax liability over a number of years. This is different from all other business expenses that can be deducted in the year of purchase, or "fully expensed."  However, the value of a long-term write-off is less than the original cost of the investment because the amounts deducted in later years lose their value.
<p>
The House plan corrects these penalties in the tax code by indexing the depreciation schedules for business investments to inflation and the time value of money. The House bill adjusts depreciation schedules (which determine how fast businesses can deduct the cost of new investments) to protect investors from inflation and otherwise remove biases against investment, particularly for long-term projects. The provision is designed to approximate the ideal tax policy of immediate expensing of capital investment (as found in the flat tax). By correcting this flaw in the tax code, Congress would help encourage businesses to invest more heavily in America's future economic growth.

<p>
<b>#12) Alternative Minimum Tax </b>
<p>
	 The House bill repeals the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax and modifies the individual AMT. These provisions impose some of the heaviest compliance costs and raise limited revenues. Combined with the Neutral Cost Recovery provision, AMT relief would ease the tax burden on American business by about $42 billion over seven years (see Appendix for state totals).
<p>

<b>#13) Expensing for Small Business</b>
<p>
In addition to neutral cost recovery, the House bill increases the amount of investment which can be immediately expensed. Along with other modest reforms, small business will realize $11.4 billion of tax relief (see Appendix for state totals).
<p>
The House tax provisions are a positive first step on the road to pro-growth tax reform. Adoption would boost incentives to save and invest, thereby ensuring faster growth for the economy and higher incomes for American workers.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
The dilemma facing the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee is how to allocate among families, businesses, and seniors the $245 billion in tax relief provided in the fiscal 1996 budget resolution. The priorities established in the $354 billion House-passed tax relief package are the place to start. 	 Family tax relief, capital gains cuts, and expanded IRAs should be the centerpiece of the new package, as they were for the House-passed plan, because of their widespread benefits to taxpayers and the economy. In particular, the $500 per child tax credit will benefit some 35 million working families, more taxpayers than any other measure. Further, the halving of the capital gains tax and the expansion of IRAs will generate more investment and savings than any of the more targeted measures in the House plan. And as Members add other elements to the new plan, they should also keep in mind the impact that certain tax relief proposals may have on federal outlays. Tax relief that returns money to Americans, and gives them an incentive to make provision for such things as nursing home care for their parents or themselves, also can reduce the cost of federal and state programs.

"The flat tax has some serious hurdles to overcome<br> 
before it can go from tax concept to tax code."</i><br>
-- J.D. Foster<br>
</center>
<hr>
<p>
<br>
The flat tax is the vanguard of tax reform, and for good reason. It is  
sound economically and easy to explain. It corrects some long-standing  
problems with the current tax system: complexity, high costs of  
administration and compliance, a depressing effect on the economy, and  
the unfairness of double taxation of income from capital. Its strengths  
have gained the flat tax many ardent fans and have brought it from an  
obscure oddity debated by economists to the forefront of the tax-policy  
debate.   
<p> 	  
Flat-tax advocates are nearly evangelistic in their drive to replace the  
current tax system, often as an integral part of their broader agenda to  
reshape government. They are also often unwilling to acknowledge that,  
despite its strengths, the flat tax also has some weaknesses and some  
serious obstacles to overcome before it can go from tax concept to tax  
code.   
<p>
<center>
<b><a name="Flat Tax">WHAT IS A FLAT TAX?</a></b><br>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
Any tax with a single tax rate could be considered a flat tax. A flat tax on  
labor and business income has been popularized by professors Robert E.  
Hall and Alvin Rabushka of the Hoover Institution. A flat tax on labor  
and business income is also embodied in legislative proposals advanced  
by Congressman Dick Armey, the majority leader in the House of  
Representatives, and Senator Arlen Specter, a presidential contender.  
These flat-tax proposals do not tax income from saving; they are  
therefore a form of consumption tax.  
<p> 	  
One of the great advantages of a flat tax is its neutrality. It taxes all forms  
of income only once and does so at a single rate. It taxes individuals'  
labor income at a single rate after allowing for personal exemptions, and  
it taxes business's net cash flow at the same rate that applies to  
individuals. The flat tax thus gives no relative advantage to any means of  
earning income. It favors neither capital nor labor, neither physical nor  
intellectual capital, neither manufacturing nor real estate. By contrast,  
under current law, the federal government uses the tax code to  
micromanage the economy, distorting the allocation of resources such as   
capital and labor, and thereby diminishing both the level of economic  
activity and the standard of living.  
<p>	  
The flat tax is also vastly simpler than the current system and thus  
virtually transparent to taxpayers -- that is, taxpayers need not become  
lawyers or CPAs to understand the intent and application of the tax  
system. Such transparency is important for individuals and businesses   
making economic decisions, for taxpayers' confidence in the fairness of  
the system, and for assuring taxpayers that the tax code will not become a  
tool of deliberate or accidental oppression by government. Much of the  
distrust bred by the federal tax system derives from a suspicion that it  
conceals traps to snare the unwary taxpayer and torture him with tax  
penalties, interest charges, tax liens, and possibly jail. The flat tax aims to  
be so simple and transparent that taxpayers could shelve their fear of the  
tax man.  
<p>	  
<b>Individuals under a flat tax.</b> Taxable income under a flat tax includes all  
wages and salary, and excludes all capital income such as dividends,  
interest, rental income, and capital gains. In addition, all nonwage forms  
of labor compensation are also excluded, such as employer-provided  
health insurance and subsidized parking. The tax on individuals,  
therefore, is essentially a payroll tax collected at the employee level.  
Most flat-tax proposals also allow the taxpayer to take personal  
exemptions and an additional exemption for each child in the household,  
effectively creating a zero tax rate for low-income filers. Under the   
Armey version of the flat tax, for example, a single filer is allowed a  
$13,100 exemption ($26,200 for married, filing jointly), and the plan  
allows for a $5,300 exemption per dependent. Having calculated taxable  
income net of the personal and child exemptions, a flat tax imposes a  
single tax rate on any remaining taxable income.  
<p>	  
The most striking feature of a flat tax is that it eliminates the special  
deductions, phase-outs, and credits in the federal income tax, ensuring  
that most individuals could calculate their tax liability easily -- hence the  
claims by flat-tax advocates that a tax return could be filed on a postcard.   
(In his plan, Specter retains the two most popular individual deductions,  
the home-mortgage interest and charitable deductions.)  
<p>	  
Simplicity for the individual is indeed one of the flat tax's best selling  
points. It is a point that is often oversold, however. Under the flat tax,  
there are two tax rates -- zero and approximately 20 percent. No doubt a  
reduction in the number of tax rates would make tax planning easier, but  
for most individuals the number of rates is irrelevant to their   
actual tax filing.  
<p>  
The simplification of the calculation of taxable income may also be  
oversold. For the approximately 80 million tax filers who take the  
standard deduction, the difference in tax computation between the flat tax  
and current law is that taxpayers today must add their interest, dividends,   
and capital gains to the tax base. They do not suffer the complexities of  
tax deductions because they opt for the standard deduction. For the  
approximately 32 million itemizers, the flat tax offers a clearly simpler  
system. But taxpayers who itemize do so voluntarily. They itemize   
because it lowers their tax liability. Thus, for itemizing taxpayers, the flat  
tax represents a loss of a preferred option in the way they file their taxes.  
Flat-tax advocates assume that most itemizing taxpayers would happily  
give up their credits and deductions in exchange for a simpler tax system.  
<p>	  
<b>Businesses under a flat tax.</b> The taxation of businesses under a flat tax  
makes even greater strides towards simplicity and neutrality. All  
businesses are treated the same; no distinction is made between  
partnerships, sole proprietorships, corporations, and any other business  
form. There is a single tax rate. And businesses are taxed on their net  
cash flow, not on their net income as under current law, thereby  
eliminating all the complications of attempting to match the timing of  
income and expenses.   
<p>	  
Under a flat tax, a business calculates its net cash flow for the year by  
totaling its receipts from all sources and subtracting all payments made  
to its employees and all payments made to other businesses for such  
things as plant and equipment and inventory. Businesses would deduct  
from income the full cost of their investments at the time of purchase,  
instead of stretching out these expenses according to complicated  
depreciation schedules. Employee fringe benefits would not be  
deductible. Nor would interest payments. The business then calculates its  
tax liability by applying a single tax rate to its net cash flow.  
<p>	  
<b>More than just a tax system.</b> In the current political environment, the flat  
tax is far more than an alternative tax system. The flat tax is also a strong  
political and philosophical statement about the role of tax policy in   
society, as seen most clearly in the strong preference of flat-tax advocates  
for a single tax rate for all taxpayers.   
<p>	  
For decades, the prevailing doctrine of "tax fairness" has dictated a highly  
progressive income-tax system. This means that, as a family's income  
rises, so do its average and marginal tax rates. Under current law,  
progressivity is achieved through a combination of deductions,  
exclusions, phase-outs, and rising tax rates imposed on a comprehensive  
measure of income. For example, in 1994 a married couple with $50,000  
in Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) and two children, taking the standard  
deduction, would pay 10.1 percent in federal income tax, whereas the  
same family with $100,000 in AGI would pay tax at an 18.5 percent rate.  
<p>	  
Under a flat 20 percent tax rate, a family would be subject to a 20 percent  
rate however high its labor income above a certain threshold. Having  
exempted lower-income taxpayers from the tax, many flat-tax advocates  
believe that proportionality, not progressivity, reflects the prevailing   
sense of fairness in America: Taxpayers should pay more tax as their  
incomes rise, but the amount of tax should not increase more than  
proportionally.  
<p>	  
Flat-tax proposals actually include two tax rates -- zero (by virtue of the  
personal exemptions) and about 20 percent. Some critics worry that the  
inclusion of a zero tax rate in the flat tax will maintain a large  
constituency for expanded government. The dangers are apparent in any   
general system of taxation that allows any but the poorest of the poor to  
escape paying at least some tax when they have taxable income. Taxes  
reflect a price we pay for government. Whenever someone escapes  
paying tax to finance government services, the direct cost of those  
services is zero and the amount of services demanded is high. Even a   
minimal tax of a few dollars a month would remind taxpayers                                                                   
that government services are not free.  
<p>	  
Many advocates of the flat tax are using the tax reform debate as a means  
of reshaping the political debate. By directly challenging the doctrine of  
tax progressivity in the federal tax system, they seek to change not only   
established ideas about desired tax burdens, but also the very notion of  
using the state as an instrument of incomes policy. Nor does the challenge  
stop there.   
<p>	  
Armey has included as part of his proposal the elimination of income-tax  
withholding. To many, withholding is simply a convenience whereby  
their employers subtract a certain amount from their paychecks each pay  
period based on an estimate of the total tax due for the year. To Armey  
and others, however, tax withholding disguises the true magnitude of the  
taxpayer's federal individual income-tax liability. By clouding the amount  
paid, they argue, taxpayers object less to the tax burden and to the  
amount of government spending that tax receipts make possible. By  
replacing the withholding mechanism with a monthly payment directly  
from the taxpayer to the Treasury, Armey believes he will bring powerful  
new forces to bear on the size of the tax burden and the size of  
government.

<b><a name="Economic Benefits">ECONOMIC BENEFITS</a></b><br> 

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
Tax reform is a long and difficult process. Even the adoption of an ideal  
tax system creates transition costs for taxpayers, economic dislocation,  
and uncertainty. What benefits would justify these costs?  
<p>	  
<b>Saving, investment, and economic growth.</b> The net national savings rate  
in the U.S. has averaged 2.7 percent per year in the 1990s, less than one  
third the rate of the 1950s and 1960s. The savings rate is a prime  
determinant of the growth of incomes and wealth, so a low savings rate  
obviously does not bode well for future growth in standards of living.   
Certainly one contributing factor to the low savings rate is the high tax  
rate on saving and investment, due in part to the double taxation of  
income from capital. The flat tax would tax income from capital only  
once -- in the form of a tax on business income. Dividends, capital gains,  
interest payments, and other forms of capital income received by  
individuals would not be taxed, because they had already been taxed  
before. The flat tax would thereby reduce the tax burden on saving,  
which means, everything else held constant, that a flat tax would increase  
the rate of private saving.  
<p>	  
The flat tax may also reduce the tax burden on investment by eliminating  
the double taxation of corporate income and allowing businesses to  
deduct in full the cost of their plant and equipment purchases. However,  
the flat tax also appears to increase the overall tax burden of businesses   
(more on this later) so the net effect on investment incentives   
may be muted.   
<p>	  
The purpose of  encouraging saving and investment is, of course, to  
promote faster non-inflationary economic growth, boost real wages, and  
raise the nation's standard of living. At a recent conference sponsored by  
the Hoover Institution, Dale W. Jorgenson of Harvard presented a paper,   
"The Economic Impact of Fundamental Tax Reform," showing that the  
adoption of a consumption tax such as the flat tax would increase the  
discounted value of Americans' future income by about $1.3 trillion.  
<p>	  
Such increases certainly justify considering a change in tax systems.  
Projecting increases in economic activity is risky business, however,  
since the projections always depend on the underlying assumptions. At  
the same conference, Laurence J. Kotlikoff of Boston University  
presented results based on a different type of economic model indicating  
that a switch to a consumption tax would eventually increase real wages  
by 7 percent and GDP per capita by 8 percent. These two studies are  
impressive and, because they are based on different types of models,  
credibly imply that the economy would perform significantly better under  
a flat tax or another consumption tax than it would under the current  
income tax.	  
<p> 
It is important to recognize that accelerated economic growth also means  
accelerated tax collections for federal, state, and local governments.  
While congressional and Treasury Department analysts persist in  
ignoring these additional revenues, policymakers should understand that   
additional economic growth will mean additional tax revenue. Using  
Jorgenson's estimates of economic growth, in present-value terms a flat  
tax could eventually raise well over $200 billion in additional federal  
revenues and $150 billion in additional state and local revenues.  
<p>	  
<b>Compliance and administrative-cost savings.</b> According to an analysis by  
the Tax Foundation, the annual compliance costs associated with the  
federal personal and corporate income taxes are roughly $200 billion.  
These costs result from recordkeeping, tax filing, litigation and appeals,   
and so forth. In addition, the federal government spends almost $14  
billion administering the system, for a total annual cost of well over $800  
per person.   
<p>	  
Most compliance costs are borne by the business sector, and most of  
these costs can be attributed to those areas of the tax code dealing with  
the timing of income and expense, and with the taxation of foreign- 
source income. The flat tax is a tax on cash flow, and so at a stroke it  
eliminates the issue of timing. It also exempts from U.S. tax the foreign-  
source income of U.S. citizens, so it eliminates this compliance cost as  
well. And, at the individual level, most compliance costs arise in relation  
to capital income, which would no longer be taxed, so these costs, too,  
disappear. While every tax system imposes some administrative and   
compliance costs, there is good reason to believe the flat tax eventually  
would dramatically reduce this burden on the taxpayer and on the  
economy.  
<p>	  
<b>Thoughts of lower interest rates.</b> Proponents of the flat tax (and of many  
other tax reform proposals) often suggest that lower (nominal, after-tax)  
interest rates would ensue. If a flat tax raises saving levels as promised,  
the amount of capital available for domestic and foreign investment  
would increase and, if everything else were held constant, this could  
reduce interest rates under certain circumstances. Everything else is not  
held equal, however. 
<p>
The flat tax may also improve investment  
opportunities by reducing the marginal tax burden on capital income.  
Recall that the double taxation of corporate income would cease and   
that businesses could, for example, expense their capital purchases. Thus,  
the domestic demand for new investment in plant and equipment may  
also increase. At this point, we cannot say whether saving would increase  
more or less rapidly than investment. 
<p>
However, as the modern mantra  
runs, we live in a global economy, and no markets are more completely  
integrated than the capital markets. This means that, to the extent   
domestic saving exceeds the demands of the economy for capital, the  
excess saving finds its way overseas in search of more profitable  
investments. And, when domestic saving is insufficient to meet domestic  
investment demands, we import capital from abroad. Thus, whether  
domestic saving increases more rapidly than investment following a flat  
tax, or vice versa, no significant effect on after-tax interest rates should   
be anticipated on this score. 
<p>
Pre-tax interest rates are nevertheless sure to  
decline following a flat tax. Interest rates reflect many factors, including  
expected inflation, a real, after-tax required rate of  return, a degree of  
uncertainty and, possibly, a degree of credit-market tightness. Interest  
rates also reflect the taxes the interest income recipient must pay, which  
explains, for example, why there is a significant difference in the interest   
rates paid to taxable and tax-exempt bond holders. Under a flat tax,  
interest income is tax-exempt, so pre-tax interest rates would fall to about  
what are currently the rates paid on tax-exempt bonds. 
<p>
On the flip side,  
interest expense is not deductible under a flat tax, so there would be no  
net reduction in after-tax interest costs to borrowers and hence little or no  
stimulation of growth from lower interest rates.  
<p>
<center>  
<b><a name="Middle-Class">PROBLEM #1: A MIDDLE-CLASS TAX BURDEN</a></b><br>  

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	  
At the tax rates currently discussed, the flat tax appears to impose a  
higher share of the total federal tax burden on middle-class taxpayers and  
appears to raise their taxes in dollar terms as well. Each of these  
represents an enormous political problem for flat-tax advocates.  
<p>	  
A progressive rate structure means that upper-income taxpayers pay a  
higher proportion of their labor income in taxes than do all other  
taxpayers. A revenue-neutral flat tax would shift some of the tax burden  
on labor income from upper-income taxpayers onto the middle class. This  
shift of tax burden to the middle class is exacerbated by the exclusion   
of capital income from the tax base, which on a per-capita basis is a  
larger fraction of a typical upper-income individual's taxable income than  
that of a middle-income individual. Finally, large personal exemptions  
would remove millions of lower-income individuals from the tax rolls.   
Consequently, the middle class would be forced to bear a greater share  
yet of the total tax burden.  
<p>	  
Flat-tax advocates take the fairness issue head on by advocating only one  
(or two) tax rates. Where the flat tax really attempts to redefine tax  
fairness, however, is in the exclusion of capital income from the tax base.  
Justice and tax neutrality are both served by excluding capital income  
since the capital has already been subject to tax at least once, if not   
many times over. Nevertheless, a clear problem of perceptions must be  
admitted.  
<p>	  
Consider two families. The Joneses have a combined salary of $50,000 in  
wages and salary. Under the Armey plan with a 20 percent tax rate, this  
family of four would owe $3,700 in tax. Now consider the Smiths, who  
in retirement consume every dollar of their $1 million in dividend  
income. Under the flat tax, the Smiths owe no tax at all because capital  
income is excluded from the tax base. This is appropriate, because their  
dividend income was taxed at least once before the Smith family received  
it. But the perception would persist that a wealthy family is paying no tax.  
<p>	  
When capital income, which would not be subject to personal income tax,  
is considered along with wage 
<p>
<center>
<hr width="50%">
<Font Size="2"><b>Less progressive.</b>  One potential criticism of the flat tax is that high-income groups appear to pay a lower percentage of their personal income in taxes than middle-income groups.  This occurs because higher-income groups receive a greater share of their earnings from capital income, which is exempt under the flat tax.  <b>Source:</b>  The Tax Foundation.<br>

<hr width="50%">
</center>
<p>
income, average tax rates for higher- 
income groups are lower than for middle-income groups under the  
individual side of the flat tax (see chart below). And so this may be the  
Achilles' heel of a flat tax: Are the majority of the American people  
willing to define tax fairness entirely in terms of labor income? Can tax  
fairness be defined in such a way that individuals who consume 
significant  
amounts of capital income would be allowed to pay little or no tax? If so,  
then the flat tax has overcome its biggest hurdle. If not, then a flat tax  
solely on labor income probably cannot succeed.   
<p>	  
Flat-tax advocates can overcome this hurdle through careful analysis. As  
we shall soon see, a flat tax will shift the incidence of taxation sharply  
from individuals to business. While individuals will pay no tax on their  
own capital income, the businesses from which they earn capital income   
will pay higher taxes. The crucial point is this: The burden of business  
taxes is ultimately borne not by the entities that pay them but, one way or  
another, by workers (in the form of lower compensation) or by business  
owners (in the form of lower profits), who tend to belong to the higher- 
income group.  
<p>	  
The chart on page 29 shows the average tax paid at different income  
levels under a flat tax when business taxes are imputed to individuals.  
Following procedures adopted by the Congressional Budget Office, the  
Tax Foundation assumes that half of the business tax is ultimately paid by   
business owners and half is paid through reduced labor compensation.  
The imputation of the business tax shows a disproportionate share of the  
business-tax burden falling on upper-income taxpayers.  
<p>	  
The chart shows the distribution of the tax burden when we account for  
both the individual and business taxes under current law, under the  
Armey proposal with a 20 percent rate (which Armey argues reduces  
revenues by $40 billion annually relative to current law), and under a  
revenue-neutral version of the Armey proposal which the Tax   
Foundation calculates would require a 21.1 percent rate. (The lower rate  
claimed by Armey probably arises because his plan, by design, loses  
revenue relative to current law.) As the chart shows, when income is  
measured comprehensively and both labor and business income are taxed,  
the flat tax imposes a remarkably proportional tax burden (once  
individuals earn enough to pay tax).   
<p>	  
Analysis of the likely distribution of the tax burden also reveals some  
disturbing news for flat-tax advocates, however: At the proposed rates,  
the flat tax would impose a tax increase on middle-income taxpayers.  
This obviously creates an enormous political problem for flat-tax  
proponents. Many middle-income voters may object to a significant tax   
increase in exchange for a simpler tax system and the   
promise of a stronger economy. One solution is, of course, to   
cut spending to reduce the tax rate below 17 percent. This is   
Armey's solution. As noted below, however, this is far easier   
said than done.   
<p>
<center> 
<b><a name="Business End">PROBLEM #2:  THE BUSINESS END</a></b><br>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	 
Successful tax reform must always originate in the barber shops and  
bingo parlors outside the Washington Beltway. Without sustained popular  
support, the enormous effort of fundamental reform will fall short. A new  
tax principle, having gained the necessary popular support, must then  
gain the support, or at least the acquiescence, of the bulk of the business  
community. Tax reform that fails employers will fail their employees as  
well.   
<p>	 
The simplicity of the flat tax would eventually benefit the business sector  
by reducing both compliance costs and the uncertainty that a complex tax  
code imposes on business decisions. On the other hand, the business  
sector, at least under the Armey flat tax, appears to bear a much higher  
share of the total federal tax burden. Currently, the business sector bears  
about 31 percent of the burden. Under the Armey flat tax, according to  
Tax Foundation analysis, the business sector would bear about 50 percent  
of the burden, an increase of about two thirds. In other words, under the  
Armey plan about 19 percent of the total tax collection is shifted from  
individuals to businesses. The higher burden on businesses is due to  such  
things as the loss of the deductions for state and local taxes and for  
employee fringe benefits. (Some of this burden would eventually be  
shifted back to individuals, as companies convert fringe benefits into  
labor income on which individuals would have to pay taxes.)  
<p> 	 
It is, of course, true that businesses only collect taxes; individuals  
ultimately bear the tax burden. Nevertheless, business leaders are very  
aware of their average tax rate and the after-tax earnings they report to  
their owners. The business community in the aggregate suffered a hefty  
tax increase as part of the 1986 Tax Reform Act, though much smaller  
than that apparent in the Armey flat tax. Many of today's CEOs and chief  
financial officers were tax directors and tax vice-presidents in 1986, and  
they remember how a laudatory tax principle eventually boomeranged to  
their firms' detriment. Business owners are likely to resist any tax  
proposal that would raise their effective tax rates, even if it promised to  
accelerate economic growth.   
<p>	 
At the very least, successful tax reform should probably avoid increasing  
the net tax burden on America's businesses. Even so, such reform would  
still create lists of winners, losers, and uncertains. Traditionally, the  
uncertains oppose tax reform while projected losers fight harder against   
their losses than winners will fight for their gains, so even a revenue- 
neutral tax reform between individuals and businesses is likely to create  
important opposition to a flat tax.  
<p>

<b><a name="Other Obstacles">OTHER OBSTACLES</a></b><br>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	 
Aside from the basic tax-burden questions, there is a long list of obstacles  
for the flat tax to overcome:  
<p>	 
<b>Charitable contributions.</b> Under the current income tax, itemizing  
taxpayers can deduct amounts contributed to charitable organizations  
(churches, certain civic groups, educational institutions, research  
organizations, etc.) in calculating their taxable income. The charitable  
deduction is defended by politically powerful organizations from Harvard   
University and the Boy Scouts to the Catholic Church and the American  
Association of Retired Persons. For itemizers, contributions to these  
groups under current law are made in pre-tax dollars. Under a flat tax, the  
tax incentive to make a contribution is eliminated, so all such  
contributions must be made in after-tax dollars. Some decline in  
charitable giving should be expected for virtually all charities, at least  
initially, following the enactment of the tax. Over the long run, of   
course, the higher incomes and capital accumulation produced by a flat  
tax will lead to increases in giving that will offset the initial decline. Even  
so, charitable groups, recognizing the immediate threat to their funding,  
will surely lobby to keep the charitable deduction in the tax base.   
<p>	 
<b>Tax receipts under the Armey plan.</b> Flat-tax advocates also often strongly  
favor a smaller federal government, and the arguments in favor of one  
occasionally intermingle with arguments in favor of the other. However,  
a flat tax implies little or nothing about the desired level of government   
spending or taxation. It is a revenue system capable of raising a wide  
range of tax revenue levels depending on the tax rate chosen. Without  
question, a flat tax would be easier to enact and implement if the federal  
government

needed less revenue. General tax cuts would help avoid the  
contest of winners and losers that typically impede tax reforms. Also,   
all tax reforms impose adjustment costs on the economy as resources are  
re-allocated and re-priced. These costs would be easier to bear in the  
context of reduced overall tax burdens.   
<p>	 
The initial tax rate under the Armey flat tax is set at 20 percent, which  
Armey argues would reduce federal collections by about $40 billion  
annually; the tax rate drops two years later to 17 percent. The Armey plan  
argues forcefully for funding these cuts with spending cuts. Over the   
traditional five-year budget window, setting the flat rate at 20 percent  
means cutting spending by about $250 billion. To put it in perspective,  
the budget passed by the House Budget Committee in May to eliminate  
the deficit called for spending cuts of $459 billion over five years.   
<p>	 
The spending cuts needed to fund the Armey flat tax would be in addition  
to those in the Fiscal Year 1996 Budget Resolution. For advocates of a  
dramatically smaller government, a call for additional spending cuts to  
fund flat-tax reform is more of an opportunity than a problem. But,   
given the difficulties of achieving the cuts in the budget resolution, it is  
fair to question whether additional cuts of this size are possible. At this  
stage, the possible responses of the flat-tax advocates would seem to be  
either that the revenue scoring must include revenue gains from projected   
accelerated economic growth or that the extra spending cuts are possible  
and desirable.  
<p>	 
<b>The flat tax and the health care debate.</b> Under a flat tax, the employer  
would no longer be allowed to deduct the cost of employee health- 
insurance coverage. This arrangement eliminates a serious distortion in  
the current system -- the tax advantage of employer-provided health   
insurance. Denying employers the ability to deduct the cost of health  
insurance will discourage them from continuing to provide insurance as a  
benefit. Instead, they are likely to raise wage and salary income, and  
families would have to buy their own insurance. Eventually, such a  
family-based system should work as well for health insurance as it does  
for any other form of insurance.  
<p>	 
At the outset, the flat tax could expose individuals to much higher  
insurance premiums if they no longer receive the benefit of group rates.  
This is a serious transition issue for the flat tax for which no good  
solution seems available. One could, for example, require employers to  
continue to offer insurance for a specified period following tax reform.   
Another solution would be to require insurers to continue coverage  
indefinitely for previously covered employees, and set insurance  
premiums at the levels applicable to the employee's previous group.   
<p> 
<b>Double taxation and state and local taxes.</b> Alongside tax neutrality,  
avoiding double taxation between tax jurisdictions is a fundamental goal  
of good tax policy. Double taxation occurs when an individual pays tax to  
one entity and must pay tax to another jurisdiction on the tax paid to the  
first. For example, when a taxpayer pays $100 in state tax ad the federal  
government includes that $100 in the taxpayer's income for federal  
income-tax purposes, then the individual is effectively paying tax on  
taxes received by the state. This is unfair to the taxpayer.  
<p>	 
With the exception of sales taxes, state and local taxes are currently  
deductible for itemizers at the individual level and for all corporate  
taxpayers, thereby avoiding double taxation. This deduction is typically  
eliminated under a flat tax, thereby assuring double taxation and bringing  
new pressures on state and local government finances. A flat tax would  
disproportionately raise the costs of living and doing business in high-tax  
states and localities. Recognizing the threat, state and local government  
officials would strenuously oppose this change in policy. On the other  
hand, many advocates of smaller government would applaud the  
additional fiscal pressures on government under a flat tax, even at the  
price of a measure of unfairness.   
<p>	 
<b>Transition issues.</b> They say the Devil is in the details, and that is certainly  
true of tax reform. But the Devil is in his Heaven when dealing with  
transition issues. A complicated economy subject to a complex tax  
system produces extraordinary business and contractual arrangements. A   
simpler tax system may eliminate the need for some of these  
complications going forward, but the old arrangements would still be in  
force and must be addressed. The limited space available here precludes a  
discussion of these issues, but they would include the depreciation of  
previously purchased plant and equipment, the taxation of deferred  
foreign-source income, the use of accumulated Alternative Minimum Tax   
Credits, etc.

<p>	 
Tax reform, and the flat tax in particular, is intended to replace a very  
poor tax system with a simpler tax promising better economic  
performance. Once such a system has been designed, the level of  
collections demanded of it is a matter of choosing the tax rate.  
<p>	 
The federal government, however, collects a wide variety of other taxes,  
including sales taxes on gasoline and other items, payroll taxes, and user  
fees which should also be considered for replacement. For example,  
federal sales taxes are highly distortionary, require separate and costly  
collection mechanisms, and are generally thought to be regressive.   
<p>	 
Once a new tax base has been established, strong arguments should be  
required in favor of keeping any of the other existing components of the  
federal tax system. Failing such arguments, we should give serious  
consideration to replacing these other, inferior tax systems, making up the   
revenue with a higher flat tax rate. A flat-tax rate of between 38 and 40  
percent would likely raise enough revenue to allow the elimination of the  
payroll tax and all other federal taxes.  
<p>	 
The nation faces many serious economic problems, including Social  
Security and Medicare systems racing towards bankruptcy, a costly  
private health-care system, and high regulatory burdens. So tax reform  
has some steep competition for national attention. It is all the more   
impressive, therefore, that the flat tax's advocates have succeeded in  
moving tax reform to the forefront so quickly. Replacing the current tax  
system with something significantly better, whether a flat tax or an  
alternative, will not solve all our economic ills. But the more rapid  
economic growth it promises may make finding the other solutions a   
little easier.

<h3><a name="Addendum">Taking on the Mortgage-Interest Deduction</a></h3>
<hr width="60%">

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
If the flat tax is to gain the support of the public, its advocates will have to confront defenders of existing 
deductions head on. The most important deduction for most itemizing individuals is the mortgage-interest deduction. Many observers defend this deduction as encouraging home ownership; some argue that it is necessary for tax neutrality. Under the Armey flat tax, the deduction disappears.
<p>
Many groups believe they would be injured by the elimination of the mortgage-interest deduction. They 
argue, for example, that the loss of the deduction would raise the cost of home ownership, reduce the value of existing homes, and generally cripple the home building industry. In combination, the realtors, the home-builders, the mortgage lenders, and the construction-workers unions make a very powerful lobby, particularly when millions of homeowners are added to the mix.
<p>
The concerns of the mortgage-interest deduction lobby are generally misplaced. As noted above in the 
discussion on interest rates, the tax a saver must pay on interest income is recovered by demanding a higher interest rate. Since a flat tax does not tax individual interest income, pretax market interest rates will fall significantly, just as tax-exempt bonds now pay interest more than 2 percentage points below the rate paid to taxable bonds. Mortgage lenders, seeing their cost of funds fall, will be driven by competition to pass these savings along to mortgage borrowers in the form of lower mortgage rates.
<p>
In after-tax terms, the elimination of the home-mortgage deduction will neither raise nor lower the interest
cost of home-mortgage borrowing. Therefore, that reform should have no affect on the demand for homes or on property values.
<p>
The benefit of lower mortgage rates does not extend to current mortgage holders unless they refinance their mortgages. Thus a legitimate problem is the treatment of mortgages underwritten prior to the enactment of a flat tax. Most of these borrowers assumed they would be able to deduct mortgage interest paid, thereby producing a lower after-tax interest rate and a lower tax burden. Since an estimated 27.4 million taxpayers will claim this deduction in 1995 to the tune of about $238 billion, a potentially huge bloc of voters stand ready to join the ranks of flat-tax opponents. While many or most may be able-to refinance, refinancing may be impractical for many current mortgage holders if, for example, they expect to sell the property in the following year or two.
<p>
A fair (and politically sensible) solution to the old mortgages problem might be to allow homeowners to 
deduct the interest on mortgages taken before the flat tax is enacted. While fairness demands 
grandfathering pre-existing mortgages, the consequence would be a slightly more complicated tax system and a short and medium-term erosion of the tax base, which would have to be offset with initially higher tax rates.
<p>
A loss in the battle over the mortgage interest deduction would not derail the essential effort to develop a flatter, simpler, more saver-friendly tax system. It would, however, require a much higher tax rate initially, and it would make it harder to repeal other popular deductions, like that for charitable contributions.

<i>"Any sales tax will inevitably become a<br> 
complex, pervasive, multi-rate value-added tax."</i><br>
 -- Dick Armey<br>
</center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<br>
One of the most refreshing feelings in the new Washington is the growing  
sense that our current tax system is not long for this world.  
<p>	 
Only days after the November election, Congressman Bill Archer, the  
chairman of the House tax-writing committee, boldly declared his desire  
to "tear out the income tax by its roots." House Speaker Newt Gingrich  
and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole have since formed a commission   
to consider entirely new alternatives. Presidential candidates Phil Gramm,  
Richard Lugar, and Arlen Specter want to scrap the system. A half dozen  
congressional panels are holding hearings on the subject. Even  
Congressman Richard Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, has  
floated a major rewrite (albeit without details).   
<p> 
The question is no longer whether America will get rid of its burdensome  
tax system; the question is, what new system should we replace it with? It  
is a question that will likely dominate our politics through the next  
election.  
<p>
<center>
<b><a name="The Contenders">THE CONTENDERS</a></b><br>  

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
There are three main contenders: One is a plan advanced by Senators  
Sam Nunn and Pete Domenici. They were among the earliest to call  
attention to the most economically lunatic feature of the current tax code  
-- the highly destructive double taxation of savings -- and develop a   
way to fix it. Called the "USA Tax," their proposal, while fairly  
complicated, defers taxation on income that is saved, while taxing income  
that is used for consumption. It is a sincere and innovative effort to  
encourage the savings necessary for continued economic growth.  
<p>	 
The second contender, which I strongly favor, is the flat tax. Designed to  
make the tax system as neutral and simple as possible, the flat tax would  
sweep away all loopholes, deductions, and exemptions, and replace them   
with a single generous personal allowance. All other income would be  
taxed at one low rate of 17 percent. As the plan's authors, economists  
Robert E. Hall and Alvin Rabushka, have pointed out, a flat tax would  
allow Americans to figure their taxes on a form the size of a postcard.  
The use of the tax code by would-be social engineers would end. Like the  
USA Tax, the flat tax would also end the double taxation of saving.  
<p>	 
While support for the flat tax is soaring -- almost 60 percent of  
Americans appear to favor a version of it, if polls are to be believed -- the  
Nunn-Domenici plan may have been overtaken by events. Conceived at a  
time when it appeared to many that the redistributionist Democratic Party  
would control Congress indefinitely, the plan contains sharply  
progressive tax rates that would kick in at surprisingly low income levels.  
It addresses the disincentive to save quite well, but it may make the other  
problems in the code, high rates and complexity, even worse than the  
current system. With the new politics in Washington and across the  
country, superior alternatives are now clearly within political reach.  
<p>	 
Then there's choice number three: the national sales tax. This is a  
sweeping plan to wipe away the current system and replace it with an  
unprecedented federal tax on retail purchases. Although it's not as widely  
discussed as the flat tax, it has substantial support among many far- 
thinking conservatives, including Archer and Lugar. Indeed, there are   
few conservative hearts that could not be at least a little warmed by its  
central promise to end the income tax altogether.   
<p>	 
This last choice demands serious examination at the moment. Although  
well-intentioned, the sales-tax option has several serious flaws. Before  
getting into that, though, we must remember that supporters of all these  
plans are allies in a fight to end America's single greatest impediment to  
achieving its possibilities: the IRS code, circa 1995.  
<p>	 
Any American tax system should meet three basic criteria. It should be  
fair, simple, and pro-growth. The current system fails miserably on all  
three counts.   
<p>	 
Is it simple? Not by a long shot. In 1990, American workers and  
businesses spent 5.4 billion hours preparing their taxes for the  
government. That's more time than it takes to build every car, truck, and  
van manufactured in the United States each year. After seven decades of  
amendments, revisions, exemptions, loopholes, and extensions, the code  
has become an incoherent mess. The IRS now sends out eight billion  
pages of forms and instructions each year. Laid end to end, they would  
stretch 28 times around the circumference of the earth.  
<p>	 
Is it fair? Hardly. The tax system is as much an exercise in social  
engineering as it is a way of raising government revenue efficiently.  
Through its exemptions and loopholes, the government tries to guide the  
economic decisions of free Americans in the misguided belief that the   
government knows best. Among other things, the code tells us that it is  
better to invest in a municipal sewer system than the next Microsoft, that  
buying rather than renting a home is a better choice for everyone  
everywhere, that purchasing air compressors is better than buying  
computer software. Government has neither the competence nor the right  
to make those decisions for us. The pretense that "government knows   
best" is an insult to our citizens.  
<p>	 
Is it pro-growth? As written, the tax code actually punishes savings and  
investment, by placing double or even triple tax burdens on capital. This  
lowers wages, destroys jobs, and depresses the living standards of all  
Americans. At the same time, it burdens American workers with  
punishingly high tax rates and overall tax burdens. With state and local   
taxes and other federal taxes, Americans now pay more in taxes than they  
spend on food, clothing, and shelter combined.  
<p>	 
All who have worked to end this system, no matter what plan they  
currently favor, should be welcomed as members of the tax-reform  
movement.   
<p>	 
Now for a closer look at option number three. What follows is my  
assessment of the major arguments advanced in favor of the national sales  
tax:  
<p>	 
<b>A sales tax is not an income tax.</b> The case for a sales tax begins with one  
highly appealing applause line. It will allow us, supporters argue, to  
eliminate the income tax altogether, possibly even repealing the 16th  
Amendment, which authorized it and made Big Government possible in   
the first place.   
<p>	 
Even if that goal were politically feasible -- and I don't think it is -- the  
exchange would come at a high price. We would give up the income tax  
for a more intrusive and pervasive tax system.  
<p>	 
The reason is simple. If the government sets out to collect a new tax at  
the cash register, it will soon have no choice but to extend that tax  
beyond the retailer to every level of production, as it desperately tries to  
stop inevitable and massive tax evasion. Any sales tax will become a  
complex, pervasive, multi-rate, value-added tax. We will soon be living   
under a VAT -- possibly the most insidious tax scheme ever devised.  
<p>	 
Sales-tax backers often oppose a VAT. But that's what they'll get. To  
generate sufficient revenue by taxing goods only at the retail level, the  
government would need to impose a sales tax of at least 20 percent,  
which means that consumers would suddenly find that everything they  
buy appears to be 20 percent more expensive. But people will not pay  
such a high tax. They will either find ways to label their consumer goods  
tax-exempt wholesale items, they will purchase goods in a cash black  
market, or they will evade it some other way. A sales tax, in other words,  
will be immediately undermined by a silent tax revolt, and the  
government -- following the pattern of European countries -- will respond  
by imposing a VAT.  
<p>	 
A VAT is assessed at each stage of production and is much easier to  
collect and enforce for a host of reasons. You can hear the bureaucratic  
lament in a 1993 report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation  
and Development, which noted: "Governments have gone on record as  
saying that an RST [retail sales tax] of more than 10 percent to 12 percent  
is too fragile to tax evasion possibilities, and it is probably not entirely  
accidental that in OECD counties, VAT rates are nearly always above 12  
percent and that, except in Canada and Iceland, RST rates have always  
been well below 12 percent."   
<p>	 
These unhappy governments were speaking from sad experience. In  
1967, 21 developed countries had retail, wholesale, manufacturer, or  
multi-stage sales taxes. Today, 20 out of 21 of these sales taxes have  
become value-added taxes. Every developed country except Australia  
that has had a sales tax now has a VAT. (Even Canada and Iceland,   
mentioned as exceptions when the OECD report was written, have since  
replaced their retail-tax-only systems with VATs.)  
<p>	 
Whether or not the sales tax evolves into a VAT, the government would  
become intimately involved in almost every economic transaction  
between consenting adults. The simplest exchange, from a vegetable  
farmer selling his produce to the corner grocer selling a loaf of bread,  
would be under the shadow of a government tax collector taking his cut.  
In fact, every businessperson in America would become a tax collector  
for the government.  
<p>	 
"But businesses already collect taxes for the government," sales-tax  
supporters counter. There's a big difference. Today, businesses collect a  
relatively small share of the income tax, since three quarters of the  
income in the economy is labor income, paid by individuals. But under a  
sales tax, there is no direct tax on individuals, so businesses will be  
responsible for collecting several times what they collect today. That  
means IRS scrutiny of American businesses could be expected to rise  
proportionately. Since the 10-12 million businesses in America have  
fewer rights under law than individuals, we can expect IRS abuses to rise   
exponentially as well.  
<p>	 
It would be an administrative mess. A national sales tax may well exempt  
many basic necessities from tax --beginning with food and clothing.  
This would lead to bitter disputes over the difference between food and  
candy, between real clothes and costume accessories. Congress and   
the courts would likely find themselves debating the nutritional value of  
Twinkies, the body coverage of sportswear, and much else, just as state  
governments do today, but on a larger scale.  
<p>	 
Worse, the federal sales tax and the dozens of different state sales taxes --  
aside from having different tax rates -- would likely exempt different  
items. That means a small businessperson would need to look up the  
correct state sales-tax rate, apply the federal rate, subtract the state tax  
rate from items exempted only by the state, or subtract only the federal  
rate from items federal-only exempted. Then he would need to do  
separate calculations for each of the states in which he does business.  
(And he would need to catch any mistakes before the tax enforcer  
appears.)  
<p>	 
The likely consequence would be a slowdown in business activity -- and  
a loss of jobs and drop in wages for millions of American workers.   
<p>	 
<b>We could eliminate the IRS.</b> Ignoring or dismissing this inevitable  
tendency for a sales tax to become an all-pervasive VAT -- with a huge  
accompanying bureaucracy -- some sales-tax advocates nevertheless  
argue that the sales tax would allow us to eliminate the IRS altogether.  
<p>	 
The argument is presented with an interesting federalist twist. The states,  
they say, could collect the new federal sales tax through their existing  
sales-tax systems. The federal government, then, could do without its  
own revenue collection agency. We could bring about the ultimate   
devolution of federal authority.  
<p>	 
One immediate problem, however, is that five states do not have a sales  
tax and would not take kindly to enforcing one for Washington. Even  
those that do would consider the costs of collecting a huge federal sales  
tax (the main source of federal revenue) an unbearable federal   
mandate.  
<p>
The enforcement costs for current sales taxes, currently about 5 percent,  
are manageable. However, if you add a 20 percent federal sales tax on top  
of that, the compliance problems grow exponentially. It makes little   
sense for a state government to pay the enforcement costs for a 25  
percent tax when it only gets one fifth of the revenue. Many states would  
simply eliminate their sales taxes.  
<p>	 
But the point is purely academic. For reasons dating back to the unhappy  
years of the Articles of Confederation, the federal government will never  
rely on state governments for its prime source of revenue. It will not  
happen.  
<p>	 
In truth, a sales tax would not eliminate any federal agency. It will  
actually allow a huge increase in the size of the federal government by  
allowing politicians to raise taxes with relative impunity. Why? Because  
sales taxes are hidden from the taxpayers, concealed in the price of the  
goods they buy.  
<p>	 
Try this experiment. Stand outside a grocery store and ask shoppers as  
they leave how much they just paid in sales tax. You'll find that virtually  
no one knows. Can you guess how much you paid in sales tax last month,  
or last year? The problem is, if people don't appreciate how much they  
pay in taxes, it is a lot easier for politicians to raise them.  
<p>	 
<b>Individuals would no longer need to file tax forms with the government.</b>
Since people would pay their taxes whenever they purchase an item,  
some sales-tax advocates argue, the government will never need to know  
a taxpayer's name. There would be no filing of any tax papers at all by an   
individual.  
<p>	 
That's not quite right. Under almost any sales-tax plan, individuals would  
still file with the government -- but for entirely different reasons than  
they do today.  
<p>	 
It's almost certain that one way or another, any federal sales tax would  
need to exempt certain basic necessities in order to make it progressive.  
One way to do this, as I've mentioned above, would be to order retailers  
not to charge tax on food and clothing and whatever else the government   
selects.   
<p>	 
But exempting a handful of items isn't enough. Absent a generous rebate,  
most Americans would face a stiff tax increase under a sales tax. That's  
why most sales-tax proposals provide for a rebate. The truth is, the   
overwhelming majority of Americans would still need to file with the IRS  
to claim their rebate (or else face a substantial tax increase).   
<p>	 
Some have suggested the IRS could simply send out checks to every  
American by Social Security number, obviating the need for taxpayers to  
file with the IRS. This is a fantasy. It wouldn't be long before there were  
more Social Security numbers than citizens. Whether or not Americans   
file directly with the IRS, the potential for fraud is staggering. Even under  
the current Earned Income Tax Credit program, fraud levels are as high  
as 30 to 40 percent. How much fraud would there be if the federal  
government were cutting thousand-dollar checks to every American?  
<p>	  
Of even greater concern is the political dynamic that would develop once  
we couple a hidden sales tax with a highly visible tax rebate. Americans  
would be quietly nickel-and-dimed to death by a sales tax they may  
hardly notice, but every year a very noticeable and generous check would  
arrive from Washington like manna from heaven. Government, and even  
the tax bureaucracy, might become highly popular after all. And in my  
judgment, if there could be anything worse then people hating the IRS, it  
would be for people to love the IRS.	  
<p>	 
<b>A sales tax will tax the underground economy.</b> The notion here is that a  
sales tax will more effectively tax illicit trade in both legal and illegal  
goods and services than any income tax. If true, this would bring in tens  
of billions of dollars in revenue to the government as we collect revenue   
from people who are currently outside the system.  
<p>	 
The neighborhood drug dealer almost always serves as the illustration.  
Since the drug dealer declines to file a 1040 form, the argument runs,  
maybe we could at least recoup some of his income through a sales tax.  
The government may have no record that he exists, but when he uses his  
blood money to buy a sports car, the government will collect tax from  
him.  
<p>	 
That sounds compelling at first, but if we think it through, it doesn't hold  
together. Look at it this way: Both systems will equally fail to tax the  
drug trade for the simple reason that the drug dealer will not play along in  
either one. If there's an income tax in place, he won't report his income. If  
there's a sales tax in place, he won't collect tax from his customers. Either  
way, the government loses exactly the same amount of money.  
<p>	 
Consider the following example. Suppose there is a drug dealer who  
makes $50,000 in sales to his customers every year and then turns around  
and spends it. Under an income tax system, we wish to tax the income of  
the dealer and his customers, while under a sales tax we wish to tax all of  
their purchases.  
<p>	 
Under the income tax, we tax the income of the drug consumers  
(assuming they are law-abiding citizens besides their drug use), but we  
can't tax the income of the drug dealer. Thus we lose $50,000 from the  
tax base. Under the sales tax, we tax the purchases of the drug dealer, but  
we don't tax the purchases of the drug consumers. Loss to the tax   
base: $50,000.  
<p>	 
It has to be the case that neither system taxes the value of the drug trade  
because the amount people spend on drugs must equal the income of the  
drug dealer. And since the drug dealer will not report sales or income tax,  
neither system will capture the value of the drug trade.   
<p>	 
The same would hold true for the underground economy in legal goods  
and services as well -- which, of course, is much larger. The proverbial  
plumber who doesn't report his house-call income today would not report  
it for sales-tax purposes either. At best, it will be a wash.  
<p> 	 
Actually, economic reasoning aside, the whole "underground economy"  
argument for a sales tax is flawed. It's obvious that if we try to impose a  
national sales tax of 20 percent or more on the public, the underground  
economy will explode. The "contraband" involved, though, will not be  
just crack cocaine, but virtually any sort of consumer good. That's   
exactly what happened in Canada when the government imposed its  
goods-and-services tax. The tax raised much less than projected.  
Coincidentally, the Canadian Treasury soon noticed a dramatic increase  
in the amount of real currency flowing through the economy. Why were  
Canadians suddenly using so much cash? Guess.  
<p>	 
<b>A sales tax will reduce the trade deficit.</b> Supporters say that a sales tax  
will increase U.S. competitiveness by taxing imports and not taxing  
exports. As tax-policy people put it, a sales tax is "border adjustable."  
Since exports aren't sold in the U.S., they would escape a domestic sales  
tax; since foreign imports are sold here, they will get hit. This way,  
American firms receive a significant tax advantage over foreign firms,  
and that will favorably alter our trade balance.  
<p> 
There are very few economists who hold this view, however. An  
immutable law of economics holds that trade surpluses and deficits are  
linked to the amount a nation lends or borrows. When savings are low,  
the trade deficit must be high, but if we substituted a tax on imports for  
some other tax, it will not affect the amount Americans save. That means   
the trade deficit not only will stay the same, it must stay the same, as a  
basic principle of economics.  
<p>	 
Economists might explain it this way (simplifying, of course): If there is  
more investment occurring in our economy than can be financed by our  
savings, then foreign investors must be accounting for the difference. In  
effect, they are taking the money we pay them for their cars and VCRs  
and using it to buy our stocks and bonds, thus supplying the investment  
capital that we don't supply ourselves. This difference is the "trade  
deficit."   
<p>	 
The only way to change the trade deficit, then, is to change our savings  
rate. If we increase our savings relative to our domestic investment, we  
will have less need for foreign cash. The trade deficit will then drop, as  
we spend relatively less money buying foreign goods and relatively more   
investing at home.  
<p>	 
But anything we do to tax incoming foreign goods -- including slapping  
them with a sales tax -- will have no effect on the amount of money  
Americans are putting into domestic stocks and bonds or even their own  
bank accounts. There is simply no relationship between them.  
<p>	 
What will happen instead is this: Our exports will increase at first because  
of the new tax advantage. But since our savings will remain the same, the  
dollar will be artificially strengthened. This will make our exports more   
expensive, and the original balance of trade will be gradually restored --  
along with the original trade deficit. The policy will be self-defeating.  
<p>	 
Even if a border adjustment were to work as its proponents claim, it  
would still be a bad idea. It would make the goods Americans buy --  
whether produced here in America or abroad -- more expensive, while  
foreigners could purchase American-made goods more cheaply. It's hard  
to see how Americans benefit from paying higher prices than foreigners  
do to purchase American products.  
<p>	 
Adam Smith makes a relevant point in The Wealth of Nations. Smith  
reminds us, "Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production;  
and the interest of the producer bought to be attended to, only so far as it  
may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer."  
<p>	 
In a border-adjustable system, however, to borrow from Smith again, "the  
interest of the consumer is almost constantly sacrificed to that of the  
producer; and it seems to consider production, and not consumption, as  
the ultimate end and object of all industry and commerce."   
<p>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
All of the above assumes, of course, that we really could replace the  
income-tax system with a national sales tax. But could we? The roots of  
the income tax go back to the 16th Amendment, passed in 1916 to  
authorize the government to levy a tax on individual incomes. In my  
view, repealing the amendment and ending the income tax for good   
is, politically, not in the cards. Conservatives in Congress have tried for  
years to pass a balanced-budget amendment without success. I believe we  
will eventually succeed, but in the midst of that grueling fight, I believe  
the notion of getting 290 members of the House, 67 members of the  
Senate, and three quarters of the states to repeal the 16th Amendment is a   
dream.  
<p>	 
And that is perhaps the best argument against the sales tax. If we try to  
exchange an income tax for a sales tax, we could easily end up with both.  
It would be a tragic irony if conservatives who favor a smaller  
government unwittingly provide the liberals with a comprehensive new  
taxing authority without eliminating the old one.  
<p>  
<center>
<b><a name="Flat-Tax">THE FLAT-TAX OPTION</a></b><br>  

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	 
We must not lose sight of the commendable motives behind the sales tax.  
Its supporters want a tax code that does not interfere with economic  
decisionmaking, minimizes the paperwork burdens on the taxpayers,  
limits the size of the federal government, avoids excessive taxes on  
savings and investment, and is straightforward and fair.  
<p>	 
For all the above reasons, however, the sales tax is not likely to achieve  
those goals. The flat tax, however, will do so. By placing a single tax rate  
on all income, it will not distort economic decisions. Citizens will be free  
to spend and invest their money as they see fit without taking tax  
considerations into account. The paperwork burden, for most taxpayers,  
will be reduced to filling out a postcard-sized tax return. Americans will  
get an honest bill and know how much their government costs them.  
Savings and investment income will be taxed, but only once. The  
punitive double taxation of savings in the current code will be gone. The  
flat tax meets the tax-reform criteria -- it is simple, fair, and pro-growth.

<H2> June/July Insider -- Flat Tax Fever </H2>
<HR>
<P>Although
it was a largely unknown academic concept just one year ago, the
flat tax today is one of the most talked about policy reforms
in Washington, in large part due to the efforts of House Majority
Leader Richard Armey of Texas. It now looks increasingly possible
that the current income tax system will be junked in favor of
this simple, fair, pro-growth plan. The present system suffers
from three major problems, each of which would be solved by the
flat tax:<P>
<ul>
<li>Problem #1: High tax rates that discourage work, savings,
and investment.Flat Tax Solution: The Armey flat tax replaces
the current discriminatory system of tax rates with a simple,
low rate that treats all taxpayers equally.<P>
<li>Problem #2: Needless
complexity that imposes $200 billion of compliance costs.Flat
Tax Solution: The Armey flat tax allows all taxpayers to fill
out their taxes on a postcardsized form.<P>
<li>Problem #3: Multiple taxation
of capital income that penalizes economic growth.Flat Tax Solution:
Not only are all individuals treated equally, so is all income.
No longer would some income escape taxation while other types
of income are subject to as many as four levels of taxation.
</ul><P>
The
flat tax solves all these problems by creating a tax system that
treats all citizens equally, rewards productive behavior, and
gets the government out of the business of using tax law to micromanage
the economy. The key benefits of the flat tax are:
<ul>
<li>Faster economic
growth: By reducing tax penalties against savings and investment,
a flat tax would spur increased work, saving, and investment.
If enactment of a flat tax boosted longterm annual growth by as
little as 0.5 percent, the income of an average family of four
after 10 years would be as much as $5,000 higher than if current
tax laws remained in place.<p>
<li>Instant wealth creation: According to
Harvard economist Dale Jorgenson, adoption of the flat tax would
boost national wealth by some $1 trillion. All incomeproducing
assets would rise in value since the flat tax would increase the
aftertax stream of income they generate.<p>
<li>Simplicity: One business
in 1992 had a tax return 21,000 pages long requiring 30 volumes.
Individual taxpayers are slightly better off, but the system still
imposes needless costs. Under a flat tax, all taxpayers, from
General Motors to John Doe, would be able to fill out their tax
return on a postcardsized form. Current compliance costs would
drop by tens of billions of dollars. <p>
<li>Fairness:  A flat tax would
treat people equally. A very wealthy taxpayer with 1,000 times
the income of another taxpayer would pay 1,000 times more in taxes.
No longer would the tax code penalize success and discriminate
on the basis of income.<p>
<li>End to micromanaging and political favoritism:
 The flat tax gets rid of all deductions, loopholes, credits,
and exemptions. Politicians would lose all ability to pick winners
and losers, reward friends and punish enemies, and use the tax
code to impose their values on the economy. According to Professor
Alvin Rabushka of Stanford, $100 billion of uneconomical investments
are made for tax purposes, funds that would be used to boost economic
growth under a flat tax.<p>
<li> Increased civil liberties: Under current
laws, those charged with murder have more rights than taxpayers
dealing with the IRS. With a simpler, fairer tax code, however,
infringements on freedoms and privacy would fall dramatically. <P>
<li>Political
feasibility: Unlike the national sales tax or value added tax, the
flat tax does not require either repealing the 16th amendment
or running the risk of creating an entirely new revenue source
for tax hungry politicians.The Heritage Foundation has published
two papers on the flat tax: Jobs, Growth, Freedom, and
Fairness: Why America Needs a Flat Tax (Backgrounder #1035) and
A Brief Guide to the Flat Tax (Talking Points). Heritage
is also leading a flat tax working group comprised of more than
100 representatives of think tanks, congressional offices, trade
associations, citizens groups, and businesses. In addition to
broad discussions about status and strategy, the working group
has subcommittees designed to address key issues involving the
media, public awareness, transition problems, and Capitol Hill.
House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole
have founded a "Tax Reform and Economic Growth" commission
charged with developing a fair and simple tax system. Heritage
President <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Ed Feulner</a> will serve as one of 13 appointees, as well
as the vice-chairman of the commission.<p>

<P>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b><BR>
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Legislation to dismantle the current tax code and replace it with
a simple, 17 percent flat tax triggered immediate and strong support
when introduced last year by now-House Majority Leader<a href="http://www.house.gov/armey.flattax"> Richard Armey</a> (R-TX). Newspaper columnists said that, among other things,
this &quot;revolutionary reform&quot; would eliminate a &quot;Rube
Goldberg tax code.&quot;<sup>1</sup>  In the view of taxpayer groups, &quot;this legislation would unleash enormous economic growth and greatly
increase personal freedom&quot;<sup>2</sup> while &quot;eliminat[ing] the
long-time bias in the current tax code against saving and investment.&quot;<sup>3</sup>
 And Representative Armey has received thousands of letters of
support from people all across the country. In short, millions
of Americans know the current system is burdensome, unfair, unworkable,
and beyond repair.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A flat tax is more than popular, however; it is economically sound.
If enacted, for instance, it would:
<P><ul>
<li><b>Produce faster economic growth.</b> By reducing tax penalties levied
against productive economic behavior, a flat tax would spur increased
work, saving, and investment. Even if long-term growth rose by
as little as 0.5 percent, the average family of four's income
after 10 years would be as much as $5,000 higher than it would
be under current tax laws.<sup>4</sup><BR>

<P>
<li><b>Create instant wealth.</b> According to Harvard economist Dale Jorgenson,
the flat tax would boost national wealth by some $1 trillion.<sup>5</sup>
 Among the reasons:  Investments would be guided by profitability
rather than tax status and the value of income-producing assets
would rise as the after-tax stream of income generated by these
assets increased<sup>6</sup>.<BR>

<P>
<li><b>Lead to simplicity.</b> One business in 1992 had a tax return 21,000
pages and 30 volumes long.<sup>7</sup>  While generally better off than business,
individual taxpayers also face complex regulations, dozens of
special forms, and often heavy preparation costs. Under a flat
tax, all taxpayers, from General Motors to John Doe, would be
able to fill out their tax return on a <a href="bg1035c1.gif">postcard-size form</a>.<sup>8</sup>  Compliance
costs of the current system would drop by tens of billions of
dollars.<sup>9</sup><BR>

<P>
<li><b>Achieve fairness.</b>  A flat tax would treat people equally. A taxpayer
with 1,000 times the taxable income of another taxpayer would
pay 1,000 times more in taxes, but the tax code no longer would
penalize success and discriminate against citizens on the basis
of income.<sup>10</sup><BR>

<P>
<li><b>End micromanagement and political favoritism.</b> The flat tax would
rid the tax code of all deductions, loopholes, credits, and special
preferences. The only exemption that would be retained is a personal
allowance based on family size. Politicians thus would lose the
ability to pick winners and losers, reward friends and punish
enemies, and use the tax code to impose their values on the economy.
<BR>

<P>
<li><b>Increase civil liberties.</b> Under current law, someone charged with
murder has more rights and protections than a taxpayer dealing
with the Internal Revenue Service. With a simpler, fairer tax
code, infringements on freedoms and privacy would fall dramatically.<sup>11</sup>
<BR>

<P>
<li><b>Increase tax collections from the wealthy.</b> Just as happened in
the 1920s, 1960s, and 1980s, lower tax rates would result in increased
tax collections from upper-income taxpayers. The reason:  Incentives
to earn <I>and</I> report taxable income would climb dramatically.
</ul><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;America's tax system is a major reason for Americans' widespread
distrust of politicians. Taxpayers know they can spend their money
more wisely than bureaucrats and lawmakers, who seem reflexively
to raise taxes at every opportunity. The tax burden in America
is now at an all-time high, and economists estimate that this
causes both economic growth and job creation to suffer.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But this animosity is driven by more than opposition to an ever-growing
tax burden and concerns about lost jobs and lower wages. Most
Americans see the tax code as bewilderingly complicated, with
laws and regulations written for the benefit of special interests
rather than ordinary citizens. Families and businesses must pay
huge amounts to comply with this code, but even this does not
ensure an audit-proof tax return. Tax lawyers and accountants
admit that some provisions of today's tax law are so complex that
it is impossible to know whether returns are filed correctly.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Congress could solve most of these problems by adopting a flat
tax, taxing income at a low, single rate and, with the exception
of a family allowance, eliminating the current labyrinth of rates,
deductions, credits, and exemptions. No income tax ever promoted
economic growth, but a flat tax at least would penalize work,
savings, and investment far less than the current tax code.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Unfortunately, while tax experts across the political spectrum
have been attracted to the flat tax, politicians have not been
as receptive. A flat tax would undermine their ability to use
the tax code to finance new spending, to grant favors to powerful
interests, and to generate contributions from those seeking to
change or preserve specific features of the tax code. Now, however,
thanks to the sweeping changes in Congress wrought by last November's
elections and the voters' demand for simplicity and fairness,
a historic opportunity exists for radical reform of America's
tax system.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>W</B></I><B>HAT IS A FLAT TAX</B>?<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While no two of the several flat tax proposals advanced over the
years have been identical, they usually are based on the proposal
developed about fifteen years ago by Stanford University economists
Alvin Rabushka and Robert Hall. Among the key features of a Hall/Rabushka-style
flat tax are:
<P>
<ol>
<li><b>A single flat rate</b> &#173;&#173; All flat tax proposals apply a
single tax rate to any income subject to tax, although proposed
rates may differ. Some plans call for rates as low as 10 percent.
<BR>

<P>
<li><b>Elimination of deductions, credits, and exemptions</b> &#173;&#173;
Most flat tax proposals would rid the code of various provisions
(for example, deductions for home mortgage interest, charitable
contributions, and state and local taxes) that bestow preferential
tax treatment on certain behaviors and activities.<BR>

<P>
<li><b>No double taxation of savings and investment</b> &#173;&#173; Flat
tax proposals are designed to reduce or eliminate the bias against
capital formation by ensuring that all income is taxed no more
than once. Simply stated, they often include the equivalent of
a &quot;super IRA&quot; to protect savings and investment from
additional levels of taxation.<sup>12</sup>
</ol><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While they share certain core principles, however, flat tax proposals
are not identical. The Armey proposal, for instance, calls for
a very generous family allowance.<sup>13</sup>  Others include smaller personal
allowances, a feature which allows the tax rate to be dropped
even further. Another major issue is whether a flat tax also should
be a tax cut. The Armey proposal would reduce government revenues
(according to static estimates). Others, like the Specter bill,
would collect the same amount of revenue.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Other differences involve the tax treatment of business. All flat
tax proposals based on the Hall/Rabushka model, such as Armey's,
address the many anti-growth features of the corporate income
tax. In theory, however, a flat tax could be designed that applies
only to the personal income tax. The Social Security and Medicare
payroll taxes, which together are the equivalent of a 15.3 percent
income tax for most Americans, are yet another unresolved issue.
Unlike the income tax, the Social Security portion of the payroll
tax (12.4 percent) is levied only on the first $61,600 of income.
The Medicare portion (2.9 percent) applies to all wage and salary
income. Hall/Rabushka-based flat taxes do not attempt to tackle
the special problems of these retirement programs, though it would
be possible to design a flat tax which incorporated payroll taxes.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In addition, there are proposals that move in the direction of
a flat tax but, for various reasons (usually political), do not
satisfy all three core criteria. Some retain a &quot;progressive&quot;
rate structure, penalizing those who contribute most to the economy's
growth<sup>14</sup>; others retain some deductions, usually for fear of offending
a powerful constituency<sup>15</sup>; and still others would continue to double-tax
savings and investment. Such proposals generally are an improvement
over the status quo, but they clearly would not have the positive
impact on jobs and wages that a true flat tax would have.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;More important, these attempts to find a &quot;middle ground&quot;
lack the political appeal of a genuine flat tax. One reason the
flat tax is so popular is that it breaks the special-interest
logjam by reversing the notion that the tax code should be used
to reward some groups while penalizing others. But allowing politicians
to continue choosing winners and losers also allows tax lawyers
and lobbyists to retain power and influence. Even worse, because
of budget deficit concerns, retaining special provisions in the
tax code almost inevitably results in tax rates that are higher
than they would be under a true flat tax. These halfway steps
also undermine the goal of simplicity, since every surviving credit,
deduction, and exemption means longer and more complex tax forms.
For these reasons, more &quot;moderate&quot; flat tax proposals
most likely would fuel cynicism among ordinary Americans and generate
far less support than more radical plans.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>W</B></I>HY A FLAT TAX IS FAIR<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Perhaps the most common argument against a flat tax is that it
would not be &quot;fair.&quot;  This assumes that the tax code
should impose increasingly steep rates on people as their income
rises. More specifically, a so-called progressive rate structure
facilitates far more income redistribution than is possible under
a single-rate system. As will be discussed in further detail later,
the economic consequences of this approach are severe and have
been demonstrated in many studies. Even leaving the broad economic
argument aside, however, the redistributionist approach fails
any reasonable test of morality and is fiscally counterproductive.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>&quot;Progressive&quot; taxation is discriminatory.</B> The
central tenet of a progressive tax is that the government has
a right to larger shares of an individual's income as his income
rises. But traditional notions of fairness suggest the law should
treat citizens equally, and penalizing those with higher incomes
violates this principle. As John McCulloch, an early student of
taxation, warned, &quot;The moment you abandon... the cardinal
principle of exacting from all individuals the same proportion
of their income... you are at sea without rudder or compass, and
there is no amount of injustice or folly you may not commit.&quot;
<sup>16</sup> Those favoring high, confiscatory tax rates sometimes argue that
well-to-do taxpayers received so much from society that it is
only proper that government seize bigger portions of their income
and use the money to benefit the less fortunate. This approach
presents several fundamental problems.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;First, in the private sector, income is earned by offering others
something of value. Employers pay workers because they produce;
consumers buy products because they value them. Without government
coercion, income is earned by offering something to society, not
by taking something from society.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The redistributionist credo, by contrast, holds that income is
earned at the expense of others in society. This assumes income
is a fixed pie and that any additional income earned by one individual
somehow comes out of the pockets of everyone else. As the <a href="bg1035c2.gif">chart</a>
above shows, however, earnings for all income groups tend to rise
and fall in unison. Incomes for all groups, including the poor,
rose substantially during the Reagan years when tax rates were
reduced. They did not perform strongly during the Carter, Bush,
and Clinton years when high-tax policies were enacted.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Second, advocates of high tax rates often claim that government
spending somehow helps the economy in general or the poor in particular.
As discussed previously, however, study after study shows that
higher levels of government spending are associated with weaker,
not stronger, economic growth. Even programs designed to help
the less fortunate, such as welfare and food stamps, seem to <a href="bg1035c3.gif">worsen conditions</a> for the poor by trapping them in a cycle of dependence
on government.<sup>17</sup>  As the adjacent chart shows, large amounts of
welfare spending have not lowered the poverty rate.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Third, studies have shown that high tax rates can backfire by
discouraging work, savings, and investment, thereby reducing taxable
income and &#173;&#173; depending on the tax rate &#173;&#173;
causing revenues to stagnate or fall.<sup>18</sup>  According to this principle,
popularly known as the Laffer curve, when tax rates reach certain
levels, total tax revenue will fall. Despite attacks by politicians
and journalists, the theory is valid. Imposing a 100 percent tax
on income above a certain level, for example, almost certainly
would yield no additional revenue, since people no longer would
have any incentive to earn money above that amount. Conversely,
the government would collect no money if tax rates were zero.
The only question (bearing in mind that the revenue maximizing
tax rate is not the same as the growth maximizing tax rate) is
whether tax rates are so high that government loses potential
revenue.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Unfortunately, official government projections are of limited
use when attempting to calculate the &quot;revenue-neutral&quot;
rate under a flat tax, since tax estimators in the Administration
and in Congress assume that taxes have no impact on the economy<sup>19</sup>.
 Most Americans would find it hard to believe that government
ignores economic effects in calculating revenue, but consider
the experience of Senator Bob Packwood (R-OR). In 1989, as ranking
Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, he asked the Joint
Committee on Taxation (JCT) to estimate what would happen if the
government confiscated <I>all</I> income above $200,000 per year.
The JCT projected that such a tax would raise $104 billion in
1989, $204 billion in 1990, $232 billion in 1991, $263 billion
in 1992, and $299 billion in 1993. As Senator Packwood remarked,
the Joint Committee's estimate &quot;assume[d] people will work
if they have to pay all their money to the Government. They will
work forever and pay all their money to the Government when clearly
anyone in their right mind will not.&quot;<sup>20</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This blunder was only a theoretical exercise, but it demonstrates
the enormous shortcomings of its methodology. Unfortunately, it
is this methodology that drives the JCT estimates that Congress
uses when considering alternative tax proposals, and the results
can be very costly, as many cases have demonstrated.<sup>21</sup>  Capital
gains estimates in the late 1980s that were off by more than 100
percent were used to kill a capital gains tax reduction that could
have eased the economic hardship afflicting the nation during
the Bush Administration.<sup>22</sup>  The large tax increase of 1990 was approved
in part because lawmakers were told it would balance the budget.
Instead, revenues came in below the tax collection estimates made
before the tax increase was enacted.<sup>23</sup>  Over the years, because
of static revenue estimating procedures, the JCT has seriously
overestimated revenues from such changes as the windfall profits
tax, the corporate income tax after the 1986 Tax Reform Act, and
the 1990 Luxury Tax on yachts.<sup>24</sup>  Ironically, the Clinton Administration
admitted the flaws of static scoring during the debate on the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), arguing correctly
that revenues generated by higher economic growth would more than
offset tax cuts in the trade legislation.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Recent evidence confirms the negative impact of high tax rates
on revenues. The 1993 Clinton tax increase was supposed to make
the &quot;rich&quot; pay more by imposing the largest income tax
rate increase since Herbert Hoover's in 1930. Yet, according to
Administration budget figures, individual income tax revenues
have been growing much more slowly than other tax revenues. These
figures are an early sign that this increase in the income tax
rate will not raise the $114 billion in new revenue the Administration
predicted. What makes the figures even more surprising is that
they include money generated by the retroactive &#173;&#173; and
thus unavoidable &#173;&#173; tax increase on 1993 income (due
on April 15, 1994). The fact that income tax revenues in 1994
were still 30 percent below the growth rates for all other revenues
is particularly significant.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Not surprisingly, the punitive Clinton tax increase caused rich
people to report less taxable income in 1993, as the <a href="bg1035c4.gif">chart</a> illustrates. The cause of this drop  &#173;&#173;  tax shelters,
reduced work effort, evasion  &#173;&#173;  is not yet clear.
Whatever the cause, the entire economy suffers.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Given what happened in the 1980s, however, the failure of the
Clinton tax hike should be no surprise. Critics charged that the
Reagan tax cuts were a &quot;giveaway to the rich,&quot; but government
figures show that upper-income taxpayers paid a significantly
<I>larger</I> share of the income tax burden after their tax rates
were reduced. Simply stated, lower tax rates encouraged substantial
income growth and reduced incentives to shelter and underreport
income, and the result was a large increase in taxable income
which generated substantial amounts of new revenue for the government
even though actual tax rates were lower.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>ADVANTAGES OF A FLAT TAX<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There are two principal arguments for a flat tax:  growth and
simplicity. Economists are attracted to the idea because the current
tax system reduces growth, destroys jobs, and lowers incomes.
While it would not eliminate this damaging impact, a flat tax
would boost the economy's performance when compared with the present
tax code. For many Americans, however, the most persuasive argument
for a flat tax is that the complicated documents and instruction
manuals they must struggle to decipher every April would be replaced
by a simple postcard-size form. This radical reform appeals to
citizens who not only resent the time and expense of their own
tax forms, but also suspect that the existing maze of credits,
deductions, and exemptions gives a special advantage to those
with political power and the money to afford tax accountants.
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>The Complexity Problem with the Current System<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;By penalizing work, savings, and investment, the income tax has
slowed economic growth and lowered living standards significantly.
This economic damage is compounded by a tax code that imposes
very high costs on those who try to follow the law. As categorized
in James L. Payne's comprehensive <I>Costly Returns:  The Burdens
of the U.S. Tax System</I>, these costs include:<sup>25</sup>
<P><ul>
<li><b>Record keeping</b> &#173;&#173;  organizing data collection systems;
collecting and appraising data; synthesizing data.<BR>

<P>
<li><b>Learning about tax requirements</b> &#173;&#173; studying tax form
instructions, tax books, pamphlets, and articles; seeking interactive
instruction in telephone calls and visits to IRS, discussion with
friends and volunteers, classes, training sessions; finding and
using a paid tax preparer<BR>

<P>
<li><b>Preparing the return</b> &#173;&#173;  making appropriate computations;
filling out tax forms and schedules; copying and sending the return.
<BR>

<P>
<li><b>Tax planning</b> &#173;&#173;  studying tax requirements, books, articles,
etc.; discussing tax avoidance with tax adviser and others; drafting
tax management plan.
</ul><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;According to Payne, today's tax code imposes 24.4 cents of compliance
costs for every dollar of taxes raised.<sup>26</sup>  The Tax Foundation puts
the cost at 15.2 cents<sup>27</sup>, though even this means the tax code imposes
$192 billion of compliance costs. Testifying before a congressional
committee, one economist stated, &quot;If an enemy power bent
on destroying our nation were somehow given the opportunity to
devise our tax code with a goal of sapping the nation of its economic
vitality... it could do little better than adopt our current Internal
Revenue Code.&quot;<sup>28</sup>  A professor of tax law declared, &quot;The
United States now has the most complex tax laws in the history
of civilization.&quot;<sup>29</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While every tax system imposes compliance costs, a simple flat
tax would sharply reduce these ancillary costs. As illustrated,
the Armey proposal would allow all taxpayers, from the teenager
flipping hamburgers to the General Motors Corporation, to submit
their returns on a postcard-sized form.<sup>30</sup>  The original tax code
was only 14 pages long, and tax forms were simple one-page documents<sup>31</sup>.
 Today's tax code has swelled to 3,458 pages.<sup>32</sup>  Moreover, the IRS
receives more than 1 billion form 1099s every year as part of
the government's cumbersome efforts to track income from interest,
dividends, and other forms of business income.<sup>33</sup>  With a flat tax,
this burden disappears. The effect would restore the simplicity
of the original income tax.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The tax laws are only the tip of the iceberg. Internal Revenue
Service regulations, supposedly written to clarify ambiguities
in the tax code, are nearly six times the length of the actual
tax law.<sup>34</sup>  To put this in perspective, federal tax laws and regulations
are more than six and one-half times longer than the King James
Bible.<sup>35</sup>  Unfortunately, length is not matched by clarity.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Compliance Costs of the Personal Income Tax<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Most individuals are painfully familiar with the peculiarities
of the personal income tax. They wade through the maze of forms
and instructions or pay professionals to do the job for them.
Studies show that Americans spend between 1.6 billion and 2.1
billion hours each year complying with the personal income tax.<sup>36</sup>
 In dollar terms, this represents an annual burden of between
$51 billion and $65 billion<sup>37</sup>, with compliance costs falling most
heavily on small businesses and the self-employed, thereby ensuring
that entrepreneurship is penalized.<sup>38</sup><BR>

<P>
What do taxpayers get for their time and effort?  All too often,
they get wrong answers. Each year, for example, <I>People</I>
magazine used to send tax information about a hypothetical family
to 50 different tax preparers, and each year virtually every one
came up with a different estimate of the family's tax bill &#173;&#173;
most of them missing the right figure by a wide margin.<sup>39</sup>  They
could have called the IRS for advice, but a 1987 General Accounting
Office survey found IRS officials giving taxpayers the wrong information
47 percent of the time.<sup>40</sup>  This survey was conducted just after
a major tax reform, and accuracy presumably has improved as IRS
staff have absorbed its intricacies. Nonetheless, the fact that
professionals both inside and outside of government have so much
trouble with the law argues compellingly for a simple flat tax.
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Compliance Costs of the Corporate Income Tax<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The personal income tax code is relatively simple when compared
with the laws driving the corporate tax system. According to Payne,
American businesses devote more than 3.6 billion hours to tax
compliance every year<sup>41</sup>, in addition to which compliance costs actually
may exceed the total raised by the corporate income tax. One recent
study estimated that these costs exceeded revenues by $40 billion,
while another found them to be as much as 75 percent of revenues.<sup>42</sup>
 Small corporations, those with assets of $1 million or less (90
percent of U.S. corporations), are especially victimized with
compliance costs of $382 for every $100 raised.<sup>43</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Like individual taxpayers, businesses may have no way of knowing
whether the information they put on their tax returns is accurate.
Provisions like depreciation, alternate minimum tax, uniform capitalization,
economic performance rules, transfer pricing, and allocation rules
all add to the complexity of corporate taxes and help explain
why businesses spend 3.6 billion hours a year trying to figure
out their tax bills.  Worst of all are the provisions affecting
U.S. corporations that do business overseas. As one executive
has remarked, the &quot;forms are so complex they defy interpretation
and result in noncompetitive cost burdens.&quot;<sup>45</sup><BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Tax Evasion<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
Many people in America and around the world choose to evade taxes
by operating in the underground economy.<sup>46</sup>  By its very nature,
the underground economy is difficult to measure. Scholars have
come up with estimates ranging from a low of 4.5 percent of official
U.S. economic output to a high of 27 percent.<sup>47</sup>  High tax rates
and complexity contribute to a decision to operate outside the
law<sup>48</sup>, but a great deal of the underground economy is the result
of government decisions to impose criminal penalties on drugs,
gambling, and prostitution. Income from such activity would not
be disclosed whatever the tax rate, and this makes it more difficult
to estimate the tax-induced economic losses from the underground
economy.<sup>49</sup><BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Costs of Taxation Incurred by Government<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A complex tax system with high marginal rates also imposes costs
on government. The annual cost of operating the Internal Revenue
Service, for instance, is expected to reach almost $10 billion
in 1995, and other government agencies also have tax-related divisions
which add about $3.5 billion to the total. All told, according
to one study, the federal government will employ more than 136,000
people and spend more than $13.7 billion enforcing the tax code
in 1995.<sup>50</sup>  While considerably less than the costs borne by the
private sector, these figures would drop significantly under a
simplified flat tax.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<I><B>T</B></I>HE ECONOMIC ARGUMENT FOR A FLAT TAX<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There are two ways to increase a nation's economic output or rate
of growth.  In simple terms, Americans must work more or work
more productively. Thus, economic growth depends on some combination
of:

<P><OL>
<b><li>Adding more labor to the economy</b>, which happens when people choose
to work longer hours, they take second jobs, or their spouses
join the workforce, or<BR>

<P>
<b><li>Adding more capital to the economy</b> so that workers can produce
more goods and services per hour of time worked.
<P></ol>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A flat tax would build a stronger economy by correcting both the
anti-labor and anti-capital features of the current income tax
code.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Why High Tax Rates Discourage Work<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Taxes on labor discourage work by reducing the benefits (after-tax
income) individuals receive from offering their labor to employers.
In the language of economists, taxes reduce the &quot;price&quot;
of leisure relative to work, so when taxes and other government
policies make work less attractive by reducing take-home pay,
many individuals choose either not to work or to cut back the
number of hours they work.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This can take many forms. Economic research indicates that taxes
have a strong impact on whether people work,<sup>53</sup> particularly people
with low incomes whose welfare benefits often result in higher
after-tax &quot;income&quot; than they can earn by holding a job.<sup>54</sup>
 Taxes also reduce incentives for those who do choose to work,
causing a decline in hours worked and, in the case of high taxes,
the willingness to work overtime (at least three strikes in recent
months were against additional overtime).<sup>55</sup>  Excessive taxation
also discourages second jobs, since workers often find that the
additional after-tax income is not enough to offset the leisure
time sacrificed. <a href="#appen1">Appendix 1</a> lists several studies that document
the impact of taxes on the decision to work.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Even though studies confirm the relationship, the idea that marginal
tax rates profoundly influence individual incentives is not immediately
obvious to many Americans. They recognize that businesses must
watch the bottom line and thus understand how higher taxes depress
wages and cost jobs, but they think about their own lives and
conclude that a shift &#173;&#173; up or down &#173;&#173; in
marginal tax rates probably will not mean dramatic change. Most
Americans, after all, do not take second jobs in response to lower
tax rates.<sup>56</sup>  Nor are many workers likely to refuse overtime just
because they rise. How, then, will lower marginal tax rates encourage
economic growth?<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It turns out that high tax rates have a particularly pronounced
effect at the upper end of the income scale. Unlike most citizens,
the &quot;rich&quot; have significant control over the timing
and composition of their income. As seen in the <a href="bg1035c5.gif">chart</a> on page
9, &quot;rich&quot; taxpayers receive most of their income from
investments and business activity.<sup>57</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Whether wealthy taxpayers are small businesses or investors, their
relative lack of dependence on wage and salary income means they
have far more ability to alter their economic behavior and protect
their income when changes in tax rates alter incentives. For small
businesses, any increase in tax rates lessens the ability to hire
workers or retain earnings for expansion. Because of the direct
effect taxes have on their generally smaller profit margins, small
businesses are even more sensitive to changes in the tax code
than large corporations are.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Many well-to-do taxpayers, of course, receive a large portion
of their incomes from dividends, interest, capital gains, and
other types of investments or passive business earnings. As with
most other Americans, they seek to realize the largest possible
return on their investments and to protect as much of their wealth
and income from the government as possible. In a survey conducted
by Prince &amp; Associates, a Connecticut financial consulting
firm, 89 percent of 311 high-income business owners were found
to be &quot;extremely interested&quot; in &quot;tax minimization
strategies.&quot;<sup>58</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;One significant advantage these taxpayers have over most other
Americans is the ability to retain the services of highly qualified
tax lawyers, accountants, and investment advisors, each of whom
supposedly can generate the highest after-tax return for clients.
Needless to say, increases in marginal tax rates reduce the attractiveness
of many investments. This encourages tax professionals and their
clients to focus on sheltering income, reducing tax code earnings,
placing assets overseas, and otherwise avoiding taxes. Consider
the following:
<P><ul>
<li><b>Municipal bonds are exempt from federal tax.</b> In a <I>Wall Street
Journal</I> report on the growth of these bonds in the aftermath
of Clinton's record tax increase<sup>59</sup>, a member of one billionaire
family noted, &quot;A wealthy New York City resident is looking
at a combined city, state, and federal rate of nearly 50 percent.
So you've got to buy municipal bonds. You've got to. A long-dated
muni yielding 5.5 percent is equal to a 10.53 percent yield on
a taxable [U.S.] government bond.&quot;<sup>60</sup>  Rather than reduce the
budget deficit, as politicians claim, high tax rates merely drive
wealthy investors into tax-free municipal bonds and other shelters.
The federal government does not collect new tax revenues, and
overall tax collections may well fall. In addition, there is real
damage to the economy as driving investors out of productive private-sector
investments and into buying the debt of state and local government
undermines economic growth, resulting in less job creation and
stagnating incomes.<BR>

<P>
<li><b>Fidelity Investments offers a new mutual fund based on tax minimization
strategies.</b><sup>61</sup>  Again, the issue is economic. As with similar funds,
managers' investment decisions, deploying huge amounts of money,
are influenced more by the arcane features of the tax code than
by real economic factors.<BR>

<P>
<li><b>The tax code drives some people to hide their money by sending
it overseas.</b> Even though such behavior is illegal, one financial
adviser recently explained, &quot;People are hiding money. They
don't like the tax system, and they think it will get worse. Legal
experts outside the U.S. tell me that they are getting a 100 percent
increase in the business every six months.&quot;<sup>62</sup><BR>

<P>
<li><b>Perhaps most revealing, the tax burden has become so oppressive
that some Americans choose to emigrate to protect their earnings.</b><sup>63</sup>
</ul><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This anecdotal evidence that people respond to tax changes by
acting to protect their earnings and change their behavior is
supported by government data. Monthly personal income data from
the Commerce Department, for example, show that income jumped
sharply at the end of 1992 and fell just as dramatically in early
1993. The reason:  the widely expected Clinton tax increase. Taxpayers
with any discretion over when they received earnings shifted income
from 1993 to 1992 to limit the additional amount taken by the
government.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Not surprisingly, monthly tax collection figures echo these data.
Taxpayers with modest earnings pay most of their income taxes
in the form of amounts withheld from their paychecks throughout
the year. Wealthy individuals and businesses, however, because
most of their income is not subject to withholding, are legally
obligated to make quarterly payments. Most of these payments are
made routinely in the months they are due, but this pattern changed
dramatically in 1993, when January's share of the payments was
more than 70 percent higher than the average January share for
the previous 15 years. This is significant, because January 1993
was the month quarterly payments for the last three months of
1992 were due. Well-to-do taxpayers shifted large portions of
their income to 1992 because of widespread anticipation that the
incoming Clinton Administration would increase marginal tax rates.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These quarterly payment figures underscore that small businesses
and rich taxpayers can and do alter the timing and composition
of their income to protect their earnings. One prominent example
is the First Lady of the United States. Hillary Rodham Clinton
elected to take her partner's share of earnings at the Rose Law
Firm on December 31, 1992, rather than at the beginning of the
following year as she had in previous years. Perhaps Mrs. Clinton,
like other smart taxpayers, suspected the new President might
propose higher tax rates and did what she could to minimize her
family's tax liability. If she did, as the following examples
indicate, she was not alone.
<P><ul>
<li>The two top executives at the Disney Corporation exercised stock
options shortly before 1993, presumably to avoid widely expected
tax increases once Clinton took office.<sup>64</sup>

<P>
<li>Other top-level corporate executives did the same thing. Three
General Dynamics Corporation officials exercised options to purchase
over 500,000 shares of company stock before the 1993 tax year
began.<sup>65</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>Well-advised professional athletes also acted to protect their
earnings in 1992. Among baseball players, Oakland's Ruben Sierra
and Mark McGwire arranged for lump sum payments of $6 million
and $7 million, respectively, to avoid 1993's higher taxes. Other
players doing the same thing included David Cone of the Kansas
City Royals, with a lump sum of $9 million, and Detroit's Cecil
Fielder, who negotiated a record $10 million.<sup>66</sup><BR>
</ul>
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Why High Tax Rates Discourage Savings and Investment</B>
<BR>
</I>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Taxes on savings and investment harm the economy by reducing capital
formation, the process by which the quality and quantity of equipment,
tools, and technology available to workers are increased, thereby
raising their productivity.<sup>67</sup>  Since salaries and wages are linked
closely to productivity, the only way to raise the income of workers
permanently &#173;&#173; assuming no change in their skills &#173;&#173;
is through savings and investment. Simply put, workers are paid
on the basis of what they produce, and giving them better tools
allows them to produce more. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The level of capital formation largely explains why workers in
the United States, Germany, and Japan earn more than workers in
Brazil, India, and Nigeria. Similarly, workers in America today
earn more than their parents because of net investment (increases
in the capital stock). As a result, they are more productive,
generating more output per hour of labor.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;An ideal tax system does not penalize or subsidize particular
economic choices. Unfortunately, one of the most destructive elements
of the current income tax is the multiple taxation of savings
and investment. Just as savings, dividend, business, and other
forms of investment income are penalized by the personal income
tax, capital formation is hindered by corporate income, capital
gains, estate, and gift taxes, by depreciation tax provisions,
and by the corporate alternative minimum tax. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <a href="#appen2">Appendix 2</a> reveals ample evidence that taxes significantly reduce
savings and investment. This is important, of course, because
reduced levels of capital formation translate into reduced levels
of income.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Why Capital Formation Matters<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Economists of all persuasions recognize the relationship between
investment and wages. Paul Samuelson, for example, a Nobel Laureate
economist who endorsed Bill Clinton for President, has written:
<BR>

<P><blockquote>
 What happens to the wage rate now that each person works with
more capital goods?  Because each worker has more capital to work
with, his or her marginal product rises. Therefore, the competitive
real wage rises as workers become worth more to capitalists and
meet with spirited bidding up of their market wage rates. <sup>68</sup></blockquote>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Another example is taken from a 1991 report on economic growth
prepared by the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, then
controlled by the Democrats:<BR>

<P>
<blockquote> When an economy's rate of net investment (gross investment less
depreciation)<sup>69</sup> increases, the economy's stock of capital increases.
A larger capital stock permits a fixed amount of labor to produce
more goods and services. The larger a country's capital stock,
the more productive its workers and, generally, the higher its
real wages and salaries. Thus, increases in investment tend to
cause future increases in a nation's standard of living.<sup>70</sup><BR>
</blockquote>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;According to a 1989 report on economic growth published by the
Congressional Research Service,<BR>

<P>
<blockquote> Capital deepening has been and will likely continue to be a central
force for accelerating growth and potential output over the medium
term. But as we have seen, a permanent increase in the long-term
rate of growth will hinge on the United States ability to increase
the pace of technical advance and innovation. However, both of
these routes to faster growth will be contingent upon the ability
to increase the level of investment spending &#173;&#173; more
spending for capital equipment and more spending for research
and development. To finance higher investment will, in turn, require
that Americans raise the national rate of savings.<sup>71</sup><BR>
</blockquote>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Critics of this analysis complain that it is nothing more than
&quot;trickle-down&quot; economics that relies on tax cuts for
the &quot;rich&quot; to boost wages. Such rhetoric may be useful
politically, but it cannot change economic reality, as economist
John Shoven has explained:<BR>
<blockquote>
<P>
 The mechanism of raising real wages by stimulating investment
is sometimes derisively referred to as &quot;trickle-down&quot;
economics. But regardless of the label used, no one doubts that
the primary mechanism for raising the return to work is providing
each worker with better and more numerous tools. One can wonder
about the length of time it takes for such a policy of increasing
saving and investments to have a pronounced effect on wages, but
I know of no one who doubts the correctness of the underlying
mechanism. In fact, most economists would state the <I>only</I>
way to increase real wages in the long run is through extra investments
per worker.<sup>72</sup><BR>
</blockquote>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The following example illustrates why savings and investment suffer
in the current tax climate. A taxpayer has $100 of income and
must decide what to do with it. He can consume the $100, spending
it on food, vacations, clothing, haircuts, or some other product
or service, in which case (with the exception of possible sales
taxes) he will receive close to $100 in goods and services for
his money. Or he can invest in the stock of a start-up company
with the potential to provide new jobs to the community and produce
goods that consumers desire. If the company succeeds, the investor
most likely will profit. If it fails, he will lose his $100.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In this case, the investment bears fruit and yields a 10 percent
rate of return, enabling the company to produce $10 of annual
income for every $100 invested. Under the current tax code, 34
percent is skimmed off to pay the corporate income tax, leaving
only $6.60 out of the original $10. This $6.60 then goes to the
investor as a dividend. But there are other taxes. Depending on
the investor's income, the personal income tax will take as much
as 39.6 percent of his $6.60, leaving him with less than $4.00
of annual income from a &quot;successful&quot; $100 investment.
In addition, he may face applicable state and local income taxes.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Finally, if the investor ever decides to sell the stock, he will
be hit by one of the highest capital gains taxes in the industrialized
world, and what little income he eventually receives from saving
and from having taken the risk of investing most probably will
be subject to sales tax when he spends it. To add insult to injury,
successful entrepreneurs who try to accumulate an estate to pass
on to their children are penalized by inheritance taxes which
can confiscate 55 percent of a deceased's assets.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Thanks to the tax code, a fortunate investor &#173;&#173; one
who actually earns money on his investments &#173;&#173; may have
to send more than half his earnings to the government, not to
mention having already paid taxes on the money used for the investment
in the first place. Thus, government tax policy has created a
very tilted playing field. By punishing saving and investment,
the tax code encourages both individuals and businesses to consume
rather than to build for America's future.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As discussed earlier, the only ways to boost per capita income
are to work more hours or produce more per hour worked. Since
leisure has a positive value to Americans, particularly those
with families, most would prefer to raise their living standards
by increasing their hourly productivity. This is why taxes on
capital are especially damaging. They penalize the very economic
actions &#173;&#173; saving and investment &#173;&#173; necessary
for increased productivity and the growth in wages that accompanies
it. Thus, while it is important that the tax code not discourage
people from working more if that is what they desire, eliminating
the multiple layers of taxes on saving and investment is even
more critical if we want higher incomes without sacrificing leisure
time.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Why High Tax Rates Depress Economic Growth<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Since taxes affect incentives to work, save, and invest so powerfully,
it should come as no surprise that major tax changes almost always
have a significant impact on the economy. Herbert Hoover's decision
in 1930 to increase the top tax rate from 25 percent to 63 percent
certainly contributed to the Depression. Lyndon Johnson's surtax
on income tax liabilities, enacted in 1968, together with an increase
in the capital gains tax helped end the 1960s expansion. Large
tax increases, including inflation-induced bracket creep, contributed
to the economy's dismal performance under Jimmy Carter. George
Bush's record tax increase in 1990 was a principal cause of the
recent recession and subsequent anemic recovery. And the sub-par
performance of today's economy, particularly the decline in median
household income<sup>73</sup>, almost certainly is attributable in part to
the record tax increase pushed through Congress in 1993 by Bill
Clinton.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Once again, the evidence is confirmed by academic research. As
the examples in <a href="#appen3">Appendix 3</a> indicate, tax codes that penalize productive
economic behavior are associated with weaker growth, fewer jobs,
and lower incomes. Other studies find that the damage occurs when
government spends the money. In either case, the message is clear:
 The larger and more intrusive a government is, the worse its
economy performs.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<h3>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT A FLAT TAX</h3>
<BR>

<P>
<b><font size="+1">Q</font> :  Will a flat tax encourage job creation?<BR>

<P>
<font size="+1">A</font>:  A flat tax will encourage more jobs and higher wages by boosting
incentives to work, save, and invest.</b> In the long run, the elimination
of most of the tax code's bias against savings and investment
will have the biggest effect. As studies show, a flat tax will
encourage capital formation, leading over time to higher levels
of productivity, increased wages, and more jobs. A flat tax also
will have a more immediate impact on job creation, however, by
making work more attractive. High tax rates drive a wedge between
what it costs a business to employ a worker and how much the worker
receives in take-home pay.<sup>74</sup>  By increasing the cost of labor, taxes
lower the number of workers a company is willing to hire. Businesses
do not exist to pay workers more than they are worth. They exist
to make money and will hire only as long as the value of each
new worker's additional output exceeds the total cost of employing
that worker.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;When politicians enact policies that raise the cost of employment,
the total cost of some workers will rise above the value they
bring their employers. In the long run, a business has only two
options when faced with this predicament:  close its doors or
lay off workers who are net money losers. Even workers who retain
their jobs pay a price. Taxes on labor income, whether paid by
employee or employer, dollar for dollar, unavoidably reduce the
amount that finds its way into their paychecks. Politicians may
pretend otherwise, but every time the tax burden climbs, workers'
after-tax income declines.<sup>75</sup><BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b><font size="+1">Q</font>:  Would a flat tax reduce the budget deficit?<BR>

<P>
<font size="+1">A</font>:  This depends on which flat tax is implemented.</b> More specifically,
it depends on the tax rate and whether the proposal includes limits
on government spending. Even though lower rates generally stimulate
economic growth and expand the tax base, at some point they translate
into less revenue. A flat tax of 20 percent, for instance, almost
certainly would raise more money than a flat tax of 10 percent.
The size of the personal exemption/family allowance also plays
a key role, since the decision to protect a certain amount of
income ($36,800 for a family of four in last year's Armey bill)
generally means the rate on taxable income must be higher.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;According to a Treasury Department analysis leaked to the media
before the 1994 elections, the Administration estimates that the
Armey flat tax would result in a $244 billion revenue loss to
the federal government in 1995.<sup>76</sup>  But this study contained a $500
billion error, as the Department later admitted<sup>77</sup>, and used the
17 percent rate to analyze 1995 revenues even though the Armey
bill calls explicitly for an initial rate of 20 percent (which
would be phased down to 17 percent). The Treasury Department now
claims that, once fully phased in, the Armey flat tax would &quot;cost&quot;
the government as much as $186 billion per year.<sup>78</sup>  Because it is
based on static analysis, however, this figure assumes that reduced
tax rates and simplification would have no positive effect on
the economy. Hence, it ignores the additional revenues produced
by income growth (as well as the binding caps on federal spending
that the Armey bill would impose).<sup>79</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A flat tax almost certainly would reduce long-term government
borrowing since its reduced rates and lower taxes on savings and
investment would boost economic growth. Each year, the result
would be an expanding tax base and at least some reduction in
outlays for certain means-tested programs and the unemployment
compensation system. According to one relatively modest estimate
of supply-side impact, a flat tax would increase the economy's
long-run annual growth rate by just 0.5 percent. By the tenth
year, national economic output would be $578 billion higher than
it would have been without a flat tax.<sup>80</sup>  Government's &quot;share&quot;
of this production of additional goods and services would be $86
billion in tax revenue.<sup>81</sup>  By the twentieth year, added growth of
0.5 percent would mean an increase of more than $2 trillion in
GDP and additional tax revenues in excess of $300 billion.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The revenue feedback from higher growth, however, probably would
not be enough in the short term to offset the revenue lost from
lower tax rates and elimination of the multiple taxation of capital
income. Achieving a deficit-neutral flat tax (at least the Armey
version) would require some restraints on government spending.
And if lawmakers were forced to balance the budget by 2002, the
limit on spending increases would have to be even more stringent.
<BR>

<P>
<b><font size="+1">Q</font>:  What would happen to charitable contributions and the housing
market?<BR>

<P>
<font size="+1">A</font>:  While many recognize that a flat tax is far better than the
current system, they fear that the transition would create problems</b> &#173;&#173; in particular, that the loss of charitable and home
mortgage interest deductions could cause turmoil in affected markets.
This is a legitimate concern. A wealthy individual donating money
to a museum no longer could claim the gift as a deduction, reducing
his tax burden by nearly 40 cents for every dollar given and thereby
also reducing the &quot;price&quot; of his gift. The loss of the
home mortgage interest deduction would increase the after-tax
cost of housing payments and could lead to a drop in housing values,
since experts believe the value of the home mortgage interest
deduction is factored into home values.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Fortunately, history suggests these fears are exaggerated. During
the 1980s, the top tax rate was reduced dramatically, from 70
percent in 1980 to 28 percent in 1988. The effect was to slash
the value of the deduction and raise the &quot;price&quot; of
gifts. Similarly, the decline in tax rates increased the after-tax
cost of mortgage payments. In fact, the after-tax costs of mortgage
interest for homeowners and donations for charitable givers in
the highest tax bracket jumped from 30 cents to 72 cents on the
dollar, an increase of 140 percent. Most other taxpayers also
experienced a significant increase in after-tax costs of contributions
and mortgages.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If these sectors of the economy depended on the value of the tax
deduction, there should have been a noticeable downturn in home
values and charitable contributions during the 1980s. As the charts
show, however, the value of <a href="bg1035c7.gif">housing</a> did not drop. Also, <a href="bg1035c6.gif">charitable contributions</a> rose throughout the 1980s even as the out-of-pocket
cost to donors increased. These charts do not mean that lower
tax rates necessarily encourage more charity and higher home values.
They simply suggest that any adverse consequences from lower rates
&#173;&#173; or from no deductions at all &#173;&#173; can be
offset if the economy's performance is robust. In other words,
charitable contributions and housing values may well depend more
on rising incomes and wealth creation than on tax status.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There is strong reason to believe, moreover, that a flat tax would
stimulate the housing industry because of its impact on interest
rates. The current tax treatment of mortgage interest &#173;&#173;
deductible to borrowers and taxable to lenders &#173;&#173; results
in artificially high interest rates.<sup>82</sup>  One need only compare the
interest rate on tax-free municipal bonds with the interest rate
on taxable bonds to see how tax treatment of interest results
in unnecessarily high interest rates. If adoption of a flat tax
reduced interest rates to the level enjoyed by municipal bonds,
the impact on the housing industry would be substantive and positive.
<BR>

<P>
<b><font size="+1">Q</font>:  What would happen to the price of other assets?<BR>

<P>
<font size="+1">A</font>:  While the potentially negative impact on housing markets and
charity appears negligible, the positive impact on income-producing
assets would be large.</b> Assets such as stocks, bonds, and rental
properties produce a stream of income over time. Their market
price is determined by calculating how much income an asset will
produce over time, after taxes, adjusted to reflect the fact that
income today is worth more than the same amount of nominal income
in the future.<sup>83</sup>  By lowering tax rates and removing the double
and sometimes triple taxation of capital income, a flat tax can
increase dramatically the after-tax income stream an asset will
generate. Thus, a low-rate flat tax would be a boon to asset holders,
offsetting any theoretical fall in housing prices, and would stimulate
a surge of new investment in the economy. Harvard professor and
tax economist Dale Jorgenson estimates that a flat tax would increase
national wealth by $1 trillion.<sup>84</sup>  While this may seem high, it
should be remembered that the mere announcement in Israel that
a capital gains tax was being imposed caused the Israeli stock
market to drop by 10 percent in just one day.<sup>85</sup><BR>

<P>
<b><font size="+1">Q</font>:  Would a flat tax benefit everybody?<BR>

<P>
<font size="+1">A</font>:  If the question is considered narrowly (will anyone's tax
bill rise?) it depends on how a flat tax is structured.</b> If it
is designed to give the government as much money as it receives
under the current system, and if there is no consideration of
the increased revenue that would accrue from new job creation
and higher economic growth, then it is impossible to avoid having
winners and losers. In the long run, a flat tax presumably would
generate higher incomes and living standards, raising after-tax
income even for those who suffered a short-term tax increase.
At the same time, it doubtless would have an adverse impact on
the lawyers, accountants, and lobbyists who profit from the current
law's complexity.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Many flat tax proposals are structured so that few taxpayers,
if any, would have higher tax bills. This is because they are
designed to go beyond simplification and rate reduction to include
significant tax cuts for the American economy. The Armey plan
is a good example. Using static estimating techniques, it probably
would save taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars over a five-year
period. While the combination of a 17 percent tax rate and generous
family exemption would not necessarily guarantee lower tax bills
for everyone, few would face higher taxes.<BR>

<P>
<b><font size="+1">Q</font>:  Is there a way to stop politicians from raising tax rates
in the future?<BR>

<P>
<font size="+1">A</font>:  There is no guarantee that a future Congress would not turn
a simple flat tax back into a complicated &quot;progressive&quot; tax.</b> This is the Achilles' Heel of tax reform. The sweeping reform
enacted in 1986 expanded the tax base by eliminating many deductions
while simultaneously reducing tax rates to keep the total tax
burden from climbing. Skeptics warned that politicians could not
be trusted to honor this arrangement and that eventually they
would raise rates while failing to restore deductions. This is
exactly what happened under Presidents Bush and Clinton.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Could this happen with a flat tax?  Using the promise of low tax
rates, could politicians take away the home mortgage interest
deduction, the charitable contributions deduction, and other tax
preferences but then raise tax rates in the future?  It is to
reduce this danger that most proponents of a flat tax include
an ironclad provision to make raising tax rates difficult or impossible.
One way to accomplish this would be by amending the Constitution
to require that no increase in tax rates can be approved without
the votes of at least three-fifths or two-thirds (in other words,
a &quot;super-majority&quot;) of both the House and Senate.<sup>86</sup><BR>

<P>
<b><font size="+1">Q</font>:  Should the income tax be abolished instead?<BR>

<P>
<font size="+1">A</font>:  Proponents of a flat tax note that the current &quot;progressive&quot;
income tax penalizes growth, discourages savings and investment, imposes heavy compliance costs, destroys jobs, and reduces America's international competitiveness.</b> It has been pointed out, moreover,
that a flat rate income tax reduces but does not eliminate these
negative effects. Thus, the question for some becomes whether
it would be better to replace the income tax with a sales or &quot;consumption&quot;
tax. Proponents of this view, including House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Bill Archer (R-TX) and Senator Richard Lugar (R-IN),
usually suggest that the foregone revenue could be offset by spending
cuts, consumption taxes, or some combination of the two.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Most advocates of a flat tax recognize that this argument is sound,
at least in theory. Abolishing the income tax, closing down the
Internal Revenue Service, and repealing the 16th Amendment clearly
would be in the national interest. Eliminating the income tax
would lead to even more economic growth and job creation than
would occur under a flat tax. The real question is how that goal
can be achieved.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Supporters of the flat tax have decided that eliminating the income
tax is unlikely, especially in the short run. Because so many
interest groups benefit from the current tax system, enacting
a flat tax will be difficult by itself. Moreover, there is some
concern that proposals to abolish the income tax could play into
the hands of those who want a national sales tax, or value added
tax (VAT), as an add-on tax. If implemented as a replacement for
the income tax, either of these would be less destructive to the
economy. The experiences of other countries, however, suggest
that, while a VAT would be implemented with the promise to eliminate
other taxes, politicians would never take that second step. The
country then would have the worst of both worlds:  income <I>and</I>
direct consumption taxes.<sup>87</sup>  In any event, enacting a flat tax is
probably necessary as an interim measure for those who favor eliminating
the income tax.<BR>

<P>
<b><font size="+1">Q</font>:  Would a flat tax eliminate the marriage penalty?<BR>

<P>
<font size="+1">A</font>:  Probably, but &#173;&#173; again &#173;&#173; it depends on
how the flat tax is structured.</b> The marriage penalty refers to
the increased tax faced by a married couple compared to two single
people with similar incomes. This penalty is most severe for couples
with similar earnings. A flat tax automatically solves part of
this problem by making it no longer possible for one spouse's
income to push a couple into a higher tax bracket. But the marriage
penalty also arises if the personal exemption for a married couple
is not twice the size of the exemption for those filing singly.
The Armey proposal solves this part of the problem by giving a
married couple twice the exemption of a single filer. Nevertheless,
a flat tax could be constructed that retains this penalty.<BR>

<P>
<b><font size="+1">Q</font>:  How would a flat tax affect business and payroll taxes?<BR>

<P>
<font size="+1">A</font>:  It would be possible to reform the personal income tax dramatically
while leaving the corporate income tax untouched.</b> As mentioned
earlier, many businesses file using the personal tax code, so
many of their problems would be solved by a flat tax that left
the corporate tax code untouched. All flat taxes based on the
Hall/Rabushka model, however, reform both the personal and corporate
income tax codes. Under the Armey proposal, for instance, the
business rate would fall to 17 percent, the same as the personal
rate, and the code would be reformed to eliminate the excess taxation
of capital.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A flat tax can be designed to include substantial reform of Social
Security and Medicare payroll taxes. Under current law, payroll
taxes totaling 15.3 percent are levied on the first $61,600 of
income (7.65 percent each from employer and employee, though economists
agree that the entire tax is borne by the worker).<sup>88</sup>  Although none
has reached legislative form, some flat tax plans incorporate
the payroll tax, making the total marginal tax rate a fixed percentage
regardless of income.<BR>

<P>
<b><font size="+1">Q</font>:  Would a flat tax help America compete?<BR>

<P>
<font size="+1">A</font>:  The historic tax rate reductions launched by Ronald Reagan
in the 1980s caused a chain reaction around the world.</b> Many nations
followed America's example and have made similarly dramatic reductions
in marginal tax rates in recent years. In large part, this worldwide
shift in tax policy was driven by competition as investors avoided
nations with high tax rates. Unfortunately, America seems to be
one of the few nations that have not learned from the experience
of the 1980s. While the rest of the world has been cutting taxes,
the United States stands alone as the only major nation to impose
sharply higher tax rates in recent years. Investors have reacted
accordingly, and the amount of new investment in American jobs
and business from overseas has dropped from an average of $175
billion per year during the low tax years of the 1980s to an average
of only $108 billion in 1990.<sup>89</sup><BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b><font size="+1">Q</font>:  What happens to capital gains taxes and estate taxes under
a flat tax?<BR>

<P>
<font size="+1">A</font>:  They are all eliminated.</b> One of the key principles of a flat
tax is that income is taxed only once. A capital gain for a financial
asset is simply a reflection that the market's expectation of
the after-tax streams of income from that asset has risen. Under
a flat tax, that income is taxed at the business level when it
is realized. To tax the capital gain is double taxation. Similarly,
the estate tax is a second layer of tax on earning which, under
the current system, already has been taxed at least once.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>C</B></I>ONCLUSION<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;America's income tax system punishes the economy, imposes heavy
compliance costs on taxpayers, rewards special interests, and
makes America less competitive. A flat tax would reduce these
costs drastically and create a tax system that rewards productive
behavior. Perhaps more important, it would reduce the federal
government's power over taxpayers' lives and get government out
of the business of trying to micromanage the economy. No tax is
good for the economy, but the flat tax moves the system much closer
to where it should be &#173;&#173; to being a tax that raises
needed revenue in the least destructive and least intrusive way
possible.

  Taxes Affect Decisions to Work</b>
<hr>
<P><ul>
<li>Joint research by economists from Princeton University and Brigham
Young University, based on a random survey of physicians, found
that a one percentage point increase in marginal tax rates is
associated with a reduction of as much as 1.11 percent in hours
worked.<sup>90</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>A University of California economist found that because of the
Tax Reform Act of 1986 (which lowered tax rates), the work effort
of high-income married women rose by 0.8 percent for every one
percent their after-tax wages increased.<sup>91</sup>

<P>
<li>Another economist found that &quot;Husbands of retirement age,
60 and over, show substantial variation in hours of work, related
systematically to wages and income in the expected way.&quot;
  Moreover, &quot;Wives in all age groups are quite sensitive
to wages and income.&quot;<sup>92</sup>  In other words, as after-tax income
falls, so does the incentive to work.<BR>

<P>
<li>Two other economists estimated that &quot;wives' labor supply
will increase by 3.8 percent&quot; in response to a reduction
in the marriage penalty.<sup>93</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>A comprehensive study in <I>The Journal of Human Resources</I>
found that taxes reduce married males' hours of work by 2.6 percent
and married females' by between 10 percent and 30 percent.<sup>94</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>According to a statistical study in <I>Econometrica</I>, yearly
hours of work for white married women increase by 2.3 percent
for every one percent increase in after-tax earnings.<sup>95</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>While husbands are not as sensitive to taxes as wives, the impact
of taxes on their behavior is nonetheless dramatic. One study
found that they work eight percent less than they would in the
absence of taxes.<sup>96</sup>  This indicates a loss in economic output of
at least $1,000 per person.<sup>97</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>All studies acknowledge that higher after-tax incomes increase
incentives to work by increasing the &quot;price&quot; of leisure,
but some assume this effect is offset because lower taxes allow
workers to achieve a certain level of income by working fewer
hours. While this trade-off is relevant when looking at individual

Taxes Reduce Savings and Investment</b>
<hr>
<P><ul>
<li>In a book on taxes and capital formation, Norman B. Ture and B.
Kenneth Sanden noted, &quot;The bias against saving in the present
tax system results from the fact that, with few exceptions, taxes
are imposed both on the amount of current saving and on the future
returns to such saving, whereas the tax falls only once on income
used for consumption.&quot;<sup>101</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>Economist John Shoven estimates that a reduction of 20 percent
in the top rate for capital gains would cause the stock market
to rise by 3 percent.<sup>102</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>Undersecretary of the Treasury Lawrence H. Summers has written
that &quot;increases in the real after-tax rate of return received
by savers would lead to substantial increases in long-run capital
accumulation.&quot;  Further, &quot;bequests may account for a
large fraction of national capital formation,&quot; which strengthens
the argument that taxes influence savings.<sup>103</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>A study in <I>The American Political Science Review</I> noted
that &quot;Nations...where the extractive [tax] capacity of government
did not significantly increase, relative to the economic product,
have, in a sense, opted for...an increasing rate of private capital
accumulation.&quot;<sup>104</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>Analyzing the decline in savings, a study by three experts concluded
that Social Security and other transfer programs have led to a
&quot;decline in U.S. saving.&quot;<sup>105</sup><BR>

<li>Two other economists also concluded that Social Security reduces
savings because workers no longer worry as much about retirement.

Growth Is Weaker When Government Penalizes Economic Behavior</b><BR>
<hr>
<P><ul>
<li>A 1983 World Bank study of twenty countries found that low-tax
nations experience faster growth, generate more investment, and
enjoy more rapid increases in productivity and standards of living
than high-tax nations.<sup>109</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>The tax system imposes between 22 cents and 54 cents of losses
for every dollar raised, according to a labor-supply economist.
For working wives, the losses are even higher:  more than 58 cents
for very dollar of tax revenue.<sup>110</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>Another study found that each 1.0 percent increase in the federal
tax burden reduces economic growth by 1.8 percent and lowers national
employment by 1.14 percent.<sup>111</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>According to a statistical study published in the <I>American
Economic Review</I>, for every dollar paid to the federal government
in taxes, 33.2 cents is lost to the economy.<sup>112</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>The increased tax burden between 1965 and 1980 drove an estimated
1.9 million people out of the U.S. labor force.<sup>113</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>Statistical research published in <I>Lloyd's Bank Review</I> has
found that in the U.K. each one percent rise in payroll taxes
causes hiring to fall by approximately 1.4 percent. The same study
estimated that each $1 of additional tax revenue costs $3 in lost
economic output.<sup>114</sup> <BR>

<P>
<li> A study printed in the <I>American Sociological Review</I> concluded
that &quot;Increases of one percent in the tax burden relative
to household income are directly associated with a 2.8 percent
decline in economic growth over three years, or just under one
percent annually.&quot;<sup>115</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>An <I>American Economic Review</I> study found that every dollar
of taxes could impose as much as $4 of lost output on the economy,
with the probable harm ranging between $1.32 and $1.47.<sup>116</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>A 1981 analysis of the Swedish economy in the <I>Journal of Political
Economy</I> found that &quot;The estimated long-run effects [of

percent and 80 percent of the additional wealth generated by increased
savings and investment goes to workers.<sup>118</sup><BR>

that the corporate income tax costs more in lost output than it
raises for the government. The &quot;excess burden&quot; is &quot;123

 The four Asian tigers adopted supply-side tax policies decades
before the Reagan and Thatcher revolutions. Finance ministers
oversaw systems of taxation that featured low rates and/or low
levels of direct taxation of individuals and businesses, the absence

taxation of 10 percentage points was predicted to decrease long-term
growth rates by 1.4 percentage points.&quot;<sup>127</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>According to Daniel Landau, &quot;The results of this study [published

are small businesses &#173;&#173; for example, sole proprietorships,

which file using the personal income tax. Others are entrepreneurs

<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxation is not the only government activity
that inflates the cost of hiring workers and reduces take&#173;home

liability costs, and labor laws drive up the cost of employment
and shrink workers' pay.
<P>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This process usually works by delaying,
reducing, or canceling wage increases. In most years, additional
investment and training increase worker productivity, making employees
more valuable and allowing businesses to increases wages. When
these productivity increases are accompanied by higher taxes,
however, it is government, not the workers, that captures all
the benefits.

<P>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its analysis of the Armey proposal,
the Treasury Department admitted that &quot;no attempt is made
to estimate the tax&#173;induced behavioral responses of either
individuals or corporations. Following the standard revenue estimating
conventions used by both the Office of Tax Analysis and the Joint
Committee on Taxation, the macroeconomic aggregates, such as the
level of compensation, prices, employment, and gross domestic
product, have been assumed to be unchanged by the proposal.&quot;

of GDP, this estimate understates the potential supply&#173;side
impact on revenues.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There has been a surge in support for a flat tax in recent months, thanks largely to the efforts of House Majority Leader Richard Armey (R-TX). Many Americans see the current tax system as a complicated failure that hinders the nation's growth while allowing the politically well-connected to manipulate the system to get special breaks not available to average workers and businesses. The flat tax, on the other hand, is simple, treats all taxpayers equally, and greatly increases incentives to work, save, and invest.
<p>
<b>WHAT IS A FLAT TAX? </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There have been several flat tax proposals over the years. While they differ in important ways, almost invariably they contain three features, each designed to fix a major problem with the current tax code. The major features of a flat tax are:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Single flat rate.</b> All flat tax proposals have a single tax rate that applies to all income subject to tax. Flat taxes also usually include provisions to ensure that all income is taxed just once. The actual tax imposed varies, with rates in some plans as low as 10 percent and in others approaching 20 percent. The low, flat rate solves the problem of high marginal tax rates by reducing penalties against working, saving, investing, and entrepreneurship.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Elimination of deductions, credits, and exemptions.</b> Flat tax proposals eliminate provisions of the code that bestow preferential tax treatment on certain behaviors and activities. Examples of such preferential treatment include deductions for home mortgage interest, charitable contributions, and state and local taxes. Eliminating these special provisions solves the problem of complexity, allowing taxpayers to file their tax returns on a postcard-sized form.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>No double taxation of savings and investment.</b> Flat tax proposals are designed to reduce or eliminate the tax code's bias against capital formation by ending the double taxation of income used for savings and investment. Simply stated, these plans often have the equivalent of a "super-IRA," which basically means that taxpayers would be taxed only on the portion of income that is consumed. This reform to ensure that income is not subject to a second level of taxation is needed since today's tax code penalizes future economic growth by discouraging capital formation.
<p>
<b>ADVANTAGES OF A FLAT TAX</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There are two principal arguments for a flat tax -- growth and simplicity. Many economists are attracted to the idea because the current tax system, with its high rates and multiple taxation of savings and investment, reduces growth, destroys jobs, and lowers incomes. A flat tax would not eliminate the damaging impact of taxes altogether. But by dramatically lowering rates and ending the tax code's bias against savings and investment, it would boost the economy's performance when compared with the present tax code. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For many Americans, however, the most persuasive feature of a flat tax is its simplicity. The complicated documents and instruction manuals taxpayers struggle to decipher every April would be replaced by a brief set of instructions and the lengthy forms by a simple postcard-sized return. This radical reform appeals to citizens who not only resent the time and expense consumed by their own tax forms, but also suspect that the existing maze of credits, deductions, and exemptions gives a special advantage to those who wield political power and can afford expert tax advisers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If enacted, a flat tax would yield major benefits to the nation, including: 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Faster economic growth.</b> A flat tax would spur increased work, saving, and investment. By increasing incentives to engage in productive economic behavior, it also would boost the economy's long-term growth rate. Even if a flat tax boosted long-term growth by as little as 0.5 percent, the income of the average family of four after ten years would still be as much as $5,000 higher than it would be if current tax laws remained in effect.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Instant wealth creation.</b> According to Harvard economist Dale Jorgenson, a flat tax would boost national wealth by some $1 trillion.<sup>1</sup>  The reason:  all income-producing assets would rise in value since the flat tax would increase the after-tax stream of income they generate.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Simplicity.</b> All taxpayers, from General Motors to a teenager flipping hamburgers, would be able to fill out their tax return on a postcard-sized form, and compliance costs would drop by tens of billions of dollars. According to a study conducted for the IRS, the current tax code requires taxpayers to devote 5.4 billion hours each year to their tax returns.<sup>2</sup>  Yet even this commitment of time is no guarantee of accuracy. The code is so complex that even tax experts and the Internal Revenue Service often make mistakes.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Fairness.</b> A flat tax would treat people equally. A very wealthy taxpayer with 1,000 times the taxable income of another taxpayer would pay 1,000 times more in taxes. No longer, however, would the tax code penalize success and discriminate against citizens on the basis of income.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>An end to micromanaging and political favoritism.</b> The flat tax gets rid of all deductions, loopholes, credits, and exemptions. Politicians would lose all ability to pick winners and losers, reward friends and punish enemies, and use the tax code to impose their values on the economy. According to Professor Alvin Rabushka of Stanford, co-author of <i>The Flat Tax</i>, $100 billion of uneconomical investments are made for tax purposes.<sup>3</sup>  Under a flat tax, those funds would be used to boost economic growth.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Increased civil liberties.</b> Under current law, people charged with murder have more rights than taxpayers dealing with the Internal Revenue Service. With a simpler, fairer tax code, infringements on freedom and privacy would fall dramatically.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Friendliness toward families.</b> Under the Armey proposal, a family of four would be able to shelter the first $36,800 of income from taxes. Other proposals include similar family allowances.
<p>
<b>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</b>
<p>
Q:  Should the rich pay more?
<p>
A:  Under a flat tax, the rich do pay more than the poor. A wealthy taxpayer with 100 times more taxable income than his neighbor will pay 100 times more in taxes. A flat tax, however, does not impose special penalties on those who contribute most to the nation's prosperity by subjecting them to punitive and discriminatory tax rates. For those who think the "rich" should pay a higher percentage of their income, the generous family allowance in, say, the Armey bill and others effectively creates a modest level of "progressivity." 
<p>
 Q:  Would a flat tax reduce the budget deficit?
<p>
A:  It depends on the tax rate, what happens to spending, and how much faster the economy grows under a flat tax. Even taking supply-side effects into consideration, at some point lower rates do translate into less revenue. The size of the personal exemption or family allowance also plays a key role since the decision to protect a certain amount of income generally means the rate on income above that level has to be higher. The Armey proposal probably would cause tax revenues to be lower, particularly in the short term. It also includes spending provisions that would cap the growth of government, however, so the long-term effect would be to reduce government borrowing.
<p>
Q:  What would happen to charitable contributions and housing markets?
<p>
A:  Some worry that the transition from the current system to a new one would create problems for charities and homeowners. History suggests these fears are exaggerated. During the 1980s, the top tax rate was reduced dramatically, falling from 70 percent in 1980 to 28 percent in 1988. The effect was to reduce the value of itemized deductions by the same amount, yet the value of housing did not drop. Similarly, charitable contributions actually rose sharply during the 1980s. This does not mean itemized deductions have no importance; it simply indicates that the benefits generated by a robust economy more than offset any costs associated with lost deductions. 
<p>
 Q:  Is there not a risk that politicians will raise tax rates in the future?
<p>
A:  As recent events demonstrate -- base broadening in 1986 followed by tax rate increases in 1990 and 1993 -- this is a real danger. But this is not an argument against the flat tax. It is further evidence of the need for a constitutional amendment that requires a supermajority to raise taxes.
<p>
Q:  Should the income tax simply be abolished and replaced by a sales tax?
<p>
A:  A flat tax does not eliminate the harmful aspects of income taxation; it only reduces them. Some have suggested that the better approach is to replace the income tax with a national tax on consumption. While attractive in theory, however, the danger is that Americans could end up not with a sales tax replacing the income tax but with a sales tax <i>and</i> an income tax. A sales tax should be considered only as part of a campaign to repeal the 16th Amendment (which allowed the income tax). Otherwise, such an effort could play into the hands of those who want to impose a national sales tax or value-added tax (VAT) as one more way for politicians to get new money to spend.
<p>
Q:  Does a flat tax eliminate the marriage penalty?
<p>
A:  It all depends on how the flat tax is structured. The marriage penalty refers to the increased tax a couple face if they choose to get married. A flat tax automatically solves part of this problem since it would no longer be possible for one spouse's income to push a couple into a higher tax bracket. The penalty also arises, however, if the personal exemption for a married couple is not twice the size of the exemption for those filing singly. By giving a married couple twice the exemption of a single filer, the Armey proposal solves this problem. 
<p>
 Q:  What counts as taxable income under a flat tax?  Fringe benefits?  Capital gains?
<p>
A:  A key principle of most flat tax proposals is that all income be taxed, but only once. Capital gains would be taxed at the business level, but the tax would not be applied a second time at the individual level. Dividend income would be taxed in similar fashion. Fringe benefits are not taxed at all under the current system, but they would be subject to tax, typically on the business level, under most flat tax proposals.
<p>
Q:  How does a flat tax affect business and payroll taxes?
<p>
A:  Most flat tax proposals, including the Armey plan, reform the corporate income tax as well as the personal income tax. Most, however, do not address payroll taxes. Both Social Security and Medicare face significant long-term structural problems. But while flat taxes could be designed to include substantial reform of Social Security and Medicare financing mechanisms, most lawmakers believe that problems of the income tax code should be addressed separately from those faced by retirement programs.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The current income tax system punishes the economy, imposes heavy compliance costs on taxpayers, rewards special interests, and makes America less competitive. A flat tax would reduce these ill effects dramatically. Perhaps more important, it would reduce the federal government's power over the lives of taxpayers and get the government out of the business of trying to micromanage the economy. There will never be a tax that is good for the economy, but the flat tax moves the system much closer to where it should be- raising the revenues government demands, but in the least destructive and least intrusive way possible.

<B> INTRODUCTION</B>
<P>
     Overtaxed American families finally have reason to cheer. There
is growing bipartisan sentiment in favor of passing tax cuts for
families with dependent children as part of next year's budget.
Congressional Republicans recently announced their commitment to
reintroducing next year the $500-per-child tax cut they proposed in
this year's Republican budget alternative. Also, reports now indicate
that there is renewed White House interest ("Clinton Still Favors
Middle-Class Tax Cut Despite Broken Vow," The Washington Times,
September 7, 1994. See also David Wessel, "For Clinton, the Politics
of a Tax Cut Are Sure to Clash With the Economics," The Wall Street
Journal, September 6, 1994; Hobart Rowen, "Economic, Political
Advisers Collide Over Clinton's Middle-Class Tax Cut," The Washington
Post, September 11, 1994.) in fulfilling Bill Clinton's campaign
promise to "grant additional tax relief to families with children."
(Bill Clinton and Al Gore, Putting People First (New York: Times
Books, 1992), p. 100.) Though skeptical voters may see such reports as
merely election year politics, there seems to be sufficient common
ground to give struggling families hope that tax cuts could move to
the top of Washington's agenda next year.<P>
     There are sound reasons why Washington should quit talking about
cutting taxes for families and take the necessary action to make it a
reality:
<P>
Families with children are overtaxed. In 1948, the average American
     family with children paid only 3 percent of its income to Uncle
     Sam. Today the same family pays 24.5 percent. (This figure
     includes federal income and Social Security payroll taxes.)
<P>
Families have been taxed out of house and home. The average family now
     loses $10,060 per year of its income due to the 45-year increase
     in federal taxes as a share of family income. This tax loss
     exceeds the annual cost of the average family home. (For more
     information, see Robert Rector, "Reducing the Crushing Tax Burden
     on America's Families," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 981,
     March 7, 1994.)
<P>
Millions of families stand to benefit. The families of 52 million
     American children, or 60 million families, are eligible for a
     $500-per-child tax credit.
<P>
Tax cuts are good for low-income families. A $500-per-child tax credit
     would eliminate the entire federal tax burden for 4.7 million
     working families.
<P>
Most families are middle-class. Nearly 86 percent of all children live
     in families with incomes below $75,000 per year -- middle-income
     by any standard -- and some 94 percent live in families with
     incomes below $100,000.
<P>
Cutting taxes for all families -- regardless of income -- is fair. A
     $500-per-child tax credit would give a family of four earning
     $18,000 per year a 33 percent tax cut and a family earning
     $40,000 per year a 10 percent tax cut, while giving a family
     earning $200,000 per year a cut of only 1.5 percent.
<P>
Family tax relief is good politics. The typical congressional district
     has some 117,000 children eligible for a $500 tax credit. This
     means families in the typical district would receive $59 million
     per year in tax relief.
<P>
     The family is the core of American society. It is the principal
mechanism through which values, knowledge, discipline, and motivation
are passed from one generation to the next. If the family is weakened,
government programs cannot repair the damage. But government policies,
especially tax policies, are undermining the American family. The
ever-increasing tax burden on families with children must be reversed
if American society is to regain its health and vitality.
<P>
<B> BIPARTISAN TALK OF TAX CUTS </B><P>
     During the presidential campaign, candidate Clinton promised to
reduce the taxes paid by families with children. "Virtually every
industrialized nation recognizes the importance of strong families in
its tax code; we should too," declared Clinton. "We will lower the tax
burden on middle class Americans.... " ("Putting People First: A
National Economic Strategy for America," Clinton campaign document,
1992, p. 9.)<P>
     Until recently, President Clinton has ignored that pledge to
relieve Washington's tax burden on working families with children. On
the contrary, Clinton last year signed the largest tax increase in
American history. As a result, taxpayers this year will send some $35
billion in extra taxes to Washington.<P>
     Families with children could have been spared this new burden. In
March, the Democrat-controlled Congress rejected the $500-per-child
tax credit plan contained in the fiscal 1995 budget alternative
proposed by House and Senate Republicans. Had it passed, some 60
million American families could have deducted $500 per year from their
tax bill for each child.<P>
     The Republican tax cut plan was financed through cuts in
government spending and thus would have had no impact on the federal
budget deficit. Over five years, implementing a $500-per-child tax
credit would reduce federal tax revenues by some $108 billion. This
revenue loss, however, would be fully matched by reductions in federal
spending. Thus, the deficit would neither increase nor decrease.
     House Republicans recently announced that they will reintroduce
this plan in next year's budget. Coincidentally, perhaps, the White
House reportedly is considering tax cuts for families with children
"when the time is right." (Steven Pearlstein, "Election Year Has White
House Pondering Tax Cut Politics," The Washington Post, September 9,
1994.)<P>
     The time is right for families who have seen their income tax
burden grow by over 300 percent during the past 45 years. Since there
is growing bipartisan sentiment for family tax cuts, now would be the
time for the White House and Members of Congress to promise American
families that they will include, at a minimum, a $500-per-child tax
credit in next year's budget.
<P>
<B> HOW WASHINGTON HAS HIKED TAXES ON CHILDREN </B><P>
<I>(This section is derived largely from Robert Rector, "How to
Strengthen America's Crumbling Families," Heritage Foundation
Backgrounder No. 894, April 28, 1992.)
</I><P>
     Federal taxation of families with children has increased
dramatically over the past four decades. In 1948, the typical family
of four paid just 3 percent of its income to the federal government in
direct taxes. In 1992, the equivalent family paid nearly 24.5 percent
of its income to the federal government. As Chart 1 shows, when state
and local and indirect federal taxes are included, the tax burden on
that family equals 37.6 percent of its income.<P>
     Federal income taxes have risen much faster for families with
children in the last four decades than for other groups of Americans.
The root cause of this growing anti-family bias in the federal income
tax code is the eroding value of the personal exemption. The personal
exemption for children was intended to offset part of the annual costs
of raising a child by allowing families to deduct an amount of money
from their taxable income. In 1948, the personal exemption was $600.
This was equal to roughly 17 percent of the median income of a family
of four, then $3,468. This shielded 68 percent of that family's income
from federal income tax. Families could protect most of the remaining
32 percent by itemizing deductions or by taking the standard
deduction. The result: in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the average
family with children paid little or no income tax.<P>
     In the past four decades, however, increases in the personal
exemption have lagged far behind the rise in incomes and inflation. As
the value of the personal exemption has declined, the income tax paid
by families with children has increased. For the personal exemption
today to have the same value relative to family income that it had in
1948, it would have to had been $7,000 in 1992 and would have to rise
to $8,000 in 1996.<P>
     The second tax blow to family finances has been the increase in
Social Security taxes, technically known as "payroll taxes." In 1948,
workers paid a two percent Social Security tax on annual wages of up
to $3,000; one percent was paid directly by the employee and one
percent indirectly by the employer through the so-called employer
share. (Liberal and conservative economists agree that both shares of
the Social Security tax are in fact taxes on workers' wages. See
Joseph A. Pechman and Benjamin A. Okner, Who Bears the Tax Burden?
(Washington, D.C.: The Brookings Institution, 1974), pp. 25-43.)<P>
     By 1992, combined Social Security taxes had risen to 15 percent
of wages on incomes up to $55,500. While all workers have suffered
from skyrocketing payroll taxes, the burden has been most severe for
working families with children. The reason for this is that Social
Security taxes, unlike regular income taxes, are not adjusted for the
number of dependents in the family. So a working parent trying to
support a family of four feels the sting of this tax far more sharply
than a single person at the same wage level. The effect of Social
Security taxation is particularly severe on lower-income parents; a
family with an income of $25,000 per year, for instance, pays $3,750
in payroll taxes.<P>
     The Government Assault on Family Income. Chart 2 shows the growth
in direct federal taxes as a share of median family income. In 1948,
effective tax rates equaled 3 percent of income for the average family
of four. By 1970, they had risen to 16 percent; by 1992, to 24.5
percent.<P>
     The income loss due to increased taxation has seriously strained
American family finances and profoundly affected American family life.
Chart 3 shows the effects of increases in federal income and Social
Security taxes since 1948 on the finances of the average family. Total
pre-tax income for the median family of four in 1992 was $47,787.
(Data from the U.S. Bureau of the Census. Total pre-tax income
includes the employer share of Social Security tax deduction from the
worker's wages.) After taxes, this family's income fell to $36,915. If
federal taxes as a percentage of family income were restored to 1948
levels, the family's post-tax income would have been $10,060 higher,
or $46,975. In other words, the loss of income in 1992 because of the
increase in federal taxes as a share of family income, due to the
falling value of the personal exemption and the rise in Social
Security taxes since the late 1940s, was $10,060.<P>
     This income loss severely affects the ability of families to
support themselves. The median price of a single-family home purchased
in 1992, for instance, was $103,700. The average annual mortgage
payment on such a home (including principal and interest) was $7,380.
Thus, the annual family income loss due to increased federal tax rates
for the average family in the last four decades actually exceeds the
annual cost of an average home mortgage by 36 percent.
<P>
<B> THE SOLUTION: TAX CREDITS FOR CHILDREN</B>
 <P>    There are two practical ways to reduce the tax burden on families
with children: first, by increasing the value of the personal
exemption and, second, through the use of tax credits. Although many
positive arguments can be made for increasing the personal exemption,
the tax credit is better policy in the long run because it is less
complex and because it can be used more effectively to reduce the tax
burden on lower-income working families.
  <P>   With an income tax exemption, income equal to the amount of the
exemption is excluded from tax. Thus, for a family in the 15 percent
income tax bracket, a $500 increase in the personal exemption
decreases income taxes owed by $75. A $1,000 increase in the
exemption, as some have proposed, decreases a family's tax burden by
$150. 
   <P>  By contrast, under a tax credit, the amount of the credit is
deducted from taxes paid, directly reducing tax liability. Thus, for
the same family in the 15 percent income tax bracket, a $500 credit
decreases net taxes by $500. Another important difference between the
credit and the increased exemption is that a tax credit can be applied
to both income and Social Security taxes (both the employer's and
employee's share). Because the current personal exemption, now set at
$2,350, is already sufficient to eliminate most or all of the income
tax liability for many low-income families, increasing its value will
protect no more of their income from the IRS. A credit, though, could
relieve this family's income tax liability and offset a portion of its
Social Security taxes.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Example: A family of four with a gross earned income of $20,000 has a
     total federal tax liability of $3,615: $555 in income taxes and
     $3,060 in payroll taxes (both shares). A $1,000 increase in the
     personal exemption for children would reduce this family's tax
     burden by only $300 ($150 for each child), a tax cut of less than
     10 percent. However, a $500-per-child tax credit would reduce the
     family's total tax bill by $1,000, enough to eliminate their
     income tax burden and reduce their Social Security taxes by an
     additional $445. Overall, they would see their total federal tax
     burden reduced by over 27 percent. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
<B> The $500-per-child Tax Credit is Not Refundable</B>
  <P>   When Republicans proposed the $500-per-child tax credit during
this spring's budget debate, the White House and congressional
Democrats argued that such a credit was not needed because they had
expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in the 1993 tax bill.
This expanded EITC, they said, delivered tax cuts to millions of
working families with children. Such a claim is misleading and ignores
the difference between a wage subsidy and a tax cut.
  <P>   The EITC is a wage supplement for working families with children
with incomes up to $26,000 per year. It is intended to offset the
Social Security tax burden on these families and increase their wages
through a cash subsidy. As shown in Chart 4, the amount of cash
returned to some families through the EITC can exceed their entire tax
burden. Technically, this means the EITC is "refundable."
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Example: A family of four earning $14,000 (slightly below the official
     poverty level) will pay no income taxes but will bear a Social
     Security tax burden of roughly $2,140. This family is eligible to
     receive, however, some $2,400 from the EITC, nearly $260 more
     than their entire tax burden. For some working families, the cash
     value of the EITC can exceed their entire federal tax liability
     by as much as 60 percent. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
     By contrast, the $500-per-child tax credit is not refundable.
This means that the value of a family's tax relief may not exceed
their tax burden. However, as Chart 4 shows, low - and modest-income
families still would have a large share of their total tax burden
eased by such a credit.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Example: A family of four earning $17,000 per year may still have a
     total tax burden of roughly $840 after deductions and after
     receiving the EITC wage subsidy. Though a $500-per-child tax
     credit might otherwise give them $1,000 in total tax relief
     because of their two children, the fact that this credit is not
     refundable allows them to deduct only what they owe -- $840 --
     from their tax bill.
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
<B> Millions of Families Shielded from the IRS</B>
<P>     Some Democrats argued during last spring's budget debate that the
$500-per-child tax credit was not "fair" because families earning
below $16,000 per year would not get a tax cut. This argument is
ridiculous, as the preceding examples demonstrate. It is clearly
impossible to give a tax cut to families who not only do not pay in
federal taxes, but also stand to receive a substantial cash wage
subsidy from the federal government.
    <P> But for many low-income working families who do pay taxes, a $500
per-child tax credit would bring badly needed relief. Indeed,
according to The Heritage Foundation's tax simulation model, based
upon the U.S. Bureau of the Census 1992 Current Population Survey,
some 4.7 million working families would have their entire federal tax
liability eliminated if Congress enacted a $500-per-child tax credit.
  <P>   Millions of other low - or modest-income families might not have
their entire tax burden eliminated by such a credit, but they
certainly would see a dramatic decline in their tax bill, and thus a
dramatic increase in their take-home pay.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Example: A family earning $28,000 per year -- and not eligible for the
     EITC -- would have 57 percent of their income tax bill and 17
     percent of their total federal tax bill (income and payroll taxes
     totaling over $6,000) erased by a $500-per-child tax credit.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B> Tax Cuts for 60 Million Families</B>
  <P>   Nationwide, the families of some 52 million American children,
some 60 million families in all, would be eligible for such a $500-
per-child tax credit. Most of the families affected by such a tax cut
fall within what can be considered the middle class. Indeed, nearly 86
percent of all children in America live in families with gross annual
incomes below $75,000 per year -- middle-class by any standard. In
fact, some 94 percent of all children live in families with gross
annual incomes below $100,000. 
   <P>  Tax cuts would bring badly needed stability to many families'
finances. As Chart 5 shows, for the typical family of four earning
$40,000 per year, a $500-per-child tax cut would cut their $9,500
total tax bill by some 10.4 percent, enough to pay one month's
mortgage on the average home.
  <P>   Upper-middle-class families will receive more modest relief. A
family earning $75,000 per year loses nearly $20,000 (approximately 27
percent of their income) to the IRS each year. A $500 tax credit for
each child would mean only a 5 percent tax cut for this family.
<P>
<B> Family Tax Relief Should Not Be Means-Tested</B>
  <P>   Every working family raising the next generation of Americans is
overtaxed. Thus, every working family, regardless of income, should be
eligible for the $500-per-child tax credit. Many Democrat Members of
Congress have argued that giving the same amount of tax relief to
middle-income families as upper-income families is not "fair." They
argue that such a credit should be "means-tested," meaning that
eligibility for the credit should be limited to families within
specified income levels, such as families earning below $75,000 per
year.
 <P>    Means-testing the family tax credit would be a serious mistake.
The tax code should not penalize children simply because of the income
of their parents. (The Dependent Care Tax Credit (DCTC) is not means-
tested. The credit is used by working families -- many of whom are
dual-income and prosperous -- who place their children in day care.)
Because of the nature of most working careers, very few children live
in upper-income families. In fact, fewer than 83,000 live in families
with annual incomes above $200,000 per year, just 0.17 percent of all
American families. (U. S. Bureau of the Census 1992 Current Population
Survey.) Most upper-income parents hit their full earning potential
well after their children become adults themselves.
  <P>   Because of this country's progressive tax system, in which
wealthier taxpayers face higher income tax rates and stingier
deductions, the IRS punishes upper-income families far more severely
than middle-income families. Chart 5 shows, for example, that a family
of four earning $200,000 per year loses 33 percent of its income to
Uncle Sam, almost 10 percent more than is paid by the typical American
family. 
  <P>   Even within this country's progressive tax structure, these
families should still be allowed to take a $500-per-child tax credit.
The reason: the credit is a progressive tax cut by definition. The
value of a $500 credit is greater for low-income families than for
upper-income families. As Chart 5 shows, such a credit for the typical
family of four amounts to a 10.4 percent cut in taxes. But the same
credit for a family earning $200,000 per year amounts to a cut of only
1.5 percent. Members of Congress who believe in a progressive tax
system, should agree that this is "fair."
<P>
<B> Use Spending Cuts to Finance Tax Cuts</B>
  <P>   Washington's budget rules require that revenues lost to the
Treasury from tax cuts must be matched or offset by some combination
of reductions in spending or by increases in other tax revenues.
Recent reports indicate that if the White House does introduce a
family tax cut plan, those cuts would be financed primarily through
higher taxes on other taxpayers. Such a strategy would be wrong.
   <P> There are two important reasons why tax cuts should be financed
by cuts in spending. First, federal spending has grown massively over
the past 45 years, resulting in a greater share of family income lost
to federal taxes. The federal government now spends about $1.5
trillion per year, six times as much as it did in 1948, after
adjusting for inflation. Indeed, in 1993, Washington consumed 22.4
percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) compared to just 12.1
percent in 1948, an 85 percent increase. Over the next five years,
this trend will continue.
 <P>    According to the Congressional Budget Office, federal spending
will grow by nearly $400 billion by fiscal 1999, far outpacing the
projected $367 billion growth in tax revenues. (Congressional Budget
Office, An Economic and Budget Outlook, August 1994, p. 31.) This
means that the federal deficit, after dipping slightly next year to
$162 billion, will again begin to climb. By fiscal 1999, projects CBO,
the deficit will hit $231 billion and reach nearly $400 billion by
fiscal 2004. If last year's deficit reduction plan -- which contained
the largest tax increase in history -- worked as its supporters have
claimed, this should not be happening. This upward trend certainly
makes it likely that politicians once again will have to ask taxpayers
to bear higher taxes in order to meet Washington's insatiable appetite
for spending.
   <P>  The persistent growth of government should be reversed by using
the savings achieved by substantial cuts in government spending to
finance tax cuts for families with children. Such a strategy would
shift resources away from government and back to taxpayers, not from
one group of taxpayers to another.
 <P>    Second, linking cuts in spending directly to cuts in family taxes
gives taxpayers a financial stake in the budget process and, thus, an
incentive to counter the advocates of government programs. Such a
strategy can sugar-coat the political "pain" of spending cuts,
lessening the opposition of special interests who benefit from federal
largess. Absent the reward of a $500-per-child tax cut, few taxpayers
would bother to lobby for spending cuts because, under normal
circumstances, few perceive any tangible benefit from cuts in federal
spending. However, the advocates of, say, a $1 billion federal program
do have a serious financial interest in maintaining that spending and
are willing to invest considerable resources in lobbying to convince
Members of Congress not to cut the program.
  <P>   But these political dynamics change when spending cuts are linked
to tax cuts. Politicians who are accustomed to viewing spending cuts
only in terms of the pain they inflict on certain interest groups can
now see them in terms of the large number of families helped by those
cuts. For example, the savings achieved by eliminating a $1 billion
federal program are sufficient to finance a $500-per-child tax cut for
2 million American families. Thus, the constituency that stands to
benefit from elimination of the program is far larger than the number
of those who stand to lose. If Members of Congress enacted a $500-per-
child tax cut for every working family in America, they would empower
60 million advocates of spending cuts to stand up to Washington's
special interests.
<P>
<B> All Tax Cuts Are Local</B>
 <P>    Even the most pro-family Member of Congress may be reluctant to
cut spending in order to finance tax cuts. This is because Members
like to take political credit for "bringing home the bacon,"
demonstrating to voters back home how effective they are in looking
out for the interests of their congressional districts. With every
federal road project, research grant, and construction contract,
Members issue press releases announcing how many jobs will be created
or how many constituents will benefit from this infusion of federal
funds. For many Members of Congress, cutting taxes for families may
not appear to lend itself to such credit-taking.
   <P>  This impression is mistaken. Based on Census Bureau data,
Heritage Foundation analysts have calculated the total dollar value of
a $500-per-child tax credit for every state and congressional
district. These figures are contained in the Appendix to this paper
(county data are available upon request). While the number in each
congressional district varies greatly, the average district has
117,000 children. At $500 per child, this means the average district
will receive nearly $59 million in family tax relief each year.
   <P>  It is difficult to imagine that any single federal spending
project of similar magnitude could benefit as many constituents at the
same time. Thus, the political advantages of family tax relief would
more than seem to outweigh the political disadvantages of cutting
federal spending.
<P>
<B> CONCLUSION</B>
 <P>    The good news for millions of hard-working American families is
that there is growing bipartisan talk of cutting taxes for families
with dependent children. The bad news for the same families is that
this talk may not turn into action. Congress and the White House
should commit themselves now to enacting a $500-per-child tax credit
in next year's budget. 
 <P>    Such a measure would bring financial stability to the parents of
52 million American children, eliminating the entire federal tax
burden for 4.7 million working families. Nearly 86 percent of the
children eligible for this credit live in families with gross annual
incomes below $75,000, middle-class by any standard. For the typical
family of four, a $500-per-child tax credit would mean a 10 percent
cut in the overall federal tax burden. Finally, family tax relief is
good politics. Families in the typical congressional district would
receive roughly $59 million per year in tax relief, effectively
creating a powerful constituency for cutting wasteful government
spending. 
   <P>  Embattled American families do not need "investment" spending or
new social programs to improve their well-being. Such government
assistance has done little or nothing to help families, and paying for
more government programs only increases their tax burden. The best way
for the federal government to strengthen families and assist parents
in their vital role of raising the next generation of Americans is to
reduce their tax burden.

 <B> APPENDIX </B><P>
     Based on Census Bureau data, Heritage Foundation scholars have
calculated the total value of a $500-per-child tax credit for each
state and congressional district.
<P>     Nationally, there are nearly 51 million children eligible for
such a credit. Thus, in the first year of the plan, nearly $25.5
billion would be returned to American families. These results are
summarized in the first table in this appendix.
  <P>   While the number of children in each congressional district
varies greatly, the average district has 117,000 children. At $500 per
child, this means the average district will receive some $58.7 million
in family tax relief each year. The second table lists the
congressional districts by state. Included in the table are: the
number of eligible children in the district, the total amount of money
the district will receive in family tax relief, and the name of the
member representing the district.
<P>     Heritage analysts also have calculated the value of the $500-per-
child tax credit for every county in the U.S. These data are available
on request.

<P>

<hr>
<P>
 After you finally completed your income tax return last April
and mailed it off, you may have needed to get away for a few days.
 So you may have decided to spend a few nights at your favorite
getaway.  What you probably didn't realize was how much you were
<a href="/atr/tax-presentation/hotloped.html">paying in taxes again</a> when you paid your hotel bill.
<P>
 The consumer generally must pay a state sales and use tax on
the hotel room of about 7%.  Local occupancy taxes charge another
6%.  This means the consumer directly pays at least 13% of the
cost of a hotel room in taxes.
<P>
 But that is just the beginning.  Out of the amount the consumer
pays to the hotel, the hotel must pay Federal income taxes, state
income taxes, Federal payroll taxes, sales taxes, capital gains
taxes, unemployment insurance taxes, workmen's compensation taxes,
business license taxes and fees, utility taxes, local property
taxes, and any local income taxes.  The hotel must also pay Federal
and state excise taxes on its telephones.
<P>
 Altogether, these taxes average about 30% of the price of a hotel
room.  Counting the taxes paid directly by the consumer, this
means about 43% of what you pay for a hotel room goes to the government
in taxes rather than for the room.  Out of an average price for
hotel rooms of $80 per night, this means about $34.40 goes for
taxes.  Everything that goes into building and maintaining the
hotel room is paid for by the 57% of the rate charged to the consumer,
or about $45.60 on average, remaining after taxes are paid.
<P>
 A number of jurisdictions impose additional taxes on hotel guests
as well.  This includes a nightly utility tax, a liquor excise
tax, and a food and beverage tax.  A telephone excise tax is also
charged on the use of all phones.
<P>
 These taxes are unfair to workers.  In a democracy, taxes should
not be hidden in the prices of products people buy.  They should
be explicit and clear, so that voters can determine whether they
think those taxes are worth what they are getting from their government.
<P>
 Thomas Jefferson wrote, &quot;Government should not take out
of the mouth of labor the bread that it has earned.&quot;  But
that is exactly what our greedy and overreaching government does
today.  It taxes you on your income when you earn it, and taxes
it again when you spend it, and taxes you over and over again
along the way.  As a result, the average family today actually
pays more in taxes than on food, clothing, and shelter combined.
<P>
 Tax relief for working people is long overdue.  Such tax reduction
would give workers more control over their own incomes and economic
future.  A major tax reduction would also greatly stimulate the
economy, leading to more jobs, higher wages, and expanded economic
opportunity and prosperity.
<P>

<h2><center><I><B>Individuals Who Save Get Third-Class 
Treatment Under The Ordinary Income Tax</h2></center></B></I>
<hr>
<P>
Our government rather freely provides loans to many foreign governments,
some of whom are (or were) communist, socialist, big government
central planners, dictators, or scoundrels.  Not infrequently,
these loans carry a zero rate of interest or a rate that's far
below market.  No collateral is required.
<P>
Many, if not most, of these loans are eventually written off as
defaults, severely written down, or rolled over with little prospect
for repayment.  In aggregate, these loans (and gifts or subsidies)
from our taxpayers' pockets amount to mega-billions of dollars
every year.
<P>
Contrast these loans, gifts, or subsidies to foreigners with the
refusal of our government to properly consider its own taxpayers'
IRA assets as representing private saving that will enhance the
government's tax revenues, not reduce them!
<P>
Rather than considering IRAs as an asset, the government treats
IRA tax deferrals as wasted spending; not unlike the writing off
of a governmental loan to, or subsidized trade with, Iraq, or
some socialist/communist country.
<P>
Completely ignored by the government are the facts that IRA assets:
 (a) are held in trust (by law) for the future payment of taxes;
(b) are invested in income-producing assets (not some foreign
government's and bureaucracy's boondoggle); (c) provide growing
amounts of capital for business enterprises and other productive
private uses, including jobs; (d) create ever-growing gains that
contribute to the economic growth of our nation; and (e) provide
tax revenue gains for our government.
<P>
It's amazing and most distressing to recognize how our government
freely gives away taxpayer money to foreigners (and then cavalierly
writes it off), while denying its taxpayers the eminently sound
financial structure of universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs,
so that all taxpayers will save more to produce more!  Taxing
saving &quot;twice&quot; or more is bad enough, but then giving
away those diminished tax receipts to fund foreign boondoggles
equals third-class or &quot;steerage&quot; treatment for U.S.
taxpayers who save and invest!
<P>
<I>It's time for all savers and investors to stand up and fight
for tax sanity and their financial well-being.</I>

<title>WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL</title>

<body>

<center>

<img src="/townhall/FRC/fampol/fampolgn.gif">

<h1>With Liberty and Justice for All</h1>
<h2><i>Redefining the Educational Choice Debate</i></h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>E</font>ducation is a so-called mixed good. It offers both 
public and private benefits. Thus, the debate over education policy in 
America is often cast as a clash between public and private interests,
a conflict between equity and liberty. In the words of social
scientist James Coleman:

<p><blockquote>

<i>[C]ontradictions . . . arise out of two simultaneously-held values
that are very relevant to most Americans. The first is the autonomy
and choice of parents to do all they can to raise their children
to adulthood. The second is the value we place on having a society
that is not fragmented by divisions imposed by segregated or exclusive
upbringing.</i>[1]

</blockquote><p>

Liberty and equity are not mutually-exclusive concepts. But if
their proper relationship is to be achieved, policymakers must
develop a new understanding of equal opportunity based on liberty.
Education policy in America today often fails to pay respect to
the need for parents to direct their children's upbringing. Indeed,
calls for parental choice in education typically run headlong
into the myth of the &quot;common school&quot; and the rhetoric
of &quot;equal opportunity&quot; -- outmoded ideas which the education
establishment successfully employs to protect its vested interest.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Paine believed that most poor<br>
parents were well aware of the<br>
benefits of education and that<br>
heavy taxation was the chief<br>
cause of their under-investment<br>
in education.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Thus, a gradual &quot;demythologizing&quot; of the common school
as the bulwark of democracy and the ultimate expression of equal
opportunity will be necessary to sustain any hope of expanding
private liberty (and improving student performance) through parental
choice in education. Otherwise, the political power of the teacher
unions and the philosophical tensions inherent in education will
continue to render choice an elusive goal.

<p>

<center><h3>No Paine, No Gain</h3></center>

<p>

Political theorists have long debated whether government should
be involved in education in any capacity. More than two centuries
ago, Thomas Jefferson made an eloquent case for a state role in
education in a letter to George Wythe:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Preach, my dear Sir, a crusade against ignorance, establish and
improve the law for educating the common people. Let our countrymen
know that the people alone can protect us against these evils,
and that the tax which will be paid for this purpose is not more
than the thousandth part of what will be paid to kings, priests
and nobles who will rise up among us if we leave the people in
ignorance.</i>[2]

</blockquote><p>

Interestingly, many of the classical economists who were busy
ardently defending laissez-faire economic policies in Jefferson's
day were also forceful advocates of a state role in education.
Adam Smith argued in <I>The Wealth of Nations</I> that the market
would fail to capture the social benefits of education because
of the divergence between public and private interests.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Mill's sympathy for government<br>
paternalism did not extend to<br>
justifying inefficient and<br>
inferior education in the name<br>
of broad public purposes.
</i></b></font>
</center>

But Smith stopped short of issuing an unqualified endorsement
of state-sponsored education. Contrasting the quality of education
under public and private arrangement, Smith argued that private
schools were more successful in cultivating skills in reading,
writing and arithmetic.[3] While eager to promote the education of
all students, Smith did not share the conviction of Jeremy Bentham
and other utilitarians that government could successfully administer
education. Instead, he argued for a wide dispersal of educational
expenditure and decision-making to prevent teacher compensation
from being made independent of effort.

<p>

Similarly, Thomas Paine believed that most poor parents were well
aware of the benefits of education and that heavy taxation was
the chief cause of their underinvestment in education. Paine proposed
a much more far-reaching decentralization of authority that would
further increase parental freedom of choice and competition among
schools. In <I>The Rights of Man</I>, he proposed &quot;to make
a remission of taxes to every poor family out of the surplus taxes
. . . enjoining the parents of such children to send them to 
school.&quot;[4]

<p>

John Stuart Mill's writings on the question of state education
are ambiguous and at times self-contradictory because he, too,
was acutely aware of the tension between personal liberty and
the public purposes of education. On the one hand, Mill differed
from Paine. Mill believed that government must control education
because parents were incompetent to judge their children's best
interests. But in a moment of supreme doubt, he wrote: &quot;A
general State education is a mere contrivance for moulding [sic]
people to be exactly like one another. . . it establishes a despotism
over the mind.&quot;[5] Mill's enthusiasm for state schools, moreover,
depended on the assumption that the public schools would always
be superior to private institutions. He wrote in <I>On Liberty</I>
that a state school should exist, &quot;if it exist at all, as
one among many competing experiments, carried on for the purpose
of example and stimulus, to keep the others up to a certain standard
of excellence.&quot;[6] Mill's sympathy for government paternalism
did not extend to justifying inefficient and inferior education
in the name of broad public purposes.

<p>

In the earliest years of the Republic, parental fees provided
the majority of funding for schools, as Adam Smith and Thomas
Paine had recommended. As parents exercised their freedom to determine
the shape of their children's education, the great heterogeneity
of the nation expressed itself in the diversity and autonomy of
its local schools.

<p>

Nineteenth century reformers, however, launched a campaign to
redefine education as the means to restore morality, justice and
social conformity. A public-purpose rationale began to triumph
over respect for the private benefits afforded parents by the
freedom and genuine diversity in the schools. Under Horace Mann's
leadership, reformers succeeded in creating a system that was
&quot;bureaucratic and professional, designed to ensure, so the
story goes, that education would be taken out of politics and
placed in the hands of impartial experts devoted to the public
interest.&quot; It was the &quot;one best system,&quot; also referred
to as the &quot;common school.&quot;[7]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Egalitarian democracy was now operationally-defined as centrally-planned
uniformity, secured through bureaucratic arrangements. According
to education historian E.G. West, however, it was teachers and
government officials, not discontented parents, who brought about
the change.[8] And, as economist Milton Friedman has observed, it
was hardly an apolitical enterprise: &quot;Though the arguments
were all pitched in terms of the public interest, much of the
support of teachers and administrators for the public school movement
derived from a narrow self-interest,&quot; including greater control
over the schools and almost guaranteed salaries now that government
was the paymaster.[9] Friedman notes that reformers simply capitalized
on public sympathy for the concept of equal opportunity to succeed
in establishing universal, &quot;free&quot; and compulsory education.[10]
That same egalitarian impulse had already found private expression
in the form of charity schools and the adjustment of school fees
according to means, as West and other historians report.[11]

<p>

<center><h3>From Equity to Liberty</h3></center>

<p>

Over the last three decades, it has become increasingly evident
that the public school is failing to fulfill its high-minded egalitarian
purpose. Equity &quot;based on homogeneity has occurred only by
discriminating against some, segregating others, and denying the
possibilities of alternative ways of life.&quot;[12] Historian David
Cohen explains:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Education has long been seen as both the chief antidote to
poverty and the principal means for assimilating ethnic and racial
minorities. . . . Since [the late 1960s], however, events have
cast serious doubt on these two venerable articles of faith .
. . that education is the high road to equality or social 
integration.</i>[13]

</blockquote><p>

In 1966, Coleman released his now-famous Equality of Educational
Opportunity report, concluding that differences in the quality
of the nation's schools bear only a trivial relationship to differences
in the educational achievement of the nation's students. Coleman's
report posed a fundamental question: If schools have little effect
on differences in children's achievement, is state-controlled
public education the key to social justice?

<p>

At about the same time, empirical evidence of low academic performance
in the public schools caused Friedman to start repopularizing
criticisms of the &quot;common school&quot; first made by Smith,
Paine, and Mill. As an alternative, Friedman began calling for
educational vouchers that would give parents freedom of choice,
thereby increasing competitive supply. Given the ineffectiveness
of the present education system, he asked rhetorically, &quot;Wherein
are the 'neighborhood effects' that justify such use of tax 
money?&quot;[14]

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

To broaden the base of potential support for vouchers, Friedman
took pains to argue that his proposal would actually enhance equality
of opportunity. Under the current system, he noted, wealthy families
have significantly more freedom of choice than low-income families.
Poor families are trapped in poor school districts. They lack
the resources to move or to choose private schools. &quot;Under
present arrangements, stratification of residential areas effectively
restricts the intermingling of children from decidedly different
backgrounds. . . . Our present system, far from equalizing opportunity,
very likely does the opposite.&quot;[15]

<p>

While Friedman questioned the practical interpretation of the
public purposes of education, he appealed primarily to a philosophical
commitment to individual liberty. &quot;Persuasive as [the] argument
[for achieving a common core of values] is, . . . [o]n grounds
of principle, it conflicts with the preservation of freedom itself,&quot;
he wrote.[16] Friedman suggested that the circumstances that justified
the definition of education as a predominantly public good in
the Progressive Era were eclipsed by circumstances that now favor
the definition of education as a private good.

<p>

While vouchers appealed to Friedman as a means to introduce the
efficiency of the market into education, liberal social analyst
Christopher Jencks embraced vouchers as a means to equalize opportunity
by improving the education of low-income and minority children.
Favoring egalitarian over libertarian goals, he designed a voucher
experiment for the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) in the
1960s that included heavy regulatory burdens governing admissions
policies, fiscal incentives for schools to accept poor students,
and the creation of an educational voucher agency to oversee the
program. The OEO voucher experiment demonstrated the problems
of policy design and political opposition that would hamper implementation
of educational choice even after changing philosophical definitions
had begun to broaden its appeal.

<p>

In most of the prospective test sites, local educators and grass-roots
organizations blocked Jencks' proposal. &quot;In effect, there
was no constituency for a plan that threatened the job security
of teachers [and] compromised the independence of private schools.&quot;[17]
Finally, the Alum Rock school district in California agreed to
the voucher demonstration; but, &quot;the process of negotiation
between federal sponsors and local interest groups resulted in
a dramatic alteration of the voucher plan. Ultimately, no private
schools participated . . . [and] [n]o teachers in unpopular programs
lost their jobs. In fact, none of the incentives usually thought
to spur initiative in the private sector were present in Alum
Rock.&quot;[18] Interestingly, Jencks and his associates concluded
that, &quot;if restrictions are too rigid, a voucher system is
likely to be indistinguishable from the present public school
system.&quot;[19] Conservatives argued that the regulations Jencks
himself proposed to satisfy equity requirements emasculated the
voucher concept, precluding an adequate test of educational choice.

<p>

The unregulated character of Friedman's proposals, however, still
posed too great a risk to liberal policymakers to win passage.
Writing at the time, education analyst Dennis Doyle observed:

<p><blockquote>

<i>The basic reason that policymakers will not support either
Jencks or Friedman vouchers is that the dimension of vouchers
that makes them interesting -- choice -- still threatens an egalitarian
society. At the present time only one important interest group
might change this, and that group is minorities in general, especially
[black Americans]. . . . [T]here is a growing body of minority
and black opinion which holds that choice itself is the key to
equality -- and that without choice, equal educational opportunity
will remain unfulfilled.</i>[20]

</blockquote><p>

Alum Rock proved to be an early sign of increasing national interest
in the concept of educational choice -- coupled with persistently
dubious prospects for political passage of any far-reaching voucher
proposal.

<p>

<center><h3>Toward a Philosophical Redefinition</h3></center>

<p>

As the limitations of the common school have grown increasingly
obvious and the case for educational choice more plausible, choice
opponents have clung more desperately to the &quot;myth of the
common school&quot; as a pluralist and apolitical institution.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>

families trapped in poor<br>
school districts.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

From the outset, a primary objective of the common school was
the socialization of all children in an overtly religious, yet
non-sectarian environment. Educator Charles Glenn's book <I>The
Myth of the Common School</I> portrays the movement toward state
education as a mission to acculturate immigrants into the predominantly
Protestant culture of 19th-century America. The religion of the
early common school was a least-common-denominator Christianity
tending toward the Unitarianism of the schools' founding fathers.
Central Protestant doctrines like sin, and salvation by faith
in Christ were expunged as committee review of curriculum and
teaching took hold, implanting a more muted religion of good and
evil, along with a hefty dose of strictly civic morality. Catholics,
Jews, and Lutherans, often the alien target of the common school
movement, found their beliefs discouraged and discounted as 
&quot;sectarian&quot; in the new schools. So began the tradition of 
&quot;publicly-sponsored orthodoxy,&quot; as long-time education observer 
Stephen Arons calls it, in which the government defines through the 
public schools a set of &quot;normative&quot; values and beliefs.[21]

<p>

But even genuine efforts to find common ground are of little avail,
for education is the very enterprise of discovering and defending
first principles. It cannot be replaced by some &quot;value-neutral&quot;
process. As Aristotle said, education is about teaching the young
to lead the good life. Since men disagree about what the good
life is, men disagree about education. Glenn muses that &quot;we
may have set ourselves an impossible task in seeking to provide
a single model of education that is to be at once capable of nurturing
character and civic virtue and yet inoffensive to the conviction
of any parent.&quot;[22] Reformers eager to employ the common school
as an agent of social change offend parents' beliefs all the more.

<p>

The socialization mission is a flat violation of families' First
Amendment freedoms of belief and expression, argues Arons. The
First Amendment, he believes, not only protects parents' freedom
to express their beliefs, but also to pass on those beliefs to
their children.[23] Yet, compulsory public education forces parents
to surrender these tender matters of conscience to the political
majority. Aron continues, &quot;The level of coercion required
to resolve these value conflicts would be inconsistent with personal
liberty and political democracy.&quot;[24] While some argue that private
schools provide an adequate escape hatch from the public schools,
Arons argues that requiring parents to purchase their First Amendment
freedoms is as crass as taxing voters to enter the polls.

<p>

Thus, he concludes: &quot;[T]he present structure of public education
is unconstitutional because the primary victims of the unequal
distribution of liberty are the poor, working people and racial
minorities.&quot;[25] The comment reflects a subtle but critically
important reframing of the equity debate. By defining equity as
more nearly an &quot;equality of liberty,&quot; Arons offers a
fledgling strategy to help temper sharp oscillations between liberty
and equity, or private and public purposes, in education.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<font size=+1><b><i>

private good.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

But Arons also casts specific doubt on the priority of the public
benefits of education: &quot;The legitimacy of the political consensus,
however weak, may be eliminated by government interference in
the process of belief and value formation.&quot;[26] Arons' searching
concern echoes the early 20th-century cautions of Princeton theologian
J. Gresham Machen that monopolistic state education would be &quot;the
most effective engine of tyranny and intellectual stagnation that
has yet been devised.&quot;[27] Machen argued that only competition
with private schools would keep the state schools healthy and
thus admonished a group of Christian school educators, &quot;May
the distinctiveness of your Christian schools never be lost; may
it never give place, by a false 'Americanization,' to a drab uniformity
which is the most un-American thing that could possibly be 
conceived!&quot;[28]

<p>

If coercion on matters of conscience results in further splintering
of communities, Arons seems to suggest government monopoly of
education may negate its public benefits altogether.

<p>

<center><h3>Are Vouchers the Right Mechanism?</h3></center>

<p>

If the argument for parental choice in education is based on the
philosophy of freedom from coercion, then the mechanism for choice
cannot be permitted to increase state coercion of parents or the
private sector.

<p>

Funding and regulation are the two defining characteristics of
public agencies, nearly always appearing hand in hand. The unhappy
results are dramatically evident in Canada, where some provinces'
religious and private schools are a part of the public school
system and receive state funding. Today many religious schools
depend heavily on subsidies from the Canadian government and have
subsequently lost their defining character.[29]

<p>

While voucher proponents originally made little distinction, today
they are careful to specify that voucher payments must flow directly
to parents or students -- not to private institutions. First Amendment
attorney William Bentley Ball argues that such precision is necessary
to sidestep potential entanglement problems.[30]

<p>

Nevertheless, many perceive the difference between aid to religious
institutions and aid to individuals to be only semantic and believe
vouchers do pose a threat to religious schools.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The threat of future tinkering with the language of such laws
should not be dismissed, according to education researcher Chester
Finn. &quot;Some [private schools] to be sure, like to think they...can
obtain aid without saddling themselves with unacceptable forms
of regulation. But most...are more or less resigned to amalgamating
or choosing between assistance and autonomy.&quot;[31]

<p>

In the current federal political landscape, the compromises necessary
to achieve a winning voucher proposal come at too dear a price
for many would-be supporters. In the recent debate over vouchers
for the District of Columbia, the political payoff for the key
support of centrist Sen. Jim Jeffords (R-Vt.) was the surrender
of the basic principle for which every true religious school exists:
the fusion of faith and learning. Jeffords demanded and won the
addition of two provisions regarding religion. The first established
a religious opt-in provision requiring written consent from parents
for students to participate in religious courses or activities.
The second was even more worrisome to friends of religious liberty,
mandating that no school could use the voucher money to pay for
its religious courses or activities. Given such provisions, James
Cardinal Hickey made it clear that schools of the Archiocese of
Washington, D.C. would not participate in the voucher program.
With Catholic schools totalling some 80 percent of the private
schools in the city, the D.C. voucher scenario was nearly a re-run
of Alum Rock.

<p>

<center><h3>Concerns Specific to Means-Tested Vouchers</h3></center>

<p>

Means-tested vouchers, in particular, suffer from several potentially
fatal flaws. Assessing social reforms in the 1970s, Irving Kristol
comments that &quot;[p]ractically all social reforms 'work' in
that they do distribute some benefits to the people whom they
aim to help.&quot;[32] Means-tested vouchers would very likely 
&quot;work&quot; to improve the educational prospects of a few low-income 
children -- perhaps even helping to mold the next Clarence Thomas. Kristol
quickly notes, however, that there are two problems inherent in
giving money only to the poor.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Today many religious schools in<br>
Canada have come to depend heavily<br>
on subsidies from the government<br>
and have subsequently lost their<br>
defining character.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The primary difficulty is that means-tested benefits always establish
a huge disincentive for families on the margin to escape the poverty
trap.

<p>

Moreover, Kristol argues that means-tested benefits do a
grave disservice to a society by establishing an arbitrary definition
of &quot;poor.&quot;

<p>

Social reform, in other words, should actively seek to minimize
class conflict by advancing low- and middle-income interests in
tandem. A recent column by William Raspberry of <I>The Washington
Post</I> confirms the perspicacity of Kristol's insight. &quot;The
recent political trend,&quot; Raspberry observes, &quot;is to
legislate luck for entire classes of people. Some get the breaks,
and some get suckered. . . .It isn't that Americans no longer
care about the common good, but that they have lost faith in mutuality.
They're afraid of being played for suckers.&quot;[33]

<p>

Both survey and anecdotal evidence suggest that school voucher
proposals may indeed be falling prey to class resentment over
policies that tax Reagan voters to bestow benefits on Clinton
backers. In the wake of the school choice defeat in California,
pollster Frank Luntz found that seven out of 10 Californians said
they do not favor exclusive targeting of lower-income students.
On the other hand, two-thirds of all California voters said that
they would be willing to support choice in education in the future
if it did not cost any additional tax money.[34]

<p>

Gene Piccolo of the Choice in Education League in Minnesota reports
voter concern over the potential of the pending voucher initiative
in his state to create a new entitlement. He also reports a subtle
but distinctive undertone of middle-class suburbanite resentment
among voucher opponents -- perhaps, he believes, because Minnesota
already boasts one of the highest levels of public welfare spending
in the country.

<p>

&quot;Publicly-funded compassion fatigue&quot; may render means-tested
vouchers a political non-starter in other parts of the country
as well. The success of the privately- funded voucher (or scholarship)
movement, by contrast, suggests that Americans are beginning to
draw a sharp distinction between &quot;compassion&quot; and government
solutions -- and between &quot;compassion&quot; and equality in
the egalitarian sense.

<p>

<center><h3>A New Look at Tax Credits</h3></center>

<p>

Given the failure to establish a full educational choice program
anywhere in the U.S. after nearly a quarter century, choice proponents
must challenge themselves to develop a new scheme. The proposal
should place a premium on liberty and on the private benefits
of education while reformulating the public-purpose rhetoric employed
by the education establishment. A new proposal should also avoid
the weaknesses associated with vouchers, including the menace
of government regulation, consistent challenges to their constitutionality,
dim prospects for political passage, the danger of expanding an
entitlement mentality and a narrow coalition of beneficiaries
to support passage. A refundable tax credit scheme is more likely
to overleap these hurdles than means-tested voucher demonstration
projects.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<font size=+1><b><i>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The more universal the private benefits, the more likely the U.S.
Supreme Court will be to uphold the proposal. In the 1983 case
<I>Mueller v. Allen</I>, the court held that a program &quot;that
neutrally provides state assistance to a broad spectrum of citizens
is not readily subject to challenge under the Establishment 
Clause.&quot;[35] The program in question was a Minnesota tax deduction 
for tuition, transportation and textbooks, which had been broadly defined 
to include extra educational benefits for even public school students.

<p>

However, by defining &quot;allowable uses&quot; or &quot;eligible
institutions,&quot; tax benefits linked to tuition may carry the
same threat of regulation as vouchers. Or they might exclude religious
institutions altogether. But a refundable tax credit for the &quot;non-use
of the public school&quot; would avoid such meddling, eliminating
the need to define allowable uses of the tax credit. Since 
&quot;non-users&quot; of the public schools already exist, there would be 
no further need to define or regulate recipients. Recently proposed in 
Idaho, the tax credit for the non-use of the public school received a
favorable review from the state attorney general, who cited it
as fundamentally different from both the tuition tax credits and
the vouchers which the state's strict definition of separation
of church and state would prohibit. &quot;[T]he proposed initiative's
grant of the tax credit to parents of all non-public school students
-- home-schooled, private non-sectarian, and private parochial
-- coupled with the absence of a direct financial benefit to parochial
schools, makes it probable this proposal will be upheld under
the U.S. Constitution.&quot;[36]

<p>

A two-tiered mediating proposal might offer a small, &quot;standard&quot;
educational tax credit of perhaps $500 to all parents of school-aged
children, and a larger tax credit of up to $3,000 for &quot;itemized&quot;
educational expenditures, broadly defined to include everything
from enrichment experiences for the public school student to private
school tuition to home school expenses. (As a general rule, tax
credits should be no higher than the average cost of local private
school tuition -- which is generally $2,500 to $3,000.[37] If keyed
to the average public school per-pupil expenditure -- as some
voucher plans propose -- the efficiency of the marketplace is
undermined by artificial inflation.)

<p>

This would limit the threat of regulation while expanding the
coalition of beneficiaries.[38]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Any proposal, however, must be considered in light of state constitutions.
Given the variance among state constitutions, as exemplified by
Idaho and Minnesota, educational choice proposals are probably
best handled at the state level. State action will be increasingly
viable as grass-roots sentiment mounts to eliminate the federal
role in education.

<p>

<center><h3>Conclusion</h3></center>

<p>

In <I>Perspectives on the Reagan Years</I>, political analyst
John Palmer argues that the Reagan Administration heightened public
awareness of an inevitable tension among political values that
decades of economic prosperity had obscured. Palmer refers to
the tensions among efficiency, social equity, and individual liberty
-- the reconciliation of which John Maynard Keynes identified
as &quot;the political problem of mankind.&quot; Just as education
was one component of the Great Society poverty programs, educational
choice was a key component of the Reagan Administration's efforts
to remake the welfare state in the image of its own philosophy.
The Reagan Administration argued that the American version of
the welfare state unduly sacrificed both individual liberty and
efficiency in the pursuit of social justice and that more diligent
concern for the former would inevitably promote the latter.

<p>

Reagan officials trumpeted educational choice as a means to mediate
between the competing values of liberty and equality -- a role
that could not have been claimed for choice without a substantial
redefinition of equality in the wake of Great Society failures.
In the words of former Secretary of Education Lauro Cavazos, appointed
by Reagan, &quot;[e]vidence shows that the growing demand for
parental choice in the United States derives not simply from a
desire for improved test scores, but from changing perspectives
on liberty and equity. It flows from an urgent reconsideration
of the role of the family and of other institutions and associations
that mediate between the individual and the State.&quot;[39]

<p>

Conservative advocates of choice must move quickly to popularize
a definition of social justice that reserves respect for individual
liberty and the primacy of the family. A more thorough attempt
at reconciling &quot;equality&quot; with &quot;liberty&quot; is
beyond the scope of the present paper. Suffice it to say that
the central issue is human dignity; that the phrase &quot;all
men are created equal&quot; promises no more -- and no less --
than equal moral worth, and that freedom is the air that true
equality must breathe to survive.

<BR><FONT SIZE=7>Clinton seeks to please<BR>gays and moderates</FONT>
<HR WIDTH=50%>By Paul Bedard<BR><font size=1>
The Washington Times</font><HR WIDTH=30%></center>


<BR><DD>President Clinton is wooing homosexual voters and AIDS activists, who were angered by his handling of their issues earlier in his term, by making new promises to consider expanded civil rights - including same-sex &quot;marriages.&quot;

<BR><DD>Capitalizing on a top issue in the community, Marsha Scott, Mr. Clinton's liaison to homosexual activists, is seeking suggestions on what position the president should take on same-sex marriages.

<BR><DD>In Boston recently, Miss Scott told a homosexual group, &quot;We [need] to find ways to ensure that those of you in these loving, long-term and committed relationships can enjoy all the same benefits that [heterosexual couples] are entitled to under the law.&quot;

<BR><DD>She added that using same-sex marriages may not be the right &quot;vehicle&quot; now but said, &quot;I'm going to argue that we broaden the context and look at the rights that gays and lesbians have ... and where those rights are denied.&quot;

<BR><DD>Asked about Miss Scott's little-noticed statements, a senior administration official said homosexual marriage is &quot;not something we intend to espouse.&quot;

<BR><DD>The official said that the White House will leave it to states to decide the issue, and that Mr. Clinton wants to do &quot;everything we can to support&quot; traditional marriages between heterosexuals.

<BR><DD>But the aide added: &quot;The president is aware that many communities and institutions are considering whether certain basic benefits can be provided outside the context of traditional marriage. The challenge in addressing these issues is to remain sensitive to the traditional values of our communities while preserving the fundamental right to live free from unjustified discrimination.&quot;

<BR><DD>Mr. Clinton, said the official, is &quot;personally&quot; opposed to homosexual marriages.

<BR><DD>Opponents of Mr. Clinton, however, noted that he also &quot;objected&quot; to late-term partial-birth abortions but vetoed a ban on the procedure.

<BR><DD>Conservative and liberal critics of the president complained about the aide's comments, which they said were designed merely to solicit support for the president. Miss Scott did not return a reporter's phone call.

<BR><DD>Steve Michael, a third-party presidential candidate supported by ACT UP, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, said &quot;they're making more empty promises.&quot;

<BR><DD>Robert Knight of the conservative Family Research Council said, &quot;The president is between a rock and a hard place, because he knows embracing same-sex marriage would alienate most voters who view him as a moderate.&quot;

<BR><DD>In an interview with Windows, New England's largest homosexual newspaper, Miss Scott said that in a Dole-Clinton race, &quot;I think you have extremely clear choices. You are either at the political table with a Clinton administration, or there is not even a door for you to get to the table.&quot;

<h3>THE SENATE FACES TERM LIMITS</h3>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Next week, the U.S. Senate will make history as it begins consideration of  <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d104:s.j.res.00021:">S.J. Res. 21</a>, a constitutional amendment to limit the number of terms members of the House and Senate may serve. The amendment provides a uniform term limit of 12 years for House members and Senators.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Term limits are needed because long-term congressional incumbency tends to distort the character of representation. By becoming overly oriented toward the federal government and insulated from the public, Members of Congress can develop a set of interests and sympathies at odds with those held by their constituents. Term limits therefore would work to keep elected officials more in touch with voters. In addition, frequent rotation in office would help assure a continuous flow of new energy and innovative thinking in Congress.
<p>
<b>THE PUBLIC JUDGMENT </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Among major public policy issues, term limits enjoys virtually unrivaled public support. As far back as 1964, a Gallup poll recorded a 49 percent plurality of Americans favoring term limits; since then, support has swelled to 64 percent in 1990 and 73 percent in 1995. Moreover, even though a reform-minded Congress was elected in 1994, support for term limits continued to grow to 77 percent in 1996.<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thus, unlike other "hot-button" issues whose support withers in the heat of public debate, support for term limits remains firm. Between 1990 and 1995, initiatives were approved in 23 states, with support averaging 66 percent.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Yet, despite this overwhelming public support, in May 1995, the Supreme Court declared in <I>U.S. Term Limits v. Thornton</I> that state-imposed term limits on federal lawmakers are unconstitutional. Thus, if federal term limits are to be enacted, the only remaining course appears to be adoption of a constitutional amendment such as S.J. Res. 21.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The electoral tsunami of 1994 was due in no small part to public support for term limits, so the new majority in Congress has a special obligation to deliver on this issue. Indeed, ten of the 12 freshman senators already have announced their support for term limits. As public support continues to grow, long-term incumbents opposed to term limitsespecially those from states that already place term limits on their state and local officialsmust explain why they continue to ignore the public will.
<p>
<b>TEN LEADING MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT TERM LIMITS</b>
<p><ol>
<b><li>Claim: Term limits are an untested innovation. 
<p>
Fact: Along with the President, 37 governors are subject to term limits.</b> Term limits were contained in America's first governing document, the Articles of Confederation of 1781, but were not written into the Constitution, primarily because its authors saw them as "entering into too much detail" for a short document.<sup>3</sup>
<p>
<b><li>Claim: The election of scores of new Senators and Representatives in 1994 disproves the need for term limits.
<p>
Fact: 314 of the 348 incumbent House members who sought re-election won -- a re-election rate of 90 percent.</b> Fully 92 percent of incumbent Senators -- 24 of 26 candidates -- won re-election.<sup>4</sup>
<p>
<b><li>Claim: Campaign finance reform will render term limits obsolete. 
<p>
Fact: Senator Fred Thompson (R-TN) has called term limits "the ultimate campaign finance reform vehicle."</b>  Term limits create open seats, which lead to contested races. These races are more competitive because they are less costly: Challengers do not have to compensate for the fundraising advantage held by incumbents, who nearly always win.
<p>
<b><li>
Claim: Term limits will deprive the nation of talented legislators. 
<p>
Fact: Self-governance is the basic supposition of democracy. </b>It is sheer arrogance to maintain that only one person in a half-million is qualified to be in Congress. Furthermore, while term-limited Senators and Representatives could serve in different capacities, other talented individuals would be given opportunity for advancement.
<p>
<b><li>
Claim: Term limits are undemocratic because they restrict voter choice. 
<p>
Fact: Incumbents enjoy electoral advantages franking, staff, and travel allowances that present huge barriers to entry by challengers.</b> Moreover, experience at the state level suggests that term limits actually increase voter choice. In California, for instance, the imposition of state-level term limits in 1990 led to an increase of over 25 percent in campaign filings for the Senate and a similar increase of over 50 percent in filings for the Assembly by 1992.<sup>5</sup>  During the past half-century, gubernatorial races have been more competitive in term-limited states -- even in years when governors can run for re-election.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
<b><li>
Claim: The limited-government agenda of the 104th Congress means that term limits are no longer needed to fight pork-barrel politics. 
<p>
Fact: The longer individuals serve in Congress, the greater their propensity to support new spending initiatives.</b><sup>7</sup>  The frequent rotation imposed by term limits, on the other hand, would help to institutionalize the 104th Congress's bias against big spending.
<p>
<b><li>
Claim: Conservatives should avoid amending the Constitution at all costs. 
<p>
Fact: As George Will, a former opponent of term limits, argues, term limits offer a necessary constitutional corrective to the profound extraconstitutional metamorphosis of the federal government.</b> The Founders envisioned a citizen legislature as the backbone of limited government; as the interventionist state arose, however, politicians began to view public office as a career.<sup>8</sup>  Term limits would work to restore the Founders' intent by diminishing the tendency of Members of Congress to exploit their legally acquired powers to remain in office.
<p>
<b><li>
Claim: As Senators find their terms limited, the Senate's capacity for deliberation and independent judgment likewise will be restricted. 
<p>
Fact: Term limits enhance the capacity for independence</b> by discouraging excessive concentration on fund-raising, re-election, and catering to special interests.
<p>
<b><li>
Claim: If term limits are such a good idea, they should be imposed retroactively. 
<p>
Fact: Rather than openly oppose term limits, opponents have pursued a shrewd strategy of calling for retroactive application.</b> This argument is a red herring. Term limits represent principle, not retribution, and the public has rejected retribution. Only one retroactive congressional term limits measure has been offered to the voters (in Washington State in 1991), and it was rejected. It is not surprising that opponents of term limits are the only ones pushing for retroactive application.
<p>
<b><li>
Claim: Under term limits, unelected individuals will run Congress. 
<p>
Fact: This argument assumes that the departure of senior incumbents will create a vacuum in which more and more decisions are made by lobbyists and staff.</b> Lobbyists thrive because they cultivate relationships with long-term incumbents; rapid turnover would greatly diminish the value of such contacts. As for staff, anyone who has seen a congressional office knows that Congressmen give assignments rather than take them. The specter of career staff manipulating freshman Members has little support in reality. In a non-term-limited Congress, staff employees work on average between five and six years.<sup>9</sup>  Under term limits, new Members would likely replace aides to former Congressmen with employees of their own choosing.
</ol><p>
<b>THE SENATE VOTE AND THE THREAT OF A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

One of the few reforms devised and implemented by people who live beyond the Beltway, term limits are a tribute to public involvement in politics. Yet, despite powerful grassroots support, term-limit laws in 23 states were overturned in May 1995 by the U.S. Supreme Court -- after the U.S. House of Representatives had failed to muster the two-thirds majority needed to ratify a federal constitutional amendment.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Frustrated by the Court's ruling and skeptical of Congress's desire to pass a constitutional amendment, some activists are pursuing a radical approach: calling for two-thirds of America's 50 state legislatures to approve an unprecedented constitutional convention to impose term limits. State legislatures in North Dakota and Utah already have called for such a convention. This year, 11 states will offer ballot measures to instruct state legislators to vote for a constitutional convention on term limits. Activists hope to garner the support of 34 state legislatures by the year 1999.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Term limits will remain a potent issue in 1996. President Clinton has decided to ignore the continued groundswell by opposing term limits. By contrast, Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS) deserves credit for assuring that they will be considered by the U.S. Senate. Whether members of the Senate will continue to ignore public opinion -- thereby fueling the drive for a term limits constitutional convention -- remains to be seen.

Sidebar: <a href="#rector">In Welfare Reform, Governors Miss the Point</a> by Robert Rector.

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Since the Republican victories of November 8, 1994, the press has focused on the dramatic changes in Congress. With a net gain of 52 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and eight seats in the U.S. Senate, the Republicans took control of both houses of Congress for the first time in 40 years. Party-switching and special elections have since left the partisan balance in the House of Representatives at 236 Republicans to 198 Democrats (with one independent); in the Senate, it is 53 Republicans to 47 Democrats.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This shift in party control certainly changed the direction of the national policy debate in Washington. Less than two years ago, Congress was seriously debating President Clinton's attempt to nationalize the entire health-care industry. And just a year earlier, Congress passed and Clinton signed a budget that contained what Democratic senator Pat Moynihan called the largest tax increase in the history of the world. Since the elections of 1994, however, the debate in Washington has centered on how to cut taxes and balance the budget in a way that would, over time, cut the size of the federal government from 21.2 percent of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product to roughly 17 percent. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	
Yet the intense focus on Washington, D.C., has obscured the conservative revolution within the states. In some ways, the changes occurring in state capitals across the country are even more important than those inside the Beltway. Conservative reforms at the state level make similar efforts in Washington both more likely and, oddly, less important. The states have led the way so far, and they are quite prepared to march ahead, even if the revolution in Washington stalls.

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Although less visible, the 1994 shift in partisan control was more pronounced at the state and local levels than in Washington. Republicans won 24 of 36 gubernatorial races to increase the number of statehouses in their column from 19 to 30. With Mike Foster's victory in last year's gubernatorial election in Louisiana, Republicans now occupy 31 statehouses. More than 72 percent of the American people now live in states with Republican governors. Within state legislatures, the GOP gained 105 senate seats and 367 house seats in 1994 to gain control of seven upper chambers and 10 lower chambers. Since that election, 50 state legislators have switched to the GOP. 
<p>
<img src="norq.gif" align=center>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	These gains have historic consequences. Prior to the 1994 elections, Democrats controlled the governorship and both legislative chambers in 17 states. In these states, all labor law, election law, budgeting and taxes, redistricting, and judicial appointments were fully controlled by the Democratic Party. Republicans exercised similar control in just four states: Utah, Arizona, New Hampshire, and New Jersey. Today, the Democratic Party controls the governorship and the legislature only in Hawaii, Georgia, Arkansas, Missouri, Kentucky, West Virginia, and Maryland, while Republicans reign supreme in 15 states, including Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, and Wisconsin.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The nationwide shift to Republican governors affects the content of the policy debate in at least two ways. First, it intensifies the pressure from the states for more autonomy. In fact, strong lobbying by governors such as Bill Weld of Massachusetts, George Voinovich of Ohio, Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin, and John Engler of Michigan was crucial to Republicans' efforts in the fall of 1995 to pass their historic budget, designed to give states unprecedented power over welfare and Medicaid programs.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Second, a Republican Congress is more likely to fulfill its commitment to "devolution" knowing that ideologically sympathetic governors are at the helm in many key states. Despite the Republican Party's dedication to federalism, is it plausible that Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole would have fought so hard to send billions of dollars with few conditions over the next seven years to Ann Richards or Mario Cuomo to run Medicaid, welfare, and other programs? Liberal governors would have gladly spent the money, then denounced Republican policies for ending entitlements. And a conservative party would have been irresponsible to hand billions in unrestricted federal dollars to its political enemies, who could use the money to hire Democratic precinct workers and build political machines to destroy Republican congressmen and senators. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The historic shift was not just a matter of <I>more</i> Republican governors. The high quality of these governors was also critical. A conservative Congress would have been rightly wary of handing power and money over to yesteryear's generation of Republicans -- including Nelson Rockefeller of New York, Bob Ray of Iowa, Bill Milliken of Michigan, and James Rhodes of Ohio-whose records on spending, taxes, and the role of government were indistinguishable from that of Cuomo or Richards. Newt Gingrich is to Bob Michel as Michigan's John Engler is to Milliken, as New York's George Pataki is to Rockefeller. This profound ideological shift among governors and state legislators has occurred in more than 25 states.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The emergence of conservative Republican leadership simultaneously at the national and state levels was no coincidence. In the 1980s, Newt Gingrich learned from John Engler, then majority leader of the Michigan state senate, that many state legislators drove to attend legislative sessions. By sending them Republican audio tapes to listen to on these drives, Gingrich began to coordinate a conservative political message across the nation. The reforms that Engler and Tommy Thompson later pushed through their respective legislatures revealed what Republican governance could achieve. Their ideas for welfare reform, which predated the 1994 election, served as a national model for Republicans. The press attacked Engler savagely for ending general welfare for some 80,000 able-bodied men. But his recovery and the victories of Republican state senators running only six months later proved again that voters value effective policy over partisan polemics.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In Washington, political reform has been frustrated by a recalcitrant Senate and Bill Clinton's veto pen. Of the Contract With America's 10 specific items, Congress has passed only the line-item veto, procedural reforms in the House of Representatives, and the Congressional Accountability Act, which brings Congress somewhat under the same laws it imposes upon business. The House has passed the Balanced Budget Amendment, regulatory reform, and other legislation, only to see them watered down or stopped in the Senate. Bill Clinton has twice vetoed welfare reform, and a relatively narrow tort-reform bill was passed over his veto.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In the meantime, the states have not stood still. The new generation of Republican governors and state legislators is advancing the Republican reform agenda -- from tax cuts to tort reform. Here are a few of the critical issues raised by the Contract With America and addressed by the states. They provide a blueprint for future work in Washington:<p><b>Taxes</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In 1993, Clinton campaign strategist James Carville announced that the off-year governor's race in New Jersey between incumbent Democrat Jim Florio -- who had raised taxes in 1989 -- and his challenger Christine Todd Whitman -- who called for a 30 percent across-the-board income-tax cut -- would be the burial ground of Republican advocacy of tax reduction.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Carville misidentified the cadaver. Whitman made the last month of the campaign a clear referendum on her tax-cut proposals, and it worked. Whitman's victory was critical in ensuring that tax cuts would be prominent in the Contract With America a year later.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In 1995, while Republicans in Congress were debating a $500-per-child tax credit and cutting the capital-gains tax in half, 17 states with Republican governors cut taxes. In addition, Bill Weld in Massachusetts and Kirk Fordice in Mississippi pushed for tax cuts but faced overwhelming opposition by Democratic legislatures. Arizona governor Fife Symington won an income-tax reduction of $130 million in 1994 and $200 million in 1995, and plans to phase out the income tax over the next four years.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	And in New Hampshire, Governor Steve Merrill demonstrated that taking the no-income-tax pledge remains a powerful campaign weapon and effective tool for governing. The Taxpayer-Protection Pledge -- made famous when George Bush won the Republican nomination and presidency because he took the pledge and then lost re-election when he broke it -- was born in New Hampshire in 1972. Since then, no one who has not taken the pledge has ever won the governorship of the state.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In the 1994 elections, Merrill had the happy idea of extending the pledge against a sales or income tax increase to the campaigns for the state senate. Before the election, there were 13 Republicans in the state senate and 11 Democrats. Merrill led a slate of 23 Republicans who took the pledge as a team (foreshadowing the Contract With America); as a result, the Republicans seized 18 of 25 state senate seats and drove from office two Republicans known in New Hampshire as RINOs, or Republicans in Name Only, who had voted with the other party. In 1996, all 395 members of New Hampshire's house of representatives will be asked to take the pledge, separating the RINOs from the Merrill low-tax Republicans. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Taxpayer activists in 40 states are now pushing state legislators, governors, and candidates for those offices to take a state taxpayer-protection pledge. Mike Foster won the governorship of Louisiana as a pledge-taker, and Alabama's Fob James signed the pledge in early 1996 to highlight his consistent opposition to tax increases.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This state emphasis on holding down taxes has already produced results. In Kansas, Governor Bill Graves passed legislation cutting the automobile tax in half over five years and repealing a 2.5 percent sales tax on labor used in new construction and on utilities used in manufacturing. Graves also enacted a two-year moratorium on the collection of unemployment taxes from many Kansas businesses, saving them nearly $275 million. Iowa governor Terry Branstad is pushing legislation to phase out over six years the property tax on machinery and equipment, which is now taxed at 30 percent of its original cost. In New Hampshire, Merrill reduced the tax rate on business profits to its lowest level in 14 years, cut the telecommunications tax and the real estate tax, and abolished the savings-bank tax and the corporate-franchise tax.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In Massachusetts, Bill Weld has achieved nine tax cuts, including the abolition of the inheritance tax, a rollback of Michael Dukakis's increases in income taxes and sales taxes and-despite an overwhelmingly Democratic legislature -- a cut in the capital-gains tax.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Weld's position on taxes illuminates the national debate over the flat tax. Massachusetts's constitution requires a single income-tax rate, now set at 5.95 percent. In 1994, the public-employee unions financed an initiative campaign to repeal this tax provision and establish a graduated, or "progressive," income tax. Weld and Citizens for Limited Taxation defeated the campaign, pointing out that a multiple-rate system allows politicians to separate voters into income groups and play them against each other.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	On April 15, 1996, and again on April 15, 1997, the U.S. House of Representatives will vote on a constitutional amendment to require a two-thirds supermajority vote for any federal tax increase. This idea, too, is drawn from the states. The two-thirds supermajority was part of California's Proposition 13 in 1978, and in 1994, Fife Symington and Arizona taxpayer groups backed a successful ballot initiative that amended the state constitution to require a two-thirds vote of the legislature for tax hikes.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The federal and state constitutions require supermajorities for any legislative actions that depend on widespread support for their legitimacy (like overriding vetoes). Tax increases also demand that level of scrutiny. Taxpayer activists in Arizona are now circulating another initiative to require a two-thirds supermajority for any tax hike approved by the voters directly. They fear that public-employee unions will swamp low-turnout elections and force local or state tax hikes. George Voinovich in Ohio is working with taxpayer advocates on a ballot proposal to require a two-thirds supermajority vote for major tax hikes. Just as term limits swept through 23 states and became part of the Contract With America, the drive for supermajority requirements for tax increases has also been moving on parallel paths at the national and state level.<p><b>School Choice</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In Washington, Republicans tried to provide parental choice in education for several thousand of the poorest families in Washington, D.C. Led by Republican congressman Steve Gunderson of Wisconsin, the House of Representatives approved the measure in the 1996 appropriations bill for the District. But as of March, the measure was stymied in the Senate by a Democratic filibuster.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As with many issues, parental choice in education reached the national political agenda via the states. Tommy Thompson led the way in 1990 with a model school-choice program for poor Milwaukee parents. More than 1,000 children have qualified to receive vouchers for tuition at secular private schools. The teachers unions maintained that only public schools could provide good education, but studies have shown that Milwaukee public schools suffer a 79 percent attendance rate and a 48 percent graduation rate. By comparison, the city's private schools boast rates of 96 percent and 88 percent respectively.Growing public support for school choice led Thompson to sign legislation last July that expanded the number of eligible children to 7,000 in the current school year and to 15,000 next year. This expanded program -- now being challenged in court -- would give parents the freedom to send their children to parochial or other religious schools. Pending a court decision, the Bradley Foundation and other private funders are financing vouchers for low-income students accepted to private schools.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In Pennsylvania, Governor Tom Ridge put school choice at the top of his agenda. Although Republicans controlled both houses of the legislature, the governor's KID I program failed last year by six votes. Ridge returned last fall with a more modest program to provide $132 million for scholarships for as many as 50,000 students. To reassure skeptics, this version was designed to expire if not reauthorized and was limited to certain cities and counties. Ridge also added a provision ensuring that no school district in Pennsylvania would lose money as a result of school choice. As of this writing, the legislature has once more refused to follow the governor's lead, but key legislators vow that the battle is far from over.In Minnesota, Governor Arne Carlson wants to provide 65,000 low-income students in Minneapolis-St. Paul and a rural district yet to be named with vouchers of up to $3,000, valid at any school. Governor Carlson does not yet have a Republican majority in both houses, but is moving school choice forward by organizing a Republican Task Force for School Choice to put political muscle behind his vision.By promoting school choice, Carlson unites economic conservatives in the business community --who know that school choice will reduce education costs and raise the quality of high-school graduates -- with social conservatives who want parents, rather than bureaucrats, to control their children's education.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In Arizona last year, Governor Fife Symington backed a statewide school-choice plan to give all Arizona students up to $1,500 to attend any private school of their choice. Many national figures in the GOP lobbied legislators on behalf of Symington's platform, yet the measure fell three votes short in the state senate, thanks to a handful of Republicans with ties to the National Education Association.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In California, teachers unions  spent $15 million of their members' dues in the fall of 1993 to defeat a school-choice ballot initiative. In his 1996 State of the State address, however, Governor Pete Wilson endorsed a targeted pilot program for school choice. Wilson's proposal would provide 250,000 children in the poorest 5 percent of California's public schools with up to $4,500 each to attend the public, private, or religious school of their choice. Connecticut's Governor John Rowland is also supporting a pilot school-choice program.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Massachusetts, Michigan, and Arizona have all embarked on extensive charter-school programs, allowing individuals and teachers to create their own public schools, free of many existing regulations. While charter schools are not school choice, they do offer a real opportunity for many teachers and students to scale the wall the NEA has erected to keep "its" children from escaping bad schools.<p><b>Tort Reform</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In 1995, 12 Republican governors took on one of the fiercest Democratic special-interest groups -- the trial lawyers -- and won. While Congress was only able to enact a very limited reform of frivolous stockholder lawsuits, Republican governors made significant strides. Walter Olson, the author of <I>The Litigation Explosion</I>, cites tort-reform initiatives by George Bush Jr. in Texas and Jim Edgar in Illinois as two of the most far-reaching.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Texas now limits punitive damages, requires "clear and convincing" evidence to prove malice, raises the qualifications for expert witnesses, and eliminates joint liability for defendants less than 51 percent at fault.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The new Illinois law bars any plaintiff found to be more than 50 percent at fault from recovering damages (which should stop drunks from suing after falling in front of trains), prohibits punitive-damage awards except where defendants behave "with an evil motive or with a reckless indifference to the rights of others," abolishes joint liability for economic and noneconomic damages (thus protecting "deep pocket" defendants from the liability of others), and provides the stiffest reform of product liability in the nation. The Illinois law also protects landowners from being sued by trespassers in most cases.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	North Dakota governor Edward T. Schafer passed a product-liability reform package aimed at luring airplane manufacturers to North Dakota. Schafer has pointed out that states need not compete for business by offering subsidies or special tax breaks; instead, they can all lower regulatory and liability costs, and everyone wins.<p><b>Crime</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The latest Republican anti-crime agenda has made little headway in Washington, where the Senate has failed to act on a package of bills passed by the House. Meanwhile, Republican governors led the way in enacting "truth-in-sentencing" laws that require violent criminals to serve at least 85 percent of their sentences, with time off for good behavior but not parole. Governor Fob James of Alabama reintroduced chain gangs -- although the new chains are made of sturdy plastic. He also instituted work and education requirements for inmates to earn television and recreation privileges and banned inmate access to pornography. Mississippi's Kirk Fordice has reestablished the state prison farm, and taken a thousand television sets away from prisoners. Under Pete Wilson, California has carried out its first two executions in 25 years. In New York, after 19 vetoes by Mario Cuomo, Governor George Pataki signed legislation restoring the death penalty and honored Oklahoma's extradition request for murderer Thomas Grasso, who was subsequently executed for murder. Connecticut's John Rowland restored the death penalty there.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Bucking the pro-gun control trend in Washington, D.C., that as recently as the fall of 1993 saw the "Brady Bill" passed and the so-called assault-weapon ban included in Bill Clinton's "crime" bill, 28 states have passed "concealed-carry" laws that require local officials to grant licenses to qualified adults who wish to carry concealed handguns. Ten states passed concealed-carry laws in 1995, including Oklahoma, which did not blink at liberal efforts to blame gun owners, taxpayers, and/or radio talk show hosts for the terrorist bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City. Mike Foster, Louisiana's new Republican governor, campaigned on a commitment to sign a concealed-carry law that his Democratic predecessor had vetoed. Ohio, too, with its new Republican majorities, has the votes to pass a concealed-carry law.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Crime is always a thorny issue for Republicans in Washington, caught between their federalist belief in local responsibility for law enforcement and public pressure for federal action on crime. The success of Republicans at the state level at implementing tough anti-crime measures has the added benefit of taking national Republicans off the hook.<p><b>Welfare</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Although Bill Clinton has vetoed the Republican welfare-reform bill (which embodies concepts that he once embraced), Republican governors continue to experiment with efforts to free individuals from the dependency of welfare. Tommy Thompson began a series of reforms in 1987 that have reduced Wisconsin's welfare caseload by 32 percent while welfare rolls nationwide were increasing by 25 percent. Pete Wilson suspended cost-of-living adjustments for welfare payments, saving taxpayers $6.3 billion over the past four years and keeping welfare costs 27 percent below where they would otherwise have been.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Fife Symington has cut Arizona welfare rolls by 10 percent. His new "Empower" welfare reform limits able-bodied recipients to no more than 24 months of welfare benefits in a five-year period, ends additional payments for welfare recipients who have additional children, and requires minors to live at home to receive any benefits. Between 1992 and 1995, George Voinovich phased out Ohio's generous general-assistance program, which was paying benefits to 142,000 able-bodied Buckeyes. Bill Weld has pushed a series of reforms that have reduced the Massachusetts welfare caseload for 25 straight months. Almost every Republican governor has passed, introduced, or requested a federal waiver for welfare reform in their state. New Hampshire alone has requested 65 waivers from federal welfare requirements. Faced with a stone wall in Washington, Steve Merrill is now prepared to institute his reforms anyway.Spending Restraint
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The conflict between Congress and the president over the size and cost of government has already shut down the federal government repeatedly. This fight has played itself out in the states as well. Steve Merrill had to fight his own Republican legislature to lower spending, and finally won a budget lower than that passed by either chamber of the legislature. Merrill's veto of legislation that would have doubled state aid to education was upheld. Merrill, George Pataki of New York, and Bill Weld of Massachusetts are the only three governors who have actually shrunk their budgets since the previous year.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In Ohio, George Voinovich won legislation eliminating two state cabinet agencies. He plans to privatize 78 state liquor stores, saving Ohio taxpayers $20 million annually. Cabinet agencies under the governor's control had 3,162 fewer employees in 1995 than in 1991, a reduction of 8.3 percent. Pete Wilson is asking for an amendment to the California constitution requiring a two-thirds supermajority vote for any new and costly regulation. Kansas governor Bill Graves enacted a six-month moratorium on new government regulations, and then eliminated 530 obsolete rules.<p><b>Medical Savings Accounts</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This centerpiece of the Republican reform of Medicare was blocked by Clinton's veto pen, but in 1995, five Republican governors (Fife Symington, Kirk Fordice, Jim Edgar, John Engler, and Idaho's Philip Batt) shepherded medical savings accounts through their state legislatures. These forays into market-based health care will have a significant effect on overall medical costs and insurance premiums, contributing substantially to the debate in Washington, and perhaps eventually ending the impasse. And, when Congress does finally enact reforms in Medicare, the states will already have in place the mechanisms to take full advantage of it.<p><b>Property Rights</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In March 1995, the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation recognizing that the Takings Clause of the Constitution is invoked when government actions destroy or reduce the value of private property, not just when the property is physically occupied by government. That legislation has not seen final action, of course. The pressures that produced it are growing throughout the country, however, and governors and state legislatures are responding to them.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Beginning in 1992, the states began passing legislation protecting the property rights of their citizens. To date, 23 states have enacted legislation of varying strength, and more efforts are under way. Most of these involve some form of compensation for land values affected by state restrictions on its use. In 1995, every state but Kentucky and Georgia was considering some form of property-rights legislation.<p><b>Color-Blind Society</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	California and Pete Wilson give a textbook example of how a state can force action that has been avoided for decades at the national level. Citizens have filed an initiative petition in California, the California Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI), that would prohibit the state from discriminating based on race or sex. It is a ban on racial preferences or quotas. For two decades, Washington politicians were able to say "I oppose quotas, but favor affirmative action," while supporting laws and court decisions that require racial preferences and quotas. The California initiative may force all national politicians, during an election year, to answer the following questions: "Are you for or against the CCRI as written?" They could no longer fudge or evade discussions of affirmative action.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Meanwhile, a dozen other states are considering measures similar to the California initiative. And on January 15, 1996 -- Martin Luther King Day --the newly elected Louisiana governor, Mike Foster, issued an executive order abolishing all racial preferences as abhorrent to King's vision of a color-blind society.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As a result, Republican leaders in the Congress have all stated their opposition to quotas and racial preferences. Bob Dole and Representative Charles Canady have introduced federal legislation mirroring California's. Black congressman Gary Franks, a Connecticut Republican was ready to push an amendment to an appropriations bill immediately eliminating contract set-asides for minorities. House leaders persuaded him to postpone it, but this is clearly an issue that will continue to surface at the federal level. There could hardly be a clearer example of state politics forcing an unwanted issue onto the Washington agenda.<p><b>Federalism</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Alabama governor Fob James took his oath of office standing under a banner carrying the words of the Tenth Amendment: "The Powers not delegated to the United States nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people." Texas Governor George W. Bush has made a mantra of his call to "let Texans run Texas." Arizona's Fife Symington forced the federal government to reopen the Grand Canyon by threatening to operate it with state workers. He has since called on the federal government to cede control of the Grand Canyon to his state, and is working with Newt Gingrich to speed a transfer of power. Symington has also socked away $1 million to finance lawsuits that may be necessary to defend the state's Tenth Amendment rights.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Utah Governor Mike Leavitt has begun to organize a national movement to promote an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would give states the right to block national laws passed by Congress that violate their autonomy. For instance, two-thirds of the governors or perhaps two-thirds of state legislatures would have the power to overturn a federal law by passing resolutions of disapproval. As with a presidential veto, a two-thirds vote of both houses of Congress would reinstate the law.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	It may not be necessary to wait for an amendment. Leavitt is trying to get a commitment from Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole that they will force a second vote on any law or part of a law that draws written opposition from two-thirds of the governors. That would give America an opportunity to get used to the way the amendment would operate.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Some commentators ask which of the Republican governors is the best or most effective. In fact, the breadth of quality and activism is amazing. Certainly, John Engler of Michigan and Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin were early revolutionaries. Bill Weld of Massachusetts and Kirk Fordice of Mississippi demonstrated how much one can accomplish in the face of overwhelming Democratic legislatures. Arne Carlson of Minnesota and Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania have bravely challenged the teachers unions in their states, and George Bush of Texas and Jim Edgar of Illinois have taken on the trial-lawyer beast.	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;All the Republican governors are traveling in the same direction and showing real courage in tackling the special interests of the old establishment order. This is important in each state, but it is also critical nationally. Republican governors and state legislators are to the new Republican majority in Congress and any future Republican president what the labor unions and corrupt big-city machines are to the Democratic Party: its nationwide infrastructure. They are a second front arrayed against the liberal welfare state. In the last five years -- and most intensely in 1995 -- they have followed Lenin's advice to probe with bayonets, looking for weaknesses. Their triumphs guarantee the ultimate success of the Gingrich Revolution-no matter what happens in Washington.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<I><b>Grover Norquist</b> is the president of <a href="/atr/1.html">Americans for Tax Reform</a> and the national political correspondent for the</I> American Spectator.

<h2>In Welfare Reform, Governors Miss the Point</h2>
<b>by Robert Rector</b>
</center>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Congress is now considering a welfare-reform plan recently proposed by the nation's governors. Unfortunately, this plan ignores America's biggest social problem: the catastrophic rise of illegitimacy. 

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Nearly a third of the children born in America last year were born out of wedlock. The illegitimacy rate is rising by a percentage point every year. And among blacks the out-of-wedlock birthrate has reached 69 percent. This figure astounds even New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who warned us in the early 1960s of the threat posed to the black community by the collapse of marriage. Moynihan's admonition was dismissed then, but the breakup of the black family and the calamities that have accompanied it are outstripping his most frightful predictions. 

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Ominously, the illegitimacy rate for whites is now edging toward 25 percent, almost exactly the rate for blacks when Moynihan first sounded his alarm. The white family now faces the same breakdown that has devastated black communities in the last 30 years. 

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Family collapse is the root cause of a host of social problems, including poverty, crime, drug abuse, and academic underachievement. Children born out of wedlock are seven times more likely to be poor than children born to couples who are married. Girls raised in single-parent homes on welfare are five times more likely to give birth out of wedlock than girls from intact, independent families. And a boy from a single-parent household in the inner city is twice as likely to become involved in crime as a similarly poor boy who lives with a father and a mother.

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The nation's governors have responded to this grim reality by ignoring it. In unveiling their welfare reform plan, they have declared that there are three "key elements" to real welfare reform: (1) providing more government-funded day care; (2) increasing child support payments from absent fathers; (3) imposing time limits and work requirements on welfare recipients. Rising illegitimacy and the collapse of marriage do not receive even passing comment. 

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This plan represents a radical shift in the focus of the welfare debate -- from combating illegitimacy to providing public-support services to an ever-expanding population of single mothers. Dodging the illegitimacy issue entirely, the governors' plan promises a future in which marriage collapses further and the government must meet the needs of a burgeoning population of single-parent families. The triumph of the Left is complete: Fighting illegitimacy is "out," and funding government-run day care is "in."
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Some argue that federal action on illegitimacy is not needed, that the governors will tackle the problem. But the governors' silence speaks volumes. Few have made reducing illegitimacy a priority; most are reluctant even to mention the topic. But by refusing to acknowledge the dangers of collapsing marriages and rising illegitimacy, they implicitly condone and ultimately promote illegitimacy. The result: Soon, half of all American children will be born out of wedlock and reared in government-run day-care centers. This is not reform -- this is a national disaster.

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The governors' plan borrows heavily from the "reform" schemes of President Clinton and other liberal proposals. It also dovetails with the interests of America's huge welfare bureaucracy, which thrives on social decay. Although the plan will trim the growth rate of welfare spending slightly in the near term, it will lead to an explosion in welfare and social-service spending. In other words, we will have to pay the price for illegitimacy sooner or later.

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Congress seems too willing to join the governors in ignoring illegitimacy. Under recent legislation, Congress will spend nearly a half trillion dollars over the next seven years to subsidize illegitimacy through welfare benefits, day care, job training, and other services. For every dollar spent to reduce illegitimacy, the federal government will spend about a thousand dollars on programs that contribute to it.

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Marriage in America is dying, and the governors have prepared the coffin. Many in Congress seem willing to serve as pall bearers. But "welfare reform" is nonsense so long as the illegitimacy rate continues to rise. Vision and leadership are sorely needed -- and the governors especially seem unable to provide either.<p>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick. Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
discusses a critical issue which is sweeping our country, making 
headlines nationwide, and causing a stir in American families:  the 
possible redefining of marriage to include homosexual unions.

<p>

We will be talking to Robert Knight of the Family Research Council, 
who has thoroughly researched the homosexual activist movement and their 
attempts to dramatically change family life as we know it. And we will
also bring you Anthony Falzarano, who, as a former homosexual,
knows well the inside story on homosexual culture and the attempts
to increase its influence by changing our laws.  These attempts
to redefine marriage will affect all of us, from the filing of
our taxes to our schools, to our workplaces, and beyond.  You
need to understand this phenomenon.

<p>

But first, let's hear from the Family Research Council's president, 
Gary Bauer.  Yesterday, Gary and I talked about a pivotal decision which 
may be made this very evening by President Clinton, whether to veto the 
Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act or to align himself with the majority of
Americans and majority of House and Senate members, who have clearly
stated that they strongly support the lifesaving act.

<p>

You will hear a lot of stories on this veto, but first, <i>Straight 
Talk</i> will take you Behind the Headlines.

<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gary, thanks so much for being with us today.

<p>

Just last week, on Good Friday, the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act
was finally sent to the President.  It was passed overwhelmingly
in both the House and the Senate.  It is a piece of legislation
that deals with a procedure in which the child is delivered into
the birth canal; moments from birth, a scissors stabbed into the
base of his skull; living brain tissue suctioned out; and this
is an abortion procedure that would be banned except to save the
life of the mother.

<p>

The President has been very clear that he intends to veto this bill. 
What do you think this says about the state of the abortion debate 
today?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  We probably should have given a disclaimer to the viewer 
who might not have wanted to hear that description.  It's incredible 
to think that in America we are actually aborting babies in the 
seventh, eighth, and ninth month of pregnancy using that procedure.

<p>

The country is deeply divided over abortion.  We all know that, Kristi. 
But every poll that I have seen shows that the American people 
overwhelmingly find this procedure to be reprehensible, to be grotesque; 
in fact, most Americans react in disbelief when they hear that it is 
something that goes on in clinics today.

<p>

So, for me, to hear the President of the United States say basically 
that he is going to fall on his sword over this; that he is so committed 
to abortion on demand that even these third-trimester abortions will 
continue under his Presidency is something that, in my mind, makes him 
an extremist on this issue.  I just don't know any other way to describe 
it. And it just seems sort of unusual, because he has really tried
in the last year or so to picture himself as being middle-of-the-road,
and I think he has been quite convincing with some Americans.

<p>

But here is an issue that gets past the rhetoric, goes right to
the heart of the debate in America about our liberty and how it
should be used, and the President has made it clear he is going
to stand with the National Organization for Women and the radicals
on this issue, and I think it is going to hurt him politically.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  One of the interesting things about this particular
abortion debate was that people who had never cast a pro-life
vote in their entire history voted for this particular ban.  What
do you think this says about the President's statement and his
advisors' statements that this particular abortion bill will work
for him?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, I don't know.  You know, the White
House does polling every night.  It is the first White House in
American history to do that, so you would expect them to have
a finely tuned sense of American public opinion.  I can't imagine
how in the world this issue would work for him, and quite frankly,
on an issue involving life and death, I would hope politicians
of all stripes would stop looking at these issues about what helps
them and what hurts them and start making judgments that are filled
with some sense of compassion and some sense of the sanctity of
life.  It just seems amazing to me that anyone would try to make
a political calculation over something this important.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Now, this bill does deal with the life-of-the-mother 
exception. If this procedure would be needed to save the mother's 
life, it would be available, but not for some of the other reasons,
not for elective abortion, for example.

<p>

This is the first time since <i>Roe v. Wade</i> that any abortion 
restriction at all has been made possible.  Why do you think that 
there has been a kind of restriction available now?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, you know, when you really think about it, people say 
that we have been debating abortion too much. Actually, we really 
don't as a society get to debate it really at all in any meaningful 
sense of the word.  The courts have driven this issue for over 20 
years, and no matter where you stand on the issue, the courts have had 
the trump cards. They keep throwing down their aces and stopping the 
American people from doing much about abortion one way or the other. 

<p>

This was the first time in a long, long time that the Congress of the 
United States actually had a real bill dealing with a real abortion 
issue that they had to debate and then vote on the record about.  I
think that is the important thing here.  These politicians in
the Congress knew that the whole country would see their vote
and would be able to ponder the meaning of those votes, and I
think that is why the final vote was so overwhelming.

<p>

Every once in a while, I tune in to C-SPAN that often will allow 
callers to comment on what is going on on the floor of the Congress, 
and what struck me was the just almost endless numbers of calls coming
in from people who would say, &quot;I'm pro-choice, but I can't
possibly support something like this.&quot;

<p>

So I think that is why this vote was so significant, and I think it 
reflects where the American people are on the abortion issue.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gary, you pointed out to me a poll out just this week 
which indicates that the majority of Americans in fact are actually 
pro-life or leaning toward pro-life.  What do the numbers tell us 
about people's sentiments toward abortions?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Yes, this is an area where there is great misunderstanding. 
The media generally says almost without question that Americans are 
&quot;pro-choice,&quot; which generally is interpreted to mean they 
favor abortion on demand.

<p>

What the polling data has shown for over 25 years and continues to 
show in 1996 is that about one-third of the country believes that 
abortion should be unrestricted totally. The other two-thirds of 
the country either wants abortion severely restricted
or doesn't want any abortions at all.  So to the extent that there
is a consensus in America, it is much more toward the pro-life
side.

<p>

Now, people get confused about what words like &quot;pro-choice&quot;
mean. That's why I always look at polls that get very specific:
Would you be in favor of abortion in this case or that case?
And when you ask that kind of question, it is clear that Americans,
two to one, take a generally pro-life position.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: This particular debate has been surrounded by a lot of 
powerful symbolism, first-time symbolism.  For example, the leaders of
the Catholic Church in America met in the park outside the White
House in pouring rain to pray and to ask the President not to
veto this particular bill.

<p>

Politically speaking, how do you think American Catholics will 
respond to a veto of the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, I think that what happened outside the White 
House just a few days ago was an incredible moral statement by the 
church that on this issue they would stand up to the President, 
even though they have some issues that they are in agreement with 
him on.

<p>

I think the interesting thing will be what will the average American 
Catholic -- and, for that matter, the average American evangelical -- 
do when they go to the voting booth in November on this kind of issue. 
There are a lot of issues that voters weigh, but presumably, men and 
women of faith are going to weigh issues that go directly to their 
faith first and foremost when they vote.

<p>

And so I think the President does run the risk of losing a lot of 
evangelical and Catholic votes if he follows through with his threat 
to veto this bill.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Do you think, Gary, that President Clinton will veto 
this bill, or is it possible that he might change his mind?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, I think that the signals over the last couple of weeks 
have been so clear and so pronounced that he almost would look foolish 
at this point. He really has backed himself into a corner.

<p>

The other thing is, there are some very important groups that the 
President has to have the support of, some of the radical feminist 
groups, groups like Planned Parenthood, the National Organization for
Women, and so forth.  These groups are important parts of the
liberal coalition in the United States, and I think the President
is afraid that if he vetoes the bill, he will get criticism from
groups he is going to be counting on.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The pro-life story can be put up against the Unabomber 
story right now, ironically enough. We have seen some very unfortunate 
and horrible shootings at abortion clinics and, after 30 peaceful years, 
an attempt to smear a lot of pro-life Americans, saying that these shooters
are representative; and then a man who by news accounts is a radical
environmentalist bombs quite a few people and in fact was involved,
they say, with Earth First, even killing people on an Earth First
hit list.

<p>

It has been interesting the way in which these two stories
have been handled and how people on both sides have been characterized.
What is your take on the way these pro-life and environmentalist
issues have been played?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, there clearly is a double standard, but first of all, 
let's make clear that everybody understands that we condemn, obviously, 
the abortion clinic shootings. Those have been terrible, terrible events, 
and the people responsible for them ought to be punished and sentenced 
to the full extent of the law.

<p>

What has been unfortunate, however, is the effort
of the pro-abortion side to take these incidents and blame them
or try to hang them on everyone who is pro-life.  I travel all
around the country, and I see tens of thousands of people sacrificing
financially and otherwise to help women in crisis pregnancy.
You've got crisis pregnancy clinics all over the country.  These
abortion murderers don't represent the pro-life movement.

<p>

But as you point out, here we have the Unabomber, who appears to be
an environmentalist, a radical environmentalist, associated in
some way with the group Earth First -- more investigation will
have to be done about that -- and yet the media is generally silent
about that connection.  The same media that wants to try to hang
a deranged killer at an abortion clinic and use him to smear the
whole pro-life movement is relatively silent when it comes to
using the Unabomber to raise questions about whether radical 
environmentalism has gone too far.

<p>

So I guess I would just ask that the standards be the same here. If 
pro-life rhetoric can be held to be responsible for a deranged 
individual, then I don't see how radical pro-environmental
rhetoric can't be held to the same standard when it comes to somebody
like the man that has been alleged to do these bombings.  Clearly,
the liberal bias of the media comes through time and time again,
and it is certainly pronounced in this case.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One last question, Gary.  As you know, President Clinton 
has tended to veto pro-life measures or to deal with abortion-related 
bills in the dead of night or on the weekend or sometimes in the middle
of, even once, a bombing that the United States was involved with.

<p>

What is your analysis on when this particular Partial Birth Abortion
Ban Act will be handled?

<p>

MR. BAUER: I think the best prediction is that it will happen late 
on a Friday when most of the media is already focused on other things, 
or it will happen on a day when there is big news someplace else, 
either foreign policy news and so forth.

<p>

This White House has shown a very clear pattern
of doing things it doesn't want the public to focus on at times
when the media is not going to be watching very closely, and I
suspect the same thing will happen on this.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you so much, Gary, for being with us.

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Thank you, Kristi.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, we will begin our
discussion regarding same-sex marriage and how it could dramatically
influence society both today and forever.  Stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Webster's Dictionary defines marriage as
the state of being united to a person of the opposite sex as husband
or wife, one woman and one man.  As basic and familiar as the
definition may sound, the literal and fundamental meaning of marriage
may undergo a drastic change if homosexual activists have their
way.  Currently across the nation, the battle to redefine marriage
and family is being waged.  Studies, statistics, and basic common
sense tell us that marriage between a man and a woman stabilizes
sexuality and provides the best environment in which to procreate
and raise children.  This has been found true both in research
and in all of recorded history.  The family, based on a committed
man and woman, exists as the foundation of society before recorded
time.

<p>

Yet homosexual activists seek to legitimize their relationships
by forcing acceptance of same-sex couples under the law.  It has
become clear that the mere tolerance of homosexual relationships
is no longer enough.

<p>

Some may question whether the decision to allow same-sex marriage 
would really do that much damage.  But those people may want to ask 
themselves whether they are willing to have businesses required to 
have family health benefits for homosexual couples, to have their 
children taught in school that homosexual sex is the moral equivalent 
of marital love, and to endorse adoption of children by homosexual 
couples.

<p>

Marriage has been revered and protected throughout the world because 
that specific and special relationship benefitted not only the people in 
them but the societies as well.  Legally destroying the exclusive territory
of marriage to achieve a political end will not provide the real
benefits of marriage to homosexuals, but it may be the blow that
the shattered American family does not survive.

<p>

To help us understand just how much a decision to redefine marriage to 
include same-sex relationships could change all of society, I am joined 
by two special guests:  Robert Knight, Director of Cultural Studies for
the Family Research Council, who has been one of the most influential
pro-family leaders in bringing this issue to light in research
and analysis; and Anthony Falzarano, Executive Director of Transformations
Ex-Gay Ministry, who works daily with men and women trying to
free themselves from the gay lifestyle.  Both are the most eloquent
experts on these issues today.

<p>

Welcome to the show.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: Great to be here.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Thanks for the introduction, too.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You're welcome.  Most of the time you're one amongst
many anti; it is only fair that you're acknowledged for the 
contributions that you both have made.

<p>

I wanted to start -- as I talk about this issue, as you all both 
do very eloquently, so many people do not understand why we should 
care.  You know, look, they're already out there. There are already 
homosexuals and lesbians in relationships.  So they have a marriage 
ceremony.  What does it hurt?  And I ask you, what does it hurt?

<p>

Bob, I will start with you, and then Anthony.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, a lot of people don't realize that what they're 
seeking is not so much acceptance for individual relationships as a 
larger goal, which is acceptance within the law, which forces it on 
everybody else.

<p>

See, when you have a couple homosexuals who say, &quot;Well, we want to
commit to ourselves,&quot; and then they go have a ceremony, they've
got that right in this country.  It's a free country.  But when
they bring the law into it, they bring us all into it.  They tell
us all that this marriage license is now the same as mom and dad
over here, and that cheapens mom and dad's marriage license, because
suddenly that marriage, the word &quot;marriage&quot; doesn't
mean what it used to mean.  It's not a very specific, defined
thing.

<p>

When you do that, when you bring a counterfeit version
in, that hurts the original.  It hurts support for the original
within the law.  People have worked very hard over the years to
support marriage within the law by setting aside specific benefits
for it, protections.  You know, spouses can't testify against
each other in trials, and all kinds of things.

<p>

Support for these kinds of special set-asides would erode if the 
institution itself suddenly ceases to be that special man-woman 
unique relationship that is the heart of civilization.

<p>

We can't do without it, and that's the bottom line.  The state knows 
that. Even if the state didn't believe that any religion was valid -- 
Christianity, Judaism, Islam, anything -- they would still support 
marriage because it has such a wide array of social benefits.  There 
is no society on Earth that has functioned without marriage, and there 
are many that have gone into the dust bin of history as soon as they 
cheapened marriage:  Rome, Greece, some of the middle Chinese dynasties.
When marriage became cheapened, the social fabric began to unravel.

<p>

And we're seeing that in this country.  We have already cheapened
marriage with easy divorce.  We have prenuptial agreements, we
have people living together.  It has already hurt marriage.  But
this would be the final blow, to say that it doesn't even have
to be a man and a woman.  It could be two guys.  And if you're
at that point, why not three guys or four guys?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There are so many interesting countervailing trends right 
now. You have a move to get rid of no-fault divorce because we say
divorce has unraveled our society.  You have men's movements saying
we need fathers involved with their children.  And then you have
this whole homosexual activist movement saying, Oh, all of that
is null and void; we really just need to expand and have it mean
even less than it does today.

<p>

Anthony, you understand this very well.  Why do you think it matters 
whether or not we legally change the definition of marriage?

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: This is extremely important. I would obviously agree 
with Bob.  Basically, the homosexual, let's say the political gay 
community, is out to destroy the traditional marriage, heterosexual 
marriage, that God has designed for us. God deemed that the male 
would leave his parents and cling onto the female and the two would 
become one.

<p>

Basically, our country was founded on those Judeo-Christian 
values, and God has blessed our country because we have stood for 
those values. But over the last 25 years we have seen an incredible 
deterioration of those values.

<p>

What the gays are up to is, they can't change the church in our 
country.  They can't change the mainline church. They can't change 
the Roman Catholic church.  They can't change the mainline Protestant 
church's view of homosexuality:  it is sinful behavior.

<p>

So, basically, what they started with in 1973 was going to the 
next most important authority, which was the
American Psychological Association, and they pushed homosexuality
out of the <i>APA Journal</i>, and when the APA decided that they would
take homosexuality out of the DSM-III, which is the official digest
of mental illnesses in this country, with that they now had permission
from an authority to go to our Federal Government and go to our
state government and say, &quot;See, these professionals do not
consider this to be a mental illness; therefore, you are discriminating
against us, and you are going to have to give us our rights.&quot;

<p>

And now they are trying to get gay marriage pushed onto our country,
because then they can now go after the church, and they can say,
&quot;Well, the American Psychiatric Association says we're normal,
the Federal Government, the state government says we're normal;
therefore, if you don't start hiring us in that local Catholic
church or that local Protestant church or in that Christian day
school, we're going to sue you, and if you don't conform, the
Federal Government is going to take your 501(c)(3) status away
and is going to take your full tax-exempt status away; therefore,
many of these churches will not be able to survive.&quot;

<p>

It's just like Georgetown University was forced to have a pro-gay group
on their campus, and it's against Catholic teaching.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Georgetown, a Catholic University that we have to mention.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  Yes, and they get federal funding from the government.
And if you take that $40 or $50 million away, whatever that figure
is, Georgetown University will be out of business tomorrow.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think it is interesting to note not only how accurate
that prediction is for future society but present society.  A
gentleman in Seattle, for example, that called Family Research
Council not too long ago.  He was a business owner, had hired
a gentleman who was a homosexual as an accountant.  They did not
have the business to keep him employed, and so they had to lay
him off, and a suit was filed that it was homosexual discrimination
because this gentleman played Christian music in the business
that he owned.  Because of that, he is fighting an expensive lawsuit
on antidiscrimination grounds saying that his faith is the problem,
and it's an extraordinary case.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes. Here are some other cases.  Shell Oil Company on the 
West Coast, there was a homosexual higher level executive who used the 
company fax machine and the xerox machine to make fliers advertising a 
gay orgy. You know, it was a very explicit flier.  Well, that's not 
conduct suitable for a high executive at Shell Oil Company, so they fired
him.

<p>

He came back and said, &quot;Well, you fired me because I'm
gay.&quot;  So under California's gay rights law, he sued; he
won millions from Shell Oil Company.

<p>

That's what we're talking about whenever you're talking about gay 
rights. You're talking about giving somebody a gun to put at the head 
of anybody who disagrees with them, whether it's the Boy Scouts, whether 
it's a local dry-cleaning establishment or a giant corporation like
Shell Oil.

<p>

That's another reason we're fighting this whole gay
marriage idea, because when you create something that's immoral,
which gay marriage certainly is, by any stretch, by any religious
value system and tradition, and then you put it into the law,
you make everybody who disagrees a moral outlaw.  You make people
who disagree find themselves the target of civil suits, harassment
at work.

<p>

I just got a call today from a guy who works for a federal
contractor, and he has been fired from his job by a homosexual
supervisor who had been hiring homosexuals, and they found out
he was Christian and harassed him and finally fired him.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Amazing. And it's only the beginning.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: It's just the beginning.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  This is only the beginning.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And we're going to have to hear more
about this after the break.  Please join us after the commercial
break as we continue to discuss the homosexual agenda regarding
marriage and family. Stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. Tonight we are discussing the drastic ramifications of 
changing marriage to including same-sex relationships, and I am joined
again by Robert Knight, Director of Cultural Studies for the Family
Research Council, and Anthony Falzarano, Executive Director of
Transformations Ex-Gay Christian Ministries.  Thank you so much
again for being with us.

<p>

There is a lot of activity going on in Hawaii right now, and, Bob, 
we are going to get to you on that in a second, where the law is 
being a frontal attack.

<p>

But, Anthony, one thing that has been interesting to me in a lot of 
the homosexual activist literature is there's this myth out there that 
most homosexual relationships are two men, two women that have been 
together for 30 years and that we're merely going to legalize with this 
change something that is already taking place.  And yet the gay literature
is very clear that not only do they want to call the relationships
marriage; they don't want their marriages to be the same as what
we would call good marriages.  Could you explain that?

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: Yes.  Well, basically, it is all propaganda.  They cannot 
sell short-term marriages to the American public.  They cannot sell
a marriage where there are three guys living in sin together.
So, basically, they choose, a certain amount of gays -- and there
are a certain percentage that are together in monogamous relationships,
but I can assure you, they are an extreme minimum.  Most homosexuals
are still highly promiscuous, even in the age of AIDS.  And, basically,
they get these people, they look all scrubbed, all American, they
have a house with a white picket fence in Falls Church, Virginia,
and you just think, Wow, they're just wonderful people; how can
we discriminate against these people?  And, basically, they are
pushing this pro-gay agenda onto the American public.  If they
can get --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  But the gay literature -- one thing
that has been interesting to me is the gay literature has come
right out and said we can't keep monogamy in our definition of
marriage.  We may have a significant relationship we'll call marriage,
but things like monogamy and fidelity, faithfulness, and lifetime
kind of till-death-do-us-part commitments are a little unrealistic.
So we want it to be marriage, but we don't want it to be monogamous.

<p>

It has been a strange delinking of monogamy.  But why do you think
that has --

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  Well, it's political.  Basically, they want to be 
able to get, if they have a boyfriend and they
work at AT&amp;T, which is a very pro-gay organization right now,
they want to be able to have that boyfriend have insurance benefits.
I mean, you can hook up with a guy who is your friend who has
AIDS and he has no health insurance, and that's very sad, but
in our country he would never be denied health care, but with
certain corporations you're going to get better health care, so
they can claim that they are in a monogamous relationship, and
therefore, you have to extend benefits to my boyfriend.

<p>

I mean, there are a lot of reasons why they are doing this, but what we
really have to focus in on is this is an attack on Judeo-Christian
values in this country.  This is an assault on traditional Judeo-Christian
marriage, and if the American public falls for this and allows
homosexual marriage to be officially recognized in the courts,
you are opening up a whole can of worms.  You are opening up the
insurance industry, the wills.  A lot of times if someone has
--

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Education.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  -- education -- you know, this is my boyfriend. He 
can bring this boyfriend into class and introduce him to 12-year-old 
children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Sure.

<p>
MR. FALZARANO:  It's a whole can of worms, and it's so
beautifully packaged by organizations like the Human Rights Campaign
Fund.  I mean, I was on a show with the director of that organization,
and she was quoting -- I don't know where she got her statistics
from, but she was quoting a study that says that America really
is for gay marriage.  And when she started giving off her data,
she said, &quot;Well, in this study, 48 percent are undecided.&quot;
I said, &quot;Well, where are you getting this propaganda from?&quot;
I said, &quot;What kind of study would have credibility where
48 percent of the study is undecided?&quot;

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Is &quot;I don't know,&quot; right.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  America is against gay marriage.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Oh, yes.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  And, hopefully, they will never accept it, or the 
wrath of God will come upon this country.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Well, interestingly enough, Hawaii has been the 
spearpoint state for driving gay marriage into the country, and 
yet, apparently, the spear point got a little blunted this week. 
Bob, what happened?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Boy, did it!  Well, it started last week. They released 
the latest poll of Hawaiians, and what had been a 71 percent figure 
opposing same-sex marriage rose to 74 percent.  That was reported 
in the major Honolulu newspapers. The percentage just keeps rising 
as people understand the threat that gay marriage, so called, poses.

<p>

But yesterday there was a major victory in the Senate.  There was a 
bill that went through the Senate unanimously, 24 to nothing, banning 
same-sex marriage, reaffirming the state's commitment to one man-one 
woman marriage, and stating the reasons for it.  This was all done 
because a court case is coming up in Hawaii in a circuit court, sent 
down from the Supreme Court, expected to be heard in August, in which 
three couples have challenged the marriage license law.

<p>

The Supreme Court had told the state of Hawaii, find a compelling 
interest to preserve one man-one woman marriage or we are going to 
open it up to same-sex relationships.

<p>

So now the Senate has moved. Liberal Hawaii, liberal Democrats and 
moderate Republicans and some conservatives, all voting to preserve 
marriage.  That has got to send a signal to the courts, and it should 
send a signal to the rest of America that you don't want this, folks.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: People don't, I think, understand [that] to redefine 
marriage is to open -- some things we are going to talk about in the 
next segment, adoption of children, to change our educational system,
to say that any kind of sex practice is morally neutral.  Here
we are struggling with rising STD rates and you have a growing
abstinence movement and just plain an attempt to decrease sexually
transmitted diseases among kids and a crippling infertility rate,
and then we are going to say that all sex practices, despite these
horrible figures, the sex that you have is insignificant.

<p>

There are all these strange counter-trends going on, but I think one
of the interesting significances of Hawaii is, if Hawaii, that
one state, changes their law, the rest of the nation is changed.
Bob, could you explain that for the viewers?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes. Because of the full faith and credit clause of the 
Constitution, states are supposed to recognize licenses from out of 
state, like a driver's license.  If a gay couple from, say, Ohio flies 
to Honolulu, gets married under a brand-new gay marriage law in Hawaii
and goes back to Ohio, they can present their marriage license
and say, &quot;Look, you have to recognize it with all the benefits
and status and privileges it brings.&quot;  That gives Ohio a
huge problem under the full faith and credit clause.  If they
don't recognize it, the gay couple is going to haul them into
court and say, &quot;You're denying us our basic human rights.&quot;

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Based on the Constitution, even.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Based on the Constitution.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  And what is incredible about
that is that a lot of states are adopting anti-gay marriage laws
right now, but, you see, the gays aren't concerned about that.
They are going to go up to the Supreme Court, which will override
the state laws, and that is what they are really up to, taking
this up to the Supreme Court.  They are assaulting the American
public right now.  They are extremely organized, and if they don't
win in Hawaii, they are going to hit California; they are going
to hit another liberal state; and eventually, they are going to
try to break through.  That is what they are up to.

<p>

If the American public doesn't wise up to this, then evil thrives 
when good men and women do nothing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Absolutely. 

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: I can tell you one thing about the --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You're going to have to tell me this after the break, 
because we are going to hear more about this.  When <i>Straight Talk</i> 
returns, we will hear more about how same-sex marriage affects the family 
and America's children.  Please stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We're back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>.

<p>

Legalizing same-sex marriage not only touches the lives of those
involved in the relationships; it also affects America's children
by opening the door to gay adoption and much more.

<p>

To shed light on this, back again are Bob Knight and Anthony Falzarano.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: Again.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Again.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: Are we eloquent still?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Eloquent and continuing to be eloquent.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

But I wanted to let you wrap up one point before we
get into the real reason why so many of us are fighting this,
which is for today's children.  But why is it, Anthony, homosexuals
and lesbians have made tremendous gains in societies?  I mean,
Hollywood and really in the job and a lot of different settings.
Why do they keep coming?  Why now gay marriage?

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: I am the director of an ex-gay ministry.  I am a former 
homosexual myself.  I was gay for nine years before I got saved and 
became a Christian and the blood of Jesus Christ washed over me.

<p>

Basically, I had no problem getting an apartment if I made enough money,
just like anybody else.  No one ever turned me down for an apartment.
There are certain gays out there that just want to push into
the landlord's face that I'm a homosexual and you can't keep me
out.

<p>

Basically, homosexuality is a neurosis.  It's healable, it's
treatable.  We are ministering to 6,000 former homosexuals in
the Exodus network.  Basically, homosexuality is a stunting of
psychosexual growth.  They are children inside, and any parents
out there -- you know, when your kid is spoiled, he'll keep coming
at you and keep coming at you and keep coming at you until you
give him a whack on the bottom and say, &quot;Enough!&quot; and
then the child will stop.

<p>

The American public has got to start treating the homosexual community 
in that way. They've got to say, &quot;Enough is enough.  You have 
enough benefits. You can live in your subculture, but please do not 
push this on our Judeo-Christian values.&quot;

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And the reason why they're stunted, I think you need 
to bring that up.  A lot of people were molested; there were some 
serious events in their lives.  We know from psychological
research that powerful and crushing events do stunt growth.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: Of course. Eighty percent of the people that have
come to Transformation in Washington have been sexually abused
as children.  Ninety-eight percent of them did not bond with their
same-sex parent.  And, basically, that is the main cause of homosexuality.
And when we treat those symptoms with the love of the Christian
church, people start to recover from homosexuality.

<p>

We see people go on to heterosexual marriage.  We put marriages back 
together. We see people go on to seminary.  These people don't necessarily
want to be gay.  They are being sold a bill of goods by the political
pro-gay factions that are in this country, and we need to get
the word out that you don't have to be gay and that there are
options, and I believe that many homosexuals, if they knew that
they had an option, would take that option to become ex-gay.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, one of the things that you have been studying has
been the sexualizing of children and the way in which children
have become a political football.  But they are the real goal
here.

<p>

It was interesting, during the gay march here in Washington,
D.C., one of the constant chants was, &quot;Ten percent is not
enough; recruit, recruit, recruit,&quot; which kind of flies in
the face of their biological argument.

<p>

Why are children the key issue here with the gay marriage debate?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, because when you legitimatize gay marriage, you 
really can't say no to adoption of children in same-sex households, 
because you have destroyed the gender distinction, the idea that men 
and women are different, complementary, have something special to offer
each other and to their children.

<p>

It is kind of the Equal Rights Amendment. It is creeping in through the 
back door saying men and women are interchangeable; there is no 
difference, so let's not make any distinctions at all.  That's what 
it's all about. That's why it's not just live and let live, have a gay 
couple down the street get a marriage license.  It's so much bigger than
that. I think what has not been said often enough is that children
really do need a mother and a father.  A little boy needs to have
a father to learn what it is to be a man and to have his growing
masculinity affirmed, and he needs to have a mother for that mother
love, and to watch both parents interact and see how men should
treat women, women should treat men, how they both treat each
other as husbands and wives, mothers and fathers, and their relationship
with their children.

<p>

In a gay household, these same-sex households that are now adopting 
children, the child immediately doesn't have a father or a mother, 
one or the other, so the kid is already at a disadvantage. Then the 
child sees a distorted view of sexuality because of the homosexuality 
going on, and then that child is intensely curious about what men 
and women do together, what relationships they have.

<p>

I know a guy who has just entered jail, tragically,
because he grew up in a lesbian household.  He still loves his
mother and doesn't really blame her, but he said, &quot;You know,
as a boy in a lesbian environment where it was intensely anti-male&quot;
-- that's all he heard, this bitterness toward men -- he said
that he felt totally disenfranchised, began having sexual problems.
He eventually became a voyeur, and he is in on a peeping Tom
charge.  He was so curious about how normal people have sex. We
have other people that are cases like this.

<p>

One case will not a principle make, but this guy is a symptom, and it 
shows that without a dad in the house to set him straight, he really 
ran into a lot of problems.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  That is right.  There is a case in the Rhode Island 
court system right now.  This poor father called me, and he says, 
&quot;I need help.&quot;  Basically, his wife left him for a woman, 
and basically, there is a custody fight over the two girls, two young 
girls in the family.

<p>

Basically, the judge said to this young father, &quot;Look, I'm not 
concerned if your wife is a lesbian.  I want to find out who is the most
suitable parent to take custody over these children.&quot;  And
he describes how unstable his former wife's girlfriend is, and
to expose two pure young girls to a lesbian relationship -- it's
child abuse, and I can't believe the courts would even consider
giving custody to this woman.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  But if you get same-sex marriage, the courts are going 
to have no choice.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: They'll have no options.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Because marriage is a privilege,
and it's a benefit, and the state really does set a big fence
around it to protect it.  So if the state thinks enough of that
relationship to give it all these special benefits and says this
is okay, you will have no defense against homosexuals saying,
&quot;We want children, too.  We're going to have them, and by
the way, we're going to teach them that homosexuality is okay
in the schools.&quot;

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  But the reason why we benefit [from] marriage is 
because marriages benefit society.  It is not a random social gift. 
People fare better, children fare better.

<p>

I want to thank my guests.  I want to encourage people to call
and write these different organizations for more about this. 
When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> will show you some video clips 
highlighting the homosexual marriage and adoption issues. Don't go 
away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council></i>.

<p>

Robert Knight has appeared on many confrontational
television shows, and tonight we will share a couple of those
with you as Bob discussed some same-sex marriage and homosexual
adoption issues.  Let's take a look at clips from ABC's 
<i>Nightline</i> and <i>Oprah</i> as we bring you Homefront News.

<p>

[Segment from ABC <i>Nightline</i>, September 25, 1995, follows:]

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Marriage is the uniting of the two sexes.
That's the definition.  So when homosexuals say, &quot;We want
the right to marry,&quot; they've already got it, but they don't
meet the requirements.  The requirements are --

<p>

MR. KOPPEL: Defined by whom?  Defined by whom?  Requirements as 
defined by whom?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Every major culture on the planet, all major religions. 
I mean, Ted, come on.  You're talking as if marriage hadn't existed, 
something we invented to oppress homosexuals, and that's nonsense.  
It is the building block.

<p>

MR. KOPPEL:  No, no, no.  What I am doing, Mr. Knight --
and forgive me; we should let our other guests have a chance to
get in here, too -- but what I am saying is that marriage -- you
refer to marriage as though it was some unchanging institution
that has not in any manner been modified over the years, and clearly,
it has.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, it has not been modified to the extent
that the homosexuals are asking, which is to eliminate an entire
gender from it.  It's the bringing together of the two sexes.
Once you don't do that, you leave an entire gender out, that
makes it something else entirely.  It's not the same psychological
dynamics, emotional dynamics.  Homosexuals do not do what mom
and dad do in the bedroom.  They don't provide children the role
models that mom and dad do.  It's an entirely different animal
and doesn't deserve the same benefits that society gives marriages.

<p>

[Segment from Oprah, January 26, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: -- and that is why kids ought to be in marriages, not in 
gay households.  They need mothers and fathers.  Okay?

<p>

I want to ask the viewers.  I want to ask the viewers, do they really 
think their mom could be replaced by two gay men; or their dad, their
father, by two women?  Sexuality is not a small thing.  Boys need
fathers.  Girls do, too, so they understand men.

<p>

GUEST: People need loving parents.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Love is great, okay?  Love is great, but sexuality is 
important.  There are two different, complementary
sexes.  You guys are pretending people are interchangeable and
there's no difference.

<p>

GUEST: There's no pretending anywhere.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  There are a lot of people who are screwed up with
their gender identity because they didn't bond with their fathers
or their mothers.

<p>

GUEST: The question here is we're talking about
protecting children.  Lesbian and gay families do exist, and the
question is, are we going to protect the children here?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes, we should.

<p>

GUEST: Are we going to entitle the children to child support?

<p>

MS. WINFREY:  I will tell you this.  May I just
interrupt this?  I've done this show before.  I've been down this
road, and years ago we did this show and I was so moved by the
children.  If you ask the children, the children will tell you
they want to be in a family where people love them, whether they
are two men, two women, a woman and a man.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

If you ask the children, that's what the children will tell you. 
The children just want people -- want to be loved and nurtured and
guided.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Okay, if a child told you, &quot;I'd rather
have three or four parents than two,&quot; would you say, &quot;Oh,
that's okay.  The kid wants it, so it must be right&quot;?  Who
do we decide?  Aren't we adults?  Come on, parents know better
than children know what they need.

<p>

GUEST: Listen. Look at society --

<p>

MS. WINFREY:  I'm just saying, ask the children.  Ask the
children, if they have a choice between being in a home with a
man and a woman who did not care for them or a man and woman who
had all these problems, divorce and fighting, arguing, abuse and
all that --

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  You can't compare a worst-case scenario
with something that's totally different.  You could say, well,
is a kid better off in a burning house or over here in a safe
gay household?  I mean, you could invent thousands of scenarios
like that.  Let's not be absurd.  There's a mountain of evidence.

<p>

MS. WINFREY:  Robert, I wasn't trying to be absurd, you know.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, I'm sorry.  That's how it came across to me.
There are mountains of evidence that show that kids do best in
mom-and-dad families.  You can't deny it.

<p>

<P>
<I><p>20 March, 2006.</I>
<p>

My cryptagent made the discovery.  It sure looked like a break-in:  the wreckage of 512bit crypto code, address shreds from bolted folders, a corrupted cache. I sure hope the CC boys found what they were looking for.
<P>
How did it happen that the Government now routinely reads what we write and say in the ether?  That sure wasn't the intention, back when the Telecommunications Act of 1996 passed.  The idea then was that very restricted language would be inserted that would protect our children.  I even remember the scene at a certain Wednesday meeting:  The "Family" alliance was making a big stink about "smut on the internet," and when we barely whispered, "censorship," they got even angrier.<I>  "See this language," they </i>and their conference committee champions said,<i> "this does nothing to inhibit free speech.  We're just taking the Pacifica definition of obscenity that everyone agrees with.  And look!  We even put in a paragraph that tells the FCC it has no power to enforce any of this!"</i>
<P>
How could you argue with that, especially when that particular staffer's hands were shaking with righteousness?  We all had similar run-ins.  We didn't want to alienate our friends on the side of the angels, so we let it pass.
<P>
We forgot the great truth about government in the last century:  legislation to do good for all ends up as government's authority to control us.  The Income Tax, Prohibition, the Draft, Citizens with Disabilities, the Clean Air Act, the Tobacco Control Act of '02;  all were designed to help people, boost the general welfare, promote civic virtue.  
<P>
But they were designed to achieve all these good things by fiat from above.  Today, so many of us think these laws pure tyranny, but the laws themselves did not enslave us.  We need to look elsewhere for that, to the ethos of rule.
<P>
The late-lamented twentieth century saw the maturation and old age of an industrial world.  It was a world of pyramids run from the top down, where those who made it to the top were called "the best and the brightest."  Law and Ivy credentials gave them the authority to call themselves<i> managers </i> (the equestrian rank of those days).  But they were not content to use this authority merely to rule.  They wanted to<i> help</I> people;  and they knew,
<i>O best and brightest,</I> that they had the smarts and the heart to do it.
<P>
They were<i> Progressives.</I>  The whole of the last century was informed by the urgent need for smart people to uplift everyone else.  And only they knew how.  And only they could do it.
<P>
This ethos of rule naturally inclined toward laws that would let the best and brightest do their good work right away.  But to do this, progressives needed not just authority;  they needed control.  Their reasoning:  <i>People will never do right on their own:  just look at the chaos and abuse of an open system.  People have to be told what to do.  The more they do what we say, the better things will be.</I>       
<P>
No, this was not Stalin's kind of control.  Not exactly.
<P>
Even now it is hard for us to believe that people who called themselves <i>Liberal and Progressive </I>for so long longed only to bring us a kinder and gentler Gulag.  But look at what they have done:
<P>
It's true, the language in the Telecom Act of '96 was careful.  FCC enforcement of the censorship provision <i>(what else can I call it!)</I> was forbidden.  The problem was, it was there in the first place.  We failed because we were worrying about the wrong problem.
<P>
We worried about "porn on the internet;"  or we were vulnerable, in some celestial way, to entreaties for the welfare of our children.  So we let a bill pass that gave progressive government still more authority over our lives.  The "Family" alliance was thinking,<i> Save our Children!,</I> but someone else was thinking,<i> I can do the protecting!</I>    
<P>
We then gave the Fed the implicit charge to go out and protect us some more.  Not the FCC.  Oh no.  The law said they could not enforce.  But there were scads of Federal agencies aching to enforce.  And enforce they did.  If the FCC was barred from enforcement, it was not denied the right of assistance.  And assist they did.
<P>
And those NSA geeks (don't tell me it was just CC boys) busting into my cache?  I knew it would happen eventually.  My encryption engine exceeded the Federal legal rating … and it was in use.  Like the old radar detectors, we all have them;  they're only illegal if you use them.  And since they're too hard to crack in volume, we get by.  We need 512 bits, for plain old privacy.
<P>
So that was how the Telecom language intended to protect us become our scourge:  All porn has to be encrypted, but encryption that works is illegal to use!  Since the porn guys have been giving away 512b engines and keys for free, the Feds say this means most kids can get it<i> (if you ignore the '000s of parental control products!). </I> So our Protectors have their probable cause <i>and</I> their slogan:<i>  For the children!</I>
<P>
I just hope it took them a nice long time to break in.  I left them a nice <i>.gif </I>of Manet's <i>Olympia.</I>  Good thing I've got the latest 1024b kernel on my hand-held.  At least they haven't started search and seizure
<P>
Yet.

<h3>THE MYTHS AND REALITIES OF TRADE PROTECTIONISM</h3>

Backgrounder No. 1077<br>

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This year's presidential campaign has raised once again the issue of free trade versus protectionism, with protectionists arguing that reducing foreign imports protects American jobs and benefits the overall U.S. economy. What are the facts?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There is no evidence that protectionism produces economic benefits that outweigh its costs, but there is plenty of evidence that it does more harm than good. There is near unanimity among economists, for example, that free and unrestricted trade benefits economies while protectionism hurts them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
America has a long history of advocating free trade, and, despite the claims of many, has been a free trade country throughout most of its history. When America has strayed from the path of free trade, the result has been economic hardship. Yet America today is on the brink of reviving protectionist policies that have failed in the past. The consequences would be all too predictable: lower living standards for all Americans, higher levels of unemployment, more business bankruptcies, and lingering economic decay.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The policies advanced by opponents of free trade ultimately are based on a number of myths: 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Myth #1: Free trade has destroyed America's manufacturing base. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Not true. Today manufacturing measured as a percentage of the U.S. economy is about the same today as it was in 1967.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Myth #2: High manufacturing wages must be protected from foreign competition regardless of the cost to the overall economy. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Not true. The cost of saving jobs from foreign competition is higher consumer prices, which harm the economy. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Myth #3: Free trade is causing America to lose its technological edge. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Not true. America today is the most technologically advanced country in the world, recapturing the lead in many high-tech industries like semiconductors.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Myth #4: Trade deficits are harmful while trade surpluses are beneficial.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Not true. Trade deficits are more a sign of strength than they are of weakness. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Myth #5: Trade deficits cost jobs. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Not true. The data show that as the trade deficit increases, unemployment decreases. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Myth #6: Japan's prosperity is based on trade surpluses generated by managed trade policies.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Not true. Japan is suffering economically because of its managed trade policies.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Myth #7: American companies will go bankrupt unless the U.S. government limits import competition and forces foreign countries to purchase more U.S. goods. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Not true. Many industries once thought to be in danger of bankruptcy are making record profits.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Myth #8: Countries like Japan are called protectionist simply because the U.S. has experienced difficulty penetrating their markets. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Not true. American companies sell almost $70 billion a year in Japan, America's largest market besides Canada.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Myth #9: Trade surpluses are always the result of government policy.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Not true. Some countries are likely to run a trade deficit because they import cheaper raw materials and export more expensive finished goods. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Myth #10: Trade retaliation is the most effective way to open foreign markets. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Not true. Trade retaliation most often fails to open foreign markets.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Myth #11: International trade arrangements like the World Trade Organization and the North American Free Trade Area violate American sovereignty. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Not true. No international organization has final policy-making authority over the United States. In all cases, the U.S. Congress and the President have final authority.
<P>

<b>THE MYTHS OF TRADE PROTECTIONISM</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The protectionist approach to settling trade disputes with Japan, China, and other countries rests on a number of myths about free trade and trade deficits. These myths are the intellectual foundation of protectionism.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #1</b>: Free trade has destroyed America's manufacturing base. Opponents of free trade argue that cheaper labor in foreign countries forces American companies to move their operations overseas. They contend that in the long run, America is being de-industrialized. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. First of all, labor is not the only factor in producing manufactured goods. Other factors such as capital, natural resources, and infrastructure also must be considered. If labor was the only or even the most important factor, all the world's manufacturers would be located in such low-wage countries as Haiti, Somalia, and the Dominican Republic. Manufacturers avoid these poor countries because of the many problems that add to the cost of doing business there. For example, port facilities or roads may be inadequate or non-existent, driving up the costs of transporting goods to market; there may be no telephone or fax service; and local and federal taxes may be so high that they cancel out any savings from cheap labor.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>America's Manufacturing Might.</b> Even more important, America is not de-industrializing. Manufacturing as a percentage of the U.S. economy is essentially the same today -- about 21 percent of GDP -- as it was in 1967.<sup>1</sup>  Moreover, employment in manufacturing has remained relatively stable over the last three decades. The number of Americans working in manufacturing jobs today (about 10.5 million) is about the same as in the early 1960s.<sup>2</sup>  Thus, even though these jobs represent a smaller percentage of the growing U.S. population, these Americans now are building computers and advanced medical devices instead of working in assembly lines sewing clothes or soldering circuit boards. If it is true that manufacturing is about the same percent of the U.S. economy as it was nearly 30 years ago, and that there are fewer workers as a percentage of the total U.S. population performing those tasks, then it is also true that the American worker is becoming more productive. This is a sign of strength, not weakness.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #2</b>: High manufacturing wages must be protected regardless of the cost to the overall economy. Protectionists believe that American manufacturing wages must be protected from foreign competition regardless of the costs to the rest of the country. They also argue that foreign competition causes Americans to lose their jobs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. The cost of saving jobs from foreign competition is higher consumer prices, which harm the economy. For example, when trade quotas were imposed on imported cars in the early 1980s, prices for domestic and imported cars rose by $2,000.<sup>3</sup>  While these quotas may have preserved some auto workers' jobs, they also passed the cost on to the American consumer. Instead of being able to use this money to send their children to college, pay their mortgages, or put food on the table, American consumers are forced to subsidize the jobs of other Americans who cannot compete internationally. In short, protectionism takes money from the many to support the high wages or jobs of the few.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Moreover, trying to save a few jobs through protectionism may cause a net loss of many more jobs. When the U.S. imposed import quotas on the auto industry in the 1980s, the price of a new U.S. automobile increased by an average of 41 percent from 1981 to 1984. This was nearly twice the average rate of increase for all consumer prices during that time. While the auto industry can claim that these price hikes saved up to 22,000 jobs, they also prevented many consumers from buying new cars.<sup>4</sup>  In fact, U.S. consumers bought around 1 million fewer U.S. cars after the U.S. imposed import quotas,<sup>5</sup> and the drop in sales forced the auto industry to lay off 50,000 workers in the late 1980s.<sup>6</sup>  Thus, even though 22,000 jobs apparently were saved, the layoffs caused by the price increase actually produced a net loss of 30,000 jobs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What is more, the price increases cost the American consumers $17 billion in higher auto prices. To save just one of those 22,000 auto jobs, American consumers had to pay $772,727. It would have been cheaper if the American taxpayer, through the U.S. government, could have given these auto workers a one-time check for $500,000 and then laid them off. Either way, whether by imposing tariffs or by paying laid-off workers directly, the U.S. government would be subsidizing relatively few workers at great expense to Americans generally.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Similarly, the number of retail jobs destroyed by years of import restrictions on textile and apparel products is far greater than the number of jobs created or saved in the textile manufacturing industry. Americans pay 58 percent higher prices for textile and apparel products because of U.S. trade restrictions. This amounts to $11 billion to $15 billion a year.<sup>7</sup>  Thus, while protectionism saved 22,390 U.S. textile and apparel jobs in the 1980s, it cost the U.S. consumer $550,916 per job saved. However, once job losses in other industries, like the retail sector, are added to the equation, the cost of each job saved increases to well over $4 million.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It should be up to individual Americans, not government, to determine how much they pay for consumer goods. It is unfair to ask a school teacher making $26,000 a year to pay $2,000 more for a car to subsidize an auto worker who makes $50,000 a year.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #3</b>: Free trade is causing America to lose its technological edge. Advocates of protectionism argue that the United States is losing its technological edge to countries like Japan, mainly as a result of the U.S. dedication to free trade. These advocates argue that foreign competition has forced many U.S. high-tech firms into bankruptcy or out of the business of producing certain goods. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. America today is the most technologically advanced country in the world, a leader in the production of such high-tech products as advanced audio and video equipment, air conditioners, building and construction hardware, computers and computer software, environmental technology equipment, medical equipment and chemicals, navigational and surveying equipment, and telecommunications equipment. Moreover, American firms are recapturing the lead in many technological fields in which they had fallen behind during the 1980s. 
<p>
Two examples:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Example 1: Semiconductors.</b> Semiconductors are electrical components used to conduct electricity. They are used not only in the most basic of electrical products, such as toasters, but in the most advanced devices, such as supercomputers or orbital satellites. All electrical products incorporate some type of semiconductor, so this industry obviously is vital to the economic well-being of any country.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Today, America is the world's largest manufacturer and seller of semiconductors. Many argue that an aggressive U.S. protectionist policy has raised the industry to its present status. In fact, however, it was U.S. private-sector joint ventures and sound business decisions by the U.S. semiconductor industry that resulted in this current prosperity. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By the 1980s, Japan had become America's biggest rival in semiconductors. Japanese firms began to invest aggressively in computer memory chips, trying to beat out the remaining U.S. producers in this area. Sensing an impending downturn in demand, many U.S. firms abandoned production of these relatively low-tech items in favor of more profitable higher-tech products. One such product was the microprocessor. While the downturn in demand for memory chips did occur in the mid-1980s, and the Japanese endured major losses, American semiconductor manufacturers profited because they focused on producing microprocessors, not memory chips.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
However, after U.S. industry had walked away from the memory chip, sales in Japan dropped. The U.S. responded to this problem in 1986 by seeking a U.S.-Japan agreement that would force the Japanese to buy more semiconductors from the United States. But this agreement had little, if any impact on increased U.S. semiconductor sales in Japan. What did increase American semiconductor sales in Japan was a series of private-sector U.S. joint ventures with Japanese companies. These ventures gave U.S. companies access to crucial Japanese manufacturing techniques and distribution channels, in addition to shared research and development costs. In 1990, there was just a handful of U.S./Japan semiconductor partnerships; by 1994, there where over four dozen. It was these partnerships that enabled American companies to sell more semiconductors in Japan.<sup>10</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Example 2: Steel.</b> In the 1970s and 1980s, America's steel industry was unable to compete with cheaper, foreign made steel. Many steel workers were laid off, some permanently. Today, the U.S. steel industry is stronger, with growing sales and more profitability. Many advocates of protectionism argue that U.S. steel was saved by trade restrictions. In fact, however, protectionism in steel harmed the U.S. economy while failing to help the U.S. steel industry. What did help the U.S. steel industry?  Joint ventures with foreign firms and massive foreign investment.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To help the U.S. steel industry cope with shrinking competitiveness in the 1970s, the Nixon Administration imposed relief from imports for a period of three years, during which the industry was supposed to modernize. In 1971, these import restraints were extended for another three years. From 1974 until 1993, the U.S. steel industry was under some kind of government protection. Wages rose from $9.90 per hour in 1970 to $17.46 per hour in 1980, an increase more than 60 percent higher than wage increases in the rest of the U.S. manufacturing sector.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The combination of higher steel wages and 20 years of protectionism cost more jobs among users of steel than were saved in the steel industry.<sup>11</sup>  Moreover, Americans paid some $5 billion a year in higher prices. Thus, while protection may have saved jobs in the steel industry, it destroyed jobs in other industries that use steel to manufacture their products. For example, from 1969 to 1980, U.S. manufacturers using U.S.-made steel paid 20 to 25 percent more for their steel than was paid by their foreign competitors.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Still, the U.S. steel industry did manage to make a tremendous comeback.<sup>12</sup>  The industry once again is making profits and, after years of modernization, is prepared to compete with foreign steel producers. The reason: Japanese foreign investment poured into the U.S. in the 1980s and gave U.S. steel companies the money they needed to build new plants and adopt more advanced manufacturing techniques. Moreover, private sector joint ventures between U.S. and Japanese steel companies taught U.S. firms how to manufacture steel more efficiently.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #4</b>: Trade deficits are harmful and trade surpluses are beneficial. This is the core idea behind protectionism and managed trade. Advocates of this view argue that trade deficits harm the economy, destroy jobs, and reflect weakness in the economy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. Trade deficits are more a sign of strength than of weakness. The U.S. trade deficit means that Americans hold more goods than their foreign trading partners, while foreigners hold more U.S. dollars. As the richest country in the world, America consumes goods and services from both U.S. and foreign companies. The influx of foreign goods and services in return for dollars adds to America's wealth. It does not detract from it.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Americans receive imported goods and services that increase their standard of living. Moreover, the dollars sent abroad for the purchase of goods and services typically cannot be spent within those countries. While dollars are traded between countries in financial markets, they are used mainly by foreign consumers to buy American goods and services. Thus, nations use surplus dollars to buy American goods and services, invest in American firms, or purchase U.S. Treasury bonds. These investments create jobs and wealth for Americans, while the purchase of Treasury bonds frees U.S. domestic capital for savings, investment, and purchases.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consider the example of someone who goes to the supermarket and buys $150 worth of groceries. The protectionist believes the proprietor has a trade "surplus" of $150, and the customer has a "deficit" of $150. But this is not the case. The grocer ends up with $150 in currency, while the customer has $150 worth of groceries. It is a mutually beneficial transaction. No one would expect the grocer to buy an equal amount of goods from the customer in order to have an equal balance sheet in exchanged goods. Nor should one expect countries to have an even balance sheet in international trade. The trade deficit represents nothing more than a surplus of foreign goods and services which Americans now own. The value of these goods and services is as much a part of the national wealth as is the possession of U.S. dollars.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Another misunderstanding involves the calculation of the trade deficit. At least one-third to one-half of the U.S. trade deficit figure counts U.S. imports from American overseas subsidiaries as part of the deficit. For example, when Ford Mexico sends a motor from its plant to the Ford assembly plant in Detroit, it is counted as an import. However, if Ford then sells an American-made car with a Mexican-made motor in the U.S., there is no corresponding export. Thus, a "deficit" supposedly is created. But why should a car sold in the U.S., even though it has a Mexican-made engine, be calculated as part of the trade deficit?  Most of the money made from this sale stays in the U.S.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Trade deficits are not harmful to the economy. If they were, America would not be the economic powerhouse it is today. The U.S. has run a trade deficit for most of its history. For the first hundred years, these deficits were fairly large; nevertheless, throughout this period, growth rates were higher than they are today. Trade deficits did not destroy the economy then. Nor will they destroy it in the future.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #5</b>: Trade deficits cost jobs. Protectionists claim that trade deficits are a major cause of unemployment.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. History shows that, on average, unemployment drops as trade deficits rise. For example, while the trade deficit leaped in 1983-1984 and peaked in 1987, the U.S. unemployment rate plummeted, from 9.6 percent in 1983 to 5.5 percent in 1988. When the trade deficit began to shrink from 1989 to 1991, on the other hand, unemployment rose from 5.3 percent to 6.7 percent, and when it began to rise again from 1992 to 1994, unemployment fell from 7.4 percent to 6.1 percent. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Looking further back in history confirms that trade deficits do not cause a loss of jobs. Every year the trade deficit increased since 1962, unemployment decreased. Likewise, every year the trade deficit decreased since 1962, unemployment increased shortly thereafter.<sup>13</sup>  Despite the trade deficit, the economy was growing and jobs were being created.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Why, then, are some major corporations laying off large numbers of workers?  The answer has nothing to do with trade deficits and everything to do with America's own economic ills. The U.S. economy today suffers from a host of government policies and regulations that are strangling corporate America. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Faced with a proliferation of environmental regulations, financial reporting requirements, and worker safety laws, American companies are finding it more and more expensive and difficult to comply with government directives. While many regulations may have laudable goals, their implementation is causing severe hardship for America's corporations. This, combined with added costs, causes far more job losses than trade deficits.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #6</b>: Prosperity is based on trade surpluses generated by managed trade policies. U.S. policymakers often use the managed trade policies of Japan as an example of how a country can eliminate trade deficits, increase living standards, and achieve greater economic stability.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. A closer look reveals that Japan's managed trade policies have had mixed results. The real purchasing power of Japanese consumers is at least 20 percent less than that of the American consumer. For example, using purchasing power parity, which takes into account differences in currency values, local prices, availability of goods and services, and inflation, America has a per capita income of $25,860. Japan, however, has a per capita income of only $21,350.<sup>14</sup>  This means that the Japanese have a lower standard of living than Americans.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Japan's lower standard of living can be attributed partly to a highly regulated economy that drives up the cost of living. For example, policies that restrict such imports as agricultural products, beef, and other food items force the average Japanese to spend about 25 percent of his disposable income on food, compared to less than 12 percent for Americans. Spending more on food means less money for housing and other needs. The result: a lower standard of living.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Managed trade is not responsible for Japan's prosperity. In fact, Japan's prosperity exists in spite of Japan's managed trade and industrial policies. In the end, the freer trade and market economic policies of the U.S. have produced a higher standard of living in America than in Japan.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #7</b>: American companies will go bankrupt unless the U.S. government limits competition from foreign imports and forces foreign countries to purchase more U.S. goods. Advocates of managed trade argue that closed overseas markets are the chief reason for America's trade deficit, causing enormous economic hardships that result in bankruptcies and lost jobs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. This scare tactic is employed by U.S. companies to frighten policymakers into taking up their cause in Washington. And what is their cause?  To limit import competition and force foreign countries to purchase a set amount of U.S. goods and services. These companies argue that they are hurt by closed markets overseas. As a result, they want Congress and the Administration to punish American consumers by forcing them to pay higher prices for imported products like automobiles.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But if American companies are so beset by closed markets overseas, why is America the world's largest exporter?  The U.S. exported over $783 billion in goods and services in the first 11 months of 1995.<sup>15</sup>  By contrast, Germany exported only $414 billion and Japan only $397 billion in all of 1994.<sup>16</sup>  Clearly, most U.S. exporters experience little if any difficulty finding overseas markets for their goods.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consider the U.S. auto industry. Is it on the verge of bankruptcy today?  It is not. It racked up $14 billion in profits last year. The main reason for Detroit's resurgence was not government coddling. Rather, it is because manufacturers are building better automobiles. This is the result of competition from Europe and Japan. Today, American cars are better built, have fewer flaws, and are bigger sellers than many of their Japanese and European counterparts. For all this, the Big Three auto makers have the free market to thank, not the meddling hand of the federal government.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #8</b>: Because the U.S. is unable to sell some goods and services in countries like Japan, these countries must have closed markets. Many protectionists argue that the U.S. has an open market while countries like Japan restrict American imports. Thus, they blame Japan for its trade surplus with the U.S.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. Japan is no more protectionist than the United States. This is the conclusion of The Heritage Foundation's <a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/econ_index/toc.html.cgi"><i>Index of Economic Freedom</i></a>, which measures the relative level of economic freedom in over 100 countries. The study concludes that, from a global perspective, Japan and the U.S. have relatively equal levels of protectionism.<sup>17</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The trade deficit with Japan is not nearly as bad as protectionists argue. For example, the commonly reported trade deficit figures measure only merchandise trade. While these figures represent the bulk of the trade between the U.S. and Japan, they also ignore the tremendous trade surplus the U.S. has in consulting, telecommunications, computers, and other services. Thus, the deficit is usually smaller than commonly reported. Moreover, much of the trade deficit with Japan comes from counting the products of Japan-based American companies exporting their goods back home. The profits from these sales go to the stockholders of American companies, not directly to the Japanese.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The truth is that Japan is America's largest overseas export market. Japan imported $69 billion in goods from America in 1995 -- that is more than the U.S. exported to Britain and Germany combined ($22 billion and $19 billion, respectively).<sup>18</sup>  Moreover, on a per capita basis, Japan buys more from the U.S. than America buys from Japan. For example, each Japanese citizen bought $444 worth of U.S. goods and services in 1994, while each American citizen purchased only $441 worth of Japanese goods and services.<sup>19</sup>  But because Japan's population is about 50 percent smaller than America's, a deficit exists. Americans purchase more Japanese goods overall because there are twice as many Americans as Japanese. Thus, a trade deficit exists for many reasons, not just because of -- or even primarily because of -- Japanese protectionism.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #9</b>: Trade surpluses are always the result of government policy. Protectionists argue that trade surpluses are created intentionally by government policy. Thus, they reason, trade deficits must be dealt with in the same manner -- by government action through tariffs and other forms of protectionism.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. Those who argue that trade surpluses and deficits are the result of government manipulation do not understand how a market economy works. They ignore, for example, that some countries with scarce natural resources are likely to run a trade surplus because they must import relatively inexpensive unfinished goods and export more expensive finished goods. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Japan is a case in point. It must import such raw materials as oil and lumber. These raw materials are used to manufacture more expensive finished products, some of which are exported. Throughout this process, the Japanese are adding value to the imported raw materials by making more expensive finished products for export. The result is a trade surplus. By contrast, the U.S. has abundant natural resources, which in many cases it exports. Thus, most of its imports are finished goods, which are more expensive and worth more than the raw materials that went into making them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #10</b>: Trade retaliation is the most effective way to open foreign markets. Protectionists believe the best way to open foreign markets is to threaten trade retaliation. The weapons of choice: special tariffs, duties, and import quotas.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. The U.S. has resorted to threats of trade retaliation to open foreign markets, but most of the time they have backfired. The principal U.S. law used to threaten trade retaliation is Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act, which grants the President the authority to impose punitive trade restrictions on imports. Of the nearly 80 Section 301 cases initiated by the U.S. since 1974, only about 15 were successful. Yet even in these cases, American consumers were saddled with billions of dollars in higher prices caused by higher tariffs and special duties. In the end, all Americans were the losers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MYTH #11</b>: International trade arrangements like the World Trade Organization and the North American Free Trade Area violate American sovereignty. Advocates of trade protectionism argue that the U.S. should pull out of these and related institutions and agreements because they all infringe on American sovereignty and represent a move toward world government.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>REALITY</b>: Not true. A world government would indeed be a grotesque and harmful development, but these agreements or organizations will not lead to such a result.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Nothing in any of America's trade agreements, including the NAFTA, can force America to follow any law not previously passed by the U.S. Congress and signed by the President. All of these agreements contain language stating that no decisions made under them can supersede domestic U.S. law. How can a foreign organization like the WTO infringe on U.S. sovereignty if it lacks the power to supersede or overrule U.S. law? 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Free trade is, in fact, the antithesis of world government. It depends on the free flow of ideas as well as goods and services. This promotion of freedom worldwide is inconsistent with the centralizing principle of world government.

<P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The driving force behind the protectionist threat of trade sanctions against Japan, China, and other countries is a misguided belief that trade deficits are harmful to the economy. Nothing could be further from the truth. Trade deficits are a sign of economic strength. They often represent a growing economy in which jobs and wealth are being created, not lost.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Another myth that inspires the protectionist is that trade deficits are mainly the result of closed markets overseas. This also is not true. There are many markets for U.S. goods and services overseas. In fact, the U.S. is the largest exporter in the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Trade protectionists misunderstand America's position in the international economy. By failing to understand America's massive export strength, they fail to comprehend the implications of America's trade deficit. And they have mistaken the reasons why Japan and other countries have a trade surplus. As a result of these misjudgments, protectionists advocate a trade policy that could threaten the wealth and prosperity of all Americans. Their myths are not merely academic, but profoundly important in a practical sense. Getting the facts straight in this debate is vitally important to the future prosperity of the American people.

&quot;We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed;<br>

Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed.&quot;

Dear Friend:

<p>

I write to you this month on a subject that weighs heavily on
my heart.  That subject is the persecution of believers around
the world, including here in the United States.  As I've learned
more about the nature and extent of this persecution, it has become
increasingly clear to me that as Christians, we must do more for
our suffering brothers and sisters both here and abroad.  From
China to Saudi Arabia to Sudan, one's profession of faith in Jesus
Christ is becoming an ever more dangerous act in the eyes of the
state.  It is time for men and women of faith to speak up!

<p>

Michael Horowitz is one man who has courageously raised his voice
on this issue.  Mike and I go back many years, to the days when
we both served in the Reagan administration.  My primary responsibilities
were education and the family.  Mike's were economic and regulatory
matters in the Office of Management and Budget.  We worked together
on several issues, and I observed the character of this man up
close.  For that reason, it didn't surprise me at all last summer
when Mike Horowitz, who is Jewish, wrote a heart-rending article
on anti-Christian persecution for <I>The Wall Street Journal.</I>

<p>

Mike was appalled by the harassment, physical abuse and
even death being routinely inflicted on Christians overseas.
But he was even more appalled by the continued refusal of our
government to focus on and do anything about this persecution.
And I have been deeply disappointed by the timidity and silence
that unfortunately have reigned among so many Christians in America,
who, myself included, needed to hear the eloquence of Mike Horowitz
to be shaken with the conviction that we must act.

<p>

This past January, I attended a meeting of evangelical leaders
in Washington, DC that Mike cosponsored with Freedom House.  Freedom
House is a widely respected human rights organization, founded
at the outbreak of World War II.  The information they shared
regarding systematic persecution of Christians was overwhelming:

<p><ul>

<li>Incidents of intimidation, arrest, and torture are growing
under various regimes around the world.  The worst offenders are 
Islamic fundamentalist governments and communist regimes. Millions 
of Christians worldwide are routinely subjected to this persecution, 
most of which goes unreported in the United States.

<p>

<li>In Sudan, 1.5 million people have died as a result of the Islamic
north's <i>jihad</i>, or &quot;holy war,&quot; against the largely 
Christian south.[1] The war has displaced another 5 million. Children 
of Christian parents are being conscripted for service in the
Islamic government army.  One mother, of boys eight and nine,
was imprisoned and savagely beaten when she went to retrieve them 
from a <i>mujahadeen</i> training camp.[2] She was pregnant at the 
time. Thousands of children of Christian parents, as young as six, 
have been taken and sold as slaves in Sudan, Libya and elsewhere.[3]

<p>

<li>Three of the most prominent evangelical leaders in Iran were
abducted and murdered in 1994.  The law there effectively prohibits
Christians from attending any kind of religious service, and those 
who dare to evangelize have been arrested, brutally tortured, and 
forced to renounce their faith.[4]

<p>

<li>Christians who flee Iran through Turkey are forced by the American
Embassy there to undergo interviews by Turkish security police who are
sympathetic toward Iran's laws against &quot;blasphemy.&quot;  Many of 
these refugees fail these interviews and face forcible return to Iran. 
American Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) field offices 
commonly treat refugees the same way.[5] In other words, the only things 
we are &quot;exporting&quot; to Iran are Christians!

<p>

<li>The government of Egypt, which has received billions of dollars
in U.S. assistance (our tax money!), has attempted to appease 
domestic Islamic fundamentalists by imprisoning and torturing Christian 
converts and evangelists.

<p>

<li>In China, persecution of the country's estimated 30 million
Christians is a matter of official public policy.  Catholics in the 
People's Republic are permitted to join only the official state church, 
whose bishops are appointed by Beijing and not by the pope. If they 
refuse to &quot;register,&quot; they are routinely imprisoned and
tortured or, in the classic communist style, &quot;re-educated
through labor&quot; -- the official euphemism for doing hard time in 
the labor camps.

</ul><p>

Recently, FRC's chief of government relations, Marty Dannenfelser,
testified before a House International Relations subcommittee
on this plague of persecution.  He made it clear that our government
has not done enough to highlight and to halt these disgraceful
abuses.  We reject the idea that these problems will go away through
quiet diplomacy, or that abuses will only increase if our government
openly criticizes the perpetrators.  History shows that speaking
out is the only way to deter tyrants.

<p>

Our own government must cease its tolerance of the mistreatment
of religious minorities around the world.  Saudi Arabia is a prime
example.  Recently the Saudis pressured the United States about
&quot;objectionable&quot; activities by American nationals stationed
there.  One complaint involved the operation of a U.S.-sponsored
nightclub frequented by American servicemen.  Our government dug
in its heels and refused to bow to Saudi requests to close it.
At the same time, the Saudis demanded that we stop holding Sunday
worship services at our embassy in Riyadh -- that is, on U.S. soil!
To this, the Clinton Administration buckled under.

<p>

I mentioned at the beginning of this letter that the United States
is also troubled by anti-Christian persecution.  The major difference,
of course, is that the examples I am about to cite are not sponsored
or tolerated by our government.  Nevertheless, their impact on
the religious liberties we hold so dear can be just as devastating.
In the past few years, the United States has experienced a wave
of violent attacks on Christian churches.  According to an investigative
report compiled by <I>USA Today</I>, some 25 black churches, primarily
in the South, have been the targets of arson.  The pace of these
attacks is clearly accelerating.

<p>

The wave seems to have begun on April 4, 1993, the 25th anniversary
of the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 
Twelve churches were burned last year, and so far this year at
least seven more have been torched.  In roughly two thirds of
these incidents, no arrests have been made.  This month, of course,
brings another anniversary of Dr. King's death, and many fear
that the attacks on churches will worsen.  Again, the only way
to prevent this tragedy from happening is for each of us to speak
out against these crimes and for the government to bring the 
perpetrators to justice.

<p>

In February, FRC joined with several evangelical, Jewish, Catholic
and civil rights groups in calling for congressional hearings
into these incidents.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation has
also begun to investigate them, but the added visibility of Congressional
hearings can serve a number of useful purposes.  After our call
for hearings, the Congressional Family Caucus, whose roster includes
several dozen freshman members of Congress, also issued a plea
for hearings.  As I'm writing this, FRC has received assurances
from House Judiciary Committee staff that in-depth hearings will
occur later this spring.

<p>

FRC is also calling upon the Clinton administration to speak
out forcefully on these events.  Attorney General Janet Reno shoulders
a special responsibility to ensure that potential arsonists know
that the full weight of federal law enforcement will be brought
to bear to end these attacks.  We have publicly urged her to show
the same zeal in pursuing the perpetrators of these incidents
as she has shown in pursuing her theories of conspiracy among
peaceful protestors outside abortion clinics!

<p>

It's too early to know for certain, but these attacks on churches
are most likely motivated by both religious <b>and</b> racial
bigotry.  Anti-Christian bigotry is the American &quot;exception&quot; 
-- the only acceptable form of intolerance in modern America.  Just 
consider how muffled the response was to the invasion of St. Patrick's
Cathedral in New York by members of the homosexual group Act-Up.
The Montrose Baptist Church, in suburban Washington, DC, has
also been the target of two suspicious fires in recent years.
It is probably no coincidence that the church was heavily involved
on the pro-life side of Maryland's recent abortion referendum.

<p>

Racial prejudice is obviously at work, too.  The damage it wreaks
on America's social fabric is astonishing.  It makes me wonder
if Americans will ever judge one another by the content of our
character, and not the color of our skin.  Can this hatred that
affronts the gospel of Christ continue to divide our house and
drag this nation down?  Our greatest hope is for spiritual revival
to again sweep our land and to bring about healing through reconciliation
within families and between races.  Then and only then will we
know our country is well on the road to recovery.

<p>

The seeds of ethnic hatred should find no fertile soil in this
land we love. That is why I included the following statement
in the Compact with Our Fellow Americans that appears in my new
book, <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I>:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

In our work and community life, we promise to elevate a public
ethic of individual merit, regardless of ethnic or national origin, 
or political or religious belief. We will not tolerate the expression, 
public or private, of bigotry on any such basis.  We will judge 
all persons we meet by the content of their character, not the color 
of their skin.

</i>

</blockquote><p>

As this statement suggests, the task of combating religious and
racial hatred is not, first of all, the task of government.  It
is every citizen's task, a battle within the heart that, won there,
cannot be lost in the public square.

<p>

In closing, let me ask that you take up your pen right away and
urge your representatives in Congress to act decisively on these
twin issues.  With a united America behind them, they will be
empowered to act boldly.  In the meantime, let us heed the words
of the apostle Paul and cast off all distress and despair.  Where
we have Christ, we have hope.

<p>

We at FRC feel greatly blessed to be in the heart of our nation's
capital, with the daily chance to address our political leaders
on these vital concerns.  Your friendship and financial support
are part of that blessing, and you have my deepest thanks for
remembering us.  If your circumstances permit, your gift to us
this month will mean so much to our campaign on behalf of family,
faith, and freedom.  Your continued involvement and support are
essential to our success.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S. It's always difficult to end a letter like this with a
little house-keeping, but the enclosures this month require some
explanation.  As you know, FRC communicates with you on a regular
basis. You most likely receive both my monthly letter and <I>Washington
Watch,</I> and perhaps other mailings as well. Our goal
is to ensure that every item we send you is useful to your family.
At the same time, we are keenly aware of our responsibility to
exercise stewardship over the resources you entrust to us.  If
you are receiving any mail from FRC that is not meeting your needs,
this is your chance to let us know.  We look forward to continuing
to send you the timeliest pro-family reports available today.

<p>

Please return the enclosed card at your earliest opportunity and note, 
that while we do hope you will respond, <b>no financial gift is 
necessary</b>. Your reply will aid us in serving you -- and many more 
families besides -- to the best of our ability. God bless you.

<title>The Challenge of Revolutionary Iran - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>
<h3>THE CHALLENGE OF REVOLUTIONARY IRAN</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/phillips.htm">James Phillips</a><br>
Senior Policy Analyst<sup>1</sup><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Committee Brief No. 24<br>
March 29, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The recent Middle Eastern travels of Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan have sparked considerable controversy. Several Congressmen have called for a government investigation of the trip, including Representative Peter King, who gave a persuasive speech on this subject at The Heritage Foundation on March 6.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Today, I would like to focus on the foreign activities of Iran, which I believe poses the greatest threat to America and to American interests of all the countries that Minister Farrakhan visited. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. and Iran have clashed repeatedly over a wide variety of issues since Iran's 1979 revolution, which brought to power radical Islamic fundamentalists led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Bilateral tensions initially flared due to the November 4, 1979, seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran by Iranian militants and the subsequent holding of American hostages for 444 days. Iran-U.S. tensions continue to simmer due to Iran's persistent efforts to export its revolution, Iranian support for international terrorism, Iran's ideological hostility to the U.S., and Iran's military buildup, which includes clandestine efforts to acquire nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons of mass destruction.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran today looms as the chief threat to American interests in the Middle East. The dissolution of the Soviet Union and the military defeat and diplomatic isolation of Iraq, Iran's traditional archrival, has given Iran the opportunity to expand its influence. Although Tehran has toned down its revolutionary rhetoric since the death of Ayatollah Khomeini in 1989, Iran remains a volatile revolutionary state. Tehran continues to denounce the U.S. as "the Global Arrogance," calls for the expulsion of American influence from the Middle East, seeks to discredit and overthrow moderate Arab governments friendly to the U.S., advocates the destruction of Israel, and adamantly opposes the U.S.-sponsored Arab-Israeli peace negotiations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran also has increased its financial, political, and military support for radical Islamic fundamentalist movements throughout the Middle East and Southwest Asia. It has developed close ties with Sudan, which it uses as a training ground for Islamic militants from throughout the region. In the short run, Iran poses more of an ideological, subversive, and terrorist threat than a military threat to America and its Middle Eastern allies. In the long run, however, Iran's military buildup, particularly its development programs for nuclear, chemical, biological, and missile weaponry, will pose an increasingly grave challenge to the security of American forces and U.S. allies in the region.
<p>
<b>IRAN'S HOSTILE FOREIGN POLICY</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Since the 1979 Iranian revolution, Tehran has seen itself as the leader of the Muslim world. It has sought to export its revolutionary brand of Islam and to radicalize Muslims everywhere. The U.S., which Khomeini referred to as the "Great Satan," is hated for its support of the Iranian regime of Shah Reza Pahlavi; for its support of Israel, which Iranian radicals seek to destroy; and for its support of moderate Arab regimes such as those in Egypt and Saudi Arabia. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But regardless of its policies, the U.S. is hated for its values and the powerful influence of its culture, which Iranian revolutionaries believe seduces Muslims and undermines Islam. This ideological motivation explains why Iranian-supported terrorists in Lebanon in the 1980s attacked targets affiliated with the American University of Beirut and Christian churches, in addition to the U.S. Marines serving in the multinational peacekeeping force.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Since 1979, Iran has been more of an ideological, subversive, and terrorist threat to its neighbors than a military threat. Tehran has enjoyed only limited success in fomenting revolution, in part because Iran's Shiite brand of Islam is shared by only about 15 percent of all Muslims. The Sunni (orthodox) Muslims who make up more than 80 percent of the Islamic world tend to be more respectful of state authority and distrustful of Shiite radicals. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran's greatest success has come in war-torn Lebanon, where it helped to create, finance, arm, and train the radical Shiite Hezbollah (Party of God) movement. Several hundred Iranian Revolutionary Guards, the militant shock troops of the Iranian revolution, work closely in support of Hezbollah in Lebanon's Bekaa valley. Tehran also supports less powerful Shiite fundamentalist groups in Iraq, Bahrain, and Afghanistan. But Shiite revolutionaries have seized power nowhere outside Iran. In fact, Shiite rebellions have been crushed in Iraq (1991) and Saudi Arabia (1979), and an Iranian-backed coup attempt was quashed in Bahrain in 1981.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iranian-supported Islamic revolutions, however, now have better prospects for success. The dissolution of the Soviet Union not only has opened up Central Asia to Iranian influence, but also has deprived secular Arab nationalist regimes in Algeria, Iraq, Libya, and Syria of a source of political, military, and economic support. The failure of Arab socialism in such countries as Algeria and Egypt has left them with feeble economies unable to absorb the huge number of youths who are entering the labor market. Faced with a bleak economic future, young Arabs are turning to radical fundamentalist movements to find hope and meaning in their lives. Some Arab fundamentalists, radicalized by the Islamic holy war (jihad) against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, have returned home to spearhead anti-government violence in their own countries. Iranian-supported Muslim fundamentalists are well-positioned to exploit the collapse of Soviet communism and Arab socialism.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran has established good working relations with several Sunni fundamentalist groups since 1990, including Hamas (the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement); Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine; the Islamic Group of Egypt; and similar groups in Algeria, Jordan, and Tunisia. The opening of Arab-Israeli peace talks at the Madrid Conference in October 1991 gave Iran and Palestinian fundamentalists a common interest in disrupting the U.S.-sponsored negotiations by escalating terrorist attacks against Israel. Iran invited a Hamas delegation to attend an October 1992 international conference held in Tehran to coordinate opposition to the peace process. Tehran subsequently agreed to help train Hamas terrorists, give Hamas $30 million over two years, and permit Hamas to open an "embassy" in Tehran. Israeli intelligence officials estimate that Iran now provides 10 to 20 percent of the roughly $70 million in donations that Hamas receives annually from its supporters around the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Tehran has welcomed the terrorist offensive which Hamas launched against Israel in the last month, killing 62 people in four suicide bombings. The state-run Iranian news service called the bombings "God's retribution."  Despite the worldwide revulsion triggered by the bombings, Iran remains one of Hamas' foremost foreign backers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran's efforts to reach out to Sunni fundamentalists have been facilitated by Iran's closest ally, Sudan, which is ruled by the only radical fundamentalist regime in the Arab world. Arab officials maintain that Sudan has helped Iran establish ties with Hamas, the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and Jordan, the Renaissance fundamentalist movement in Tunisia, and the Armed Islamic Group in Algeria.
<p>
<b>IRAN'S LINKS TO SUDAN</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran has become the chief supporter and ally of Sudan's National Islamic Front, a Sunni fundamentalist movement that came to power following Lt. General Omar Hassan Bashir's 1989 coup. Sudan, Africa's largest state, offers Iran a strategic foothold to outflank Saudi Arabia and extend its revolutionary influence throughout North Africa and the Horn of Africa. Iranian-Sudanese cooperation escalated following President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani's December 1991 visit to Sudan. Hundreds of Iranian military advisers and Revolutionary Guards were dispatched to Sudan to help train the Sudanese Army and internal security forces. Iranians also are believed to be assisting Sudan's radical regime in its long-running war against Christian and animist rebels in southern Sudan.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Although Iran claims that most of these personnel in Sudan are engaged in construction projects, persistent reports indicate that the Revolutionary Guards are training Islamic fundamentalist revolutionaries and terrorists, primarily from Algeria, Egypt, and Tunisia. U.S. officials maintain that Iranians train terrorists in five camps around Khartoum that are equipped and financed by Iran. The Egyptian government contends that several thousand Egyptian fundamentalists have received training from Iranians in Sudanese camps. Egyptian intelligence officials claim to have evidence that Iran was responsible for training and organizing terrorists who have attacked foreign tourists in Egypt. Algeria expelled Iranian diplomats in November 1992 and broke diplomatic relations with Iran in March 1993 after accusing Tehran of supporting Islamic radicals who have waged a bloody guerrilla war against Algeria's military regime that has resulted in the deaths of over 30,000 Algerians since 1991.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Sudan has become in effect a "new Lebanon" where Iranian revolutionaries arm, train, and equip Arab fundamentalists for political violence while denying responsibility for their actions. Significantly, Iran's former ambassador to Sudan, Majid Kamal, helped create Hezbollah when he was the Iranian charg‚ d'affaires in Beirut in the early 1980s. But unlike Lebanon, where Iran's freedom of action is constrained by Syria's military domination, the fundamentalist Sudanese government fully shares Iran's revolutionary goals.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Sudan also is a valuable ally for Iran because of its key role in helping Iran to expand its contacts with Sunni fundamentalists, especially Egyptian and Palestinian groups opposed to peace negotiations with Israel. Iranian-supported Egyptian fundamentalists easily can infiltrate the porous Sudanese-Egyptian border, seeking to overthrow the Egyptian government. The Islamic Group, which considers Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman to be its spiritual leader, has launched terrorist attacks that have killed hundreds of Egyptians since early 1992.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Egypt is one of Iran's most important targets for subversion because of its historic role as the preeminent Arab power. An Islamic revolution in Egypt would send shock waves throughout the Arab world and incite Islamic revolution elsewhere. Moreover, a radical fundamentalist Egypt would break its peace treaty with Israel and render moot the U.S.-backed Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, which Iran has denounced as "treason."  As the leading Muslim power unequivocally opposed to Israel's existence, Iran stands to gain much from prolonging the Arab-Israeli conflict.
<p>
<b>IRAN'S SUPPORT OF TERRORISM</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran is the world's "most active state sponsor of international terrorism and continues to be directly involved in planning and executing terrorist acts," according to the State Department's most recent report on terrorism, <I>Patterns of Global Terrorism, 1994</i>, which was published in April 1995. Iranian intelligence agencies support terrorism, either directly or through extremist groups, primarily aimed against Iranian opposition movements, Israel, or moderate Arab regimes. Tehran has established over 20 ideological and military training camps in Iran, Lebanon, and Sudan staffed by Arabic-speaking Revolutionary Guards.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Hezbollah, Iran's most important surrogate, has become the "world's principal international terrorist organization," according to former CIA Director James Woolsey, testifying before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on July 28, 1993. The Lebanon-based organization has established groups of supporters as far away as Australia, Canada, India, Indonesia, and South America. Hezbollah's long list of terrorist atrocities includes the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks at Beirut Airport, and the kidnapping of most of the 15 American hostages held in Lebanon between 1984 and 1991.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The last American hostages held in Lebanon were released by Hezbollah at Iran's direction in late 1991 after Tehran concluded that it could gain nothing from holding the hostages any longer. Iran's use of terrorism as an instrument of policy remains undiminished, however. In recent years, Tehran has stepped up its terrorist attacks against Iranian exile leaders and Israel. More than a dozen Iranian dissidents have been assassinated in European cities since 1987, including the August 1991 murder of former Iranian Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar in Paris and the September 1992 murders of four Kurdish opposition leaders in Berlin. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Iran's terrorist campaign against exiled opposition activists appears to be growing in intensity in recent months. On February 20, 1996, two Iranian exiles were assassinated in Turkey. On March 2, two Sunni Iranian clerics were assassinated in Pakistan. And on March 7, another Iranian opposition activist was assassinated in Baghdad, the sixth killed inside Iraq since May 1995.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Iran's assassins also have struck inside the United States. Iranian political activist Ali A. Tabatabai, the founder of the Iran Freedom Foundation, was murdered at his home in Bethesda, Maryland, on July 22, 1980.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Although Iranians recently have not been caught launching terrorist attacks on American targets, Iran furnishes substantial financial, logistical, and training support to terrorist groups that continue to target Americans. Tehran provided financial support, at a minimum, for some of the Islamic militants arrested for the February 1993 bombing that killed six people at the World Trade Center in New York. Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman, the radical Egyptian cleric who inspired and guided the bombers, long has been funded by Iran's intelligence service, according to Vincent Cannistraro, former head of CIA counterterrorism operations. Sheik Omar reportedly was regularly given large sums of money by Iran's delegation to the United Nations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Although no direct Iranian participation has been established in the World Trade Center bombing, senior U.S. officials warned in March 1993 that Iranian-backed terrorist groups appeared to be becoming more aggressive. Iran also reportedly has begun cooperating with non-fundamentalist terrorist groups such as the Abu Nidal Organization, a renegade Palestinian terrorist group that has launched some of the bloodiest and most indiscriminate terrorist attacks, such as the December 1985 massacres at the Rome and Vienna airports. Iran also financially supports the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC), a pro-Syrian group which it reportedly asked in 1988 to bomb a U.S. airliner in retaliation for the July 1988 accidental downing of an Iranian airliner by the <I>U.S.S. Vincennes</I>. The plot was disrupted by the arrest of a terrorist cell in Germany in October 1988. Libyan agents reportedly then bombed Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iranian-supported terrorists have been particularly active against targets in Turkey. The Turkish Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility in 1992 for the murder of an Israeli diplomat and the bombing of an Istanbul synagogue. It also is believed to be responsible for a series of murders of Turkish journalists. Iran also supports the Marxist Kurdish Workers' Party, which has waged a long-running terrorist war against the government in eastern Turkey. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

But in recent years it has been Israel that has been the prime foreign target of Iran's terror campaign. Iran was involved in the March 1992 bombing of the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires, which killed 29 people. In March 1994, three Iranian agents were arrested in Thailand after an abortive attempt to detonate a truck bomb at the Israeli Embassy in Bangkok. Iranian involvement is also suspected in the July 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires that killed 96 people. Iran continues to support Hezbollah's terrorist offensive against Israeli forces along the Lebanese-Israeli border, as well as the terrorist operations of Hamas inside Israel. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

 Under Iranian tutelage, Sudan has emerged as a leading sponsor of international terrorism. Sudan has given sanctuary to a wide spectrum of terrorist groups, including many Arab militants who participated in the fundamentalist jihad in Afghanistan. Sudan gave Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman sanctuary before he moved to New York. Two Sudanese diplomats were implicated in the aborted plot by eight of the Sheik's followers to bomb the United Nations headquarters in New York. Moreover, five of the eight suspected terrorists arrested for the plot in June 1993 were Sudanese. Sudan's escalating involvement in international terrorism led Washington in August 1993 to add Sudan to the State Department's list of states that sponsor terrorism, which also has included Iran since 1984. This prohibits the transfer of U.S. military equipment, militarily useful civilian technology, and foreign aid to the terrorist state, strips it of favorable trade privileges, and requires the U.S. to block loans by international financial institutions.
<p>
<b>IRAN'S MILITARY BUILDUP</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran currently poses only a limited conventional military threat to its neighbors. Since the 1979 revolution, its armed forces have been weakened by political purges, huge losses of up to 60 percent of their major weapons systems in the eight-year war with Iraq, and shortages of spare parts for U.S. and Western arms supplied before 1979. But President Rafsanjani has accorded a high priority to building Iran's military strength. Shortly after coming to power in July 1989, Rafsanjani traveled to Moscow to sign a $1.9 billion arms deal that included 48 modern MiG-29 <I>Fulcrum</I> fighters and 100 T-72 tanks. His government, in January 1990, allocated $2 billion per year for five years to buy advanced arms. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran's ambitious military plans have sparked considerable concern that Tehran seeks to establish regional hegemony by building its military capabilities far beyond its legitimate defense needs. Iran's long-term objective reportedly is to acquire a modern air force of roughly 300 advanced combat aircraft; a modern army with 5,000 to 6,000 tanks, 2,000 self-propelled artillery pieces, and thousands of armored personnel carriers; and a navy upgraded with three advanced Russian <I>Kilo</I>-class submarines and scores of fast patrol boats armed with missiles.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran also has purchased hundreds of ballistic missiles and the technology to produce them from North Korea and China. Tehran has acquired at least 300 SCUD-B surface-to-surface missiles with a range of approximately 185 miles, and an unknown number of improved SCUD-Cs, which have a range of approximately 370 miles. These missiles enable Iran to attack states across the Persian Gulf. Iran also reportedly has agreed to buy 150 North Korean Nodong 1 missiles with an estimated range of over 600 miles. These surface-to-surface missiles are capable of delivering conventional, chemical, or nuclear warheads on targets as far away as Israel.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran's missile buildup is especially worrisome given Tehran's determined efforts to build weapons of mass destruction. Iran has "the most active chemical warfare program" in the Third World, according to an anonymous U.S. government official quoted in the <I>Washington Post</I> on March 8, 1996. The CIA estimates that Iran has produced and stockpiled up to 2,000 tons of chemical warfare agents, which it used at least once during the Iran-Iraq war. Iran also has an active biological warfare program and is trying to buy biological agents from Europe that could be useful in developing such weapons, according to U.S. intelligence sources. Some U.S. experts believe that Iran already may have produced biological weapons in the form of toxins or anthrax.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But the West's chief worry is Iran's effort to develop nuclear weapons, which has been making steady progress under the cover of Iran's civilian nuclear power program. CIA Director John Deutch stated in November 1995 that Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in as little as four years if it received extensive foreign assistance. American intelligence analysts have reported that Iranian acquisition teams have shopped for weapons-related nuclear equipment and nuclear scientists in the former Soviet Union, concentrating on Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In conclusion, although Iran now poses primarily an ideological, subversive, and terrorist threat to American interests in the Middle East and the Muslim world, in the long run Iran will pose an increasingly grave military threat to the security of the U.S., American military forces in the Middle East, and American allies in the region.

<h3> What Are America's Vital Interests?</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin J. Feulner</a>, Ph.D.
<P>
Delivered February 6, 1996
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Tonight I would like to outline a conservative internationalist foreign policy anchored in the foundation of vital American interests. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I define those vital interests as developments that could concretely affect the security or economic future of America and our citizens. Before giving you my list of American vital interests, let me first touch upon the growing drift in U.S. foreign policy since the end of the Cold War. In other words, let's review current policy.
<p>

<table border=0 align=left>

</table><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Clinton's foreign policy has been formulated by a group of retreads from the Carter Administration who were uncomfortable, unconvinced, and therefore unsuccessful in waging the Cold War against the Soviet Union. They returned to office with Clinton and believed that they could successfully reorient American foreign policy to harness the American military for what they deemed to be virtuous crusades in far-flung regions of the world. But they neglected the fact that the American people supported distant interventions during the Cold War only on behalf of important American national interests, and specifically to oppose the spread of an expansionist, ideological, totalitarian system that was publicly committed to burying us.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
American foreign policy has drifted dangerously astray, especially since 1993. A large part of the problem is that the Clinton Administration appears to be incapable of distinguishing between America's vital interests and some liberal do-gooders' marginal interests. The Administration too often has resorted to questionable military interventions to promote its peculiar vision of American values in such countries as Bosnia, Haiti, and Somalia, where there were no vital American interests at stake.
<p>
<b>The New World Order </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Remember the New World Order that some American foreign policy gurus were hoping to achieve?  The rest of us ordinary folks soon learned that it was long on new and short on order. Some of us have called this the age of chaos.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I can almost point to the very moment when American foreign policy began losing its purpose. It was that defining day in Moscow -- the day when the line at McDonald's became longer than the line at Lenin's tomb. That really happened, and when it did the communism versus capitalism argument was over. The tenor of the discussion in Russia went from "We will bury you" to "Do you want fries with that?"  But with it, too, went America's organizing purpose abroad. Our prior purpose had been containment of the Soviet Union and eventually, for us conservatives, liberation of the captive nations.
<P>
<b>Isolationist Right and Interventionist Left</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the United States has been searching for an intellectual framework for its foreign policy. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A band of conservative isolationists on the fringe wants America to withdraw from the world altogether, while a suddenly macho band of liberal interventionists seeks to remake Haiti, Rwanda, Somalia, and the rest of the world in its own preening self-image.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The isolationist right thinks that we have few vital interests and so we shouldn't join alliances, which only entangle us. The interventionist left distrusts America's power and our vital interests and seeks to deny them by putting our troops and interests under the authority of the United Nations. Both approaches reflect a defeatist attitude of an America in decline -- a pessimistic attitude that America cannot hold its own in the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The fringe isolationist right hides behind protectionism, having no confidence that the U.S. can compete in the international world economy. The interventionist left hides behind multilateralism, having no confidence that the U.S. can compete in values and in the integrity of its interests. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The real problem, it seems to me, is that neither group has any conception of America's true vital interests in the real world today.
<p>
<b>Clinton's Foreign Policy</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration's foreign policy reminds me of the man who said he wanted to take assertiveness training but that his wife wouldn't let him. It variously and alternately seeks to promote human rights, alleviate human suffering, recreate history by undoing coups, build Western-style nations in places that have no Western values, stop nuclear proliferation with vague unverifiable agreements, and advance democracy and international law while raising the planet's environmental conscience.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When not engaged in these activities, the U.S. State Department, under mandates from earlier liberal Congresses issues reports on America's own human rights abuses and bemoans what it calls the historical and continuing oppression of African Americans, Native Americans, and Women Americans. Meanwhile, the U.S. foreign aid bill mandates that U.S. government agencies promote "harmony among diverse racial, religious, and ethnic groups" in foreign countries -- something we can't accomplish or even define at home. Elsewhere in our foreign aid program, it's mandated that we must "include the economic empowerment of women as a factor in the evaluation of projects and programs."  We're even supposed to stop discrimination by foreign governments against people with disabilities.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Currently, the ultimate foreign policy test is not the vital interests of the American people, but mushy compassion. I commend to you a scathing article in the current issue of the journal <I>Foreign Affairs</I> entitled "Foreign Policy as Social Work," which rakes the Clinton Administration over the coals for its feel-good foreign policy. Written by Michael Mandelbaum, a foreign policy scholar who is no conservative and initially supported the Clinton Administration, the article lambastes the Administration for a misconceived foreign policy that is aimed at relieving suffering in conflict-ridden regions of the world rather than promoting American national interests.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
President Clinton presided over three failed military interventions in his first year in office which then set the tone and much of the agenda for this Administration's foreign policy. 
These were:
<P><ul>
<li> The announced intention and subsequent failure to lift the arms embargo against Bosnia and bomb the Bosnian Serbs in May 1993;
<p>
<li> The deaths of 18 U.S. Army Rangers in a failed Special Forces operation in Somalia in early October 1993; and
<p>
<li> The dispatch of a U.S. Navy ship carrying military trainers and its subsequent recall due to anti-American demonstrations in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, in mid-October 1993.
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under Clinton, American foreign policy has been transformed into an international social welfare program. Clinton has expended billions of dollars and scores of American lives in these naive military interventions in Somalia, Bosnia, and Haiti -- three countries where the U.S. has no vital interests at stake.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In Somalia, the Clinton Administration inherited a humanitarian intervention designed to feed starving Somalians. But while President Bush sent American troops to Somalia to feed people, President Clinton clumsily escalated the mission into a doomed scenario called "nation-building."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In Bosnia, Clinton has zigged and zagged so many times, nobody is sure what U.S. policy actually is. But the same mission creep that led to disaster in Somalia is built into the ambiguous U.S. intervention in Bosnia.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In Haiti, Clinton has chosen to commit the U.S. to bring stability and democracy by working with an unstable leader, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, in a country that has never had a stable democracy. Slowly, it is dawning even on the President that the only way to sustain Aristide in office is to extend the stay of U.S. troops in Haiti. Our troops have become Aristide's palace guard. The intervention has already cost an estimated $1.9 billion. This is the equivalent of almost $300 for each of Haiti's 6.5 million people.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Administration is a hawk on Haiti, Somalia, and Bosnia -- in other words, causes that require only small-scale military actions, enjoy the cover of U.N. approval, and serve no clear-cut strategic interest of the United States. And yet it is a dove when it comes to standing up to North Korea, Iran, or some other hostile power that genuinely does threaten U.S. vital interests.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;That is not all.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration's feel-good foreign policy focuses on peripheral international issues, often to curry favor with special-interest domestic political constituencies. For example, the Administration actively has intervened in Haiti to court African-Americans.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
These politically motivated actions are not only an unnecessary waste. They also come at the expense of important American foreign policy interests and defense needs. Humanitarian interventions and nation-building experiments have diverted attention from key items on the American foreign policy agenda.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These key items include:
<p><ul>
<li> Bilateral relations with Russia, whose recent elections have underscored a growing anti-Western backlash;
<p>
<li> China, which is becoming increasingly aggressive and belligerent in East Asia;
<p>
<li> Iran, whose clandestine nuclear efforts and continued export of terrorism have led Congress to seize the initiative and force the Administration to impose trade sanctions;
<p>
<li> NATO, whose future now has become entangled with the future of Bosnia, a military quagmire of uncertain resolution;
<p>
<li> Missile defense, a critical element of national defense that the Administration has woefully neglected; and
<P>
<li> The promotion of free trade, which the Administration allowed to fall by the wayside when it failed to gain fast-track negotiating authority for expanding NAFTA to include Chile.
<p></ul>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Moreover, the expanding commitment of U.S. military forces to far-flung humanitarian and peacekeeping operations has stretched thin our military forces around the globe. These commitments have also undermined our ability to respond to dangerous threats to our vital interests elsewhere. A recent article in the <I>Washington Times</I> reported that Pentagon officials are concerned that the commitment of 30,000 American troops to Bosnia and the surrounding region will seriously undermine our ability to repel aggression in the Persian Gulf or on the Korean peninsula -- you see, in military and foreign policy, everything is connected to everything else. Thus, the diversion of U.S. combat troops to peacekeeping operations depletes our strategic reserves. It erodes military readiness by interfering with training to sharpen warfighting skills.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite the concerns of the Pentagon, the Administration is now considering an additional peacekeeping operation -- the deployment of U.S. troops to the Golan Heights if a peace treaty is signed by Israel and Syria. Such a deployment is dangerous. It will be either too small to defend itself if another Middle East war erupts or too big, further straining our ability to meet other military contingencies around the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In addition, it will be an inviting target for a group of terrorists -- or an official party to the treaty (I refer to Syria and not, of course, to Israel). I say inviting target because the U.S. troops would be an especially attractive "trip wire" to bring the U.S. into the conflict or to drive the U.S. home, out of our more appropriate role in the Middle East.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In summary, ladies and gentlemen, America now has a foreign policy as chaotic as the world itself. I do not believe such a policy can possibly offer the leadership that is needed to protect American interests. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
We have a policy of good intentions, as defined by a bunch of mushy-minded liberals. But in foreign policy, good intentions are not enough. We all know that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. As Mandelbaum noted in his article, "While Mother Teresa is an admirable person and social work a noble profession, conducting American foreign policy by her example is an expensive proposition."  And, I might add, an ineffective and inefficient one at that.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
So what is to be done?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
My friends, first of all, the left-liberals in America need to get over this notion that it's somehow embarrassing or even immoral to have vital global interests. The isolationists need to get over the idea that, with Soviet communism gone, we no longer have global interests. The fact is, the United States is a global power. Responsibility as a global power requires us to behave like a global power. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
We can protect neither our interests nor our values unless we remain a global power. As we approach the 21st century, we must apply the lessons we learned in the 20th century: It is too dangerous for us to hide and to put our heads in the sand.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I believe the world longs for America's leadership, the kind of leadership that led Ronald Reagan to stand there in Berlin in 1987 and demand, "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!"  Each day we find out more and more from Soviet archives how it was U.S. strength that freed the people of the U.S.S.R. and Eastern Europe. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I believe the world is a freer, safer, more stable place when the U.S. is actively pursuing its own vital national interests.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Leadership that we have because we are the world's only remaining superpower -- 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Militarily:</b> America's blue water Navy helps safeguard access to free trade and natural resources not just for the U.S., but for all nations. The guarantee of U.S. military support for the NATO alliance is critical to Europe remaining a free and prosperous community of nations. But that does not mean the U.S. should get involved in a local conflicts like the one in Bosnia. Resolving that thorny crisis is a European interest, not an American interest
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Economically:</b> Not only is the U.S. economy the world's largest, but Americans lead the world economy as both importers and exporters.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Educationally:</b> I don't need to tell you how many students from around the world come to America to study. When these students return home, they take with them experiences that bolster free ideas and free markets in their countries -- and that benefits us all.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Technologically:</b> America leads the world in inventions and innovations of all kinds, and the whole world benefits. Look at the personal computer, soon to be as common and affordable as the television set. This tool empowers people everywhere to tap into the enormous wealth of information on the Internet and to share ideas unimpeded by national boundaries.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Entrepreneurially:</b> America's corporations know better than anyone how important it is to remain flexible in a global economy. Hence they are constantly innovating, finding ways to do more, to do it better, and to do it with fewer resources. When the world's largest economy does these things, it is felt around the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Culturally:</b> You can travel anywhere in the world and see vivid signs of American culture like popular music and movie stars. Less vivid but more enduring, however, are the ideas of democracy and free markets that the United States has been sharing with the other nations of the world for over two centuries, helping to make the world safer and more prosperous for everyone.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I believe that when America's vital interests are served, so are the values of political and economic freedom worldwide, because to the extent that America is a strong leader protecting its values, those same democratic values are safer and more vital elsewhere in the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Here, briefly, are what I believe America's interests to be.
<p>
<b>VITAL INTEREST #1: Safeguard U.S. national security.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This means, above all, to protect America's territory, borders, and airspace.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Our borders are not threatened by the likes of Haitian boat people -- a situation created by our own economic embargo of that poor, desperate country. No, the biggest threat to the United States remains long-range missiles armed with nuclear weapons. Our response to this threat should include an anti-missile defense and a broad nonproliferation policy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration vetoed Congress's defense bill recently, largely because it contained an aggressive program for building missile defenses for America by the year 2003. Yet Secretary of Defense William Perry just last month finalized plans for building a missile defense system for Israel in five years, using existing technology. To quote Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, "it will be a great contribution to the security" of the Middle East. But I believe it is inconsistent -- no, it is mad for the United States to help allies to defend themselves against missile attacks while denying our own citizens that same capability.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A broad nonproliferation policy also should be a vital component of American foreign policy. If diplomacy fails to discourage hostile powers from acquiring nuclear weapons, our vital interest could warrant the use of force -- unilaterally if necessary -- to stop renegade nations from becoming nuclear powers. I believe the civilized world would sigh with relief if we decided to eliminate those facilities.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This also means maintenance of the necessary conventional forces to protect our homeland.
<p>
<b>VITAL INTEREST #2: Prevent a major power threat to Europe, East Asia, or the Persian Gulf.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Here threats include expansionist activities by Russia against her neighbors, an expansionist Iraq or Iran, or a nuclear-armed North Korea. And we should not focus simply on immediate threats. Today radical nationalism, Islamic fundamentalism, and -- although not as threatening as its original version -- neocommunism exist in places where the U.S. has vital interests.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Regarding Europe, it is a false economy to withdraw any more of our 100,000 troops just because Russia is not an immediate danger. To those who say, "Well, we'll just come back if or when Russia is a threat again," I say, "You mean like we did in 1944 on the beaches of Normandy?"  And to those who ask, "Why should America pay anything to defend Europe or East Asia?"  I say, "We're not paying for Europe's defense or Japan's defense. We're paying for <I>our</I> defense."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Far better to keep 100,000 troops in Europe to maintain the peace than to send a million later to fight a war started in our absence. Far better to enter into strategic alliances -- like NATO and our mutual defense treaties with Japan and South Korea -- than to try to go it alone.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A word about China: The rulers in Beijing must learn that it is in the national interest of the U.S. to stay a permanent Pacific power. This means that we will not tolerate any forcible activity from mainland China against Taiwan. Taiwan is much more than our 7th-largest trading partner. She has also become the model for a vigorous, democratic, free-market society in Asia. We will not tolerate an invasion, blockade, or aggressive activity by mainland China against Taiwan.
<p>
<b>VITAL INTEREST #3: Maintain access to foreign trade.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The greatest danger here comes not from outside U.S. borders but from inside, from those who fear America cannot compete. The protectionists who opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement and GATT are pessimists about America's future. They favor the low-paying textile jobs of the past over the higher paying technology jobs of tomorrow. They are blind to the regenerative power of the free market, which they believe in devoutly for the domestic economy but not for the world economy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
GATT was central to the Reagan and Bush agendas because those administrations recognized that the U.S. is the world's largest exporter, not just the world's largest economy. Yet some Republicans seem to forget this, and some of them even have edged toward playing politics with free trade. I hope those Republicans return to the party's long tradition of seeking open markets for the benefit of both U.S. consumers and U.S. exporters.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Heritage Foundation supported the Clinton Administration on the North American Free Trade Agreement, and we supported it on GATT. We will continue to support further efforts toward expanded free trade, such as expanding NAFTA to include Chile as the next step.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I have confidence that our great nation, with our great people, can compete economically with any country. I am distressed by those who don't have this confidence in America, that we can compete and win.
<P>
<b>VITAL INTEREST #4: Protect Americans against threats to their lives and well-being.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. has an obligation whenever possible to protect American citizens from terrorist activity and other international criminal activity. Yet, if a recent incident is any indication, I don't think the U.S. State Department quite understands this elementary concept.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Terry Anderson, who was held hostage for seven years by Lebanese terrorists, wrote a book on his captivity entitled <I>Den of Lions</I>. While he was writing it, the U.S. State Department refused to turn over any documents it had on his captors for two years because -- get this -- it felt compelled to protect their privacy!  The State Department said it could not give Anderson the documents unless he received written permission from the terrorists for the information's release.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Is it any wonder the State Department seems to have a problem sorting out America's vital interests?  As the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Jesse Helms of North Carolina, wrote to Secretary of State Christopher on the day after our seismic November 1994 elections, "It's about time there was an American Desk at the Department of State."
<p>
<b>VITAL INTEREST #5: Maintain access to resources.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The American economy depends on foreign oil, which now accounts for more than 50 percent of America's oil consumption and is expected to provide an increasing share of future oil consumption. A threat to our oil supply is a threat to our national interest. Tour the oil fields of Kuwait, as I did three months ago, and you will see first-hand why we must maintain our access to vital natural resources.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Reduced to their basics, then these are America's five vital interests.
<P>

<b>Assertive Multilateralism: A Liberal Oxymoron</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Liberals, of course, often believe that where the U.S. has real interests is exactly where we should tread the lightest because these interests are somehow unseemly. As a result, America's foreign policy recently has pursued what is called "assertive multilateralism" -- a contradiction in terms if I've ever heard one.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Let me add that using force multinationally is no more moral than wielding it unilaterally. The U.N. is filled with governments and dictatorships that do not represent the wills of their people. Why is the U.N. more moral than the U.S. Congress?  Yet President Clinton sought and received U.N. approval for invading Haiti but skipped the U.S. Congress. I believe multilateralism is the abandonment of America's leadership role in the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Now, beyond these vital interests I've just mentioned, America has a number of other important interests, as well as many marginal ones, constantly tugging at us. The U.S. has an important interest in promoting democracy and free markets abroad, especially in regions where old totalitarian or authoritarian empires have collapsed. The more democratic the world becomes, the more peaceful it becomes, and therefore the more congenial for U.S. values and interests. Public diplomacy -- that is, reaching out above governments to tell America's story to the world -- is an important tool for promoting American interests and values.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The problem, however, is that the marginal interests -- not the vital ones -- have been driving our foreign policy. This has undermined U.S. credibility abroad and casts doubt on the steadfastness of American foreign policy in many places. This situation will not endure. I'm reminded of what Winston Churchill said during World War II: "You can always count on the Americans to do the right thing, but only after they exhaust all other opportunities."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
So, in closing, I believe the United States eventually will do the right thing and recognize our own vital interests. We need not deny these interests. The world need not fear them. They are a stabilizing force for peace and prosperity. That we believe in democracy, freedom, and the power of open markets is something of which we should be proud, not ashamed. We should reassert this in a positive and forthright way. Maintaining the strength and the coherent international principles to protect those values is not a luxury. Rather, it is an obligation of the federal government written into our Constitution. It is the most basic obligation of all: "to provide for the common defense... and secure the blessings of liberty."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The poet Carl Sandburg wrote of American destiny that "Always there arose enough reserves of strength, balances of sanity, portions of wisdom to carry the nation through to a fresh start with ever renewing vitality."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I believe America's vitality and leadership abroad will return, but I think it will take a change of administration to accomplish this. It is a challenge and an opportunity that we, as a great nation, cannot afford to let pass.

<title> Tax Limitation Amendment</title>
</head>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">

<h2><i>Tax Limitation</i></h2> <br>		             
</center>

Although April 15th is always an important day in the Unites States, this year, this day will earmark a hopeful turn of events.  The Tax Limitation Amendment, one of the first reform acts of the 104th Congress, will go to the House floor on April 15th.  Sponsored by over 166 Representatives, this amendment would require Congress to have a two-thirds majority vote in each house to approve tax-rate increases. <p> 

Senator Kyl (R-AZ) is the driving force behind the amendment for the Senate.  Senator Kyl has proposed that if this bill passes it would need ratification by 38 states in order to become the 28th amendment to the U.S. Constitution. <p>

One of the key factors to passing this bill would not only make it harder for Congress to raise taxes, but would force lawmakers to prioritize government spending.  The bill was written to encourage the elimination of lower priority programs to pay for new proposals as opposed to seeking finances through raised taxes. <p>

Recent surveys and studies have shown that the majority of American voters support the Tax Limitation Amendment.  The bill has also received tremendous backing from many high profile organizations, such as the American Conservative Union, the Christian Coalition, Citizens Against Government Waste, Family Research Council, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. <p>

Below is a layout of the proposed bill and some of the key reasons why it would stabilize tax laws: <p>

 <p> <br> <br> <br> 
					
					<center>April 15 Floor Vote </center> <p>

Section 1.<p>
	Any bill to increase taxes by increasing the rate or base of any tax may pass only by a two-thirds majority of the whole number of each House of Congress. <p>

Section 2.<p>
	Waiver during periods of declared war or imminent and serious threat to national security declared by a joint resolution.  Any provision which passed subject to the waiver shall last no more than 2 years. <p>

Section 3.<p>
	All votes will be roll call votes. <p>

<li>The Kemp Commission on Tax Reform endorsed a 2/3rds super-majority requirement for tax increases. It is an essential part of any tax reform.<p>

<li> One-third of all Americans live in a state with tax limitation in their constitutions: Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and South Dakota.  Other states are pursuing similar measures. <p>

<li> In the last decade, taxes in non-super-majority states went up 104%.  In super-majority requirement states, tax revenues went up only 87%. <p>

<li> In the last decade, spending in non-super-majority states went up 102%.  In states with the super-majority protection, spending increased only 95%. <p>

<li> It must be more difficult for future Congresses to raise taxes. Because federal benefits tend to be targeted at specific groups, special interest groups consistently come together to effectively lobby for more spending.  Taxes, on the other hand are spread among many millions of people who would find it difficult to band together as an interest group. The built-in pressure in a democracy is toward more spending.  The super-majority provision successfully balances the pressure. <p>

<li> Four of the last five major tax increases were passed with less than a two-thirds super-majority.  Those taxes added an additional $666 billion to the tax bill for the American taxpayer. <p>

<li> On Day One of the 104th Congress, the House voted 279-152 for a super-majority requirement to raise income taxes -- 11 votes shy of two-thirds.  This important protection, though, only applies during the 104th Congress, and only to the House. <p>

<h2>Hearings on the<br> Federal Communications Commission</h2>
<b>Before the House of Representatives Subcommittee on<br>
Telecommunications and Finance of the Commerce Committee<br></b><P>
Testimony of <a href="/pff/people/afellow.html#Pitsch">Peter K. Pitsch</a>
<P><br>

<B>Summary of Testimony</B>
<P>
 Important as the Telecommunications Act of 1996 is, important systemic
telecommunications reforms are still needed.  Although some federal and state
regulation remains appropriate, experience has now shown that industries
governed by market forces generally work better than government-run or
regulated ones:<p>
<ul>
<li>    Markets produce objective information on how consumers and producers value
resources and strong incentives to act on this information.  The FCC's delay
of cellular is estimated to have cost America over $80 billion.<p>
<li>    Competitors often use the regulatory process  to delay innovation and
competition by several years or even decades.  Consider customer premises
equipment, long distance yesterday and today, cable, video dial tone, VHF
drop-ins, low power TV, and DBS.<p>
<li>    The pace of technical change, especially regarding digital technologies,
has increased the cost of regulation.  Digital technologies make most
regulatory distinctions between voice and data and video just plain silly.
In accordance with these principles, much of the FCC's current responsibility
should be devolved to the states, transferred to the Department of Justice
and most important of all committed to the marketplace, in the end the true
agency of consumer protection.<p>  
</ul>
First, most federal price and profit regulation of telecom markets should be
eliminated, either because the relevant markets are effectively competitive,
regulation is better left to the states, or such federal regulation is
counterproductive.  Possible forbearance targets recommended by some members
of  the Progress & Freedom Foundation Working Group are attached to my
testimony.  They include tariffing, service bundling, and self-certification
reforms.<p>
Second, the electromagnetic spectrum should be largely privatized. Existing
spectrum licensees should be given freedom to use their spectrum as they see
fit as long as they do not interfere with other licensees--their cochannel
and adjacent channel neighbors.  Unallocated private and underutilized
federal spectrum should be made available in flexible assignments through
auctions.  A detailed proposal for reforming the electromagnetic spectrum
developed by members of the PFF Working Group is attached to my testimony.
Third, much of the FCC's general public interest authority is better
exercised elsewhere.  Attempts to address the broader public interest by
assuring there is adequate children's programming, by regulating mergers, or
by conducting international negotiations should be handled by Congress or
state legislatures in explicit actions or by other agencies such as the
Department of Justice or State.<p>
The case for dramatic reform is now more compelling than ever before.
 Growing global competition, merging markets, and the revolution in digital
and related technologies make the unintended and untoward effects of
government regulation far more costly than in the past.  A regulatory
framework that slows innovation in this area, despite any plausible shortrun
efficiency gains it might achieve, will foreclose a tremendous opportunity
for the American people.

<P>
<B>Testimony</B>
<P>
Introduction<br>
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  It is an honor to be here to testify before this
Committee about the restructuring of the Federal Communications Committee.
 As you know I worked at the FCC for eight years in the 1980s, first as Chief
of the Office of Plans and Policy then as Chief of Staff to Chairman Dennis
Patrick.  Since then I have been in private practice, an adjunct professor at
Georgetown University Law Center, and an adjunct fellow at The Hudson
Institute and The Progress & Freedom Foundation.  I am a member of the PFF
Working Group that last May proposed eliminating most of the FCC's current
functions over the next three years.  Today I am representing PFF and myself
and no one else.<p>
This Congress and this Committee are to be congratulated for passage of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996 which creates a new legal and policy playing
field based on the presumption that competition, open entry and market forces
should regulate the telecom industry.  Important as that legislation is, and
it is the most important telecommunications legislation of the last 60 years,
important telecommunications reforms are still needed.  Some might benefit
from legislation.  Others only require diligent oversight by this Committee.
I want to address four broad points.  First,  I want to lay out the case for
 reform.  Second, I will list the structural reforms that should be
implemented over time.  Third, I will discuss reforms that the FCC should
undertake today.  Finally, I want to stress the importance of these reforms
to the American people.<p>
Before I begin I want to be clear about what I am saying and not saying: <br>
<ul>
<li>	I am not here to proclaim the end of communications history.  I am not
saying that all communications regulation by all agencies, federal and state,
is inappropriate.  <p>

<li>	Nor am I saying that my policy prescriptions could be implemented
overnight.  Indeed, even with a free hand, it might take two or three years
to transition to a new system.  As an aside,  additional resources should be
given to the FCC to meet the legislation's mandates, but only if this
Committee is satisfied that the FCC is doing everything it should to pare
back through forbearance and privatization. <p>

<li>	My message is not partisan.  My criticisms of the FCC are systemic.  They
cross administrations.  They span the decades.  Time and again and to this
day well intentioned regulation has hurt consumers, often the poor and those
least well represented in the Washington regulatory game.<p>

<li>	Lastly, because in my eight years at the FCC I got to know many FCC
employees first hand, it is important to me to make explicit that my comments
are not intended to be a criticism of  FCC employees, who perform their jobs
in an exemplary fashion.  The cost of the FCC is not salaries.  The
overriding costs of the FCC are the foregone benefits of competition and
innovation.<p>

Why Dramatic Reform Is Needed<br>
Why replace the FCC?  What's wrong with regulation?   Experience has now
shown us that industries governed by market forces generally work better than
government-run or regulated ones--competition regulates prices and profits
better than the administrative process.  Markets produce objective
information on how consumers and producers value resources and strong
incentives to both to act on this information.  <p>
Regulation, in contrast, comes up short on both counts.  Regulators lack the
necessary information and the proper incentive needed to make prudent
decisions that will most benefit consumers.<p>
Consider spectrum allocation decisions, e.g., the cellular mobile radio and
VHF television allocations were billion dollar debacles.  The FCC's delay of
cellular is estimated to have cost America over $80 billion.  Consider too
the government's current  use of the 6 to 10 GHz of spectrum below 30 GHz
spectrum.  Most experts outside government believe that that spectrum is
underutilized.  <p>
A second failing of the regulatory process is that it is often used by
competitors to delay innovation and competition by several years or even
decades.  Few companies and no trade association can resist the temptation to
use the regulatory process to stymie a competitor or delay a new entrant.
 Most of those efforts have injured consumers.  When it comes to
communications pleadings H.L. Mencken's quip is surely right, &quot;It may be a
sin to think evil of others, but it is seldom a mistake.&quot;  Again let's look
at the record.  It's replete with examples of where regulation impeded
competition and new service such as customer premises equipment, long
distance yesterday and today, cable, video dial tone, VHF drop-ins, low power
TV, and DBS.  <p>
The pace of technical change, especially regarding the digital technologies,
has increased the cost of regulation.  In the old days it was ridiculous for
the FCC to allocate land mobile frequencies on a nationwide basis to narrow
industries, such as taxis and forestry management.  The inevitable
consequence was an overallocation of frequencies to taxis in Boise and an
underallocation in New York City and vice versa for forestry management
frequencies.  Digital technologies make most distinctions between voice and
data and video just as silly and far more expensive.<p>
What Structural Reforms Are Needed<br>
What's the answer?  As this Committee and Congress have recognized in the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, it is to rely more on market forces.  Where
regulation is necessary to check market power, it should seek to preserve the
information-producing  and feedback mechanism of the marketplace.  Subsidies
should be explicit and competitively neutral to minimize their distortive
effect.  Deferring to state regulators and employing case-by-case mechanisms
such as the common law rather than imposing nationwide structural rules will
maximize the opportunity for experimentation.<p>
In accordance with these principles, the current FCC should be replaced with
a much smaller federal agency.  Much of the FCC's current responsibility
should be devolved to the states, transferred to the Department of Justice
and most important of all committed to the marketplace, in the end the true
agency of consumer protection.<p>
FCC regulation can be divided into three parts.  First, there is utility
regulation, that is, the regulation of natural monopoly and universal
service.  Most federal price and profit regulation of telecom markets should
be eliminated, either because the relevant markets are effectively
competitive, regulation is better left to the states, or such federal
regulation is counterproductive.  States should be given principal
responsibility for defining universal service and any federal universal
service subsidies should be made explicit and means-tested.  Regulation of
local exchange facilities should be devolved to the states, subject to
federal guidelines necessary to the development of local competition  and the
assurance that interstate users of local exchange facilities have non
discriminatory access.  I discuss possible forbearance targets below.  
Second, the management of the electromagnetic spectrum should be largely
privatized.  Electromagnetic spectrum allocation decisions should be made
principally by private parties in the marketplace.  Existing spectrum
licensees should be given freedom to use their spectrum as they see fit as
long as they do not interfere with other licensees--their cochannel and
adjacent channel neighbors.  Unallocated private and underutilized federal
spectrum should be made available in flexible assignments.  The assignment of
spectrum should be made through the use of auctions where there are competing
applicants.  I have attached  a detailed proposal for reforming the
electromagnetic spectrum developed by members of the PFF Working Group.  
Third, much of the FCC's general public interest authority is better
exercised elsewhere.  Attempts to address the broader public interest by
assuring there is adequate children's programming, by regulating mergers,  or
by conducting international negotiations should be handled by  Congress or
state legislatures in explicit actions or other agencies such as the
Department of Justice or State.  Regulation of mergers should be done through
antitrust enforcement, not structural rules.  Any federal regulation of
programming content should be by explicit subsidy through legislation or
enforcement in federal court.<p>

Forbearance Actions That Can Be Taken Immediately<br>
The Commission should immediately undertake several deregulatory initiatives
that would benefit consumers, promote competition, and reduce its budgetary
needs.  Some of these initiatives are made possible, indeed required, by the
Telecommunications Act of 1996.   Section 401 of the new law adds a new
provision to the 1934 Communications Act, as amended (new 47 U.S.C. section
160) which requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to forbear
from regulating telecommunications carriers or services, under certain
circumstances.  Other initiatives, especially those that do not pertain to
telecommunications services, can be done under previous Commission authority
and discretion.  For example, the Commission can use self certification and
updated licensing procedures to speed up license transfers and reduce its
resource needs.  Other functions, especially handling public inquiries, could
be streamlined and possibly privatized. <p>
As the Commission seeks to promote competition, it should not delay the
forbearance process.  These and other initiatives should be taken to begin
the FCC's smooth transition to a competitive environment.  Congress should
give the FCC  flexibility to adjust its processes and move its personnel to
expedite this process.  An initial list of forbearance and privatization
proposals prepared by members of the PFF Working Group is attached.  Some of
those recommendations are:<br>
Private Carriage Contracts.  Private carriage promotes competition, the
satisfaction of customers' demand for tailored offerings, and the avoidance
of unnecessary regulatory costs.  There is no good reason to require AT&T,
MCI, Sprint, or other long distance firms to file single-customer offerings.
 Typically, these single-customer offerings appeal to the largest
communications customers, firms which spend millions (and, in several
instances, hundreds of millions) of dollars annually, and which have large,
sophisticated in-house communications staff.  Extensive FCC tariffing
requirements thus serve little of the customer protection role traditionally
associated with tariffing.  Instead, those requirements have become at best
an unneeded  expense and, at worst, a means of price signaling and
coordination.<p>

Computer Inquiry Rules.  The new forbearance law should be applied to
Computer Inquiry rules that prohibit carriers from bundling various services
and equipment and impose other unnecessary requirements.  For example, all
long distance and regional Bell operating companies are prohibited from
bundling basic services with either customer premises equipment or enhanced
services.  Also, AT&T and the Bell companies must:<br>
<ol>
<li> get prior FCC approval of enhanced affiliates' interconnection plans.<p>
<li> disclose changes in basic network interfaces.<p>
 <li> file non-discrimination reports allocate joint and common costs incurred in the provision of basic and
enhanced services.<p>
<li>  In all these cases, where the FCC determines the basic
service involved is effectively competitive, the regulation is no longer
necessary or productive.<p>   
</ul>
Dominant Carrier Reforms.  Steps should be taken to simplify FCC price and
profit regulation of telecommunications companies still deemed to command
&quot;market power.&quot;  The FCC needs to move toward a regime of price, not profit
regulation, by adopting a &quot;pure&quot; incentives-based (&quot;price caps&quot;) regulatory
system, along the lines followed by Britain's progressive Office of Telecommunications. 
 The FCC's current approach &quot;caps&quot; permissible prices for
&quot;interexchange access&quot; based on a complicated formula keyed to the prevailing
rate of inflation and forecasted productivity attainments.  But it also
requires local exchange carriers to &quot;share&quot; profits above a pre-determined
level with customers.  By focusing on the appropriate productivity factor and
eliminating the &quot;sharing formula,&quot;  the FCC could discard all the
paraphernalia associated with traditional rate-base or rate-of-return
regulation, such as depreciation regulation and cost allocation rules.
<p>
Sea Change in Approach.  In every telecommunications proceeding underway, the
FCC should ask if the relevant market is competitive.  If so, it should
refrain from regulating or consider how it can adapt regulation to promote
rather than hinder competition.  An illustration of the need for a dramatic
change in outlook is the FCC's proposal to impose mandatory resale on paging
operators.  That  market has numerous competitors and no serious observer
contends that it is not effectively competitive. <p>
This approach should also be taken as to the rulemakings required by the new
law.  Two examples include the rulemakings the FCC must undertake to promote
geographic averaged rates and universal service.  Imposing geographically
averaged rates is inconsistent with competition.   Long distance competition
could be distorted by companies limiting their activities to low cost
regions.  In that case national carriers might find it difficult to compete
in those areas.  Under the forbearance section, the FCC should find that
competitive concerns require any geographic averaging of rates to be limited
and transitional. Similarly, universal service subsidies must be reduced and
targeted to those who need them.  Market-based mechanisms can be fashioned to
phase  out unnecessary subsidies that could distort and impede the
development of competition.<p>

License Transfers and other changes.  The Commission reviews the assignment
and transfer of all broadcast stations.  Instead, it could adopt a
self-certification approach that would put the onus on the buyer who would
certify that all the relevant statutes and FCC regulations have been met.
 The FCC should where necessary clarify its regulations to ease the
certification process and use audits as the basis for determining compliance.
 Alternatively, the FCC could select a self regulating organization (SRO)
which could review all license transfers and assignments.  Self certification
of transfers and assignments would likely be supported by the industry as
evidenced by its endorsement by Broadcasting and Cable magazine.  
<p>
Why Reform Is Important<br>
We are all familiar with the rapid change in the computer industry.  In the
space of five years, IBM lost roughly $70 billion dollars of market
capitalization.  In the same period, many small hardware and software
companies grew exponentially, more than offsetting those mainframe losses.
 Who can seriously question the likelihood that if Apple, Intel, Compaq and
Microsoft had required FCC approval to get to the market, the personal
computer revolution would have been postponed.<p>
The case for dramatic reform is now more compelling than ever before.
 Growing global competition, merging markets and the revolution in digital
and related technologies make the unintended and untoward effects of
government regulation far more costly than in the past.  Heightened
competition has often undercut the rationale for regulation.  Moreover, the
increasing pace of change makes the costs of regulatory delay increasingly
unacceptable.<p>
Fundamental reform of the FCC would unleash innovative and entrepreneurial
forces and would build on the U.S.'s current but perishable lead in the
global digital derby.  Reform of the electromagnetic spectrum, alone, could
promote the development of competition in local telecommunications markets
and create a raft of new wireless digital services and devices.  America is
positioned to leave other countries in a cloud of silicon dust.  A regulatory
framework that slows innovation in this area, despite any plausible shortrun
efficiency gains it might achieve, will foreclose a tremendous opportunity
for the American people.<p>

<p>
"The United States is unambiguously still today, thank goodness, the leader in medical technology but that intelligence, that human capital is literally getting on an airplane and flying to Europe and setting up shop and setting up households in Europe.<p><p>

"We simply think the process should be decentralized, that much of the work should be moved out of the hands of government bureaucracies into efficient private sector agencies.  But the same level of safety and efficiency ought to be demanded – both by the private sector companies that are doing the certification and also the FDA and in its final approval.<p><p>

Dr. Eisenach was also quoted in the Wall Street Journal on this subject:  "The FDA, instead of being a 'certifier of products' would become a 'certifier of certifiers,' ensuring that the private entities uphold the agency's standards, he said."

<I><FONT SIZE ="+2">W</FONT>elcome</I> to the American Conservative Union's "Legislative Update" page.  On this page you will
find regular updates on the key legislation we are tracking, as the legislation moves from
introduction to subcommittee and committee hearings, subcommittee and committee markups,
and floor action in both the House and Senate.  On any given day, this is where you can get the
latest information available on the key issues conservatives care about.
<P>
As the nation's oldest conservative grass-roots lobbying organization, founded more than three
decades ago, the ACU sees its proper role as being the grass-roots lobby for the entire
Conservative Movement.  As such, we are not a single-issue organization.  Our officers, staff, and
-- most importantly -- our members are motivated toward public policy activism by the shared
beliefs explained in the ACU Statement of Principles.
<P>
Because the ACU is a multi-issue, umbrella organization, we monitor and lobby on a wide range
of issues before the Congress.  For ease in tracking those various pieces of legislation, we have
broken them down into four general categories:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Economic and Budget issues (examples:  the Balanced Budget Amendment; the Tax
     Limitation Amendment; the Budget Resolution; tax legislation; health care reform
     legislation; legislation to raise the debt ceiling; the Mexico bailout; etc.)
<LI>Social and Cultural issues (examples:  the Crime Bill; welfare reform; a school prayer
     amendment; abortion legislation; homosexual rights legislation; educational choice; etc.)
<li>Foreign Policy and Defense issues (examples:  ballistic missile defenses; the United
Nations; Bosnia; Haiti; the foreign aid bill; the War Powers Act; etc.)
<LI>Institutional Reform issues (examples:  term limits; campaign finance reform; budget
     process reform; repeal of the 16th Amendment, which instituted the income tax; lobbying
     reform; etc.)

<title>Why the House Health Insurance Reform Bill Would Help Achieve True Health Care Reform - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>
<h3>WHY THE HOUSE HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM BILL WOULD HELP ACHIEVE TRUE HEALTH CARE REFORM</h3>
By John C. Liu<br>
<P>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder Update No. 271<br>
March 26, 1996<br>
<p>
(Updating <I>Issue Bulletin</I> No. 222, <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/ib222.html">"A Guide to Kassebaum-Kennedy,"</a> March 22, 1996.)
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The House of Representatives soon will consider major health insurance reform legislation approved by the Committees on Commerce, Ways and Means, and Economic and Educational Opportunities.<sup>1</sup>  The Health Coverage Availability and Affordability Act of 1996, a legislative proposal being coordinated by Representative Dennis Hastert (R-IL), contains many of the structural improvements needed in today's health insurance market.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The reforms would enable Americans to keep their health insurance should they change or lose their jobs. They also would generate more genuine competition among insurance carriers and other health plan providers, thereby controlling costs through free-market forces. In addition to making health insurance more available and portable, the House proposal would address the more immediate and pressing concern facing millions of Americans -- the affordability of health insurance. It would do this by changing the tax treatment of health insurance, creating medical savings accounts (MSAs), and expanding tax relief for health insurance. This would give Americans more personal choice of health care services and make it possible for more families to own their health plans.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Increasing the Availability of Insurance.</b> The House proposal would restrict the ability of health plans and employers to limit or deny group health insurance coverage to 12 months for medical conditions diagnosed in the previous 6 months. The limitation period on preexisting conditions would be reduced by the length of time that a worker and his dependents were continuously covered under any prior plan. In addition, the proposal would prohibit an insurance company from imposing any further preexisting condition exclusions if the employee had been covered under another group health plan at the time coverage was offered, and would prohibit health plans from excluding or canceling coverage for any employee in the employer group plan based on a preexisting condition or health status. Thus, workers who changed jobs would no longer be subjected to waiting periods. The absence of portability in group health insurance, now confronting millions of workers who want to change jobs, would be alleviated in the proposed group-to-group provision.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
More important, the House bill would help create a consumer-based health insurance system by making individual ownership of health policies much easier. Individuals would be guaranteed health insurance coverage if they met certain specific requirements.<sup>2</sup> 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Guaranteed issue and the availability of health insurance in the individual market would be achieved under the bill by forbidding insurance carriers from imposing eligibility, continuation, or enrollment requirements based on health status, medical condition, claims experience, or medical history. These rules would guarantee the portability of health insurance for workers and their families in the individual market. Under current law, individuals switching from an employer who provides health insurance to another employer who does not will lose coverage. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The concern has been raised that a guaranteed issue requirement would sharply raise the premiums on individual-based policies. Estimates vary, with some projecting increases of 2 to 5 percent, and others placing the increase between 10 and 15 percent.<sup>3</sup>  Because real consumer choice and genuine market competition are virtually non-existent in today's distorted health insurance market, it is inevitable that premiums would increase somewhat in the individual market under a guaranteed issue requirement. And since only employer-based health insurance is completely tax free, individuals who purchase it on their own must pay the entire cost of the higher premiums in after-tax dollars. Without any change in this tax treatment, healthier-than-average individuals would be more likely to decline insurance under a guaranteed issue requirement, while unhealthy persons would be more likely to purchase coverage, driving up average premiums. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Fortunately, the House proposal makes two key adjustments in the federal tax code that would help offset the increase in premiums.
<p><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>1.) Medical savings accounts.</b> The bill creates medical savings accounts (MSAs). As drafted, MSAs would enable group-to-individual conversions to have a significant impact on today's uninsured population. While there are other forms of tax equity Congress should consider, such as the comprehensive system of tax credits proposed in 1994 by Senator Don Nickles (R-OK) and Representative Cliff Stearns (R-FL) and 100 percent deductions for the self-employed, MSAs are a good start. They would provide an incentive for healthy individuals to purchase at least catastrophic health insurance, thereby creating a solid and solvent risk pool to help offset the claims of future unhealthy enrollees.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>2) An increased tax deduction for the self-employed.</b> Under current law, self-employed individuals are permitted to deduct 30 percent of the amount paid for health insurance for themselves and their dependents. The House bill would increase the deduction to 50 percent by 2003.<sup>4</sup>  While this would help, the federal tax code would remain biased against employees in employer-based health plans who prefer the security of choosing and owning their own plan. The House thus should establish at least a 50 percent deduction for all individuals purchasing health insurance, not just the self-employed.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Small Employer Pooling.</b> The House bill would allow smaller businesses to join together under the auspices of ERISA to purchase insurance coverage or to cover their employees under self-insured multiple employer health plans (MEHPs).<sup>5</sup>  Eighty-five percent of uninsured Americans are in households headed by a worker. The House proposal uses ERISA to preempt any state laws prohibiting groups of employers from obtaining fully insured health insurance coverage through a multiple employer arrangement.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The House bill also would eliminate confusion surrounding the responsibilities of the states and the U.S. Department of Labor under ERISA. This confusion has helped insurance swindlers and bogus unions hide behind the ERISA preemption clause. The House proposal would clarify the law and give legitimate self-insured associations (including church plans, franchise networks, trade associations, and certain collectively bargained plans) two clear and distinct regulatory options.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
First, legitimate associations could maintain or establish multiple employer health plans by seeking licensure in a state permitting such practices. Alternatively, they could seek federal certification under the "exemption" provision in current ERISA law. Second, the House bill makes clear that entities created for the express purpose of purchasing health insurance would be subject to the laws of the state in which they seek to do business rather than ERISA. The states could make these groups meet any state-defined insurance or multiple employer plan licensing requirements.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Smaller employers and individuals are at a disadvantage when attempting to negotiate premium rates with insurance carriers. The wrong way to deal with this would be for Congress to create government-sponsored health insurance purchasing cooperatives and impose new federal regulations. By giving smaller employers and the self-employed the right to take advantage of the economies of scale available under ERISA, the House proposal would make it much easier for small firms to obtain this expensive health insurance.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The House legislation would be a big step toward genuine health care reform because it addresses the principal reason why Americans have been demanding health insurance reform -- their fear of losing current health benefits or being unable to afford coverage. Further, the bill begins to tackle the root cause of the financing problems -- the tax bias against purchasing health insurance outside an employer. By doing this, the House proposal would give Americans the desirable components of health care reform that were the casualties of the battle over the Clinton health plan:  availability, affordability, portability, and -- above all -- the security that comes with personally owned health insurance.
<p>
<b>Endnotes:</b>
<ol><p>
<li>These three committees have jurisdiction over particular aspects of health insurance legislation. The Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee reported out H.R. 995 on March 6, 1996; the Ways and Means Committee reported out H.R. 3103 on March 19; and the Commerce Committee reported out H.R. 3070 on March 20. The House of Representatives is expected to vote on a final version combining specific provisions from these three bills on March 28, 1996.<p>
<li>Among these requirements:  1) The individual must have been covered under one or more group health plans for at least 18 months; 2) the individual is not eligible for coverage under another group health plan (new employer or spouse's employer); and 3) if eligible for COBRA coverage (or a similar state continuation of coverage program), the individual would have to have elected and exhausted such coverage.<p>

<li>It should be noted that a similar provision to increase the 30 percent deduction to 50 percent was passed by Congress in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995. This proposal was vetoed by President Clinton.<p>
<li>The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA, P.L. 93-406) prohibits states from treating self-insured firms as insurance carriers and making them subject to state regulations.

<center>
<h2>Hot Issues<p>
Whitewater</h2>
<br>
Friday, March 22, 1996
<p>
</center>



<hr>The following letter from ACU Chairman David Keene was delivered to the United State Senate on March 
18, 1996:<br>                 
        <p>
        
        Dear Senator:<br>
        <p>

        On behalf of the more than one million members and supporters of the American
        Conservative Union, I urge you to support an unlimited extension of the Special
        Whitewater Investigative Committee when the matter comes to the Senate floor this week.<p>
        
        While it is undeniably true that the Whitewater investigation has been going on for quite
        some time, it is also undeniably true that many in the Clinton White House and the
        Administration have displayed a callous, flagrant disregard for the subpoenas served on
        them.  On numerous occasions, documents subpoenaed months and even years ago have
        miraculously been &quot;discovered&quot; out of the blue.  Just in the past ten weeks, this has
        happened on four separate occasions, with the most recent &quot;discovery&quot; coming just a few
        days ago, when the White House released Counsel Bruce Lindsey's notes of a meeting
        long past.<p>
        
        No rational person could observe this pattern developing and not question whether or not
        the White House was complying fully with the Senate investigation, as the President
        promised it would.  Instead, it looks as if the White House has something to hide, and that
        someone there believes that if they just hold out long enough, the Senate committee will
        run out of time and money, and the danger -- whatever it might be -- will have passed.
        
        For that reason, we urge you to support not only an extension of the Whitewater
        Committee, but an indefinite extension.  Putting a time limit on it -- as some Democratic
        Senate leaders have suggested -- would merely tell anyone continuing to hold back
        documents how much longer they had to hide them before the threat was passed.<p>
        
        The American people want this investigation concluded, but they also want it concluded
        with no doubts left as to the facts of the matter.  Otherwise, the time and money spent
        already would be a waste.<p>
       
<Pre>
                          Yours sincerely,
        
        
               

                          David A. Keene
                              Chairman

<title>GAY 'MARRIAGE': HAWAII'S ASSAULT ON MATRIMONY</title>

<body>

<center>

<img src="/townhall/FRC/fampol/fampolbl.gif">

<h1>Gay 'Marriage'</h1>
<h2><i>Hawaii's Assault on Matrimony</i></h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>T</font>he Hawaii Commission on Sexual Orientation 
recently voted 5-2 to recommend that same-sex couples be granted 
identical legal status now conferred on married couples.  The majority 
report declared that the denial of the &quot;benefits&quot; of marriage
&quot;purely on the basis of gender&quot; is a violation of &quot;basic
human rights&quot; enshrined in Hawaii's constitution.[1]

<p>

While the Commission's recommendation is non-binding, it
coincides with other pro-homosexual activity in the judicial and
executive branches of Hawaii's state government.  If these efforts
succeed, the institution of marriage will not only be affected
in America's 50th state, but in the other 49 as well.

<p>

In making its recommendation, a majority of the Hawaii Commission
on Sexual Orientation concluded that denial of marriage licenses
to same-sex couples deprived applicants of legal and economic
benefits, including:

<p><ol>

<li>joint parental custody;<br>
<li>insurance and health benefits;<br>
<li>the ability to file joint tax returns;<br>
<li>alimony and child support; and<br>
<li>inheritance of property and visitation of a partner or child in 
the hospital.

</ol><p>

The majority also concluded that legalization of same-sex
&quot;marriage&quot; would be an economic boon to Hawaii, as homosexuals
would flock there to get married.  (Apparently, they ignored the
possibility that traditional honeymooners may choose another destination,
and that more than 97 percent of the population is heterosexual.)

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Making gay 'marriage' legal would<br>
impose it on all the citizens of<br>
Hawaii, and perhaps even on people<br>
in the rest of the United States.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The Commission's minority report took issue with virtually
every assertion made by the majority, and cited medical, social,
historical and legal authorities to make the case that same-sex
&quot;marriage&quot; would encourage homosexuality and therefore
aggravate health problems associated with homosexual behavior,
hurt the island state economically because of possible boycotts,
and undermine the moral fabric of Hawaiian society.  The report
charged the majority with bullying witnesses, altering the official
record of meetings, rudely interrupting minority members and
generally suppressing information.

<p>

The minority concluded that granting marital status to homosexuals
would imperil marriage itself and bring Hawaii into conflict with
the other 49 states.  Its recommendations:

<p><ul><i>

<li>The Legislature should adopt a Constitutional Amendment
preserving marriage and the marital partnership as between one
man and one woman as husband and wife.

<p>

<li>The legal and economic benefits conferred on married couples
in the state of Hawaii should not be extended to homosexual and/or
&quot;common law marriage&quot; couples because the cost is too
great.

<p>

<li>The legal and economic benefits conferred on married couples
in the state of Hawaii should not be extended to homosexual couples
for all the same reasons these benefits are not extended to unmarried
heterosexual couples engaged in &quot;common law marriage&quot;
in Hawaii.

</ul>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b>
Other relationships have not been<br>
accorded the same status as marriage<br>
because they do not contribute in the<br>
same way to a community. No society<br>
can survive without marriages and<br>
families.
</b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<ul>

<li>Rather than extend marital benefits to homosexual couples,
the legislature should modify statutes defining family to include
all those who share a household, which would include homosexual
couples as families.  However, the cost of doing so must be analyzed.

<p>

<li>The legislature must create a very broad religious freedom
exemption covering religious institutions and individuals who
have religiously motivated objections to treating same-sex partnerships
as marriage-equivalents.

</i></ul><p>

The latter recommendations seem to be fall-back positions
in case the state goes ahead with some sort of change in family
status.  Recommendation &quot;D&quot; is an unwise move toward
redefinition of family, and is surprising in light of the minority's
conclusion that &quot;homosexuality is a psychological pathology
and should not be encouraged.&quot;[2]

<p>

Commissioner Lloyd James Hochberg, Jr., who voted in the
minority, told <i>The New York Times</i>, &quot;Why would we want
to take a pathological condition and make it the equivalent of
heterosexual marriage as a goal that society is teaching children?
Once homosexual marriage or domestic partnership is permitted,
the schools are going to have to teach that it's equivalent.&quot;[3]

<p>

<center><h3>Background</h3></center>

<p>

In May 1993, the Hawaiian Supreme Court ruled 3-1 in <i>Baehr
v. Lewin</i>[4] that the state's exclusion of same-sex couples from
marital status may be unconstitutional because it amounts to discrimination.
Two homosexual men had applied for a marriage license, were denied,
and then sued the state.  The case eventually made its way to
the state Supreme Court, which remanded it to a lower court with
instructions to the state to prove &quot;compelling state interests&quot;
for limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples.

<p>

The lower court is expected to rule on the case in July 1996.
If the State of Hawaii loses the case, and the court thereby
legalizes same-sex marriage, it can appeal to the state Supreme
Court. But that is unlikely because the governor and the lieutenant
governor are on record as favoring same-sex marriage and/or domestic
partnerships (legal equivalency of marriage without the term 
&quot;marriage&quot;).

<p>

In April 1994, the Hawaiian legislature overwhelmingly passed
a bill (21-4 in the Senate and 36-12 in the House) reaffirming
the traditional one-man, one-woman definition of marriage.  If
the lower court rules for same-sex marriage, it would strike down
this state law.  A likely reaction would be a voters' drive for
a constitutional amendment to replace the stricken statute.  Meanwhile,
other states are already moving to protect the traditional definition
of marriage.

<p>

<center><h3>Majority v. Minority Reports</h3></center>

<p>

The minority report begins with a wry observation:  &quot;The
irony of this 'minority' report is that its conclusions actually
reflect the view of a majority of Hawaii's residents.&quot;[5]
Indeed, a series of polls revealed that two-thirds of Hawaiians
disapprove of same-sex &quot;marriage.&quot;[6] Even so, many observers
expect the liberal Hawaiian courts to mandate gay &quot;marriage.&quot;

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Gay 'marriage' is an oxymoron, an<br>
ideological invention designed to<br>
appropriate the moral capital of<br>
marriage and family toward the goal<br>
of government-enforced acceptance of<br>
homosexuality. As such, the term is<br>
a counterfeit and a fraud.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Hawaii has earned a reputation for being on &quot;the cutting
edge&quot; of social experimentation.  It was the first state
to legalize abortion (1970), the first to ratify the Equal Rights
Amendment (1972) and the fifth to offer special employment protections
to homosexuals (1991).

<p>

The majority report, mimicking arguments used by homosexual
activists, compares the same-sex quest for marital status with
the civil rights struggle by black Americans.  Most prominently
cited is an interracial couple's victory in <i>Loving v. Virginia</i>.[7]
In that historic case, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down laws
preventing marriage between people of different races as violating
the equal protection and due process clauses of the Fourteenth
Amendment to the Constitution.

<p>

But the court never came close to redefining the institution
of marriage itself, which is what would have to occur for same-sex
relationships to be accorded marital status.  The false equation
of a benign, nonbehavioral characteristic such as skin color with
an orientation based precisely on behavior finds no support within
the law.  Perhaps it is no wonder that the majority equates all
sexual behavior.  At the very first meeting of the commission
the majority voted to ban all discussion of homosexuality because
some members might find it offensive or inflammatory.[8] Thus, the
truth about homosexual behavior was deliberately kept out of 
the proceedings.

<p>

The majority report also cites a number of flawed studies
to give the impression that homosexuality and heterosexuality
are essentially no different and have no implications for health
or for the well-being of children.  The report provides no medical
data to sustain its assertion that &quot;testimonies stating [that]
the extension of benefits to same-gender couples would threaten
public health are inaccurate.&quot;  The report also states that
&quot;there is no evidence that children of gay and lesbian parents
develop any differently than [sic] the children of opposite-sex
parents.&quot;[9] In making this point, the report ignores considerable
evidence that children are more likely to experiment with homosexuality
or identify as homosexuals when raised in a homosexual household.[10]

<p>

The majority expresses an odd understanding of the role of
morality and the law when it states, &quot;[W]hile each person
has the right to practice their individual religious and moral
beliefs, they do not have the right to impose those on others.&quot;[11]
Making gay &quot;marriage&quot; legal would impose it on all
the citizens of Hawaii, and perhaps even on people in the rest
of the United States.

Same-sex 'marriage' threatens not<br>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The majority goes on to state, &quot;Under our constitutional
government the fact that some religious [sic] or churches condemn
same-sex marriages does not mean that those religious beliefs
can be imposed on others.&quot;[12] In the very next paragraph, the
report notes, &quot;The Buddhists asked the Commission to support
stable relationships between loving people regardless of whether
those people are the same gender.&quot;[13] So, while saying that
no religion can impose its beliefs on others,  the report openly
and unselfconsciously adopts the Buddhist position.  Incidentally,
the commission itself was formed, then regrouped, only after two
representatives from the Catholic Church and two Mormons were expelled 
on grounds of &quot;separation of church and state.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>Societal Implications</h3></center>

<p>

In the 1970s, homosexuals unsuccessfully challenged marriage
laws in Minnesota, Kentucky and Washington state.  In the Minnesota
case, the state Supreme Court noted, &quot;The institution of
marriage as a union of man and woman, uniquely involving the procreating
and rearing of children within a family, is as old as the book
of Genesis....This historic institution is more deeply founded
than the asserted contemporary concept of marriage and societal
interests for which petitioners contend.&quot;[14]

<p>

Other relationships have not been accorded the same status
as marriage because they do not contribute in the same way to
a community. To put it bluntly, societies can get along quite
well -- in fact, better -- without same-sex sexual relationships,
but no society can survive without marriages and families.  In
fact, because the term &quot;heterosexual marriage&quot; is redundant,
the term &quot;marriage&quot; will mean in this essay what it
has always meant:  the social, legal and spiritual union of a
man and a woman.  &quot;Gay marriage&quot; is an oxymoron, an
ideological invention designed to appropriate the moral capital
of marriage and family toward the goal of government-enforced
acceptance of homosexuality. As such, the term &quot;gay marriage&quot;
is a counterfeit and a fraud.  It would undermine support for
marriage by ending marriage's unique legal and cultural status.
It would also undermine support for natural families, whose
foundation is marriage.

<p>

Same-sex &quot;marriage&quot; threatens not only the integrity
of the marital definition but also religious freedom.  Although
the majority report recommends that religious institutions not
be forced to perform same-sex ceremonies, it offers no defense
for the conscientious Christian, Jew or Muslim (or Hindu or atheist,
for that matter) who will not legally recognize same-sex 
&quot;marriage.&quot; Law carries the potential use of force against 
those who will not abide by it.  If a businessman declines to extend 
marital benefits to same-sex couples, the law would open him to lawsuits
and state coercion.  Schools would be forced to teach the acceptability
of gay &quot;marriage&quot; in family life courses.  Homosexuals'
efforts to adopt children would be made easier if marriage is
stripped of its unique status.

<p>

All institutions except specifically religious ones would
be subjected to state enforcement.  That would include Christian
bookstores, radio and TV stations, and other nondenominational
businesses owned by religious people.  And religious institutions
themselves may enjoy immunity only for a short time.  &quot;Religious
exemption&quot; implies that the policy itself is at odds with
the moral order, but when push comes to shove, the state often
prevails.  For example, the Supreme Court swept away Bob Jones
University's tax-exempt status because the college, citing religious
reasons,  prohibited interracial dating.  The justices said that
the state's compelling interest in ensuring equality overrode
the college's religious views.  Almost all Christians would view
the university's stance as unbiblical, but the point is that religious
freedom is at the sufferance of the courts, which are acting increasingly
like lawmakers instead of law interpreters.  Religious freedom
can be curtailed anytime a court decides the state wants to do
so for &quot;compelling&quot; reasons.  Religious exemptions,
therefore, are most likely a temporary step on the way to total
acceptance of homosexuality.

<p>

<center><h3>Other States Fight Back</h3></center>

<p>

A constitutional conflict looms should the Hawaii court legalize
gay &quot;marriage,&quot; because under the U.S. Constitution's
full faith and credit clause, states must accord reciprocity to
other states in such matters as marriage and drivers' licenses.
So, theoretically, a homosexual couple could marry in Honolulu,
move to California and demand that the Golden State recognize
their &quot;marriage.&quot;  Because states do vary in their marital
requirements (such as minimum age), the general rule has been
to apply the law of the state where the marriage was performed
to determine a marriage's validity,  unless it &quot;violates
the strong public policy&quot; of the state in which the couple
reside.[15]

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Observers in some states have already moved to bolster this
common law protection by making the point more explicitly.

<p><ul>

<li>In March, 1995, Utah's legislators voted to deny recognition
of any out-of-state marriages that do not conform to Utah law.

<p>

<li>In South Dakota, a similar bill (H1184) passed the House
of Representatives but failed by one vote to get on the Senate
calendar.

<p>

<li>In Alaska, a bill was introduced in early 1995 to make clear
that &quot;marriage is a civil contract entered into by one man
and one woman.&quot;

<p>

<li>In Minnesota in 1993, a bill (H3016) which specified that
&quot;a marriage contracted between persons of the same gender
and recognized as valid in another state is not valid in this
state&quot; failed in a House committee.

<p>

<li>In New Hampshire in 1994, a bill (SB557) failed in a Senate
committee that would have barred recognition of  marriage &quot;between
persons of the same gender.&quot;  Even this might have proved
ineffective given the ongoing drive by feminists at United Nations-sponsored
conferences on women to redefine gender into no less than five
categories (male heterosexual, female heterosexual, male homosexual,
female homosexual and transsexual/bisexual).

<p>

<li>In early 1996, marriage protection bills were introduced in several 
state legislatures, including California, Idaho and Washington. 
Legislators in other states, such as Alabama, Virginia and Georgia, 
were preparing bills.

</ul><p>

<center><h3>The Importance of Definition</h3></center>

<p>

In all cultural struggles, a primary battleground is the
use of language.  Compromising the integrity of a term or phrase
can advance a particular agenda, or, at least, sow confusion
and uncertainty.  A term such as &quot;marriage&quot; can either
lose the power of its original meaning or be commandeered to mean
something entirely different.  In 1828, Noah Webster defined 
&quot;marriage&quot; as:

<p><blockquote>

<i>The act of uniting a man and woman for life; wedlock;  the
legal union of a man and woman for life.  Marriage is a contract
both civil and religious, by which the parties engage to live
together in mutual affection and fidelity, till death shall separate
them.  Marriage was instituted by God himself for the purpose
of preventing the promiscuous intercourse of the sexes, for domestic
felicity, and for securing the maintenance and education of children.
&quot;Marriage is honorable in all and the bed undefiled.
Heb. xiii.&quot;</i>[16]

</blockquote>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
One can no more 'expand' a definition<br>
or moral principle than one can<br>
continually expand a yardstick and<br>
still use it as a reliable measure.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

A more recent (1981) <i>Webster's</i> definition retains
the essential elements of the earlier version:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Marriage\ a: the state of being united to a person of the opposite
sex as husband or wife b: the mutual relation of husband and wife:
wedlock c: the institution whereby men and women are joined in
a special kind of social and legal dependence for the purpose
of founding and maintaining a family.</i>[17]

</blockquote><p>

No jurisdictional unit in the United States -- town, city,
or state -- recognizes same-sex couples as &quot;married.&quot;
In 1975, Boulder, Colorado granted a marriage license to a same-sex
couple, but it was struck down by a federal court in 1982. Protections
favoring marriage are built into the law and the culture because
of the central importance of the family unit as the building block
of civilization.  In 1888, the U.S. Supreme Court described marriage
&quot;as creating the most important relation in life, as having
more to do with the morals and civilization of a people than any
other institution.&quot;[18]

<p>

However, some jurisdictions are moving toward redefining
the family to include same-sex relationships, and there is a movement
within the legal community to overhaul the definitions of marriage
and family.  A note in the <I>Harvard Law Review</I> in 1991 advocated
replacing the formal definition of family with an elastic standard
based &quot;mainly on the strength or duration of emotional bonds,&quot;
regardless of sexual orientation.  The note recommends redefining
the family through &quot;domestic partner&quot; or family 
&quot;registration&quot; statutes that go beyond the limited benefits now 
conferred by existing domestic partnership laws so as to &quot;achieve 
parity&quot; between marriage and other relationships.[19]

<p>

In 1990, San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos appointed lesbian
activist Roberta Achtenberg (later Assistant Secretary of the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development under President
Clinton) to chair the Mayor's Task Force on Family Policy.  The
final report of the task force defines the family this way:

<p><blockquote>

<i>&quot;A unit of interdependent and interacting persons, related
together over time by strong social and emotional bonds and/or
by ties of marriage, birth, and adoption, whose central purpose
is to create, maintain, and promote the social, mental, physical
and emotional development and well being of each of its 
members.&quot;</i>[20]

</blockquote>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
This definition is so vague that<br>
multiple-partner unions are not<br>
excluded, nor any imaginable<br>
combination of persons, including<br>
a fishing boat crew. The whole<br>
point is to demote marriage to a<br>
level with all other relationships.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

In this definition, which could reasonably be described as
a formulation by homosexual activists, marriage is no longer the
foundation for families but secondary to &quot;strong social and
emotional bonds.&quot;  This definition is so vague that multiple-partner
unions are not excluded, nor any imaginable combination of persons,
including a fishing boat crew.  The whole point is to demote marriage
to a level with all other relationships.

<p>

To place same-sex relationships on a par with marriage destroys
the definition of marriage altogether.  When the meaning of a
word becomes nonspecific, the exclusivity that it previously defined
is lost.  For instance, if the state of Hawaii decided to extend
the famous -- and exclusive -- &quot;Maui onion&quot; appellation
to all onions grown in Hawaii -- even on, say, Oahu --, the term
&quot;Maui onion&quot; would lose its original meaning.  Consumers
would lack confidence in buying a bag of &quot;Maui onions&quot;
if all onions could be labeled as such.  The same goes for any
brand name. Wine from California could be falsely labeled as wine
from Bordeaux, France, thus destroying the uniqueness of both
appellations.  If &quot;marriage&quot; in Hawaii ceases to be
the term used solely for the social, legal, economic and spiritual
bonding of a man and a woman, the term &quot;marriage&quot; becomes
useless.

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

A key point to remember is that no one of marriageable age
is prevented from marrying in Hawaii provided they don't marry
blood relatives, underage persons, nonhumans or more than one
person.  Homosexuals are not denied the right to marry; but they
have to fulfill the requirements like anyone else.  They cannot
call a same-sex relationship &quot;marriage,&quot; since it lacks
a basic ingredient -- an entire sex.  The joining of the two opposite
sexes in permanence is the very essence of marriage.  Once the
&quot;one man, one woman&quot; definition is abandoned, there
is no logical reason for limiting &quot;marriage&quot; to two
people or even to people.  Why not have three partners?  Or why
not a man and his daughter?  Or a man and his dog?  The logical
reason to extend &quot;marriage&quot; to homosexual couples has
nothing to do with marital integrity, but only reflects the fact
that homosexuals want the same status regardless of its real meaning.
Anything less, they say, is a denial of human rights.  If so,
then a threesome or a foursome seeking marital status can similarly
claim that their sexual proclivities must be recognized by society
and the law as the equal of marriage or they are facing discrimination.

<p>

<center><h3>The Real Agenda</h3></center>

<p>

Homosexual activist Tom Stoddard acknowledges that &quot;enlarging
the concept to embrace same-sex couples would necessarily transform
it into something new....Extending the right to marry to gay people
-- that is, abolishing the traditional gender requirements of
marriage -- can be one of the means, perhaps the principal one,
through which the institution divests itself of the sexist trappings
of the past.&quot;[21] In other words, while many homosexual spokesmen
say they want only to be left alone to enjoy the benefits of marriage,
Stoddard rightly sees the expanded definition as a way of attacking
the institution itself.

<p>

In 1992, organizers of the homosexuals' 1993 March on Washington
met in Texas to draft a platform of demands.  Known as &quot;the
Texas platform,&quot; it was later toned down to make it more
palatable to a mass audience.  The original section on &quot;family,&quot;
however, is revealing as to the intentions of the movement.  In
addition to Demand No. 40, &quot;the recognition and legal protection
of all forms of family structures,&quot; the writers make Demand
No. 45, &quot;legalization of same-sex marriages,&quot; and Demand
No. 46, &quot;legalization of multiple partner unions.&quot;[22]

An English study also published<br>
in the journal</i> AIDS <i>found that<br>
most 'unsafe' sex acts occur in<br>
steady relationships.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

An enormous body of research indicates that monogamy is not the
norm for the average homosexual.[23] But even when it is, the result
is not necessarily healthier behavior.  A study published in the
journal <I>AIDS</I> found that men in steady relationships practiced
more anal intercourse and oral-anal intercourse than those without
a steady partner.[24] In other words, the exclusivity of the relationship
did not diminish the incidence of unhealthy behavior that is the
essence of homosexual sexual activity.  Curbing promiscuity would
help curb the spread of AIDS and the many other sexually transmitted
diseases that are found disproportionately among homosexuals,
but there is little evidence that &quot;monogamous&quot; homosexual
relationships function that way.  An English study also published
in the journal <I>AIDS</I> found that most &quot;unsafe&quot;
sex acts occur in steady relationships.[25]

<p>

Former homosexual William Aaron explains why &quot;monogamy&quot;
has a different meaning among homosexuals:  &quot;In the gay life,
fidelity is almost impossible.  Since part of the compulsion of
homosexuality seems to be a need on the part of the homophile
to 'absorb' masculinity from his sexual partners, he must be constantly
on the lookout for [new partners].  Consequently the most successful
homophile 'marriages' are those where there is an arrangement
between the two to have affairs on the side while maintaining
the semblance of permanence in their living arrangement.&quot;[26]

<p>

<center><h3>Sexual Revolution: A War on Families</h3></center>

<p>

As the research of the late Harvard sociologist Pitirim Sorokin
reveals, no society has loosened sexual morality outside of marriage
and survived.  Analyzing studies of cultures spanning several
thousand years on several continents, Sorokin found that virtually
all political revolutions that brought about societal collapse
were preceded by sexual revolutions in which marriage and family
were no longer accorded premiere status.[27] To put it another way,
as marriage and family ties disintegrated, the social restraints
learned in families also disintegrated. Societal chaos ushers
in tyrants who promise to restore order by any means.

<p>

Self-governing people require a robust culture founded on
marriage and family, which nurture the qualities that permit self-rule:
deferred gratification, self-sacrifice, respect for kinship and
law, and property rights.  These qualities are founded upon sexual
restraint, which permits people to pursue long-term interests,
such as procreating and raising the next generation, and securing
benefits for one's children.

<p>

In the 1981 Apostolic Exhortation <I>Familiaris Consortio</I>,
John Paul II summarized the importance of marriage-based families
this way:

<p><blockquote>

<i>&quot;The family has vital and organic links with society since
it is its foundation and nourishes it continually through its
role of service to life:  It is from the family that citizens
come to birth and it is within the family that they find the first
school of the social virtues that are the animating principle
of the existence and development of society itself.&quot;</i>[28]

</blockquote><p>

According sex outside marriage the same protections and status
as the marital bond would destroy traditional sexual morality,
not expand it.  One can no more &quot;expand&quot; a definition
or moral principle than one can continually expand a yardstick
and still use it as a reliable measure.[29]

<p>

Marriage-based kinship is essential to stability and continuity.
A man is more apt to sacrifice himself to help a son-in-law than
some unrelated man (or woman) living with his daughter. Kinship
entails mutual obligations and a commitment to the future of the
community. Homosexual relationships are a negation of the ties
that bind -- the continuation of kinship through procreation of
children.  To accord same-sex relationships the same status as
a marriage is to accord them a value that they cannot possibly
have.  Marriages benefit more than the two people involved, or
even the children that are created.  Their influence reaches children
living nearby, as young minds seek out role models. The stability
they bring to a community benefits all.

<center><h3>Conclusion</h3></center>

<p>

Some people in Hawaii are beginning the process of fashioning
a constitutional amendment to protect their state's law on marriage,
should the courts radically redefine it.  Other states are taking
action to defend their laws regarding marriage.   If more states
strengthen their laws, they would also strengthen the marriage
defenders in Hawaii, who can cite the &quot;compelling state interest&quot;
of heading off a constitutional crisis. At the federal level,
Congress may well consider legislation mandating the one-man,
one-woman definition of marriage for all federal purposes, including
the military, federal benefits, federal agency employment policies,
and the law in federal territories such as Puerto Rico and Guam.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Both the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China on Taiwan (ROC) have applied to join the World Trade Organization (WTO), the multilateral organization that sets the rules for international trade. Taiwan has made substantial progress in its accession negotiations. Although several important economic issues remain, the most significant obstacle to Taiwan's membership in the WTO is not economic, but political. China insists that Taiwan should not join the WTO before China.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. prefers that China and Taiwan become members of the WTO simultaneously. Simultaneous accession is, of course, the best possible outcome, but China is not as far along as Taiwan in meeting the criteria for membership. The U.S. should not let China's political sensitivities over Taiwan's membership slow U.S. negotiations with Taiwan. Once Taiwan meets the requisite economic criteria for WTO accession, the U.S. should be prepared to exercise international leadership to support Taiwan's membership, even in the face of China's determined opposition. Indeed, a clear signal to Taipei that the U.S. is willing to exercise such leadership could encourage Taiwan to meet the economic criteria for membership. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. also needs to clarify its position toward the PRC's prospective membership in the WTO. China wants to join for economic and political reasons. It wants not only the benefits of trade, but also the political recognition of its status as a world economic power and its primacy over Taiwan. In contrast, the European Union (EU), Japan, and the United States insist that WTO membership is a commercial contract, not an act of political recognition.<sup>1</sup>  Along with the Europeans and the Japanese, the Clinton Administration correctly insists that China can join the WTO only on "commercially viable terms."
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Substantial disagreements remain over the terms of China's accession. In particular, China disagrees with the EU, Japan, and the U.S. on the size and scope of tariff reductions; when China's export-import licensing scheme, known as trading rights, should be abolished; how China's investment and industrial policies should be brought in line with international agreements; whether China should accede to the WTO as a developed or developing country; and what safeguards should be available to limit import surges while the WTO accession agreement is being implemented.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
China's desire to join the WTO is an opportunity for the U.S. In addition to ensuring that China meets certain economic standards before acceding to the WTO, the U.S. could offer Beijing permanent, unconditional most-favored-nation (MFN) trading status in exchange not only for economic concessions, but also for dropping its political demands on Taiwan with regard to the WTO. It is in America's interest that membership in the WTO, both for China and for Taiwan, be treated as an economic question.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

To further American economic interests, President Bill Clinton should:
<p><ul>
<li> Support Taiwan's accession to the WTO after it meets U.S. demands on outstanding issues. Taiwan's accession should not be held hostage to demands by the PRC.
<p>
<li> Work closely with the European Union and Japan to ensure that China becomes a WTO member on commercially viable terms. In the face of a unified position on the part of the world's major trading nations, Beijing will be more likely to make economic concessions.
<p>
<li> Offer to exempt China from the Jackson-Vanik Amendment in exchange for concessions. The President should ask Congress for discretionary authority to exempt China from the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. Allowing the President to trade unconditional, permanent MFN status, which Beijing would value highly, for concessions on Taiwan's membership in the WTO and on economic issues benefitting the U.S.would increase America's negotiating leverage with China.

</ul><p>
<b>FROM GATT TO THE WTO</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Both China and Taiwan want to join the World Trade Organization because membership facilitates trade and enhances economic growth. Superseding the General Agreement Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the WTO establishes the legal framework for international trade. It also is the international organization which administers such multilateral agreements as GATT, the General Agreement on Trade in Services, and the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The WTO requires that member states and territories adhere to certain trade rules. Each member must apply the same tariffs and trade regulations to goods and services from all other members. This is known as the most-favored-nation (MFN) principle.<sup>2</sup>  Moreover, members may not discriminate against imported goods in favor of "like" domestically made products. This is known as the national treatment principle. All WTO-related trade agreements are based on these two fundamental principles.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The World Trade Organization is a direct descendent of the International Trade Organization (ITO), which allied leaders attempted to create at the end of World War II. The ITO was intended to prevent a recurrence of protectionism and to set the rules for international trade in the post-war era. In 1946-1947, President Harry Truman negotiated an "interim" agreement, the GATT, with other countries to reduce tariffs and establish a legal framework for international trade.<sup>3</sup>  The GATT was not intended to be a permanent organization, but a temporary instrument of the ITO. However, because the U.S. Senate failed to ratify the ITO charter, the ITO died stillborn in 1950, leaving the GATT forced to function as the world's multilateral trade organization until the WTO was established on January 1, 1995.<sup>4</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Since 1947, there have been eight successful rounds of trade liberalization negotiations under the GATT. The eighth was launched in Punta del Este, Uruguay, in September 1986 and concluded in Marrakesh, Morocco, on April 15, 1994. U.S. legislation implementing the Uruguay Round was signed into law on December 8, 1994.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

As in previous rounds, the Uruguay Round achieved substantial tariff reductions in developed countries. It cut tariffs by 38 percent, dropped the average tariff to 3.9 percent, and eliminated some tariffs altogether.<sup>5</sup>  The Uruguay Round also broke new ground in a number of areas:
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Agriculture.</b> For the first time, trade in agricultural products was placed under the GATT. The Uruguay Round mandates the conversion of non-tariff barriers on agricultural products into tariffs. This means that import quotas on foodstuffs must be lifted and replaced by tariffs whose rates are set to allow at least the same volume of imports as under the quota. The Uruguay Round also reduces government financial support for agriculture by 20 percent and cuts the value of export subsidies by 36 percent and the volume of subsidized exports by 21 percent over six years.<sup>6</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Apparel and Textiles.</b> Import quotas on apparel and textiles manufactured in developing economies such as China or India are being phased out over 10 years.<sup>7</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Services.</b> Trade in such services as advertising and tourism is governed by a new General Agreement on Trade in Services, which establishes an MFN principle for all services. However, this agreement applies the national treatment principle only to those services listed by a WTO member in its trade liberalization commitments.  This agreement also mandates additional negotiations on opening markets in such service sectors as financial services, telecommunications, and maritime transport.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Trade-Related Investment Measures.</b> Modest progress was made toward liberalizing foreign investment. Regulations which require that a minimum percentage of a product's "added value" (i.e., that portion of its value normally subject to a value-added tax) be produced within a country are banned. Such regulations are known as local content requirements. Also banned are regulations which require that a minimum percentage of finished goods be exported in exchange for allowing imports.<sup>8</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Intellectual Property Rights. </b>Finally, the Uruguay Round establishes global rules for the protection of copyrights, trademarks, industrial designs, trade secrets, semiconductor layouts, and geographical indications.<sup>9</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

During the Uruguay Round, GATT members recognized the need for a permanent multilateral organization similar to the stillborn ITO to supervise global trade. As a result, the World Trade Organization, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, was established to supersede the GATT. The WTO oversees the implementation of trade agreements negotiated under auspices of the GATT or WTO, periodically evaluates the trade practices of its members, organizes future multilateral trade negotiations, and adjudicates trade disputes arising from WTO-related trade agreements.
<p>
<b>HOW TO JOIN THE WTO</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

A knowledge of the WTO's structure and procedure helps explain the difficulties facing Taiwan. The WTO is governed by a Ministerial Conference, which is composed of the trade ministers of all WTO members and must meet at least once every two years. Between meetings, the Ministerial Conference delegates the power to run the WTO to a General Council composed of representatives of all WTO members and a Director-General appointed by the Ministerial Conference.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Article IX of the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization states, "The WTO shall continue the practice of decision-making by consensus followed under GATT.... [W]here a decision cannot be arrived at by consensus, the matter shall be decided by voting."  The preference for consensus is very strong. Fewer than a handful of votes have been taken in almost 50 years. When a vote does occur, each WTO member has one vote.<sup>10</sup>  Accession of new members requires a two-thirds vote of the membership. 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Article XII of the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization provides that a member may be either "a [sovereign] state or a separate customs territory possessing full autonomy in the conduct of its external commercial relations."  A state or territory applying for membership must submit a memorandum detailing all of its laws, regulations, and policies affecting trade and investment. Once this memorandum is submitted, negotiations for entry start on two tracks. In Geneva, the General Council appoints a Working Party composed of trade negotiators from WTO members, including the U.S., to bargain with the applicant on bringing its domestic laws into line with WTO rules. 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Simultaneously, the applicant begins bilateral discussions with individual WTO members on tariff reductions and other market-opening issues. Only after the applicant concludes all bilateral negotiations may the Working Party submit a Protocol of Accession to the Ministerial Conference for approval. The Protocol of Accession is a statement which details all of an applicant's trade liberalization commitments. Consequently, the bilateral negotiations are a choke point in the membership process; any member can veto an applicant simply by failing to conclude the bilateral talks.
<p>
<b>TAIWAN'S BID TO JOIN THE WTO</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Because GATT and its successor, the WTO, allow either sovereign states or autonomous customs territories to apply, Taiwan applied on January 1, 1990, to become a contracting party to the GATT as "The Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu," or "Chinese Taipei."  This lengthy designation was chosen to soothe Beijing's sensitivities about Taiwan, over which it claims sovereignty.<sup>11</sup>  Taiwan was following the example of Hong Kong, which became a contracting party on April 23, 1986. On September 29, 1992, the GATT accepted Taiwan's application and appointed a Working Party to begin membership negotiations.<sup>12</sup>  Since then, Taiwan has participated in eight Working Party sessions and has conducted bilateral negotiations over tariff reductions and market access with 25 WTO members.<sup>13</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

China does not object to "Chinese Taipei's" accession to the WTO, provided it does not join before China. In fact, China has offered to sponsor Taiwan's membership as its first act as a WTO member; at the same time, however, because China considers accession to be a political act, it has warned WTO members that it will firmly oppose admitting Taiwan first. 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Both bilateral and Working Party negotiations with Taiwan have progressed farther than they have with the PRC. Taiwan has agreed to enter the WTO as a developed economy, meaning it would comply with the same standards as the European Union, Japan, and the U.S.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Taiwan has promised to implement all WTO commitments immediately and fully with only a few exceptions, related principally to agricultural products. Taiwan has offered not only to lift all import bans, but also to cut average industrial tariffs from 5.2 percent to 3.8 percent and average agricultural tariffs from 13.3 percent to 11.4 percent. It also has agreed not to raise tariff rates in the future without compensating other WTO members; such compensation may include lowering other tariff rates, removing non-tariff barriers, or liberalizing trade in service sectors.<sup>14</sup> 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

However, five important economic issues remain unresolved in the bilateral negotiations with Taiwan.
<p><ul>
<li> Market Access for Alcohol and Tobacco. The Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Monopoly Bureau currently maintains a legal monopoly on the manufacture and distribution of alcoholic beverages and tobacco in Taiwan. The European Union and the U.S. are seeking to end the monopoly's discriminatory practices and expand export opportunities.
<P>
<li> Market Access for Agricultural Products. Australia, the European Union, New Zealand, and the U.S. are not satisfied with Taiwan's offer to reduce tariffs and liberalize quotas for agricultural products, especially beef, milk, rice, and various fruits and vegetables.
<p>
<li> Market Access for Motor Vehicles. Japan, South Korea, and the U.S. have yet to reach agreement with Taiwan on cutting tariffs and removing strict quotas on automobile imports.
<p>
<li> Intellectual Property Rights Protection. The European Union and the U.S. find that Taiwan does not sufficiently protect intellectual property rights. Taiwan still requests a two-year phase-in period for implementing the Uruguay Round Agreement on Intellectual Property Rights, while American and European negotiators insist on full implementation immediately upon accession. Taiwan also has failed to meet the American and European demand for full protection of copyrighted materials produced in the last 50 years.
<p>
<li> Market Access for Services. Taiwan's proposal on such services as telecommunications and legal services is also inadequate for the U.S. For example, American negotiators want to remove Taiwan's suffocating restrictions on foreign investment in the telecommunications industry.<sup>15</sup>
</ul><P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

During the December 1995 meeting of the Taiwan Working Party, U.S. negotiators handed their Taiwanese counterparts a discussion paper on these unresolved issues. Taiwan is expected to reply before the Working Party's next meeting, tentatively scheduled for late spring 1996.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The optimum outcome would be the simultaneous accession of China and Taiwan to the WTO. However, the slower pace of the negotiations with China may be affecting the pace of talks with Taiwan. Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Winston Lord told a November 9, 1995, briefing at the Foreign Press Center that "we have not reached a point where we have to worry about sequence,"<sup>16</sup> but a more accurate (and perhaps more candid) statement of where things actually stand came from another American official. This official, who requested anonymity, commented after Taiwan's Working Party meeting on December 14, 1995, that "no one in the Working Party has the stomach" to propose delinking the accessions of the PRC and ROC.<sup>17</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

When the question of who should go first does come up, the Clinton Administration merely follows the crowd. As Lord noted, "[the sequence of accession] will be a collective decision of the WTO, not just the United States."  Lord went on to say that "we believe each case should be decided on its own merits" without "any political consideration."<sup>18</sup>  As a European official observed anonymously after the conclusion of the Working Group meeting on December 14, however, "Bilateral concerns with Taiwan should be easy to conclude, [but] the EU is not keen to conclude them because there is a clear sentiment among WTO members that Taiwan's accession cannot take place before China's."<sup>19</sup>  Thus, without determined American leadership, it is doubtful that Taiwan will be permitted to enter the WTO before the PRC. The WTO's consensus-based approach to decision-making gives China a tacit veto over Taiwan's accession.
<p>
<b>THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA AND THE WTO</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It will be more difficult for China to join the WTO than it is for Taiwan, if only because Beijing will have to make more fundamental changes in the structure of its economy.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
China is now the world's third-largest economy behind the U.S. and Japan. Since 1978, the People's Republic of China has transformed its once-stagnant command economy into a growing mixed economy. Markets have been liberalized, and prices are set largely by the market. While currency inconvertibility and poor statistical data make a precise determination of China's gross domestic product impossible, estimates of its 1994 GDP range from $474 billion to $3.0 trillion.<sup>20</sup>  China's annual real GDP growth rate has averaged more than 9 percent in the last decade.<sup>21</sup>  Furthermore, China's high savings rate, high degree of literacy, and low population growth rate suggest the ability to sustain high productivity and per capita income growth rates in the future.<sup>22</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Economic reform also has stimulated international trade. China's global two-way trade was $20.7 billion in 1978, making the PRC the world's 27th-largest trading economy. In 1994, with two-way trade of $236.4 billion, China became the world's tenth-largest trading economy. Two-way trade between China and the U.S. also has grown, rising from $4.8 billion in 1980 to $48.1 billion in 1994, making the PRC America's sixth-largest trading partner.<sup>23</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Coming to Geneva.</b> China has been seeking to join the GATT and now the WTO for almost a decade. Although the Republic of China was an original contracting party to the GATT in 1948, Taiwan's government withdrew in 1950, following the Communist victory on the mainland and the Nationalist retreat to Taiwan; later, once economic reforms were underway on the mainland, the PRC sought to resume the seat itself. China won observer status in the GATT in November 1982 and formally requested accession to the GATT on July 11, 1986. On February 13, 1987, China submitted the required memorandum describing its trading system, and on March 4, 1987, the GATT Council established a Working Party to negotiate China's accession.<sup>24</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Following the conclusion of the Uruguay Round, China launched a major campaign to join the GATT before the end of 1994. Beijing wanted to become a founding member of the WTO because it saw this as political recognition of China's status as a world economic power. The European Union, Japan, and the U.S. insisted that China's accession must be accomplished on "commercially viable terms."  Because negotiators were unable to bridge the wide gap between these two positions, the talks failed to produce an agreement on China's accession.<sup>25</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Almost one year later, on November 10, 1995, Deputy United States Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky laid out a secret 13-page "road map" on Chinese accession to Beijing negotiators. This document outlined the full range of WTO commitments and identified the basic issues that China must resolve before it can enter the WTO on a commercially viable basis.<sup>26</sup>  These issues include:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Reducing tariffs and opening markets.</b> A wide gap remains between China's current offers on reducing tariffs and the minimum demands of the major trading powers. During the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum Leaders' Meeting in Osaka, Japan, on November 19, 1995, Chinese President Jiang Zemin announced that China would cut its average tariff rate from 36 percent to 24 percent as a "downpayment" on APEC trade liberalization.<sup>27</sup>  China also has indicated a willingness to cut its average tariff rate to 17 percent within three years for industrial products and six years for agricultural products.<sup>28</sup>
<p>
China has not released detailed information on what the new tariffs would be. Therefore, it is difficult to know the exact value of this offer. However, China's average tariff rate, even after this second reduction, would remain high compared to other developing countries such as Brazil (14.3 percent) or Malaysia (9 percent). Moreover, China indicated not only a desire to maintain an industrial policy to protect "infant" industries, but also an unwillingness to liberalize foreign investment rules and import restrictions in the automotive and telecommunications sectors of its economy.<sup>29</sup> 
<P>
<li><b> Trading Rights.</b> China controls imports and exports through a licensing system known as trading rights, which requires companies to receive Beijing's approval for each of their imports or exports. Under the WTO, firms may import or export any product they wish unless that product falls under certain narrowly defined government exceptions. Eliminating trading rights is important because they allow China to negate the value of any tariff concession by refusing to grant import licenses.<sup>30</sup>  In December 1995, China offered to phase out trading rights within five years instead of the eight years it had offered in July 1995.<sup>31</sup>  The U.S. has pushed for a shorter phase-out, possibly two or three years, provided China does not favor domestic firms over their foreign rivals in granting trading rights during the phase-out period.<sup>32</sup>
<p>
<li><b> Investment and Industrial Policies.</b> China's investment and industrial policies violate GATT's national treatment principle. For example, China forbids foreign investment in some industries (such as motor vehicle assembly), requires local partners in others, and discriminates against foreign firms in granting trading rights. China also violates the Uruguay Round Agreement on Investment by requiring that foreign investors in China use domestic components in manufacturing of their products and also by requiring that foreign-owned firms export a large percentage of the products made at their Chinese factories. Finally, China violates the Uruguay Round Agreement on Intellectual Property Rights by requiring the transfer of patented technology as a precondition for approving foreign investment. The European Union, Japan, and the U.S. insist that China terminate these practices upon accession, but the Chinese want a much longer phase-out period.
<p>
<li><b> Developed versus Developing Country.</b> China seeks to enter the WTO as a so-called developing country. The WTO tries to help developing members adjust to global competition by allowing them to adhere to less demanding standards and to take a longer time to implement trade liberalization than is required of developed members. For example, in agriculture, while developed members must cut the value of their export subsidies by 36 percent and the volume of their subsidized exports by 21 percent over six years, developing members are allowed to reduce the value of their export subsidies by only 24 percent and the volume of their subsidized exports by 14 percent over ten years. Similarly, developed members must implement the Agreement on Intellectual Property Rights within one year, while developing members may take up to four years to implement the provisions.
<P>
China argues that it qualifies for admission as a developing country because of its low per capita income. The U.S. and other developed countries counter that China's economy is not small and weak like those of other developing countries; China is already a major exporter. Therefore, the PRC should enter the WTO under the more demanding standards of a developed country.
<P>
<li><b> Protection Against Import Surges from China.</b> The only significant disagreement among the European Union, Japan, and the U.S. concerning China's entry to the WTO is over safeguards against import surges from China during the phase-in period. WTO members may raise tariffs temporarily or impose quotas for up to four years (1) when an import surge threatens a domestic industry and (2) when relief from the import surge may "prevent or remedy serious injury and facilitate adjustment."  This practice is known as a "safeguard."  Generally, safeguards may not be targeted at a specific country; they must be applied equally to all exporting countries.
<P>
Europeans insist that during China's transition period, WTO members must be permitted to impose "safeguard" tariffs or quotas on Chinese exports without having to apply them at the same time to exports from all other WTO members. Furthermore, they want to be able to apply these safeguards against either specific Chinese products or all Chinese exports. The Japanese, on the other hand, have shown little interest in safeguards.
<P>
The American position is more ambivalent. The United States wants a strong accession agreement and would like to have China move rapidly to liberalize its market and adopt strict rules on investment and intellectual property rights. At the same time, the U.S. "road map" suggests a willingness to consider safeguards if necessary.
<P>
China objects to safeguards as a violation of the MFN principle but does not rule them out entirely. It would allow WTO members to invoke safeguards only when the volume of imports of a specific Chinese product grew substantially faster than the volume of imports of similar products from other countries.<sup>33</sup> 
<p>
<li><b> Import Quotas.</b> Referring to Poland's accession to the GATT in 1968 as a precedent, the U.S. "road map" suggests that China should consider adopting import quotas while implementing its WTO commitments.<sup>34</sup>  During Poland's accession negotiations, GATT members struggled over how to create trading opportunities between Poland's non-market economy and their market economies. To solve this problem, Poland agreed to increase its imports from GATT members by seven percent each year and to subject its exports to GATT members to special safeguards. These import quotas encouraged Polish central planners to permit more imports and to abandon some protectionist policies.<sup>35</sup>
<p>
China feels that import quotas are inappropriate during the implementation period. A Chinese negotiator recently stated that "China is in transit from a planned economy to a market economy. Today's China is totally different than Poland thirty years ago."<sup>36</sup>
<p>
<li><b> Jackson-Vanik.</b> The Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the Trade Act complicates the U.S. discussions with China over WTO accession. Passed in 1975, this law requires the President to certify annually that countries with non-market economies are allowing free emigration. Congress may overturn the President's certification by passing a joint resolution. Jackson-Vanik was intended to increase the flow of Jewish emigrants from the former Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellites to Israel and the U.S. However, following the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, Congress began to apply it to China by attempting to revoke China's MFN status.
<P>
The WTO requires that the U.S. grant China unconditional, permanent MFN trade status once it joins the WTO. By preventing this, Jackson-Vanik will force the U.S. to conduct separate negotiations with China to try to duplicate the terms of its WTO accession in a separate bilateral trade agreement. This reduces America's negotiating leverage, allowing China to offer less generous economic concessions to the U.S. in a parallel bilateral trade agreement than other countries would receive under the usual WTO accession agreement.<sup>37</sup>
</ul><P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Chinese Reactions to the U.S. Position.</b> Chinese negotiators greeted the U.S. "road map" as a "positive initiative," but they also warned that substantial differences remain unresolved. An informal meeting of the Working Party convened in Geneva on December 7-8, 1995, and China-U.S. bilateral talks were held the following day. Chinese negotiators agreed to reply to the "road map" by the next meeting of the Working Party on March 18, 1996.<sup>38</sup> 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

During a February 12, 1996, meeting with Deputy USTR Charlene Barshefsky, Vice Minister Sun Zhenyun delivered China's reaction. Sun reaffirmed that the "road map" was a positive step, but criticized parts of it for making what he claimed were demands that exceed what is required of other WTO members. Sun rejected a U.S. proposal for safeguards against surges of Chinese imports. He also opposed a U.S. suggestion for import targets. China is expected to respond to the other issues raised in the "road map" at the next Working Group meeting.<sup>39</sup> 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

So far, American, European, and Japanese negotiators have remained remarkably united in their talks with China. The three major trading powers have insisted that China may not join the WTO as a matter of political recognition; accession must occur on a "commercially viable basis."

<p>
<b>BRINGING CHINA AND TAIWAN INTO THE WTO</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It will take China longer to join the WTO than it will Taiwan. The PRC has to make fundamental structural changes in its economy to meet WTO standards. The economic concessions Taiwan must make, while significant, are more limited, affecting only certain sectors of its economy. Nevertheless, even if the Taiwanese government decides to make concessions, Beijing's determined opposition to Taiwan's accession before China's and the apparent U.S. willingness to accede to Beijing's desires will hold Taiwan's application hostage to China's wishes.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

WTO-related trade agreements are commercial contracts, and WTO accession is an economic, not a political, act. Any state or territory willing and able to meet the WTO's economic criteria should be free to join. As the world's largest exporter, the U.S. has an interest in seeing that arbitrary political criteria are not applied to WTO applicants. Therefore, to further American economic interests, President Clinton should:
<P><ul>
<li><b>Support the accession of Taiwan to the WTO after Taiwan meets U.S. demands on outstanding issues.</b> If China is making enough progress in the WTO negotiations, the Clinton Administration should help China and Taiwan join at the same time. This would be the best outcome for all parties. However, if the talks with China fail and accession appears unlikely in the near future, the Clinton Administration should support the accession of Taiwan on its own merits, even though this would face China's determined opposition. 
<p>
<li><b> Cooperate with the European Union and Japan to ensure that China becomes a WTO member on commercially viable terms.</b> Close cooperation among the European Union, Japan, and the United States will prevent China from playing one against the others in the accession negotiations. Therefore, cooperation will increase American leverage in negotiating with China. At a minimum, President Clinton must insist that China agree to: 
<p><ol>
<li><b> Implement</b> the principal WTO commitments, publish all trade regulations, and provide an open and fair legal process for adjudicating trade disputes immediately upon accession.
<p>
<li><b> Accept</b> strong safeguard provisions in exchange for a longer time to phase out trading rights and implement other WTO commitments.
<p>
<li><b> End</b> the PRC's practice of forcing foreign firms to transfer technology as a condition of doing business in China. China's market is so huge that Beijing has the leverage to force large industrial firms to surrender to this form of government-sponsored theft.
<p>
<li><b> Enforce</b> fully all existing bilateral trade agreements, especially the 1995 Intellectual Property Rights Memorandum of Understanding.
</ol><P>
<li><b> Offer to exempt China from the Jackson-Vanik Amendment in exchange for concessions.</b> The President should ask Congress for discretionary authority to exempt China from the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. Beijing highly values gaining unconditional, permanent MFN trade status in the U.S. However, keeping China on conditional MFN status subject to annual renewal, as mandated by Jackson-Vanik, provides the U.S. with few benefits. By granting the President the discretionary authority to exempt China from Jackson-Vanik, Congress would strengthen substantially America's leverage in WTO accession talks with Beijing. The President then could offer Beijing unconditional, permanent MFN trade status in exchange not only for relaxing its political demands on Taiwan's membership in the WTO, but for economic concessions that benefit American exporters and investors.
</ul><P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Jackson-Vanik Amendment harms American interests in a number of ways. First, applying Jackson-Vanik to China is based on a faulty premise. The PRC is no longer a stagnant non-market economy. Rather, it is a growing mixed economy. Proponents of applying Jackson-Vanik ignore the economic reforms that have occurred in China since 1978.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Second, applying Jackson-Vanik to China is inappropriate. Jackson-Vanik was designed to encourage the Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellites to lift restrictions on Jewish emigration to Israel and the U.S. However, it is American immigration law, not Chinese emigration policy, that restricts the flow of Chinese emigrants. While millions of Chinese would willingly emigrate to the U.S., American immigration law limits the flow to approximately 25,000 annually. 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Third, Jackson-Vanik's threat to withdraw MFN is at best ineffective and at worst counterproductive. MFN tariffs are not a special privilege granted to specific countries; they are the standard rates that the U.S. extends to all but a handful of small countries. Withdrawing MFN would compel the U.S. to apply Smoot-Hawley tariffs on Chinese exports. After the inevitable Chinese retaliation against American exports, there would be a virtual cessation of China-U.S. trade.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Finally, Jackson-Vanik weakens the U.S. bargaining position in the WTO accession talks with China. By preventing the U.S. from granting China unconditional, permanent MFN, it would force the U.S. to conclude a separate bilateral trade pact with Beijing, paralleling China's WTO accession agreement and allowing the PRC to offer the U.S. smaller tariff cuts and fewer market-opening measures than it would grant to other WTO members in its accession agreement.

<P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Both the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China are seeking to join the WTO, the former as a sovereign state and the latter as an autonomous customs territory. Although Taiwan is closer to the goal, both have yet to meet the economic criteria for membership. Taiwan sees WTO membership as a commercial contract, while the PRC regards it as an act of political recognition. Beijing therefore opposes Taiwan's accession before its own. 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Because China's accession is more complicated, negotiations with China may take longer to complete than those with Taiwan. Taiwan's accession to the WTO could be held hostage to the process of internal change in China. Given the commercial nature of the WTO, this would be manifestly unfair. When Taiwan meets the economic criteria, the U.S. should be prepared to exercise leadership in building international consensus for its accession, even in the face of China's determined opposition. Taiwan should join the WTO when it is ready, not when Beijing says it can.
<p>
<b>Endnotes:</b>
<p><ol>
<li>Technically, only sovereign states and autonomous customs territories may join the WTO. However, in the Treaty of Rome, member states ceded their authority over international commercial relations to the European Union. The EU represents all of its member states at the WTO and acts on their behalf in trade negotiations. For the sake of simplicity, this <I>Backgrounder</I> will treat the EU as if it were a WTO member.<p>
<li>There are several important exceptions to the most-favored-nation principle. Customs unions such as the European Union and free-trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) are permissible exceptions to the MFN principle. Likewise, developed WTO members may abolish or reduce tariffs on certain industrial goods imported from least developed members. This is known as the generalized system of preferences (GSP). <p>
<li>The GATT was negotiated under authority granted to the President in the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 and thus did not require congressional approval.<P>

<h2>Hot Issues<p>
        Immigration Reform          </h2>            
       

                                 <BR>


        Wednesday, March 20, 1996:

        <P></center>


        

        On behalf of the more than one million members
and supporters of the American

        Conservative Union, I'm writing to share
our concerns regarding the controversial issue of

        worker verification hotlines as contained
in HR 2202, the immigration reform bill you will

        be considering today and tomorrow.  We oppose
such hotlines, and urge you to oppose them

        as well.  Specifically, I urge you to oppose
the Gallegly amendment, and to support the

        Chabot amendment instead.

   <P>     

        The original version of the bill contained
language mandating a national employment

        verification pilot program, through the institution
of an 800-number hotline attached to a

        database.  Critics rightfully referred to
this as a &quot;1-800-BIG BROTHER&quot; number.

<P>        

        The worker verification provisions in the
original bill have been diluted somewhat.  Instead

        of a mandatory national program, the underlying
legislation now calls for a &quot;voluntary&quot;

        program in which employers could call a national
database to verify whether or not

        prospective workers were eligible for employment.

<P>        

        But what is the point of establishing a pilot
program, on either a mandatory or voluntary

        basis, if not to test its efficacy?  If it
fails, it will have been merely a waste of time and

        money.  But if it succeeds, the likelihood
is great that a move would be made in a future

        Congress to mandate the program nationally
-- something we oppose outright.

<P>        

        To begin, we have a strong philosophical
objection to the entire concept that individuals and

        private employees must phone the Federal
Government to ask permission to work. 

        Moreover, we have serious concerns about
where this might lead.  Once a national

        employee verification hotline is established,
we're only one short step away from national

        identification cards, to &quot;ease&quot;
the burden on the hotline and further combat fraud.  (In fact,

        we've noted with some dismay the establishment
of just such a federal identification card in

        the original version of the companion Senate
legislation, S. 269.)

<P>        

        In addition to our pure philosophical objections,
there are also practical considerations.  As

        we read the legislation, it appears to us
that the heaviest burden likely would fall on those

        businesses that seek to abide by the law;
those who knowingly and regularly flout the law

        by hiring illegal aliens would be no more
likely to abide by this law than they would be

        likely to abide by current law.  Thus, just
as in the case of the Brady Bill (which merely

        mandates that law-abiding citizens must wait
to purchase a hand gun, while criminals are

        not deterred at all from purchasing such
weapons), it is the law-abiding citizens who pay the

        price.

<P>        

        Small businesses do not have the staff or
the resources to keep up with the new mandate. 

        Many would be literally snowed under with
the new requirement.  Those who survive the

        new regulatory burden may see their colleagues'
distress and conclude that disobeying the

        law is a cost of doing business -- thereby
taking law-abiding small business owners and

        turning them into criminals.  Is that what
we want?

        <P>

        The Gallegly amendment would re-institute
the mandatory nature of the verification pilot

        program, while the Chabot amendment would
eliminate the program altogether.  For that

        reason, we urge you to oppose the Gallegly
amendment, and support instead the Chabot

        amendment.  When even a president as liberal
as Bill Clinton says &quot;The era of Big

        Government is over,&quot; how can we justify
the creation of a Big Brother employment

        verification hotline -- even on a trial basis?

<h2>Affirmative Action</h2>
</center>
<blockquote><P> 
For the past thirty years, affirmative-action policies have contributed to the 
balkanization of America by race, sex and ethnicity.   The original intent of these 
policies -- to redress past discrimination -- was a noble one, but the means of redress 
have been fundamentally flawed and the real-life consequences disastrous.  It is time 
to stop counting by race and to re-dedicate this nation to the proposition that we are 
a color-blind society.<p>    

To be sure, racism and discrimination are still ugly stains on the American 
landscape, and where they occur, we should use existing laws to stamp them out.   
But affirmative action as a remedy has outrun its course.  If we continue to count by 
race, hire by race, and admit by race, we will divide by race.  We must renew our 
commitment to the American ideal that we are one people:<i> e pluribus unum</i>.  The 
best way to achieve a color-blind society is actually to be a color-blind society, in law 
and in spirit.<p>

<B>Recent Developments</B><br>
Despite President Clinton's morally bankrupt defense of all federal affirmative-
action programs, public opposition to quotas and the institutionalized 
discrimination of affirmative action programs continues to mount.  Moreover, 
several recent developments have dealt powerful blows to federal policies and 
programs that count by race.<p>  

In June, the Supreme Court ruled in Adarand Constructors v. Pena that federal 
affirmative action programs must meet a standard of &quot;strict scrutiny.&quot;  Under the 
strict-scrutiny standard, the federal government must demonstrate that an 
affirmative-action program is narrowly tailored to redress identifiable past 
discrimination.  Few of the existing affirmative-action programs meet that test. 

In July, Congress introduced &quot;The Equality of Opportunity Act of 1995,&quot; which 
prohibits the federal government from taking race, gender, or ethnicity into account 
in its employment or contracting practices, or in the implementation of any federally 
conducted program or activity. The &quot;Equality of Opportunity Act&quot; is an important 
piece of legislation that, if passed, will guarantee all Americans justice and equal 
treatment under  the law.<p>

Empower America is also a strong supporter of the California Civil Rights 
Initiative, which should appear on the statewide ballot as a referendum in 
November of 1996.   The Civil Rights Initiative prohibits the state of California from 
using race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin as criteria for discriminating 
against, or giving preferential treatment to, any individual. <p>  

In dismantling the racially divisive programs of affirmative action, it is important 
for conservatives to be principled, not opportunistic:  We still need to reach out to 
disadvantaged Americans, especially those living in our inner-cities.  To this end,  
Empower America supports measures that will expand opportunities to the inner-
city poor, including tenant- management housing, empowerment zones, and school 
choice.  We also support redesigning the tax code to make possible broader 
ownership of capital, savings, and credit in the minority community.   Expansion of 
opportunity is necessary to ensure equality of opportunity.<p>

<i>Issue Briefing</i><P>
<h2>Outcome-Based Education</h2>
<P><i>March 19, 1996</i><P></center><hr>
<P> 
				
There are serious, legitimate concerns surrounding outcome-based education (OBE).  In 
principle, it sounds good.  In practice, however, OBE can be used to undermine parental 
authority and traditional moral and religious beliefs.  This explains why much of the 
criticism of OBE has come largely from parents' rights groups.<p>

A key to understanding outcome-based education depends on making the distinction 
between cognitive outcomes (i.e., the development of intellectual abilities and skills) 
and behavioral and social outcomes (i.e., the shaping of social attitudes, values, and 
interpersonal relationships).<p>

A case can be made on behalf of outcome-based education if it is confined to cognitive 
outcomes; that is, if we objectively measure students' knowledge in the basics -- math, 
science, history, and English.  Some people still believe that OBE can be used to advance 
such ends (a good example of OBE, properly utilized, is the current high school 
Advanced Placement exam, in which students do not get credit for their course unless 
they demonstrate proficiency in a rigorous nationwide test).  This explains why 
conservative education reformers like Chester Finn, Jr. have spoken well of cognitively-
based outcomes.<p>

The real concern is when those in the education establishment use OBE to (1) eliminate 
objective measurable criteria (like standardized tests); (2) do away with the traditional 
subject-based curriculum in favor of an emphasis on things like general skills, attitudes 
and behaviors; and (3) advance their own radical social agenda.  Increasingly, OBE is 
applied to the realm of behavior and social attitudes--becoming, in effect, a Trojan Horse 
for social engineering, an elementary and secondary school version of the kind of 
&quot;politically correct&quot; thinking that has infected our colleges and universities.<p>

Outcome-based education raises a number of questions:  what if parents do not want 
their children to view all lifestyles as equal?  What if a young person has developed 
strong personal convictions based on traditional moral standards?  Will students who do 
not give  &quot;appropriate&quot; responses to desired &quot;outcomes&quot; still be allowed to graduate?  It is 
also worth noting that little in the way of public input is sought when it comes to OBE, 
and it offers no method of accountability.<p>


There are some other problems associated with OBE, including:<p>
<ul>
<li>	The &quot;dumbing down&quot; of classes.  Many of the curricula being developed call for 
teachers to wait for all students to understand all aspects of a subject before moving 
on.  Many parents fear that this will penalize more advanced students.

<li>	Traditional education terms are being reinterpreted.  In some programs, <i>cognitive</i> 
now refers to &quot;a belief system,&quot; and <i>critical thinking</i> refers to &quot;a willingness to 
question everything, including one's deepest convictions, beliefs and relationships.&quot;<p>
</ul>
Some of the confusion surrounding outcome-based education is based on semantics.  The 
conservative education reform movement of the 1980s wanted to focus on outcomes (i.e., 
knowledge gained) instead of inputs (i.e., dollars spent).  The aim was to ensure greater 
accountability.  What the education establishment has done is to appropriate the term but 
change the intent.

In short, the &quot;outcomes&quot; increasingly being measured are not based on objective and 
measurable criteria like standardized tests; the state-desired outcome is increasingly 
based on vague, subjective social aims.  Consider some of the vocabulary that surrounds 
OBE:  words like &quot;openness to change,&quot; &quot;appreciation of the global community,&quot; 
&quot;tolerance,&quot; and &quot;higher-order thinking skills.&quot;<p>

There is a big push in the country on behalf of outcome-based education.  But unless 
some means is found to ensure that it serves the traditional aims of sound intellectual and 
moral education, it should be resisted.<p>

<I>The following remarks were delivered at &quot;The New Majority:  Democratic Governance in a Revolutionary Age&quot; conference, hosted by The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation on January 22, 1996.  The conference explored the possibility of political realignment and asked:  Is there a &quot;new majority&quot; taking shape in America and other western-style democracies?  Who is part of the new majority, what are its beliefs - and how is it related to the transition from an industrial to an information-age economy?  Which (if either) American political party is best positioned to represent it?  And, what impact will it have on the 1996 presidential election?

<p>
Many people infer that the title, The New Majority, has something to do with the recent events in the United States Congress, the development of a new majority, a Republican majority, in the House and in the Senate.  While that event in November 1994 certainly is part of the phenomenon we are describing, the new majority that we are talking about here today is in fact a much larger and broader phenomenon.  One of the underlying premises of the work that we do at The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation is the notion that we are in a time of Big Change, the transition from an Industrial Age to an Information Age, and a series of very profound cultural, economic, political and social changes that accompany that.  On the political side, that clearly will involve the creation of new coalitions, not only in politics, not only in America, but around the world.  
<p>
The new majority that we are talking about here today is an Information Age majority.  It is not yet clear which political party will represent that new majority, whether it will be called Republican, Democratic or by some new name.  Indeed, the politics of 1995 as they have played out have not, in my view, and in the view of many of those you will hear today, represented the politics of the new debate.  
<p>
In many ways, the Republican agenda as it's taken shape and been explained on Capitol Hill more resembles the fiscal conservatism of Herbert Hoover than the vision of Newt Gingrich.  By the same token, the Democratic minority on Capitol Hill appears to much better represent the Welfare State, Great Society message of Lyndon Johnson than the visionary speeches of President Clinton.  
<p>
We are in a time of Big Change.  It is a time of opportunity.  It is a time of danger.  Today we discuss what that means in terms of the shape of American politics, its implications for 1996, and its implications beyond.

<p><CENTER><B>Has there Been a Political Revolution?
by Vin Weber<B><SUP>*</SUP> 
</B></B></CENTER>
<p>
All the time I encounter political associates who argue that if such and such a thing happens, the Republican revolution will be over.  If we nominate the wrong presidential candidate or if Bill Clinton gets re-elected or if we don't get the right conclusion to the budget agreement, then the revolution will be over.  
<p>
I'm here to argue that the revolution <I>is</I> over, that we want the revolution to be over, and that we ought to think of the revolution as being over.  To think of an ongoing revolution is a mistake.
<p>
Revolutions are actions that overturn an existing order. Successful revolutions end quickly and then the revolutionaries get on with the business of rebuilding society consistent with the principles that drove the revolution.  I think it is a political mistake for Republicans to continue to talk about revolution.  It may stir the faithful, but it scares the average voter.  And more importantly, I think it misinterprets and incorrectly analyzes what the state of the country politically is and where we are.  Simply put: the revolution is over, we've won, and it's time to think more seriously about rebuilding society consistent with the principles that brought the revolution to power.
<p>
The first question people might ask is have we really won?  After all, Bill Clinton is still President, much of the Contract With America, perhaps most of it, will not become law until there's a change in the presidency, and there's ample reason to believe that we haven't changed the way the country is governed. I think that's all true. Yet, we have experienced a political revolution in the form of a major intellectual and ideological realignment.
<p>
A fundamental change in the way the voters perceive government, it's usefulness, it's ability to interact successfully with them, it's relationship to individual people and communities:  it is in this sense that I would argue that we had a successful revolution and a successful realignment, and we are now going about the business of rebuilding society.  
<p>
The last genuine realignment was in the 1930's, culminating about three decades of political turmoil in the country featuring Progressives and Populists and Bull Moosers and all sorts of other insurgents within the existing two-party order.  In 1933, Eleanor Roosevelt said &quot;One has a feeling of going it blindly because we are in a tremendous stream and none of us knows where we are going to land.&quot;  At the beginning of the great revolution that became known as the New Deal, with a huge mandate from the voters and being the most ideologically oriented person in the Administration, certainly much more so than her husband the President, Eleanor Roosevelt still had this sense that she was in a dark room and didn't really know where to go.  They were making up the New Deal as they went along.  For us to look back today, 60 years later, we could fall into the trap of thinking that this was all very carefully planned from the outset, the building of what we now call the Liberal Welfare State.  
<p>
It's important for us to understand that this wasn't the case.  You found that they made up quite a bit as they went along. Mrs. Roosevelt reflected most of the thinking of the New Deal: lots of optimism and lots of ideas, but not a clear plan in any sense.  They did, however, have a model that made a lot of sense to them and surprisingly that model really came from corporate America.  Some writers have argued only half facetiously that the real father of the New Deal was not Franklin Roosevelt but Henry Ford. Alvin and Heidi Toffler have written about the impact of what Henry Ford and other captains of industry did around the turn of the century in providing a model for the New Dealers when they went into government. Business was in the process of reorganizing and regimenting America, forcing massive population movements from the country into the city, organizing business along the factory model with hierarchically structured corporate organizations. Standardization was the key word.
<p>
The New Deal planners had this model of corporate America that seemed to be the wave of the future. Top down, hierarchical command and control structures, standardization, regimentation organization: That was how successful enterprises were organized.  It followed that government should be organized in the same way. It helped a great deal that President Roosevelt had the twin disasters of the Depression and World War Two to focus the country's attention, but nonetheless part of the process had been going on for some time.  In short, it just made sense to the American people.  By the end of Roosevelt's first term, people really had a new conception of how government should interact with people, and it was consistent with the other changes that they saw taking place around them.
<p>
Their conception of the proper role of government dominated our politics until 1980. It's imperative to recognize that it was not simply one party - although the Democrats benefited proportionally from it - but both parties basically accepted the same premise about how government should approach problem solving. The notion that the country swung back to the Republicans when Eisenhower was elected really is a misreading if you think about what happened.  Eisenhower, and Nixon as well, simply validated the New Deal, liberal welfare state approach to problem solving by embracing it.  Eisenhower was quite specific in office about saying he did not want to go back and repeal the New Deal.  He wanted to invent &quot;modern Republicanism.&quot;  Nixon, when he was in office, established the EPA, OSHA and imposed price controls.  In both cases, they accepted what had become the conventionalism since the successful Roosevelt revolution, which was that Federal Government activity, centrally structured, hierarchically organized, standardized in approach, was the way in which government operated to solve problems. 
<p>
The first President really not to be a part of that consensus was Ronald Reagan.  It's not that he was successful in rolling it back, but he really did not accept those premises and did not try in any way to expand the liberal welfare state as every President, Republican and Democrat alike, had done from Roosevelt up unto Reagan.  	
<p>

Now, to restate my basic point: I believe that a similar realignment in thinking has occurred.  Just as the realignment of our country's thinking that took place in the 1930's had gestated for 30 years or so with the Progressives and the Populists, there's been a long period of gestation and rejection of New Deal, Great Society liberalism today. It began with Barry Goldwater, who challenged the Republican Party's acceptance of those principles, and culminated in Ronald Reagan, who ran a campaign basically against the Welfare State.  
<p>
What confirmed the realignement was not so much the 1994 elections, but the health care debate earlier that year.  After the Clinton health care plan was interred in September of 1994 by <I>The Washington Post</I>, <I>The New York Times</I> and others, it was interesting to watch the analysis from all of the smarter-than-thou people around Washington - people in the media, people in the think tanks, people in politics - all explaining that, of course the Clinton health care plan was doomed from the start because&#133;fill in the blank.  Either because the President put his wife in charge of it, or because Ira Magaziner had never succeeded in anything, and 15 other reasons why.  Yet the amazing thing about the failure of Clinton's health care plan was that it failed.
<p>
It was the first time that a Democrat President, carrying a substantial Congressional majority, running a campaign based on a promise of a tangible benefit to a middle class constituency, addressing a real problem, failed to deliver.  He couldn't deliver not so much because he simply couldn't control or discipline his Congress, but because public support for it collapsed.  Support for Clinton's plan went from 60 percent plus when he initiated it to about 30 percent when it died.  It went from being the issue that many Democrats thought was going to be their key issue in preventing normal mid-term election losses, to the issue that by the last two or three weeks of the campaign Republican strategists were telling their challengers to use against the Democratic incumbent as symbolizing everything that they wanted to be against.  That's a remarkable transformation.
<p>
The more people learned about Clinton's plan, the less they liked it. They didn't like it because it was bureaucratic and costly and centralized and all those things.  So what's new?  Name me a New Deal Great Society program that wasn't attacked by Republican opponents as being bureaucratic, costly and centralized.  The difference is this time it worked.
<p>
The ratification of this revolution in people's thinking is the fact that President Clinton appears to have accepted it.  He has not reinitiated a new health care proposal, nor does Clinton have any other major new Federal initiatives that he's putting before the Congress.  In his 1996 State of the Union message, the President said &quot;the era of big government is over.&quot;  He talked a good deal about foreign policy success, bragged about the health of the economy, threw up a few liberal slogans on Medicare and Medicaid, but we saw no stirring defense of the Department of Commerce, no call for establishing any new Federal agencies.
<p>
That the President is already acting substantially within the parameters of the new context of American politics validates my argument that the revolution has succeeded.  In this regard, Clinton is less today Franklin Roosevelt or his hero, John Kennedy, than he is the Eisenhower of our new realignment, the first Democratic President to essentially govern within the constraints of this newly realigned country, with in the new thinking about the appropriate role for government.
<p>
The challenge, then, is not necessarily one of &quot;keeping the revolution alive,&quot; but to move ahead as quickly and wisely as we can with the rebuilding of society in the wake of the revolution.  That's hard work because although the public has largely rejected New Deal, Great Society, welfare state liberalism or whatever words you want to add to my description of it, there really is no evidence that they want to go back to a pre-New Deal conception of government.
<p>
Yet there is a great risk for Republicans to conclude this realignment is simply a dismantlingly of government. After all, in the 1992 election not too long ago, Democrats won largely on the issue of insufficient government activism. They argued that President Bush had no agenda domestically or economically, and people wanted more activism from their government.  The third party candidate, Perot, did not talk about diminishing or shrinking government, he talked about getting under the hood and fixing government.
<p>
Some pundits think the tension between an electorate seemingly wanting an activist government in 1992 and one wanting to greatly reduce the size of government in 1994 shows and immature and spoiled public. Supposedly voters want lower taxes and less government while demanding solutions to all the social problems like health care and the environment.  Many pundits say that voters can't have it both ways and are going to have to be forced to make a choice.
<p>
I don't think that's the case.  The public is sending a strong, strong signal to politicians that they want a different way of approaching problems, and they're going to be ready to turn politicians out until they find those people or parties that will devise a new solution, a new way of activism.  I don't have all the answers.  I think the outlines are beginning to come into shape somehow, probably more if you look at governors and mayors than at the federal level. Although some people like John Ashcroft and Dan Coats in the United States Senate are already talking very seriously about how to forge a new domestic policy, bringing in non-governmental organizations, churches and others more actively into the solution of some of our social problems.  Certainly at the level of governors and mayors, you find people like Steve Goldsmith in Indianapolis experimenting with new concepts, utilizing privatization, trying to grab a hold of community and tap non-governmental sources to solve problems.
<p>
There is, just as at the beginning of the New Deal, something to be invented today. We are only beginning to see its outlines.  It'll be very clear to people when they look back on it 20 or 30 years from now, but our challenge is to make sure that we get beyond the dismantling of the state and actually think seriously about how we build a conservative opportunity society, something that replaces the liberal welfare state. The party or people that do that will be the majority for another 40 years.

<CENTER><B>Who Is the New Majority?
by Frank Luntz<B><SUP>*</SUP> </B></B></CENTER>
<p> 
It is not an election itself that causes political revolutions.  If you ask Americans today whether they believe that there's been a change since 1994, three out of four would say not.  So if there's been a revolution, you better wake up the American people.  They don't see it.  Even when the Federal government was closed, 88 percent of Americans said it did not affect them at all.
<p>
Yet there is a new majority taking shape in the electorate.  The best way to understand a majority is to understand what the average American is like. 
<p>
She - because men smoke too much, drink too much, work too hard and die too young - is Jennifer Smith.  She's 32.7 years old.  She's white. She comes from European ancestry.  She lives in a mortgaged suburban home that has three bedrooms and a pet and is heated by natural gas.  She likes living there, but she is thinking about moving to something larger.  Jennifer is a happily married mother at least for now.  The strange thing about survey research is that I know she will become unhappy in about three or four years but I don't have the heart to tell her.  She watches about four hours of TV a day between work and raising a family.  She has a high school diploma, perhaps a little bit of college but she does someday hope to get that college degree.  She works in a service job but has higher aspiration.
<p>
Like her husband, John, Jennifer has her own car, and she drives to work alone each day.  There's a direct correlation, by the way, between those that car pool and registration of Democrats and Liberals. So whenever you see a car pool lane, you know that the people driving it are most likely to be Democrats.  Now the difference between her and her husband is that when they both reach a yellow light, she will stop and he will drive right through.  She attends church once a week, although she occasionally misses a week here and there.  She prays quietly to herself almost once a day, and she strongly believes in God.  Even though she feels the American dream is somewhat alive, Jennifer thinks the nation is in serious trouble and that some country other than America will be the number one economic superpower by the year 2020.
<p>
Emotionally, Jennifer is frustrated and anxious, particularly about crime and the economy, but she is less concerned than her husband.  She believes that the federal deficit is spinning out of control, and she thinks that her elected officials waste 48 cents out of every dollar.  She votes only once every four years.  She hates partisan politics and has very little confidence in the Federal government.  She does not trust politicians, and she's skeptical of the media, of lawyers and of the legal system - although she did follow the O. J. Simpson trial virtually every day.  She doesn't know if the two party system is salvageable, nor does she really care.  However, she does believe that her local community is headed in the right direction and she is somewhat optimistic that her own personal situation will improve.  She and her husband are charitable people; they do give more than one percent of their income to charity. They want to help those that are less fortunate, but they simply don't want their tax dollars going to Welfare.  They don't want the charity to come from Washington, to come from a bureaucracy. She's a patient person, but her patience is running out.
<p>
In short, Jennifer Smith believes in our government in abstract principles - democracy and capitalism for example - but she has little confidence in institutions - the Presidency, the Congress or the courts.  She believes in herself, but she wonders whether society will bring her down.  Jennifer and her 263 million compatriots see the American dream slipping out of their grasp and even farther out of the reach of her children.  She doesn't believe the American dream is dead - in fact, only 15 percent of Americans do - but she thinks it's very sick.  
<p>
(The problem that I have in saying that the new majority has won, that the new majority exists today and that it's in the Republican Party, is that the Republican Party has not successfully appealed to Jennifer Smith.)
<p>
That's a demographic look at the average American.  Now I want to give you an attitudinal look, and I want to start with what the new majority rejects because from a public opinion standpoint it is easier to tell you what they are against than to tell you what they are for.  
<p>
They reject the Federal welfare system above all else.  When you talk to a so-called member of the new majority, if you want to see the emotion and the passion, it doesn't come from a balanced budget.  It doesn't come even from crime.  What makes them really spitting angry - where they start to use four letter words -is the welfare system, how destructive it is, how unfair it is, how vicious it is, and how they want to eliminate it. If there's one great opportunity that Republicans have in 1996, it's to tie the welfare system around President Clinton's neck and sink him with it.  It's like lead boots that the so-called wise guys used to use on informants when they would throw them off some beach down south of Miami.  The welfare system is that around President Clinton's neck.  
<p>
What next makes members of the new majority most angry is the public school system, with increasing Federal control, mediocrity and the fact that there seems to be more bureaucracy to it.  They're angry at a Federal tax code that is anti-work, anti-investments, anti-savings and, when you talk to middle class, anti-success.  They reject the expense of Federal bureaucracy.  It seems to serve its own interest, and what freaked them out is something that came out of a David Letterman routine when he made the comment: &quot;If 80 percent of our Federal workers are non-essential, doesn't that send us a message?&quot; The one thing that I don't understand is why we Republicans did not draw the line back in December and say if they're not essential, why are they here, and if they're not working, why are we paying them? How many of you, if you don't come to work because there's a furlough, if you're not producing day after day and you're out of work for two weeks, three weeks, how many of your bosses or you yourself will get paid?  What are we doing paying people not to work?  It's insanity, and a new majority does not understand that.
<p>
The new majority rejects Federal regulatory-structure red tape.  They do not understand why it takes them so long to fill out forms, why it seems like the government is against them, why a small business can be shut down by OSHA if their toilet paper is one-quarter of an inch too high or too low.  They reject the legal system that has become the most expensive in the world and the most embarrassing at home.  They reject the anti-family mind set that permeates almost all of Washington's social, tax and welfare policies. They reject a government that can't even keep them safe. They reject the Washington ethic that encourages dependency and victimization:  Everyone in America seems to be a victim; It wasn't those poor Mendez brothers fault that they went in and gunned down their parents; They actually went out and reloaded so they could shoot again;  It wasn't their fault; It was society's fault, society to blame.  And, they reject the $5 trillion federal debt that is eroding America's ability to save and invest.
<p>
If there is a new majority, than current politicians, if they wish to succeed, must find a way to communicate to these people, to address their concerns, and not to play in this rhetorical game that we've been in right now. The Republican party is losing this budget debate, and if you think otherwise, then I don't know what TV shows you're watching.  Every day, from Leon Panetta to Donna Shalala, from Robert Reich to George Stephanopolis, they talk about values in the Clinton Administration.  They talk about principles.  They talk about being pro-family, pro-community, and even the President talks about spirituality.  What do Republicans do?  They talk about numbers, and fight over the nuts and bolts.  Any party that wants to lead the new majority cannot do that.  You cannot communicate in trillions and billions when the new majority understands things in hundreds and maybe if it's a mortgage in thousands.
<p>

The central questions the new majority wants answered is:  How many of you believe that you have a better quality of life today than your parents did when they were your age?  And how many of you honestly believe that your children will have a better quality of life than you when they reach your age? 

<p>
Why do so many people answer yes to the first question but not the latter? We have to understand why so many hands went up to the first question and so few hands went up to the second question. If the Republicans are to lead that new majority, as I certainly hope they are, because I don't believe in a third party, then the Republican Party has to communicate to all of you who said yes to the first question but not to the second.

<CENTER><B>Where is American Public Opinion Headed?
by Andrew Kohut<B><SUP>*</SUP> 
</B></B></CENTER><p>

If there's a revolution going on, it's not with the American public. We just see no indication that public opinion is in a revolutionary state.  It's certainly changing.  It's more evolving than being in a state of revolution.
<p>
We've been measuring basic political values since 1987.  Each year we do a major national survey and we ask people about how they feel about the government, the national economy and a whole range of social issues.  We see two persistent trends since 1987: less support or more suspicion of political leaders and more cynicism about the way the political system works, and less support for government solutions to national problems.  Consistently, each of our seven or eight measures which attempt to find out how much support there is for government solutions has shown an erosion of support since the mid-1980's.  In 1987, perhaps the average percentage of our samples saying they supported government solutions was at the 70 percent level.  It's slowly eroded to the 60 or 55 level, but it's still there.  
<p>
There is still clear majority support for Federal government solutions to help the poor, to provide a social safety net, to improve the environment, to deal with the problems of education and to deal with a wide variety of problems.  People no longer look to government to solve new problems.  Bureaucracy is in fact a dirty word, and government is seen more than ever as a court of last resort, but it is indeed seen as a court of last resort, and the American public doesn't want to see it go away. 
<p>
Looking at the past 12 months, what we see most clearly is that the public thinks that the new Republican majority on the Hill is cutting government too fast and too far.  They want welfare reform and they want government reform.  They want government changed, but they don't want to see it go away.  Whether they're correct in their perception, they think that the Republicans are going to do away with government to too great an extent.
<p>

I think the most important thing to recognize about American public opinion besides this discontent with the way government works, but still not a total disconnection from it altogether, is that we're in a cycle.  There's always been a change in the American public opinion between wanting the government to solve problems and not liking government, and when the emphasis is on the problems, then the American public doesn't pay a lot of attention to how inefficiently the Government works, or the downside to Government activity.  
<p>
The emphasis now is not on the problems.  People aren't up in arms about the problems of the poor.  The environment is a concern, but it's not a top concern.  The issues that are paramount to people aren't the kinds of things that were the case in the late 1960's and early 1970's when government programs really grew.  Therefore, there's much greater attention to the shortcomings of government activity and the discontents that have been mentioned here.  But the public has in no way in my view walked away from government.  It still wants government to do things that can't be done by the private sector or people can't do themselves, and the American public continues to feel that if all else fails the government should help solve problems - certainly not in the free form way that the American public felt 20 years ago, but nonetheless it's there.
<p>
The most important thing about the new electorate as we have measured it is not so much the left and the right - which are more clearly etched and defined than 10 years ago - but the fact that the middle has become what we describe it in our latest topology as the detached center, because it is so disconnected in terms of ideological thinking and political thinking from the left to the right.  The detachment isn't so much from political belief as it is from political system. The typical American is a high-school educated, middle-aged woman with no connection to the Republican Party or the Democratic Party and has very contradictory views about governance and issues of strong support of the environment, suspicious about higher taxes, worries about government yet a believer in social welfare.  So when I said there's no makings of a revolution in American public opinion, the nature of that political thinking is not revolutionary in the sense except in its detachment from the two political parties.

Candidates and elected officials began taking the pledge in 1986. After President Reagan's Tax Reform Act of 1986 was passed,
many taxpayers feared that some politicians would raise income tax rates. With President Reagan's support and endorsement,
Americans for Tax Reform and a broad-based coalition of groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National
Federation of Independent Businesses and hundreds of taxpayer groups throughout the nation began to ask all candidates for
public office to "take the pledge." Every year, all Members of Congress are asked to take the pledge by Americans for Tax
Reform, and all challengers are asked to take the pledge during each election cycle. 



<P>
<blockquote><blockquote>     I, ________, pledge to the taxpayers of the _____ District of the State of _______, and to the American people that I will:<P>

     ONE, Oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses; and

<h3>DEFENDING AMERICA: ENDING AMERICA'S VULNERABILITY TO BALLISTIC MISSILES</h3>


An Update by the Missile Defense Study Team ("Team B")<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder No. 1074<br>
March 15, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
<a href="bg1074t1.gif">Table 1</a>: Recommended Funding for Missile Defense Systems
<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1995, The Heritage Foundation convened a Missile Defense Study Team to examine the growing threat of ballistic missiles armed with weapons of mass destruction -- nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. The Missile Defense Study Team, known as "Team B," released its report <I>Defending America: A Near- and Long-Term Plan to Deploy Missile Defenses</I>, in June 1995, recommending timely, affordable, and technically sound responses to the missile threat, in keeping with the congressional leadership's high priority on ballistic missile defense.<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Subsequent events have only reinforced the importance of Team B's recommendations that an effective ballistic missile defense system be deployed at the earliest possible date. In fact, the need for a vigorous missile defense program is more acute than ever. Ballistic missiles carrying mass destructive warheads remain the only weapons that can seriously threaten the territory of the United States. Shorter range or theater ballistic missiles (TBMs) also threaten U.S. forces and bases abroad, and allies in key regions of the world, as potentially hostile states continue to develop weapons of mass destruction and seek to acquire missiles to deliver them.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In February 1991, an Iraqi Scud missile killed 29 American soldiers in Dharan, Saudi Arabia, the largest single loss of American life in the Persian Gulf War. Yet five years later, the U.S. still has no better defense against theater ballistic missiles than the <I>Patriot</I>. To be sure, the <I>Patriot</I> did good service in the Gulf War, helping to neutralize the potential impact of Iraq's Scud arsenal. But it was designed originally as an air defense, not an anti-missile system, and its ability to defend a wide area or population center from ballistic missile attack was deliberately limited.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The U.S. still has no defense whatsoever against intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), contrary to what most Americans believe. If an ICBM were launched at the United States today -- by accident or design -- there is not a single thing the U.S. military could do to stop the warhead or multiple warheads from reaching their targets and killing hundreds of thousands, possibly millions, of Americans. In 1983, President Reagan began the Strategic Defense Initiative to end this utter vulnerability to the world's most terrible weapons. Yet the nation is no better protected from missile attack in 1996 than it was in 1983. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Team B considered this needless vulnerability in the context of the missile threat to the American people and to their forces, bases, and allies overseas. Team B concluded, unlike the Clinton Administration, that the threat is clear, present, and growing; and that it demands an urgent response.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As the least expensive and most effective solution to this global problem, <I>Defending America</I> recommended accelerated deployment of global wide-area defenses -- at sea within the next three to four years and in space by early in the next decade. These initiatives would restore key ballistic missile defense programs that the Clinton Administration sharply curtailed or canceled in 1993. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A year after the release of the Team B study, the United States remains undefended despite the best efforts of some Members of the 104th Congress -- and will likely remain undefended if the Administration's current policies prevail. Because missile defense remains a vital but unfulfilled national security requirement, The Heritage Foundation asked Team B to reconvene and take a look at what the Clinton Administration and Congress have done -- or failed to do -- to defend America. Team B has revalidated its basic approach of 1995, but also has concluded that the lack of progress in protecting Americans from ballistic missiles warrants this updated report in conjunction with the reissue of <I>Defending America</I>. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Consequently, The Heritage Foundation is reissuing the Team B report along with this update, which reviews events of the past year that affect the missile defense effort, analyzes the negative impact of recent Clinton Administration missile defense program decisions, and discusses in more detail the Clinton Administration's negotiations with Russia on re-interpreting the ABM Treaty and extending the Treaty's limits to key theater defense systems.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In this update, Team B offers a number of new recommendations to adjust to delays and negative developments in the missile defense program in the past year. The main conclusions are summarized as follows: 
<p><ul>
<li> Congress, and the U.S. Senate in particular, should seek ways to remove the obstacles to effective missile defenses posed by the ABM Treaty, including possible withdrawal from the treaty as the U.S. is entitled to do under Article XV.
<P>
<li> Congress should forego development of ground-based systems for national missile defense and accelerate deployment of sea-based, wide-area defenses. Without artificial performance constraints or limits imposed by the ABM Treaty, this system could counter threats against the U.S. homeland as well as regional threats from theater missiles, beginning by the year 2000. 
<p>

<li> Congress should accelerate the deployment of space-based sensors to enhance the effectiveness of both theater and national missile defense.
<p>
<li> Congress should direct the Air Force to develop follow-on space-based defenses, both kinetic energy interceptors and space-based lasers, to begin deployment early in the next decade. 
<p>
<li> Congress should ensure the Ballistic Missile Defense Office develops an integrated but open architecture for battle management, command, control, and communications to support missile defense systems.
</ul><p>
<b>WHAT TEAM B PROPOSED IN 1995</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1995, The Heritage Foundation Missile Defense Study Team proposed improvements or renewed emphasis in several missile defense program areas, in particular:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>Sea-Based Wide-Area Defense.</b> Because the Navy already has invested almost $50 billion in its AEGIS cruisers and their infrastructure, modifications or modernization of the software, battle management system, and interceptors for the missile defense mission would cost only about $1 billion. The U.S. could then begin deploying defenses on AEGIS-equipped naval vessels by the end of this decade. For an investment of $2-3 billion, 650 defensive interceptors on 22 AEGIS cruisers could be at sea by 2001, achieving a limited global missile defense capability for the U.S. and for American forces and allies overseas. Team B pointed out that these highly mobile platforms could defend Americans in all 50 states from a limited long-range missile strike, as well as defend American troops and allies overseas, provided the full technological capability of the Navy missile defense system was not arbitrarily constrained or artificially compromised.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>Brilliant Eyes Sensor System.</b> Team B recommended accelerating the <I>Brilliant Eyes</I> space-based sensor to begin deployment by as early as 1999. This system would enhance the capability of all wide-area defense interceptor systems, wherever based.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>Space-Based Defenses.</b> Team B recommended reviving space-based defense programs canceled by the Clinton Administration to provide deployment options beginning early in the next decade. This approach would be the most effective long-term defense to protect the American homeland and to counter advanced theater ballistic missiles.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>ABM Treaty Limits.</b> Team B also recommended that defenses for America and American troops, bases, and allies overseas be built without arbitrarily restraining systems to comply with the outdated ABM Treaty. Codifying the Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD) strategy of the Cold War, the ABM Treaty no longer makes sense in a multipolar world of proliferating nuclear powers.
<P>
<b>THE CLINTON RECORD ON MISSILE DEFENSE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Team B members are dismayed at the extent to which the Administration has undermined the ability of the United States to defend itself against the growing threat posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles. It is a widely acknowledged characteristic of President Clinton and officials in his Administration that they say one thing and do another. Nowhere is this disingenuousness more evident than the Administration's position on weapons of mass destruction and their principal delivery systems -- ballistic missiles. 
<p>
<b>The Administration's Declaratory Policy</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
On November 14, 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12938, declaring in part that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering such weapons constitutes "an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States," and that he therefore had decided to "declare a national emergency to deal with that threat."  A year later, on November 15, 1995, he issued a notice of the continuation of this "Emergency Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction."  This is a clear and indisputable evaluation of the immediate danger to the U.S. and its interests posed by "the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and the means of delivering such systems."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite this clear and unequivocal statement of U.S. policy, President Clinton vetoed the FY 1996 Defense Authorization Act on December 28, 1995. This legislation contained missile defense provisions intended specifically to meet the threat from the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile delivery systems. President Clinton based his veto primarily on his objection to the missile defense language in the Act, which called for defending all 50 American states by early in the next decade. According to the President, this would be a "costly defense system" against a threat that the "intelligence community does not foresee in the coming decade."  His veto message asserted that the missile defense provisions would "also jeopardize our efforts to agree on an ABM/TMD demarcation with the Russian Federation." 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Defense Secretary William Perry said on September 20, 1994, when announcing the results of the Clinton Administration's nuclear posture review, that his "number one priority is to put MAD (Mutual Assured Destruction) behind us for good, to replace it with Mutual Assured Safety."  But on May 10, 1995, President Clinton joined Russian President Boris Yeltsin in declaring the ABM Treaty -- which is based on MAD -- a "cornerstone of strategic stability."  Indeed, the Clinton Administration's theological commitment to the ABM Treaty is so strong that it refuses to exploit U.S. technological advantages to build the most effective defenses -- which are also the least costly defenses -- to protect the American people and their overseas troops, friends, and allies.
<p>
<b>More Administration Inconsistency</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Secretary Perry is as inconsistent as his commander in chief. On January 31, 1996, he told the Hoover Institution Board of Overseers that "we are pursuing, in my judgment, robustly, vigorously, a so-called theater missile defense program [which] will give us the capability of defending U.S. forces and U.S. allies against medium-range ballistic missiles. We are moving toward deployment -- the production and deployment of this system on a high-priority schedule where the first of the new generation of such defenses will begin their deployment in a few years."  In a press conference on February 16, the Secretary announced the results of a six-month Pentagon review of plans to defend the American people and their troops, friends, and allies overseas, stating: "I have no higher obligation as Secretary of Defense than to protect our forces and our territory. This program responds to threats as they develop, combines current and evolving technology to face today's threat and will enable us to develop new technologies to face tomorrow's threat from longer range missiles."<sup>2 </sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Nevertheless, the content if not the rhetoric of the February 16 announcement was contrary to the clear intent of Congress, which last year increased the Administration's budget request for missile defense and directed that key programs be accelerated.<sup>3</sup>  Instead, the Clinton Administration has decided to slow these programs while cutting 15 percent from its previously planned budget -- a budget that already had been cut by about 60 percent below the missile defense plan of the Bush Administration.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Defense experts who were not misled by the responsible-sounding statements in Mr. Perry's February 16 press briefing realize that even the Administration's vaunted commitment to theater missile defense is highly questionable. Secretary Perry announced cuts in funding for both the Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) and the Navy's AEGIS-based wide-area defense and proposed to delay deployment for both indefinitely -- in spite of congressional direction to deploy these two systems by 1999. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Furthermore, the Administration has decided to delay for at least three years a decision to deploy any defense of the American people, a delay that will most likely prove to be indefinite if the Clinton Administration continues in office beyond January 1997. The Administration has canceled or sharply curtailed development of the most effective, least expensive defenses. It is even stretching out development of the programs it is supporting, thereby increasing total system costs. It has reoriented the theater defense programs to the least capable systems, providing only limited protection to overseas troops, friends, and allies and denying the American people the inherent capability that would be afforded by fully exploiting modern technology.<sup>4</sup>  Similarly, deployment of <I>Brilliant Eyes</I> space sensors was delayed at least six months while the Administration reviewed how to proceed. In short, the net effect of the Clinton Administration's policies and statements is to undermine deployment of effective theater and national missile defenses.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These developments, apparent from the headlines of press reports from the briefing given on the Friday afternoon before a long holiday weekend,<sup>5</sup> are at sharp variance with last year's Team B report, which concluded that the threat is clear, present and growing. The factual evidence presented in <I>Defending America</I> demonstrated in particular that worldwide defenses against longer range missiles are urgently needed to counter blackmail threats that could limit U.S. involvement in future regional crises involving U.S. national interests. This kind of blackmail was illustrated recently when a Chinese official threatened to destroy Los Angeles if the U.S. interfered with China's feud with Taiwan.<sup>6</sup>  And on March 8, 1996, China conducted missile firing tests offshore near Taiwan's two largest cities as part of an ongoing campaign to intimidate Taiwan. These missile "tests" amounted to a <I>de facto</I> blockade, and further dramatized the use of ballistic missiles as weapons of coercive diplomacy as well as weapons of war.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The incoherence of the Administration's position on missile defense is further revealed by its handling of theater defenses, which it continues to claim are "first priority."  Seeking funds in a shrinking defense budget to offset shortfalls in other procurement accounts, the Administration is slowing its own theater defense program on the grounds that there is no imminent threat.<sup>7</sup>  Yet America's top commander in South Korea, General Gary Luck, asked that the THAAD (Theater High Altitude Area Defense) system be expedited to replace the Patriot system in light of growing tensions with North Korea. But General John Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, justified turning down General Luck and delaying THAAD because, in his view, there is no new threat from North Korean missiles.<sup>8</sup>  Also, U.N. inspectors fear that an Iraqi missile program exposed last year is more extensive than previously thought and could enable Saddam Hussein to fire chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons at targets up to 2,000 miles away -- which would include all of the capitals of Europe.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The need for wide-area defenses -- surpassing the capability of THAAD -- could not be clearer. Short-range interceptors like <I>Patriot</I> and the Navy Lower Tier emphasized by the Clinton Administration will be ineffective against 2,000-mile-range ballistic missiles. They will have difficulty defeating even the Gulf War Scud, which broke up on reentry and became very hard to hit as its warhead "cork-screwed" its way toward the Earth. Neither of these theater systems currently being pursued by the Clinton Administration will be at all effective against missiles that release their warheads shortly after their boost phase, while they are rising in rocket-powered flight from their launchers. Yet there are reports that such missiles might be developed and "on the world market within the next five years."<sup>10</sup>  Thus, the missile threat demonstrably continues to grow and the Clinton Administration continues to resist committing the needed resources to protect the American people, their forward-deployed forces, and their allies. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Clearly, the Clinton Administration's relaxed view of the threat and its inconsistent actions on missile defense are neither prudent nor responsible. It has become regrettably clear that the Clinton Administration cannot be relied upon to carry out its own stated policy. The President has created a political environment in which words mean nothing, in which the Administration's policy declarations merely conceal the failure to protect Americans against ballistic missiles. The Administration's actions over the past year demonstrate that the American people cannot depend upon the executive branch to fulfill its chief constitutional duty -- to provide for the common defense -- even though the missile threat continues to grow.
<p>
<b>ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENTS SINCE THE 1995 TEAM B REPORT</b>
<p>
<b>The President's Veto of the Defense Authorization Bill</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In crafting the missile defense provisions of the FY 1996 defense authorization bill, the congressional defense committees focused on limited, ABM Treaty-compliant, ground-based systems for the homeland defense mission. Team B recognizes that staunch supporters of missile defense in Congress chose to focus on ground-based defenses in order to garner the majority needed to pass the defense authorization bill. It was a tactical judgment call designed to "move the ball forward" toward actual deployment of National Missile Defense (NMD), even if only a few yards, and the bill as passed did direct the Clinton Administration to deploy, early in the next decade, a defense for the American homeland.<sup>11</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But on December 28, 1995, President Clinton vetoed the bill precisely because it mandated defending the American people by early in the next decade. The majority that had coalesced around a less than optimum NMD program was not sufficient to override the President's veto, and Congress was forced to strip out the offending section so that the defense authorization bill could be signed into law.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While this was a severe setback for the defense of the United States, at least it clarified the missile defense debate. It is now clear that the Clinton Administration and the majority of the Democrats in Congress, who would not vote to override the veto, are willing to risk leaving the American people vulnerable to attack by even a single ballistic missile.
<p>
<b>"Explaining Away" the Need for Missile Defense</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration argues that there is no ballistic missile threat to the American homeland and that there will be sufficient warning to build needed defenses before such a threat develops. In line with these assumptions, the Administration has structured a National Missile Defense Deployment Readiness Program. Over the next three years, it would develop components of an ABM Treaty-compliant ground-based defense which, in turn, could be deployed in another three years if, in the President's view, developments warrant it. It therefore intends to provide no defense for the American people before 2003 at the earliest. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yet American cities can be destroyed today by Russian and Chinese missiles. One wonders whether the Clinton Administration believes it is "politically incorrect" to call attention to such possibilities. Furthermore, authoritative Administration officials testified to Congress last year that rogue states could threaten U.S. cities with long-range missile attack in three to five years -- or sooner if they chose to accelerate their development plans.<sup>12</sup>  Several Senators and Congressmen have expressed concern that the Clinton Administration politicized a recent National Intelligence Estimate so as to suggest a lesser threat to the United States than indicated in this previous testimony.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
<b>The ABM Treaty -- or an ABM/TMD Treaty?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Last year Team B recommended an honest appraisal of the impediments to effective missile defense, including theater defense, posed by the 1972 ABM Treaty. To its great credit, the congressional leadership has sought throughout the past year to prevent Clinton negotiators from negotiating arbitrary constraints on theater missile defense systems that were never supposed to be limited by the ABM Treaty.<sup>14</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But the Clinton Administration appears committed to "strengthening" this treaty. In talks to determine the demarcation between permitted theater defenses and ABM Treaty-limited strategic defenses, the Administration reportedly has accepted the Russian demand to limit the performance of the most promising theater defenses, including the Navy wide-area system. Only Russian recalcitrance and over-reaching in seeking greater restraints on theater missile defense have prevented consummation of the agreement and converting the ABM Treaty into an ABM-TMD treaty. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In demonstrating such a slavish adherence to a narrow interpretation of the ABM Treaty, the Administration in effect is binding the U.S. unilaterally to perceived rather than real treaty constraints. This theological devotion to the treaty has resulted in deliberate "dumbing down" of theater defense designs rather than making the systems as capable as available technology will permit. For example, the Navy wide-area defense is not being designed to exploit high velocity interceptors or external sensor data to maximize its reach, because that capability also would enable the system to defend the United States.<sup>15</sup>  The THAAD system is not being allowed to use any external sensor data to extend its reach and effectiveness.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite the President's promise to "work closely with the Congress," he has largely ignored the concerns of Congress in favor of accommodating Russian demands to limit U.S. missile defenses through a renegotiated ABM Treaty. But Members of Congress are becoming increasingly disturbed at the Administration's position. Late last year, Representative Martin Hoke (R-OH) introduced a bill directing the Administration to exercise its rights to withdraw from the ABM Treaty,<sup>16</sup> though it has not yet been debated. More recently, Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC), introduced a similar bill in the Senate.<sup>17</sup> 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 With these bills pending, the stage is set for hearings and a serious debate in both the Senate and the House on these issues vital to the nation's security. If the Administration expands the ABM Treaty to cover advanced theater systems and also agrees to "multi-lateralize" the treaty by including the states of the former Soviet Union, it will be making substantive changes in the treaty. These changes must come before the Senate for its consent. Otherwise, the Senate's constitutional prerogatives in treaty-making will be undermined, as will national security.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It has become manifestly clear that no effective defense of the American people can be built consistent with ABM Treaty limits. And if the Administration has its way, no highly effective theater defense will be built either. The Administration has shown clearly that it prefers defending the Treaty to defending Americans.
<p>
<b>TEAM B RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 1997</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Team B believes the congressional leadership, having made clear its fundamental differences with the Administration, should press for deployment of the least expensive, most effective near-term defenses technically achievable. Moreover, Team B concludes that the ABM Treaty must be dealt with in a manner consistent with these primary objectives. Recommendations to meet the latest developments are to:
<p><ul>
<li> Review the Clinton Administration's ballistic missile threat assessment and direct a more prudent approach to accelerate the development of appropriate responses;
<p>
<li> Review the role of the ABM Treaty in artificially limiting the development of the most effective defenses now technologically feasible and direct that the most effective, affordable near-term defenses be developed unconstrained by the ABM Treaty and then deployed at an accelerated pace;
<p>
<li> Use all available congressional powers and prerogatives to move the U.S. toward withdrawal from the ABM Treaty after giving six months' notice, which it has the right to do under Article XV;
<p>
<li> Redirect last year's consensus objective of deploying ground-based U.S. homeland defenses by 2003 and focus it instead on beginning deployment of sea-based wide-area defenses by the year 2000, unconstrained by the ABM Treaty;
<p>
<li> Direct the Air Force to accelerate deployment of <I>Brilliant Eyes</I> space-based sensors beginning as early as 1999, to enhance the effectiveness of both theater and U.S. homeland defenses;
<p>
<li> Direct the Air Force to develop follow-on space-based defenses -- both kinetic-energy interceptors and space-based lasers -- for deployment early in the next decade;
<p>
<li> Direct the Army to focus its efforts on developing and deploying ground-based theater missile defenses to support overseas U.S. troops and allies; restore the $2 billion recently removed by the Administration from the multi-year THAAD budget; and re-establish 2000 as the initial deployment date;
<p>
<li> Direct the Ballistic Missile Defense Office to assure development of an integrated but open architecture for the battle management, command, control, and communications to support these defense systems.
</ul><p>
<b>Revised Spending Plan</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress's failure to override the President's veto of the FY 1996 defense bill demonstrates the futility of pursuing relatively expensive yet less effective ground-based national missile defenses in the hope of getting at least some anti-missile protection deployed. Team B believes Congress instead should direct the accelerated development and deployment of the most effective sea-based and space-based wide-area defenses. Developing a boost-phase intercept capability with these and other systems also should be a high priority. These systems also will defend American forces and allies abroad, reducing the requirements for ground-based theater missile defenses.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This approach will require that missile defense funds, including those already appropriated and those currently being applied to the Clinton Administration's so-called 3+3 Deployment Readiness Program, be spent instead on sea- and space-based defense programs. The highest priority should be assigned to deploying the Navy wide-area defense beginning in the year 2000. This would provide the earliest U.S. homeland defense. Evolutionary improvements to increase its effectiveness should occur as the relevant technologies mature. This is needed to maximize the system's ability to protect the U.S. homeland. Second, the development of space-based sensors and space-based defenses, both kinetic-energy interceptors and lasers, should be revived and accelerated. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<a href="bg1074t1.gif">Table 1</a> provides recommended funding levels, including additional funds in 1996 which can be accommodated by reprogramming funds already appropriated under the National Missile Defense program element from ground-based defenses to sea- and space-based defenses. (The recommended funding is consistent with last year's Team B report, given that six months of FY 1996 already have been lost.)
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As discussed in last year's Team B report, the out-year funding needed for space-based systems will depend on development activities during the next three years. However, Team B continues to believe that the two space-based defense systems are complementary. In fact, for a given effectiveness against advanced threats, it can be shown that the least expensive space-based defense involves both. With the necessary funding, deployment can begin shortly after the year 2000. For planning purposes consistent with this objective, Team B recommends that $1.6 billion, $2.4 billion, and $3 billion, respectively, be budgeted for 1999, 2000, and 2001.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This recommendation to forego continued commitment to a ground-based defense for protection of the U.S. homeland is intended to address the inherent shortcomings of ground-based systems discussed in the 1995 Team B report. In short, they can be overcome by likely countermeasures, they are expensive, and they are difficult to deploy in peacetime -- even more so in crisis or war. The Clinton Administration suggests that a very limited "ABM Treaty compliant" single site defense might cost less than $5 billion.<sup>18</sup>  Team regards this as a waste of scarce missile defense dollars. Such a significant expenditure of funds on relatively ineffective ground-based defenses will only delay building urgently needed, more effective, and less expensive sea-based and space-based defenses. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Team B recommends that FY 1996 funds for National Missile Defense (NMD) be redirected from the ground-based NMD program now planned toward accelerating more effective and less expensive sea-based and space-based wide area defense programs. Future NMD funds should be directed toward providing evolutionary technical improvements to the initial Navy wide-area defense system in order to give it the most capable performance against the full spectrum of future threats to the United States. The NMD budget line should also include about $150 million per year to continue programs to defeat countermeasures and support critical sensor programs that will enhance the midcourse intercept capability of all defenses.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The recommended funding for the technology line would restore key efforts against likely countermeasures. The most important countermeasure anticipated in the relatively near future is a "clustered submunition" that disperses numerous warheads shortly after a missile's boost phase is completed. This countermeasure would overcome the limited theater missile defenses currently being developed by the Clinton Administration. To defeat it would require a boost-phase defense -- that is, destroying the entire missile/warhead package before the submunitions can be released. But all boost-phase defenses that could be deployed in the near term were canceled by the Clinton Administration in 1993. Restoring them therefore should receive high priority. The funding recommended above should be sufficient for a technology demonstration within three years of a high-acceleration boost-phase interceptor like the <I>Raptor Talon</I> concept.
<p>
<b>The Final Hurdle: The ABM Treaty</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Team B again recommends that Congress do all within its power to restrain the Clinton Administration's penchant for negotiating additional treaty limits on U.S. defenses. Instead, the U.S. should indicate clearly to the Russians that the U.S. intends to provide effective wide area defenses for the American people and their overseas troops, friends, and allies -- and that it would prefer to do so with Russia's agreement. However, the U.S. should be explicitly clear that unless Russia begins to cooperate immediately, it will exercise its right to withdraw from the ABM Treaty and proceed to build defenses unilaterally.<sup>19</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It should be obvious to any competent U.S. negotiator that the Russians will agree only if they believe that the U.S. is prepared to proceed unilaterally. The best way to move in this direction is to announce that the strategic situation has changed significantly since the ABM Treaty was negotiated in 1972 and that, because the new world disorder presents a number of potential threats to America's supreme interests, the U.S. intends to withdraw from the ABM Treaty. If the treaty no longer serves America's national security interests, the U.S. has every right to withdraw, and this right is made clear in Article XV. Once this step is taken the U.S. should proceed to build the effective defenses recommended above as quickly as possible.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration refuses to give serious consideration to building an effective missile defense program, whether to protect the U.S. homeland or U.S. troops abroad. Team B continues to recommend that global defenses be deployed urgently -- initially from the sea and then from space. These are the least expensive and most effective defenses possible, and the U.S. can begin their deployment by the end of the decade if it has the political will to do so. As Team B concluded in 1995, the ultimate issue in the missile defense debate is not technology, nor even cost, but political will.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The test of the nation's political will to defend itself -- and a test of the U.S. Senate's determination to defend its constitutional prerogatives -- will be in dealing with the 1972 ABM Treaty. Some in Congress and the defense community believe the ABM Treaty is not a near-term problem; they think dealing with the treaty can be deferred to some distant future. But they are wrong. The ABM Treaty is stifling the development of today's most capable and effective defense systems and perpetuating the vulnerability of the American people and their troops, bases, and allies overseas. Continuing to appease the Russians in ABM Treaty negotiations delays U.S. efforts to build needed defenses, and may permanently impair American interests. Team B believes that U.S. supreme interests are threatened by realities that are fundamentally different from those of the Cold War. The time has come for the U.S. to exercise its Article XV right and, as a matter of supreme national interest, withdraw from the ABM Treaty and build the needed defenses.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution confers on the U.S. Congress the power and the duty to "provide for the common Defence."  This entails the raising, support, and regulation of the nation's armed forces. In other words, Congress shares the responsibility for national security with the President, the commander in chief. This shared but direct responsibility for the security of the nation is an important element of the constitutional system of checks and balances.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration continues to keep Americans vulnerable while hiding behind a smokescreen of positive sounding but meaningless policy declarations. It is now clear that the Clinton Administration will remain derelict in the duties required of the office of the commander in chief by failing to provide for the common defense. Congress must fulfill its constitutional duty to check the excesses of the executive branch. It must stop the improper attempts to broaden the ABM Treaty and counterbalance the executive's dereliction of duty by pressing for the most capable and effective missile defense technology permits. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Someday soon, it is a near certainty that U.S. forces abroad, and possibly even the U.S. homeland, will come under ballistic missile attack. Such an attack may occur with missiles carrying chemical, biological, or nuclear warheads. If that day comes, the American people will hold responsible all those in positions of public trust who failed to carry out their constitutional and moral duty.

<li>    It is commonly though incorrectly assumed that the technology is most mature for ground-based defenses because such defenses have been under development longest, and that such defenses are the least expensive. In fact, effective wide-area defenses can be deployed sooner at sea and in space. Contrary to conventional wisdom, advances in technology have been flowing from research on space-based systems to ground-based systems, not the other way around. Finally, as discussed in the 1995 Team B report, sea-based and space-based defenses would be far less expensive and more effective in providing the needed wide-area defensive coverage.<p>
<li>    See Senate Select Committee on Intelligence news release, "Senate Intelligence Committee Releases Unclassified Intelligence Assessments," May 1, 1995.<p>
<li>    Senator Jon Kyl (R-AZ) discussed his misgivings with the "new" NIE in a January 18, 1996, speech at an AIAA conference in Monterey, California (mimeograph). See also Rowan Scarborough and Bill Gertz, "Missile-Threat Report 'Politicized,' GOP Says," <I>The Washington Times</I>, January 30, 1996, p.

 <li>   Over the past year, at least seven letters from the congressional leadership have directed the Clinton Administration to cease its efforts to limit theater and U.S. homeland defenses and to "multilateralize" the ABM Treaty -- even to halt the negotiations that seem determined to proceed in this direction despite repeated statements of congressional concern. See, for example, Bill Gertz, "Deal With Russia Could Hamper Missile Defenses," <I>The Washington Times</I>, December 4, 1995. In one of the most recent letters, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, House Speaker Newt Gingrich, and 12 chairmen of defense and foreign affairs committees and subcommittees wrote President Clinton on February 12, 1996, expressing their strong objections to continuing negotiations with Russia that "will impede our ability to defend America and its interests" and indicating their intent to hold related hearings in the near future.<p>
<li>    Then Deputy Defense Secretary John Deutch explained to the Navy League on April 13, 1995, that the Clinton Administration's version of the Navy Upper Tier -- or wide area -- defense was treaty-compliant because it was constrained to use only data from the SPY-1 radar co-located with its interceptors. See Bill Gertz, "Navy Missile Defense Shouldn't Be Issue In Talks," <I>The Washington Times</I>, April 14, 1995, p. A3. What he did not reveal was that this constraint, especially in conjunction with the interceptor velocity limits being discussed with the Russians, limits the Navy system's effectiveness as a theater defense system and precludes it from having a capability to defend the U.S.<p>
 <li>  Kerry Gildee, "Bill Introduced in House Calls for U.S. to Abandon ABM Treaty," <I>Defense Daily</I>, October 18, 1995, p. 77.<p>
<li>   Bill Gertz, "Helms Wants U.S. Out of ABM Treaty," <I>The Washington Times</I>, February 7, 1996, p. A3.<p>
 <li>   The least expensive (perhaps $2-3 billion) and nearest term (perhaps within four years) ground-based defense would involve modifying Minuteman missiles and command and control software to exploit the current Minuteman infrastructure. However, this system would have limited capability against only a few missiles (in his April 27, 1995, testimony before the House Budget Committee, Defense Secretary Perry acknowledged that a defense would be needed against several times this number -- i.e. 10-20 warheads; on September 28, 1995, he told the Regional Commerce and Growth Association of St. Louis, Missouri, that a reasonable attack to design against would include "several dozen missiles"). There are likely to be substantial operational constraints (how would the U.S. persuade Russia that Minuteman defensive missiles launched at North Korean missiles were not Minuteman offensive missiles launched at Russia?), and these missiles would be less effective than sea-based wide-area defenses that could be deployed as soon for the same price -- and defend American overseas troops, friends, and allies as well.<p>
<li>    During the past year, bills that support this policy have been introduced in the Senate by Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC) and in the House by Representative Martin Hoke (R-OH). Hearings and floor debate could be very useful in firming up a clear U.S. policy regarding the need to move beyond the ABM Treaty and build effective defenses that increase the security of the U.S. and its friends and allies in the post-Cold War world.

<h2>Big-Government Junkies</h2>
<b>by John P. Walters</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The great budget debate between President Clinton and Congress is about more than the level of federal spending and taxes. The fundamental conflict is over the responsibility for addressing America's great social crises. President Clinton wants Washington -- Congress, federal bureaucrats, federal judges -- in charge. Republicans in Congress argue that Big Government has failed to address the human needs of America. They want to return that responsibility to where it has historically rested -- with families, communities, churches and synagogues, and state and local governments.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The conflict was dramatically illustrated when Clinton threw down the gauntlet last January in his State of the Union address: "I challenge Congress not to cut out support for drug-free schools." In June 1995, the president  vetoed legislation to limit the Department of Education's "Drug-Free Schools and Communities" program. With teenage drug use rising rapidly since 1992, who could oppose antidrug programs for America's youth? But the central question is who bears the responsibility for taking action. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The GOP Congress voted last year to cut by 60 percent the $465-million budget for the antidrug program. With cameras rolling, Clinton vetoed the bill in the Rose Garden and called Republicans "extremists" opposed to drug education. His message shows how federal programs diffuse responsibility and undermine citizenship at the local level. No one doubts the importance of reducing illegal drug use. And the federal government has important responsibilities in the fight against illegal drugs: targeting drug trafficking from abroad, for example, as well as interstate commerce in illegal substances and money-laundering.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But teaching children that drug use is wrong and harmful is primarily the responsibility of parents and local communities -- youth organizations, religious institutions, schools, and police. Federal funding is neither necessary nor sufficient for conveying this lesson by word and deed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Moreover, the program in question provides roughly $7.25 per pupil. So by the time this money makes its way through the various state and local bureaucracies, many schools receive less than $3 per student. The president suggests that all those parents and teachers who seek to dissuade young people from using illegal drugs will cease to do so if they fail to receive a federal subsidy of $3 a child.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Drug-Free Schools program began in 1987 during the Reagan administration's expansion of the war on drugs. With good intentions, Congress and the executive branch decided to spend more on federal, state, and local efforts to prevent and treat drug abuse and enforce narcotics laws. Our nation's leaders were particularly anxious to contain the explosion in crack addiction. Later, it became clear that crack use had peaked in 1985 and declined rapidly -- proving that efforts by parents and communities were working long before any federal program tried to "help" them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The federal government increased the appropriation for the Drug-Free Schools program from $200 million in 1987 to more than $624 million in 1992, but paid very little attention to what was actually happening to them. According to former Michigan drug czar Bob Peterson, "The health-education lobby misled educators into believing that drugs only pose another personal health choice. In doing so, federal drug funds underwrote controversial sex-education expansion and condom giveaways and enriched health-education consultants." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Before Governor Engler and the state's education department put a stop to it, $32 million in antidrug funds were diverted to the Michigan Model for Comprehensive School Health. More than $81,000 was used to purchase giant plastic teeth and toothbrushes. Kids who brush, said the "experts," do not use drugs. Another $1.5 million was spent on models of the human torso that were used just once. A Washington, D.C., school used federal antidrug money to take its basketball team to a restaurant. According to testimony before a congressional committee, 400 students at Dallas's Sunset High School received "A"s for a federally funded course about substance abuse that never met and had no teacher.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But the damage is much greater than fiscal waste. Such federal grants do not empower local communities; instead, they turn the federal government into a tax collector for state and local educational bureaucracies and in so doing make them wasteful and unaccountable to their communities.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;However well-intentioned, the nationalization of local obligations undermines responsibility and accountability. By claiming that effective antidrug education depends largely on federal programs, President Clinton has done America's youth a tremendous disservice. Parents, teachers, and communities should not leave to the federal government a responsibility that really belongs to them.

<dt><EM><STRONG>Rosenberger v. University of Virginia</STRONG></EM>
<dd>A State University denied a religious student newspaper the right to apply for activity funds on the same terms as other student groups on the grounds that doing so would violate the Establishment Clause.  CIR, representing the students, argued that a government entity must be evenhanded in granting benefits, and that discrimination based solely on the newspaper's viewpoint was a violation of the Free Speech Clause.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Two lower Courts found for the University, but the Supreme Court reversed 5-4 and found for the Students.  Current status: Remanded back to District Court where matter is pending.

FEC determined its testers were treated differently and sought a cash settlement from BMC under threat of a federal discrimination lawsuit.  In one of the few cases where it has represented a defendant, CIR represented BMC arguing that the testers did not have standing to sue because they were not actually seeking employment.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The District Court refused to grant summary judgment, but the Court of Appeals held that the testers did not have standing to sue.  Current status: after winning at the Court of Appeals level, defendants settled the remaining issues with plaintiffs.

<p><center><b><font size=5>Reality check</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>We received an interesting invitation to a video conference in Washington honoring Women's History Month, titled &quot;Sexual Harassment 1996: Scholarly Definitions &amp; Everyday Realities.&quot;

<BR><DD>And wouldn't you know that Anita Faye Hill, who charged she was sexually harassed by Clarence Thomas, is the featured special guest panelist. The video conference will take place March 27 at the Biz Net Studios in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Building.

<BR><DD>We're told that Paula Corbin Jones, who has brought sexual harassment charges against President Clinton, will not be participating.

<p><center><b><font size=5>Kooks on kooks</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>Democrats are finding that the World Wide Web is an effective means for distributing news, information and even a political jab or two to a large audience.

<BR><DD>Taking a peek at one of the Democratic Policy Committee's well-designed Web pages - http:// www.randomhouse.com/site/ election96/carville/ - we find links to such items as the &quot;Ridiculous Republican of the Week,&quot; the &quot;Republican Hatchet Job of the Week,&quot; the &quot;Republican Myth of the Week&quot; and, last but not least, the &quot;Republican Kook of the Week.&quot;

<p><center><b><font size=5>Say anything</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>It's an election year, and President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore certainly aren't fooling anybody, but for the sake of the youth of our nation, that's OK with Sen. Orrin G. Hatch.

<BR><DD>&quot;President Clinton has let the country down because of his failure to lead on the drug issue,&quot; the Utah Republican said. &quot;We have gone from a 'just say no' program under President Reagan to pleading with President Clinton to just say something.

<BR><DD>&quot;If the president is finally beginning to speak out more because it is a political year - I know he just held a conference on some aspects of this problem - then I say it is better late than never. I commend him for it.&quot;

<p><center><b><font size=5>Bunning and the boys</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>Pitcher-turned-congressman Jim Bunning is one of four baseball greats elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. The Kentucky Republican, 64, won 224 games with the Detroit Tigers, the Philadelphia Phillies and the Pittsburgh Pirates over 17 seasons.

<BR><DD>Rep. Henry J. Hyde, Illinois Republican, got to deliver the news about the future Hall of Famer's election to the House.

<BR><DD>In doing so, he told the story of when Mr. Bunning was pitching against the New York Yankees, who had a first-base coach named Bob Turley, &quot;a former pitcher who was very skilled at stealing signs. Every time Jim would throw a fastball, Turley would whistle, and the batters knew what the pitch was,&quot; Mr. Hyde noted.

<BR><DD>&quot;Now, the first batter up was Bobby Richardson, and Jim got him out. The second batter up was Tony Kubek, the shortstop. Jim got him out. The third batter stepped in, Mickey Mantle, and Jim walked over to the first-base coach, Turley, and he said, 'If you whistle, I am going to hit him right in the back with a pitch.'

<BR><DD>&quot;Jim took the mound. He got his sign, and he was at the top of his windup when Turley whistled. Jim decided to cross everybody up. He threw a slider. It got away from him, and hit Mantle right in the back. Mantle headed toward the mound with his bat, but decided better of it, and trotted down to first base.

<BR><DD>&quot;The next batter was Yogi Berra. Yogi stepped in, pounded the plate, looked at Jim Bunning and said, 'Hey, Jim, if Turley whistles, I ain't listening.'&quot;

<p><center><b><font size=5>The Wright stuff</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>Democratic Rep. Claude Pepper, who was the oldest member of Congress when he died in 1989 at 88, was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1937. A liberal, he was on Capitol Hill to fight for Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal and against Ronald Reagan's conservative revolution.

<BR><DD>Last week, Sen. Byron L. Dorgan, North Dakota Democrat, recalled the week he first set foot in Congress and walked into the office of Mr. Pepper, &quot;and I saw something I have not forgotten.&quot;

<BR><DD>On the wall behind Mr. Pepper's desk, the senator remembered, &quot;was an autographed picture of Orville and Wilbur Wright making the first airplane flight. And it was autographed, 'To Congressman Claude Pepper,' by Orville Wright. ...

<BR><DD>&quot;Then, hanging just above that, was a picture of Neil Armstrong setting his foot on the moon, autographed, 'To Congressman Claude Pepper.'&quot;

<p><center><b><font size=5>We got you, boys</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>A tremendous audience of 250 people showed up for a news conference recently at which the national retail sales tax was unveiled. The legislation would abolish the Internal Revenue Service, the federal income tax and inheritance taxes, replacing them with a retail sales tax of about 15 percent.

<BR><DD>Republican Reps. Billy Tauzin of Louisiana and Dan Schaefer of Colorado are co-sponsors of the legislation, although fellow Rep. Sonny Bono, California Republican, dropped by to see why the big audience.

<BR><DD>Introducing the former Hollywood entertainer, Mr. Tauzin noted: &quot;You know, when Sonny wrote the song 'I Got You, Babe,' it was really the theme song for the IRS.&quot;

<BR><DD>To which Mr. Bono quipped: &quot;Billy and Dan, you guys have got a lot of courage for sponsoring this legislation, because you know you're going to get audited!&quot;

<p><center><b><font size=5>Pork alert</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>We've just examined the 1996 Congressional Pig Book, released by Citizens Against Government Waste.

<BR><DD>&quot;Rolling out the pork barrel and having a barrel of fun has long been one of Washington's more unseemly traditions, and few indeed have shown the will to resist its temptations,&quot; notes the 600,000-member, nonpartisan organization in the introduction.

<BR><DD>First, the criteria for pork: requested by only one chamber of Congress; not specifically authorized; not competitively awarded; not requested by the president; greatly exceeds the president's budget request; not the subject of congressional hearings; and serves only a local or special interest.

<BR><DD>Second, a few examples of pork 1996-style, followed by CAGW reaction:

<UL>
<LI>$395,000 awarded in conference for rice modeling at the University of Arkansas and the University of Missouri. &quot;Uncle Ben, not Uncle Sam, should be funding this research.&quot;

<LI>$3.75 million by the Senate for wood-utilization research from Maine to Oregon. &quot;How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if he had $3.75 million?&quot;

<LI>$1 million by the Senate for outreach for socially disadvantaged farmers.

<LI>$1 million by the Senate for research on the brown tree snake. &quot;The Brown Tree Snake, which is found only in Guam, has not been discovered to be life-threatening to humans, nor does it have the ability to survive in North America.&quot;
</UL>
<p><center><b><font size=5>Real death</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>A government notice states: &quot;According to the National Center for Health Statistics, tobacco, diet and alcohol are the three leading causes of actual death in the U.S.&quot;

<p><center><b><font size=5>Talk about reporters</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>Carrie Klein, a former aide to Sen. Mark O. Hatfield, Oregon Republican, compiled the congressional index that appears in the 1996 Media Studies Journal, published by Columbia University. One portion notes:

<BR><DD>&quot;Number of journalists accredited to the Senate and House press galleries: 7,142.

<BR><DD>&quot;Ratio of journalists to congressmen: 16:1.

<BR><DD>&quot;Ratio of journalists to senators: 71:1.&quot;

<p><center><b><font size=5>Sweet dreams</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>Sen. Jesse Helms, North Carolina Republican, was on hand at the White House March 12 to witness President Clinton sign long-awaited legislation to tighten sanctions against Cuba.

<BR><DD>Emerging from the signing ceremony, Mr. Helms encountered a horde of reporters in the White House driveway, one of whom pointed out: &quot;You know, the Cuban government says repeatedly that this law is going to have no impact, that in reality the other governments are not going to pay attention to what it says, on the contrary it's illegal because it goes against NAFTA and GATT. What's your impression? Do you think -&quot;

<BR><DD>&quot;Well,&quot; interrupted Mr. Helms, &quot;will you deliver a message to the Cuban government for me?&quot;

<BR><DD>&quot;Well,&quot; replied the reporter, &quot;I can't -&quot;

<BR><DD>&quot;Dream on!&quot; Mr. Helms told the Cuban government.

<BR><DD>&quot;... but I'm sure they're hearing it,&quot; the reporter said.

<p><center><b><font size=5>Sea to shining sea</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>We've intercepted a memo from the U.S. Coast Guard commandant's office that says Transportation Secretary Federico Pena &quot;has requested that the department commemorate Earth Day, April 22, 1996, with a celebration that reaches across the country from headquarters to our field units.&quot;

<BR><DD>It continues: &quot;This is an ideal opportunity to recognize every individual's role and responsibility and to reinforce one of the Coast Guard's most important missions, 'Protecting Our Environment.' This year's theme is 'Reduce, Reuse and Recycle.'&quot;

<BR><DD>The memo directs all field units &quot;to plan and participate in Earth Day festivities either by conducting Earth Day observations at your units ... or by contributing to local community Earth Day celebrations.&quot;

<BR><DD>It also requests that each unit provide in advance to the commandant's office a list and description of planned Earth Day activities.

<BR><DD>The Earth Day tradition was launched in the United States in 1970, shortly after the Cuyahoga River caught fire.

<P>
The mood was euphoric. The tone one of bravado. &quot;We're looking
for horror stories. We're going to change the way things are done
around here!&quot; Thus spoke one Congressman shortly after the
November 1994 election. The targets? The Endangered Species Act,
the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, all environmental regulations,
and especially the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).<BR>

<P>
By 1996, the mood was sober; the tone confused. Congressional
reformers of the 104th Congress had failed to institute hoped-for
changes in environmental regulations. &quot;The stumbling block
to reform,&quot; admitted a Congressional staffer at a January
1996 retreat, &quot;is the vision thing&quot; - how reformers
define and understand basic environmental policy challenges.<BR>

<P>
What is needed is an environmental vision that combines an appreciation
of the general environmental psyche of the nation with a respect
for the diverse values people hold. This means finding approaches
to environmental problems that economize on the need for consensus
- that limit instances in which non-voluntary collective decisions
are sought - while reinforcing incentives for personal environmental
stewardship. <BR>

<P>
Reformers also need a plausible picture of how the world works
- how one identifies environmental problems, assembles information
relevant to minimizing these problems and maintains incentives
- within firms and among individuals - to apply that information.
<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><a name="vision"></a><B>The &quot;Vision Thing&quot;<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
The &quot;old vision&quot; that shaped the past quarter-century
of environmental policies offered lofty images of Mother Nature
and a better world. Its language of poetry - and sometimes fear
- captivated the imagination of the American public. And, translated
into public policies, the old vision produced some successes.
<BR>

<P>
But, as Horatio warned Hamlet, &quot;All is not well.&quot; The
record of environmental gains tells only part of the environmental
story. The rest of the story - high costs and growing conflict
- are the driving forces behind appeals for environmental policy
reform. Three features of the old vision made high conflict and
high costs a likely outcome.<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><a name="values"></a><B>Values<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
First is the matter of values. The old environmental vision often
implicitly, and sometimes explicitly, portrayed environmental
values as absolute - as somehow more important than other values.
The result has been an endorsement of &quot;zero emission&quot;
goals and remediation standards in which little consideration
is given to costs. &quot;If Mother Nature didn't put it in,&quot;
one California regulator recently told me, &quot;you had to take
it out - everything - that was the goal. This drove us to rigid,
grossly exuberant attempts at clean up.&quot;<BR>

<P>
But this view that environmental values are absolute cannot be
right. Environmental values, while important, are situated among
a cluster of values that constitute quality-of-life. People seek
health, safety, nourishment, shelter, learning, companionship,
aesthetic enrichment and personal accomplishment, along with environmental
protections. And it is often difficult for outsiders - or even
individuals themselves - to know in advance how they would prefer
to trade off among different wants.<BR>

<P>
Most people want all good things, including environmental protection.
Year after year, opinion polls demonstrate (at least in the abstract)
a commitment to environmental values. Any successful reform effort
must appreciate this commitment.<BR>

<P>
But general societal trends do not erase particular differences
among individuals. Environmental values are more important for
some people than for others. And, for any particular individual,
some environmental values are more important than others. A new
environmental vision must depart from the old way of thinking
by recognizing the need to find ways in which individuals and
particular communities can undertake their own balancing among
these many values.<BR>

<P>
Environmental problem-solving is about making choices. The challenge,
however, is not simply one of deciding what's to be done. The
challenge is also one of determining &quot;who should decide&quot;
and &quot;how.&quot; Recognizing that people have diverse values
establishes one constraint in thinking about &quot;who shall decide.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><a name="knowledge"></a><B>The Knowledge Problem<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
A second constraint is what Nobel laureate F.A. Hayek called the
&quot;knowledge problem&quot; - how societies create and access
information relevant to making decisions about the allocation
of time and resources. <BR>

<P>
The old vision viewed the information challenge as one of identifying
general environmental problems and then specifying uniform remedies
to those problems. Information relevant to environmental problem-solving
was perceived to be the sort that could be collected and centralized
within an agency of experts, then translated into a series of
one-size-fits-all regulations that prescribed acceptable technologies,
clean-up methods and single-purpose wilderness management plans.
The result was often an attitude that &quot;bureaucrats know best.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
This old vision was partly right about &quot;knowledge.&quot;
Many environmental problems do involve matters of &quot;general
knowledge&quot; - scientific understanding of facts that are constant
across time and space. Sometimes this scientific knowledge is
a matter of settled understanding: the boiling point of water,
for instance, or the bonding patterns of chemicals. EPA uses this
kind of knowledge to develop ways of detecting chemical concentrations
in polluted soils. <BR>

<P>
In other instances, scientific knowledge is a matter of ongoing
research and scientific contention: What, for example, are the
health hazards of various substances or the effects of carbon
dioxide on climate? Or is concentration of a chemical in the soil
a useful indicator of risk to humans and ecosystems? Much environmental
debate takes place over issues of general knowledge, and these
questions are important. But they are not the whole story.<BR>

<P>
Environmental problems and problem-solving also often involve
what Hayek called &quot;specific knowledge&quot; - the knowledge
of time, place and experience. This information varies by circumstance
and location and may change over time. Specific knowledge is decentralized
- it resides on the factory floor, on a specific farm and at a
particular Superfund site.<BR>

<P>
The impacts of a landfill in the desert will differ from those
near the Florida Everglades. Whether incorporating recycled content
into a package optimizes resource efficiency will depend on the
material, the availability of alternative materials, particular
production processes and other product-specific details. Using
two coats of oil-based paint will have different impacts than
using just one coat.<BR>

<P>
These kinds of details do not reside in the minds of bureaucrats
in Washington - or even within state agencies. Yet this is the
kind of knowledge that is often most relevant to understanding
specific environmental problems and the merits of different remedies.
<BR>

<P>
The narrow framing of the &quot;knowledge problem&quot; captured
in the regulatory reform bills proposed in the early part of the
104th Congress did not address this problem of dynamic and decentralized
information. The first prong of the &quot;knowledge problem&quot;
- how to better incorporate available general knowledge into public
policy - dominated that debate. Proponents of the 1995 regulatory
reform bills viewed the essential problem as one of irrationality.
They called for more professionalism and better planners. The
Big Fix, they argued, would come from the twin icons of rationalism:
hard science and good economics.<BR>

<P>
This emphasis on costs and the denunciation of regulations directed
at trivial risks is common sense stuff. An effort to introduce
better science and economic analysis into environmental decision-making
may yield more efficient and sensible policies.<BR>

<P>
But matters of high cost and poorly chosen goals are really derivative
problems. They are a predictable (and lamentable) product of a
mismatch between top-down, micromanaging decision processes and
the world as it is: complex, dynamic and full of particulars rather
than generalities.<BR>

<P>
A reform agenda that simply superimposes cost-benefit decision
constraints on regulators does not get at the kinds of information
problems inherent in a complex, dynamic world full of location-specific
details. Attending to the knowledge problem means, instead, thinking
about what institutions and decision-making processes will create
information feedback loops and facilitate access to relevant knowledge
of time, place, and experience.<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><a name="firm"></a><B>The Individual, the Firm and the Marketplace<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
This challenge brings us to the third feature of the old environmental
vision - its perception of the individual, the firm and the marketplace.
The old vision viewed industry and economic dynamism as a central
cause of environmental degradation. Pollution was not just a problem;
it was evil. And the motives of participants in this economic
growth dynamo were suspect. <BR>

<P>
This view is a recipe for emphasizing sticks, not carrots. It
is also a recipe for emphasizing fines and punishment rather than
problem-solving.<BR>

<P>
As journalist Gregg Easterbrook shows in <B>A Moment on Earth</B>,
his 1,000-plus pages tome on environmental progress, our air and
water are cleaner; wolves again prowl in once-abandoned forests;
and, ospreys fish in once-polluted waters. Easterbrook implicitly
attributes most of these reported gains to three decades of regulation.
Forgotten by Easterbrook and most other chroniclers of environmental
gains is the role that marketplace ingenuity, market prices and
private stewardship have played in environmental progress. This
myopia means the reform agenda has been mostly about fine-tuning
regulations, not rethinking the nation's basic approach to environmentalism.
<BR>

<P>
Yet the incentives promoted by a competitive marketplace have
yielded phenomenal improvements in how efficiently we use resources.
In an essay on technology and environment, Jesse Ausubel reports
that the telecommunications industry now consumes 65 pounds of
silica to create a cable that can carry 1,000 times more messages
than cable made from one ton of copper. A handful of sand versus
a ton of copper represents an environmental triumph of a competitive
marketplace that nudges manufacturers to use less stuff.<BR>

<P>
These trends have occurred in things both great and small. On
the one hand are construction-industry gains, where technology
improvements mean builders can use one-third the materials once
needed to build a high-rise building. At the other end of the
spectrum is the diminutive soda can. In the 1960s, producers required
164 pounds of metal to produce 1,000 soda cans; today they use
around 33 pounds of metal.<BR>

<P>
These gains result not only in &quot;doing more with less.&quot;
They also reduce the &quot;environmental footprint&quot; - the
pollution and waste - associated with producing a given product.
<BR>

<P>
This picture of progress is, of course, imperfect. Two decades
of economic literature have described the &quot;tragedy of the
commons,&quot; in which resources are &quot;owned&quot; by everyone
and thus are essentially owned by no one, since they can be used
indiscriminately by everyone. Under these circumstances, each
person has an incentive to consume as much as possible, as fast
as possible, rather than preserve and protect resources for future
use.<BR>

<P>
This &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot; applies to unowned lands;
it also applies to air basins, oceans and many other water bodies.
<BR>

<P>
Sometimes, the resolution to these commons problems lies in clarifying
rights and strengthening markets, as some environmental economists
have argued for twenty years - occasionally successfully. Environmental
writer Tom Wolf describes a &quot;Ranching for Wildlife&quot;
program in Colorado that borrows from the ideas of these environmental
economists. In the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, elk on public and
private lands compete with cattle for forage. The challenge, suggests
Wolf, is &quot;to figure out how ranchers can capture value from
the elk.&quot;<BR>

<P>
Hunters will pay as much as $8,000 for a license to hunt trophy
elk. But until Colorado passed its Ranching for Wildlife law,
landowners were unable to take part in potential revenues from
the sale of hunting licenses. Under Ranching for Wildlife, the
state still &quot;owns&quot; the wildlife, but owners of large
ranches can auction off a designated number of hunting licenses
that guarantee trophy elk. The program, in effect, has partially
privatized elk-hunting rights. Participating ranch owners now
manage their lands to provide suitable habitat for elk. They also
vigilantly guard against poaching of young bull elk.<BR>

<P>
But some problems - and many air pollution problems fall into
this category - are not easily divisible into private &quot;spheres
of stewardship.&quot; And one person's choices directly affect
others. These problems involve situations in which defining and
enforcing individual rights are costly. These high &quot;transactions
costs,&quot; as economist Ronald Coase called them, inhibit the
emergence of contractual arrangements in which all affected parties
voluntarily work out an allocation of rights and responsibilities.
<BR>

<P>
Thinking about the problems of indivisibility and transaction
costs introduces a central challenge for environmental reform.
Fully private, individual decisions are not always possible. Regulatory
decisions are often undesirable, since they suppress localized
information and impose a single-value hierarchy. And reliance
on courts to resolve all disputes about pollution and other social
&quot;nuisances&quot; can be divisive and costly. Needed is a
way of sorting out which collective decision-making arrangements,
under which circumstances, enhance expression of environmental
values at least cost. <BR>

<P>
The old environmental vision fostered passage of command-and-control
laws that gave scant attention to costs and regulated large and
small problems indiscriminately. That vision nurtured laws that
stirred up adversarial relationships between regulators and the
regulated. It formed the basis for a blueprint destined to divide
communities.<BR>

<P>
A new environmental vision must be compatible with a complex,
dynamic world in which quality-of-life comprises many values,
but time and resources, at any given moment, are not infinite.
Under this vision, environmental values are viewed as part of
an array of wants people hold. This vision also appreciates the
importance of decentralized information - information of time,
place and experience - and recognizes that marketplace institutions
(clearly defined rights, competition and market prices) help foster
incentives for stewardship and efficient resource use. But this
vision also recognizes that all environmental problems are not
alike. Some problems are amenable to some form of &quot;privatized&quot;
solution; others require collective - though not necessarily government
- action.<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><a name="reform"></a><B>Principles of Reform<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
How might the vision outlined here reshape U.S. environmental
policy? The &quot;vision thing&quot; in itself is not enough to
provide direction to an environmental reform agenda. From that
vision, reformers need to outline some simple policy principles.
Five policy principles are consistent with the vision outlined
here. <BR>

<P>
<I>Principle of Decentralization</I>. For three decades, we have
thrust many environmental decisions into the Federal arena. But
for some problems, impacts are strictly local and narrowly circumscribed.
Other environmental problems may impose regional, or even global
impacts. The locus of impact of a problem should help determine
where decision-making authority ought to reside.<BR>

<P>
If most knowledge relevant to understanding specific environmental
problems is location-specific and dynamic, decisions about &quot;how
clean is clean&quot; and what remedies to use should take place
closest to where the problem occurs. For air-emission problems,
that might mean a local air basin. For decisions about cleaning
up an industrial site, that might mean creating processes that
foster bargaining between landowners adjacent to the site and
the site owner. <BR>

<P>
Decentralized bargaining approaches bring to bear relevant local
information. These approaches may also be less likely to drive
decisions toward &quot;zero risk&quot; than centralized decision
processes. In decentralized bargaining situations, citizens face
<I>both</I> the risks associated with a facility and enjoy directly
the benefits - in the form of lower clean-up costs and more job-creation,
for example - associated with a particular remedy. Bargaining
thus serves as a discovery process, revealing more accurate information
about risks and benefits.<BR>

<P>
Unbounded fears may, in fact, be more likely to drive decisions
toward &quot;zero risk&quot; in centralized decision processes.
There, the costs of decisions are spread over an entire population,
but benefits from pursuing pristine clean-ups are enjoyed by those
few near a particular site. The few then have an incentive to
lobby for those benefits, while the many have little incentive
to lobby at all - with obvious results.<BR>

<P>
The contrast between costly Superfund site clean-ups, which have
occurred in a top-down, regulatory framework directed by the EPA,
and more recent local remediation of abandoned industrial sites
through negotiated settlements offers testament to this point.
The locally negotiated clean-ups have, in general, been accomplished
at a fraction of the cost for Superfund sites.<BR>

<P>
<I>Principle of Flexibility</I>. Complexity and change characterize
nature and human interaction with it. Traditional regulations
that prescribe technologies or mandate particular clean-up remedies
ignore location-specific and ever-changing information critical
to all production and consumption decisions. To take advantage
of the knowledge residing within a particular plant, or at a specific
hazardous waste site, or on an individual farm, environmental
policies need to foster flexibility, often through the market
process. Performance standards, in contrast to command-and-control
regulations, allow individuals and firms to figure out how best
to achieve the stated standards (to lower overall air pollution
to a certain level, for instance).<BR>

<P>
<I>Principle of Problem-solving</I>. The old environmental vision
tended to cast business against environmentalists, the private-sector
against the public sector, regulators against the regulated. The
result was an emphasis on crimes and punishment. According to
EPA Administrator Carol Browner, in fiscal year 1994 the EPA collected
$165.2 million in monetary penalties and $747.5 million in injunctive
relief. The agency pursued 2,246 enforcement actions in a single
year - and these efforts do not include state and local government
enforcement activities.<BR>

<P>
Enforcement efforts, per se, are not unwarranted. But an emphasis
on enforcement that leads to prosecutions of sometimes trivial
procedural violations is costly - and such efforts may inhibit
rather than foster actual environmental improvements. An emphasis
on criminal enforcement even when there is no intent to violate
the law or no gross negligence simply expends scarce dollars on
prosecutions rather than problem-solving.<BR>

<P>
A reform agenda needs to foster information exchanges and technology
development, and bolster incentives of individuals - acting alone
and within public and private institutions - to find ways of mitigating
environmental problems.<BR>

<P>
<I>Principle of Balancing.</I> Enhancing quality-of-life requires
optimizing among the many values that people hold. All production
and consumption activities produce residuals. For every residual
generated, some corresponding benefit (from the perspective of
individual consumers) is produced. And all production and consumption
activities involve a series of trade-offs. A dollar spent on pollution
prevention technologies or clean-up is a dollar not available
to invest in other productivity-enhancing endeavors.<BR>

<P>
Trade-offs are not merely between environmental and economic goals.
Many trade-offs are between one set of risks and other risks.
For example, pesticide run-off may contaminate waters, but pesticides
help reduce food spoilage in the field. And less food spoilage
means less food needs to be planted to meet the same consumption
requirements. <BR>

<P>
The September 1995 issue of <I>Risk in Perspective</I>, published
by the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, reported that &quot;chlorination
of drinking water is considered one of the most dramatic success
stories in the field of public health.&quot; Chlorination has
helped prevent a whole range of waterborne diseases from chronic
diarrhea to typhoid fever. On the other hand, the Harvard newsletter
cautions that &quot;chlorination is not free of counterveiling
risks....the possibility that these compounds could cause long-term,
chronic effects, including cancer, is now a subject of intensive
research by toxicologists and epidemiologists.&quot;<BR>

<P>
Balancing these risks is not a trivial matter. In Peru, a decision
to reduce the chlorination of public drinking water may have been
responsible for an outbreak of cholera that killed thousands of
people.<BR>

<P>
This problem of trade-offs - and how to get the biggest bang for
the environmental buck - lay at the heart of 1995 Congressional
proposals to institute cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment.
Reform proposals need to incorporate &quot;balancing mechanisms&quot;
- decision processes that foster a balancing of costs against
benefits and establish means for setting priorities. But balancing
may be better achieved through bargaining processes than through
top-down rules that impose detailed analytical requirements on
regulators. <BR>

<P>
<I>Principle of Accountability and Stewardship</I>. Economists
Richard Stroup and John Baden conclude that institutions, not
perverse people, are the genesis of environmental problems. Policies
that more closely link the choices that individuals make with
outcomes for those choices strengthen incentives for stewardship
and efficiency. Paying to use resources, for example, establishes
incentives to conserve the same resources.<BR>

<P>
But this linkage applies to public decisions as well. Current
policies that require individuals or firms to set aside land for
wildlife, wilderness and wetlands protection in effect ask these
people to provide a public amenity at no cost to the public. Compensating
private individuals (or firms) in those instances in which they
are asked to provide a public amenity is not merely a matter of
fairness. It also gives property owners a financial self-interest
in protecting habitat and preserving endangered species. And it
gives regulators an incentive to prioritize their efforts.<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><a name="do"></a><B>What Can Policymakers Do</B>?<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
An environmental vision must precede policy reform because it
shapes the principles of progress. It provides a basis for developing
principles against which to construct and evaluate different policy
reform tools. It establishes some notion of what reformers value,
and it offers, as Walter Lippman wrote in his 1965 book, <B>Public
Opinion</B>, a &quot;map of the universe&quot; - a sense of the
nature of knowledge and how people create and tap into relevant
knowledge to make decisions.<BR>

<P>
But a vision, and the principles that flow from that vision, are
necessarily abstract. Policy reformers, however, must deal in
specifics. What might an agenda for reform look like?<BR>

<P>
Former EPA chief William Ruckelshaus correctly concluded in his
fall 1995 speech at the Environmental Law Institute's annual awards
dinner in Washington, D.C. that, &quot;despite the current rhetoric
in this city, there is no simple fix, no silver bullet.&quot;
Aligning environmental policies with a new vision that highlights
problem-solving rather than punishment, dynamic use of decentralized
information, and a balancing among many values will require an
overhaul of many current statutes. And it will need to be an evolutionary
process. Three kinds of statutes might start that process.<BR>

<P>
<I>Environmental Devolution Statute</I>. The first step would
include passage of a general statute to devolve responsibilities
and authority for many environmental programs to states. Several
ideas for such a statute have been outlined by the Washington,
D.C.-based National Environmental Policy Institute and other groups.
These ideas serve as a useful starting point. An Environmental
Devolution Statute, focused on most air, water and hazardous waste
regulations, should:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>Devolve to the states authority, responsibility and accountability
for setting environmental goals, implementing policy and monitoring
success. Where airsheds or watersheds cross state boundaries,
states would have primary authority for working out acceptable
standards, and the national role would be one of mediator. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Create sunset provisions to phase out existing legislation
<I>as revised environmental laws</I> are introduced. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Create a performance-based system in which the emphasis is
on setting ambient environmental standards, not on the use of
specific technologies. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Establish mechanisms for development of multi-media, facility-wide,
or even community-wide, ambient standards and permitting that
would allow for emission trading among facilities, among different
emission sources within a single plant and even possibly among
different pollution sources. Permits could take the form of contracts
or covenants rather than the more traditional regulatory permits.

</UL>

<P>
The primary purpose of such a statute would be to create procedures
for decentralizing decision-making and developing flexible conditions
in which success is measured by real-world accomplishments, not
by prospective EPA approvals based on modeled predictions of how
EPA thinks different technologies and programs might affect environmental
quality.<BR>

<P>
<I>Civic Environmentalism Act</I>. The second step for environmental
reform would include a Civic Environmentalism Act passed by Congress.
Designed to shift emphasis away from primarily punitive approaches
to policies that promote problem-solving, bargaining and technical
information and information exchange, this act would:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>Reform environmental enforcement by clarifying which actions
are subject to criminal penalties and which are subject to civil
and administrative proceedings; tie criminal penalties primarily
to situations in which intent to harm is present; revise sentencing
guidelines so that environmental sentences conform more closely
with guidelines for other, comparable crimes; and, limit dual
prosecutions for the same violation by different agencies. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Create an environmental extension program patterned after
agricultural extension programs in which information and technical
assistance are provided to farmers and businesses to achieve emission
reductions as a substitute for enforcement actions in situations
where neither &quot;intent to harm&quot; nor &quot;gross negligence&quot;
exists. Such programs need not require new expenditures but could
involve a shifting of current expenditures away from punitive
approaches, or they could use proceeds from pollution charges,
or such programs could use private funding. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Facilitate the establishment of local, market-like bargaining
and negotiating processes through which those directly affected
by particular pollution and other environmental harms can negotiate
with the individuals, firms or governments responsible for those
harms concerning appropriate clean-up levels and ambient standards.
Models for these programs already exist within some states, for
some kinds of projects. 
</UL>

<P>
A Civic Environmentalism Act would represent a major departure
from the regulatory approaches established over the past thirty
years. The goal of such an act would be to begin the process of
&quot;privatizing&quot; decision-making regarding some environmental
problems, and creating bargaining approaches for problems such
as Superfund site clean-ups, brownfields redevelopment, Federal
facilities clean-ups, toxic emission standard-setting and other
problems with primarily local impacts.<BR>

<P>
<I>Environmental Amenities Act</I>. The third step in environmental
reform would be an Environmental Amenities Act patterned in part
after the 1995 House proposals for takings compensation to property
owners who lose some (or all) use of their property to provide
public environmental amenities such as wilderness, wildlife and
wetlands protection. The overall purpose of an Environmental Amenities
Act would be to replace the regulatory and punitive approaches
of the current Endangered Species Act and wetlands regulations
developed under the Clean Water Act with market approaches that
create incentives for environmental stewardship and relieve individual
property owners or firms from shouldering the burdens of providing
public amenities at private rather than taxpayer expense. An Environmental
Amenities Act would:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>Create requirements for takings compensation in situations
where private landowners are required to provide public amenities;
such provisions <I>do not</I> include compensation against regulations
regarding pollution reduction or mitigation. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Empower states to &quot;privatize&quot; benefits of wildlife
and habitat protection by encouraging use of bounties, competitive
contracts for private entities to provide habitat and wildlife
protection, and other measures that allow private individuals,
firms, ranchers and forest owners to &quot;capture value&quot;
by producing environmental goods. 
</UL>

<P>
The purpose of an Environmental Amenities Act would be to strengthen
accountability - both in the private and public sectors.<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><a name="better"></a><B>A Better Future<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
All environmental decisions involve a tug-of-war among competing
values. This includes a tug-of-war among substantive values -
my sphere of values versus my neighbor's and one value versus
another.<BR>

<P>
The tug-of-war also includes juggling among what I call decision-process
values. All decision-making processes experience, to varying degrees
along a continuum, a tension between predictability and flexibility;
uniformity and diversity; certainty and dynamism; anticipation
of all harms and resilience - the ability to respond effectively
when problems arise.<BR>

<P>
For thirty years, however, legislators have opted for environmental
policies that have emphasized predictability, centralization,
certainty and uniformity. These decision characteristics are ill-suited
to a dynamic world in which people hold diverse values and problems
are complex and often location-specific. Such a world requires
decision processes that enhance autonomy, personal stewardship,
flexibility, decentralization, adaptation and resilience.

<title>No More Home Alone - Policy Review - Mar-Apr 96 - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><h2>No More Home Alone</h2>

<b>Essays by James Q. Wilson & Kathleen Sylvester call for an end to money for teen moms to live on their own</b>
<p> <b><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</b><br>
March-April 1996, Number 76</i><hr width=50%></center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Sociologist James Q. Wilson proposes that unmarried, pregnant girls live in some type of supervised, privately run group home as a condition of receiving government benefits. This, he argues, would help provide the social structure that young single mothers and their children now lack, but desperately need if they are to escape the cycle of dependence. <a href="#syl">Kathleen Sylvester</a> of the <a href="http://www.dlcppi.org/">Progressive Policy Institute</a> describes a version of this concept that was approved by Congress last fall as part of its welfare reform package. President Clinton vetoed the bill.<p><h3>James Q. Wilson<br><i>Beginning with Our Children</I></h3><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The American political regime as envisioned by its founders was not supposed to have anything to do with character. It was supposed to enable people living in villages and towns to compose their differences at the national level in order to secure a more perfect union and ensure domestic tranquillity and justice. <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It was assumed that it was in private associations (family, neighborhood, and peer groups) and small political institutions (village and town governments) that character could be formed, so the national government could take character for granted. "Men," Madison wrote, "are presumed to have sufficient virtue to constitute and maintain a free republic." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Today, by contrast, we are properly concerned with the issue of character, placed on the national agenda by both political parties. Why is it that the assumptions that influenced the men who gathered in Philadelphia in 1787 are no longer the assumptions we bring to the contemplation of the true purpose of our national polity?<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; One reason is that government has gotten bigger. As government gets bigger, it touches all aspects of our lives. As it touches all aspects of our lives, we increasingly put our concerns back on the government. The price of big government is an ever-expanding agenda. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Forty years ago, when I began studying politics, it was inconceivable that the federal government would ever be held responsible for crime, drug abuse, illegitimacy, welfare, civil rights, clean air, or clean water. Today it is responsible for all those things. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Not only have our aspirations and the size of the federal government changed, but so has our culture. In many spheres of our lives, we are no longer confident that local private institutions like families, churches, and neighborhoods are sufficient to form a culture that will sustain and enrich a free society. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; One of the areas in which this concern has become most sharply focused is illegitimacy. An illegitimacy crisis that affects both blacks and whites has been growing without let up since the early 1960s. It has shaped the profound debate now unfolding in Washington about the relationship between federal welfare programs and the very formation and maintenance of families. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;When Title IV, which created the program now known as Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), was added to the Social Security Act of 1935, it was the least controversial part of that landmark legislation. For years after its enactment, it caused scarcely a national political ripple. The reason was that it gave federal support to a few state programs designed to provide short-term compensation to women who had been widowed due to the First World War or coal-mining disasters, or who had been divorced or deserted by husbands. It nationalized these programs by extending them to the other states. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;No one expected it would become a way of life and no one ever expected teenagers would apply for it. All that has changed. Today, the typical new AFDC enrollee spends only two or three years on welfare and then moves on. It acts as a stopgap measure to provide for the needs of women and children during a particularly difficult time in their lives. This is the group for whom AFDC was originally intended. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But if you look at the total number of welfare recipients, as opposed to those who enter the roles in any given year, you notice that the typical recipient has been on welfare for 10 years. Increasingly, this has extended into second and third generations. Many come and leave quickly, but a few remain. And the number who remain now constitute the largest share of the whole. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; There is a spirited debate about why this should be so. I think it is fair to say that no one can confidently claim to know the answer to this question. It is difficult to sustain the argument that the existence of welfare causes dependency if it did not do so during the first 30 years of its history. Evidence about the effect of state differences in welfare payments on rates of welfare participation is inconclusive. <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There has probably been a profound cultural shift that has destigmatized illegitimacy and removed barriers that once inhibited people from remaining on AFDC for long periods of time. Even if we assume that the system of public payments did not cause this phenomenon, it certainly makes it possible. If the system did not exist, the current degree of dependency would not exist.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Even if you disagree with that assertion, the system has surely not cured its own defects. Rates of illegitimacy and single parenthood among black and white Americans have risen steadily since the early 1960s and that trend shows little sign of tapering off. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The harms associated with single parenthood and illegitimacy are now so well documented that the evidence need not be reviewed. But let me give you one example gathered by the government itself. A few years ago, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services selected more than 30,000 households across the country, designed to represent a statistical cross section. They interviewed the mother, father, or both about the welfare of their children. Except for the very highest income level, children raised in single-parent households are materially worse off, irrespective of race. They are worse off in terms of educational achievement, social well-being, aggressiveness, and difficulty with the law. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It should not take massive studies to establish this phenomenon. It is evident to many who confront life in hospital emergency rooms, police stations, juvenile courts, or welfare offices on a daily basis. The problem has crystallized in our concern about the unmarried teenage mother. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If you survey the history of families around the world, every culture has had teenage mothers. Indeed, what is striking today is how long many women wait before having children. But what was different in the past is that those girls gave birth as part of an embedded structure: with a husband, parents, grandmothers, aunts, uncles, and siblings. They were part of an extended family or a village in which there were many people who not only helped take care of the child, but taught the mother to be a mother and required that the father be a father. The debate I hear in Washington about reforming the current system is remarkably inattentive to the core fact that young girls living apart from other adults cannot expect much success at raising children alone. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Instead, the debate is posing questions such as: How do we save money on the welfare budget? How soon can we require recipients to work? How can we use modern technology to go after deadbeat dads? These may all be worthwhile concerns, but they should be viewed as subordinate to the central goal of saving the children whose lives are being destroyed as a consequence of growing up in this environment. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To solve this problem, we must ask all levels of government and the private sector to do something American government has never had to do before: constitute and support a viable alternative to the traditional family for the children and young women most at risk. One trembles even to utter the phrase "viable alternative," because in the Anglo-Saxon legal tradition, the king with all his legions stops at the threshold of the hut of the very poorest peasant. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;We all understand that government cannot raise children. But there is something out there that is not working and government must change its allocation of incentives to give us a fighting chance of solving the problem. Let me suggest a strategy and then indicate how it might be implemented. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;We must get young, unmarried, pregnant girls embedded in a social structure under adult supervision. This not only provides their children with a chance for a good start in life, but teaches them how to be a parent and protect themselves from the desperate conditions of gangs, drugs, and crime that often exist around them. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I therefore propose that if young, unmarried, pregnant women wish to establish an independent household at public expense, they should be given this support only on the condition that they live in some kind of family shelter or group home managed under private auspices, including religious groups. Part of the welfare reform debate currently raging in Washington focuses on the so-called Ashcroft Amendment, sponsored by Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri. The amendment states that nothing in the proposed welfare reform bill shall prevent religious groups from providing social services to welfare recipients on an equal basis with secular groups. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is not clear what is meant by "services," or how funds would be transferred to these groups. But it is sending the message to young women that the character of the children they are raising is so important to this society that we insist they raise them in a truly adult setting provided by one of a variety of private organizations. And we will reinforce this by saying that your check cannot be cashed unless it is cosigned by the person who manages the program. You are free to choose the program -- secular or religious -- you wish to join. But we will not fund you to set up an independent household, given what we know about the harm it does to the children. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Up to this point I have said nothing about the other half of the equation -- the men involved. The riskiest policy for a male observer is to act as if this were a problem created by women that could be solved by placing more constraints on women. But let me clarify a few points from the perspective of someone who has been researching the history of families and fatherhood around the world. Men and women differ in their willingness to make a commitment to the welfare of a child. This can be established by the simple fact that in any culture where there are single-parent families, more than 90 percent of them are headed by women. This cannot happen by accident. If it were simply a matter of cultural convention, you would find places where half or more of single parent families were headed by men. But you do not. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Men and women differ due to evolution, biology, and a variety of other factors. But since women care for children when men will not, much of civilization has been devoted to the problem of disciplining males. Society in all cultures has invented a few techniques to get males to play their role. When I was growing up, young unmarried women who got pregnant had a couple of choices. They either went away to live with relatives, had the child, then returned while the relatives raised the child, or they told their fathers and brothers the identity of the father of the child. The father and brothers then told the boy, "Either you marry the girl or we will beat you to death." The other option for the boy was to run away and join the Navy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; None of those options seems to work anymore. The force of custom and shame is no longer as powerful as it once was. The law once played a role in forcing men to take responsibility by requiring that paternity be clarified. Women once played a role by denying sexual access to men unwilling to make a commitment. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If you want to summarize in hyperbolic terms what the core problem of character formation is today, it is that the only one of these forces that still operates is the woman's willingness to say "no." In place of law, we have no-fault divorce. In place of custom and shame, we have created a sense that everyone should "do his own thing." And fathers and brothers, far from beating up someone who has impregnated a daughter without marrying her, are themselves busy with other people's daughters. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Unfortunately, this leaves the burden on women. But women should not bear the burden alone; the state should be on their side. To the extent it can, it is desirable for the state to enforce the obligations of paternity. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This has proven to be extremely difficult. For several years, particularly since Congress passed the Family Support Act in 1988, programs have been in place to get states to devise ways of collecting child-support payments from absent fathers. Many states have vigorously pursued the fathers, but have not collected much money. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But again we are moving away from the core problem. The key is not to supply dollars, but to supply the father. It is his presence, not just his money, that has been lost. The average child raised by a mother only sees his father a few times a year. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The problem of reconstituting this character-forming institution cannot be solved by government. But I would suggest that just as we have formed and are encouraging charter schools, we should form and encourage "charter families" --  private-sector groups that are willing to accept government money to provide long-term shelters for young girls who cannot or will not live with their own parents and who have children with no fathers to take care of them. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I have no idea whether this will work. But we must encourage this type of experimentation. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Money is going to flow from Washington to the states in the form of block grants. With some degree of restriction, states will have the opportunity to design and implement their own welfare programs. Most states will reproduce less expensive forms of the current system. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But I hope the states will use this opportunity to tear up the old script. Leave the existing system intact for women who need it as a bridge to get through death, desertion, or divorce, and will leave welfare in two or three years. But provide a radically different option, privately run and with a built-in social structure, for those young girls who are now raising the next generation of our children. <P><I><b>James Q.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In 1863, President Lincoln signed a charter establishing a home for orphans and "unprotected females" --  as unwed mothers were then known -- just a few blocks from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Last September, during the Senate's contentious welfare-reform debate, there was a rare moment of bipartisan agreement as Senate Democrats were joined by Mr. Lincoln's party in nearly unanimous support of a similar institution: the "second-chance home." In an amendment later adopted by the House of Representatives, the U.S. Congress went on record in support of reviving an old institution -- the maternity home -- in a new form.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Second-Chance Home amendment, offered by Democratic Senators Kent Conrad and Joseph Lieberman, would provide $150 million in seed money for states to support community-based residences for welfare mothers under 18. Young women whose own families are unstable would be required to live under adult supervision in these homes with their children as a condition of receiving welfare. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This provision was included in the welfare-reform bill vetoed by President Clinton. But the idea and its principles already are attracting broad support. States and communities are not waiting for federal funding. The "second-chance home" may become a new social institution. And even more importantly, it may offer a model for partnerships between government and communities that restore values to social programs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;One reason that second-chance homes are becoming popular is that they are practical. They are designed to deal with the realities of teen mothers' lives rather than the stereotype that they are simply promiscuous young women having babies to get welfare checks. Remember, these women have been badly nurtured. Many have been subjected to neglect or physical violence. Studies show that as many as two-thirds were victims of rape or sexual abuse at an early age-crimes often committed by males living in the same household. Many suffer from mental and emotional problems. They are easy prey for older men. The Alan Guttmacher Institute reports that almost two-thirds of teenage mothers' babies are fathered by men who are 20 or older.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Finally, the life prospects of teenage mothers are severely limited by their lack of socialization: They raise their children as their parents raised them; they model their social behavior after peers from the same neighborhoods. They have few role models for any other life.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For many of these young women, it will take a new home and a new family -- a second-chance home. Communities as varied as Los Angeles, New Albany, Indiana, and Wheeling, West Virginia, are offering such homes. There are several hundred of them around the country, mostly privately funded. While the homes differ in structure, they all offer three common elements that teen welfare mothers need to change their lives: socialization, nurturing and support, and structure and discipline.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These homes offer a genuine social contract. The young mothers must help with household duties, stay in school or job training, and take good care of their children. They must stay drug free and abide by curfews. They learn to manage money and manage conflicts. In return, they get help with day care and health care and schoolwork. They get protection from violent family members and abusive boyfriends. Most importantly, the teen mothers receive the support of caring adults and lessons in everyday living.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The notion that government has a fundamental obligation to help these young mothers is one Democrats have long supported. But the idea these young women owe society a reciprocal obligation is one that some in the party have resisted. The welfare debate signaled a change: Many Democrats are ready to abandon the moral relativism that has characterized liberal social policy. While those on the party's far left still argue for an unfettered right to public support, a growing number of Democrats are willing to impose standards on welfare mothers, sending a powerful message that society no longer offers unconditional financial support for women who bear children out of wedlock. Senator Lieberman, in offering his amendment, called a system that supports the birth of children to young unwed mothers "profoundly troubling" and one that "does not reflect the best values of our country." Many Democrats, it seems, are ready to reassert the importance of values in social policy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Republicans have traditionally been more comfortable talking about values, but less willing to acknowledge a basic government role in assuring the welfare of citizens in need. And to be sure, many conservative Republicans -- those who would cut off public aid to teen mothers under 18 -- still take the callous and wrongheaded view that the fundamental goal of welfare reform is to punish illegitimacy. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But Democrats and Republicans in a number of states -- including Massachusetts, Iowa, Maryland, and California -- are working together to create second-chance homes. If these political leaders are wise, they will continue on their bipartisan path: They will support the Democrats' assertion of a fundamental role for government in social problems, and they will heed the Republicans' insistence on the importance of values.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Whose values? The values of communities. If second-chance homes are created as real "community-based" institutions, they will begin to remedy one of the unintended consequences of the New Deal. For when government assumed primary responsibility for poor families, communities were relieved of obligations to care for their own citizens, and the notion of social reciprocity disappeared. Government became a wedge between communities and individuals, providing each group excuses to ignore its obligations to the other.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Second-chance homes should not be "government-run" or purely government-funded. They should be run by community-based institutions, including churches and non-profit organizations. That is how the most effective homes for teen mothers are now run. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Teen Parent Residence in Albuquerque, New Mexico, offers an example. The program, based in a cluster of low-income apartment units subsidized by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, costs the state just $67,500 for services to 14 teen mothers and their children for one year. The young mothers, who are enrolled in the federal Job Corps, use their welfare checks to pay below-market rent for the apartments they share. The state pays for an apartment in the cluster for the resident "house mother," for a night-duty nurse, and for some professional counseling services. Virtually everything else comes from the community.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The local health clinic teaches the young mothers about child development. The Agricultural Extension service teaches nutrition classes. Local youth groups offer baby-sitting services. Albuquerque's Hispano Chamber of Commerce not only donates money to the program, it hires the program's graduates. Families from local churches take the mothers and children home for Sunday dinner-and sometimes to Sunday services as well. The young women and children who live in the Teen Parent Residence have become part of the community. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is possible, of course, to spend much more money on residential facilities for young mothers. In New York state, group homes staffed and run entirely by professionals cost more than $50,000 a year per mother and child. While this approach guarantees uniform standards, it also guarantees that the young mothers will live in isolation from their communities. These expensive, bureaucratic institutions reinforce the old paternalistic notion of the left that government can invent a program to solve every problem. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Second-Chance Home legislation takes an important step away from bureaucratic rigidity by specifying that beneficiaries of federal programs can't be discriminated against if they live in these group homes. This means, for example, that young mothers won't lose their food-stamp benefits if they cook and eat together -- something current food-stamp regulations prohibit. In practical terms, it means that a small community-based organization that wants to help four or five teen mothers won't have to apply for federal waivers so young women can keep their food-stamp income and use it to buy groceries for the home. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Now as welfare decisions shift to state policymakers, they, too, must resist urges to overregulate and micromanange. Governors and legislators deciding how to set policies for second-chance homes should use these principles for guidelines:
<p><ul><li>	Funding should be used as Congress intended -- as seed money. It should go only to communities that pledge broad community involvement and a match of in-kind services.<p>
<li>	Churches and other religiously affiliated institutions have a long history of service to families; these organizations should be eligible for public funding to continue providing services.<p>
<li>	Evaluate them on what they accomplish. Judge the homes by the number of mothers who don't get pregnant a second time, the number who finish school, and the number who get off welfare. This would allow providers to help teen mothers by whatever means work. <p>
<li>	Government's monopoly over social policy is quickly eroding. In response to this change, government must offer communities a new "bargain." Government must catalyze and support the efforts of communities. At the same time, government policy should be consistent with a declaration by our nation's civic, moral, and community leaders that it is wrong -- not simply foolish or impractical -- for women and men to make babies they cannot support. In this way, government can help reestablish the importance of values -- those of communities and families -- in social policy. That is the best way to define a social agenda for the next century.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;St. Ann's, the institution that Lincoln chartered, still operates today just outside of Washington, D.C. And though the lives of its residents are vastly different from its first beneficiaries, they still meet Lincoln's definition of "unprotected females." They are still young women who need society's support to make decent lives for their children. Politicians of both parties who revere Lincoln should heed his wisdom.<p><I><b>Kathleen Sylvester</b> is the vice president for domestic policy at the <a href="http://www.dlcppi.org/">Progressive Policy Institute</a>.</I>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Just weeks after telling the nation, in this year's State of the Union address, that the "era of big government is over," Bill Clinton indicated that the obituary notice was somewhat premature when he delivered his a 20-page FY 1997 budget to Congress. In contrast to the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 (BBA), which he vetoed last fall, the latest Clinton budget would mean $1,927 in higher taxes and $3,155 in higher spending for every household in America over the next seven years. This is the eighth budget plan Clinton has delivered to Congress in a year; and, except for the FY 1996 budget submitted last February (which called for $200 billion deficits through the end of the decade), each has been short on specifics and long on promises.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While Clinton claims his FY 1997 budget will eliminate the federal deficit by FY 2002 using Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates, it does so only by using the same assortment of smoke, mirrors, and other gimmicks that has made taxpayers increasingly cynical about Washington's commitment to budget-making. Even worse, although the Clinton budget balances on paper, it flinches from making the tough decisions needed to eliminate wasteful and outmoded programs, end welfare as we know it, save Medicare from bankruptcy, or transfer failing federal programs to the states.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The FY 1997 Clinton budget is not the end of big government, it is the embodiment of it. Clinton's plan, for example:
<ul>
<li>Increases federal spending by $361 billion over the next seven years and hikes tax revenues by $526 billion;
<p>
<li>Spends a total of $12.16 trillion over the next seven years, or $306 billion more than the vetoed Balanced Budget Act of 1995. That means $3,155 more for every household in America;
<p>
<li>Raises a total of $11.4 trillion in tax revenues over seven years, $187 billion more than the BBA, and $1,927 more in taxes for every household in America;
<p>
<li>Allows $119 billion more deficit spending through 2002 than the BBA, which is equivalent to passing along $1,227 per household in debt to the next generation of American workers;
<p>
<li>Fails to eliminate a single program of any significance;
<p>
<li>Fails to eliminate even one Cabinet-level agency;
<p>
<li>Increases entitlement spending by $365 billion over the next seven years while failing to save Medicare from bankruptcy, end welfare as we know it, or protect states from the exploding costs of Medicaid; and
<p>
<li>Spends $111 billion more on discretionary programs than the BBA while calling for billions more in spending on programs that have failed or become obsolete, that duplicate others, or that should be transferred to state and local government control.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The FY 1997 Clinton budget signals not the end of big government, but the continuation of status-quo government.
<p>

<b>CLINTON 8, TAXPAYERS 0</b><sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Despite a campaign promise to balance the budget in five years while providing tax cuts for working families, President Clinton has consistently resisted congressional efforts to enact a balanced budget plan with tax cuts. In addition to vetoing the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, Clinton presented four budget plans to Congress during 1995 -- each time falling far short of balancing the budget, according to the Congressional Budget Office. After a year of prodding, Clinton presented a fifth budget plan on January 5, 1996. CBO certified -- at least on paper -- that this new proposal would balance the budget by 2002. Closer review of each of the budget plans proposed by Clinton during the past year, however, including the FY 1997 budget, shows that the White House has never been serious about either balancing the budget or providing meaningful tax relief. It seems interested only in finding ways to spend more taxpayer dollars while appearing to agree that the budget should be balanced.
<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #1</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In February 1995, the Clinton Administration responded to the 1994 election results by presenting a status-quo FY 1996 budget to the new Congress. This budget deviated little from "baseline" forecasts which projected $200 billion deficits through the end of the decade. According to CBO, the President's February budget would increase the deficit from an estimated $177 billion in 1995 to $276 billion in 2000. Spending would grow an average of 5 percent per year, some $422 billion in all in just five years. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The February Clinton budget did propose a few modest privatization initiatives, such as selling the Power Marketing Administrations, portions of the Strategic Petroleum Reserves, the Naval Petroleum Reserves, and portions of the National Weather Service. It also proposed terminating a few small programs and consolidating some 270 programs into 27 new programs. In addition, the budget proposed a "Middle Class Bill of Rights" which included a modest $300-per-child tax credit for families that have children below age 13 and who earn less than $60,000 per year. But the Administration did little to fight for any of these proposals. On May 19, the Senate defeated Clinton's budget plan by a vote of 99 to 0.
<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #2</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;On June 13, 1995, after months of criticizing congressional efforts while offering no plan of his own, Clinton presented a second budget plan which he claimed balanced the budget in ten years, by FY 2005. This Clinton plan, barely 30 pages in length, fared no better than his first effort under CBO scrutiny. According to CBO, in addition to not balancing the budget, this plan would produce $200 billion deficits for at least the next ten years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The second budget plan also included the modest tax cut for families with children in addition to tax deductions for higher education and expanded Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Due to revised economic forecasts, the Administration later said that this plan would balance the budget in nine years. However, the CBO maintained that it would never balance the budget. Indeed, CBO found less than $400 billion in legitimate deficit reduction in this Clinton offer -- $350 billion short of the total seven-year deficit reduction in the Balanced Budget Act.
<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #3</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;On December 7, the day Clinton vetoed the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, he presented yet a third budget plan. The Administration claimed that this plan also would balance the budget in seven years but was more in line with the President's priorities than the one he had vetoed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Once again, CBO found that the Administration's numbers failed to reach a balanced budget by 2002. While this plan proposed larger savings from discretionary spending programs and welfare reform than the June budget, it also proposed smaller savings in Medicare and Medicaid. In total, Clinton's third budget produced only $385 billion in credible deficit reduction over seven years -- $365 billion short of the savings achieved by the BBA he had vetoed. Moreover, according to the CBO, instead of balancing the budget in FY 2002 as advertised, it would leave a deficit of $115 billion in that year.
<P>
<b>Clinton Budget #4</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;On December 15, after two weeks of negotiations with congressional leaders, Clinton presented a fourth budget plan. But this plan was mostly an iteration of Budget Plan #3 and contained no new policy recommendations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The CBO scored this plan as $69 billion out of balance in FY 2002. The Administration tried to make up for its shortcomings in reducing the deficit by challenging CBO technical and economic estimates. The Administration had been arguing for weeks that CBO's economic assumptions were too conservative and thus required excessively deep spending cuts to balance the budget. In other words, the Administration wanted to have it both ways: Claiming that it wanted to balance the budget, it actually wanted to spend more money as the budget was moving toward balance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;On December 18, the House defeated this plan by a vote of 412 to 0.
<p>

<b>Clinton Budget #5</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;On January 6, 1996, Clinton presented a fifth budget plan to Congress. This plan, largely adapted from a proposal by Senate Democrats, was certified by CBO to balance the budget in seven years, at least on paper. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is likely that Clinton never would have submitted this plan had it not been for the conditions Congress included in the continuing resolution passed on January 5, 1996. These conditions stipulated, in effect, that a bill to provide operating funds for unappropriated federal programs through January 26 would not be sent to the President until he submitted a seven-year balanced budget plan scored by the CBO. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Though it mathematically balances the budget in seven years, the fifth Clinton budget falls far short of being credible. The reasons: 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the fifth Clinton budget, most of the heavy lifting of deficit reduction was required in the two years following the end of Clinton's possible second term as President. Indeed, 62 percent of the plan's $583 billion in deficit reduction fell in FY 2001 and FY 2002. For example, the plan called for $102 billion in Medicare savings over seven years, but 63 percent of these savings was to come in the last two years. Similarly, the plan called for $37 billion in discretionary spending cuts beyond the savings needed to achieve a "hard freeze" in these programs, yet 95 percent of these additional savings fell in the last two years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While the fifth Clinton budget plan called for $87 billion in gross tax cuts ($17 billion in net tax cuts) over seven years, these cuts were "sunsetted" in FY 2001 -- one year before the budget would be balanced. This means taxes would have to be raised. Mathematically, such a ploy "boosts" tax revenues by at least $15 billion in FY 2002 and thus requires fewer spending cuts to achieve a balanced budget. The overall size of the tax cut proposal is reduced by the plan's call for $60 billion in new revenue from closing "corporate loopholes." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Some 43 percent of the revenues generated from these tax hikes would be received in FY 2002.
<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #6</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The sixth Clinton plan was submitted to Congress on January 9. It moved only slightly beyond the previous plans, modestly increasing the proposed savings from Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare reform while boosting the net size of the tax cuts to $85 billion. Overall, this Clinton plan would produce nearly $160 billion less in budget savings than the last congressional offer and nearly $70 billion less in deficit reduction. Moreover, the White House still avoided the fundamental reforms in Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare needed to achieve budget savings and restructure the programs. 
<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #7</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The seventh Clinton plan was submitted to Congress on January 18. This budget plan was essentially identical to the January 9 plan except that it substantially increased the amount of new revenues it would generate from closing "corporate tax loopholes" and other such devices. Because of these new revenues, the net size of the tax cut would be reduced to a mere $36 billion over seven years.
<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #8: The FY 1997 Budget</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Like the seven budget plans that preceded it during the past year, the FY 1997 Clinton budget, presented to Congress February 5, would force hard-working Americans to pay higher taxes in exchange for more spending on programs which have become old and obsolete, or which are ripe for termination, privatization, or transfer to state control. Moreover, each plan ignores the fundamental problems facing the government's major entitlement and welfare programs. Clinton has shirked his responsibility to address, for instance, a Medicare program facing insolvency, a Medicaid program that is bankrupting state budgets, and a welfare system that perpetuates a culture of poverty.
<p>
<b>WHAT CLINTON'S FY 1997 BUDGET WOULD MEAN</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The eight Clinton budgets clearly demonstrate that this President envisions a government that has a balanced budget but somehow remains largely unchanged from government with perpetual $200 billion deficits. In other words, Clinton wants it both ways. He says he wants a balanced federal budget, but he is not willing to challenge the size and scope of government as a credible balanced budget plan requires.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The boldest proposal the Administration can muster is to "reinvent government," which, in practice, amounts to putting a new paint job on a house whose foundation is collapsing under its own weight. American taxpayers sent government a very clear message in the 1994 election: They do not want useless and obsolete programs merely to waste their money more efficiently. They want the budget to be balanced in a timely fashion, and they want the result of this effort to be a smaller, less costly government.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton FY 1997 budget would leave less money in the pockets of working families and more money in the hands Washington's big spenders.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It spends money taxpayers cannot afford. The 20-page FY 1997 Clinton budget proposes to "balance the budget" in FY 2002 while boosting spending $361 billion over the next seven years. It would spend a total of $12.16 trillion over the next seven years, $306 billion more than would be spent under the Balanced Budget Act the President vetoed last December. This amounts to $3,155 more government spending for every household in America. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It takes more of their money in tax revenues. The Clinton budget assumes federal tax collections will grow an astonishing $526 billion by FY 2002, a jump of nearly 39 percent. Also, the Administration expects the government to collect a total of $11.4 trillion in tax revenues over the next seven years, $187 billion more than under the BBA. This amounts to $1,927 more in taxes for every household in America. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It adds to tomorrow's debt burden. Because the Clinton budget fails to control federal spending, it would add $755 billion in accumulated deficits to the national debt, even while promising to balance the budget over seven years. Compared to the BBA, this is $119 billion more deficit spending over seven years, equivalent to transferring $1,227 per household in added debt to the next generation of American workers.
<p>

<b>Balancing the Budget Without Lifting a Finger</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As was the case with Clinton's previous "balanced budget" plans, the only way the FY 1997 budget can be made to balance -- at least on paper -- is by leaving the real work of deficit reduction to a future President and Congress. How does it do this?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>First, the Clinton plan purports to save nearly $596 billion over the next seven years, but less than 40 percent of these savings is achieved during the first five years.</b> The painful task of accomplishing 61 percent of the plan's deficit reduction falls to the first Congress and President elected in the next century. Indeed, some 54 percent of the plan's Medicare savings and 60 percent of its Medicaid savings will fall beyond a possible second Clinton term in office.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Second, while Clinton claims his budget balances according to Congressional Budget Office assumptions, it does not. Clinton makes his job of balancing the budget in FY 2002 easier by challenging or ignoring CBO assumptions</b>.<sup>2</sup>  For instance, CBO currently projects a $228 billion deficit in FY 2002. Clinton, however, reduces that projection to $221 billion by challenging one of CBO's technical assumptions, thereby avoiding the need to cut $7 billion in spending. Also, Clinton's budget uses Office of Management and Budget (OMB) estimates of proposed spectrum auction proceeds, rather than CBO estimates, to produce an additional $11 billion in deficit reduction in FY 2002 -- again, to avoid having to produce real spending cuts. The Senate Budget Committee reports that if honest accounting methods were used, Clinton's budget would produce a $9 billion deficit in FY 2002, not the balance the Administration claims.
<p>
<b>Modest Tax Cuts, More Tax Increases</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton budget also manipulates its proposed tax cuts in order to avoid having to make tough choices on curbing spending. The budget proposes a meager $98.5 billion in gross tax cuts over seven years, equivalent to returning just 8 cents of every $1,000 in taxes the government expects to collect. The centerpiece of the plan is a tax credit for dependent children that begins at $300 per child and increases to $500 per child in 1999.<sup>3</sup> However, Clinton "sunsets" the child credit after FY 2001, increasing taxes on these families by over $17 billion in 2002 -- the year Clinton promises to balance the budget.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton budget proposes to generate $59.4 billion in new tax revenues by "cutting corporate tax subsidies, closing loopholes, and improving tax compliance."<sup>4</sup> This amount exceeds the Administration's proposed seven-year savings in Medicaid ($59 billion) and is nearly 50 percent greater than its proposed welfare cuts ($40 billion). These new revenues effectively reduce the net size of the tax cut package to $39 billion, equal to a cut of just 3 cents for every $1,000 taxpayers will send Washington over the next seven years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;One of the major contributing factors in the Clinton budget's ability to "balance" the budget in FY 2002 is the temporary nature of the tax cuts combined with the permanent nature of the new tax revenues. The new tax measures purportedly generate $11.9 billion in FY 2002. When this amount is added to the $17 billion tax hike on families resulting from the unseating of the child tax credit, the result is $29 billion in deficit reduction, roughly 15 percent of Clinton's total deficit savings in FY 2002. Again, there is no need to make tough choices on real spending cuts.
<p>

<b>The Failure to Address Exploding Entitlement Growth</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Regrettably, Clinton proposes no credible solutions to the serious problems facing the nation's major entitlement programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare. The meager savings the Administration proposes to achieve from these programs fall far short of stemming the tide of red ink in the near term -- and far short of the fundamental changes needed to keep these programs from collapsing. The White House has been warned repeatedly of the need to curb runaway entitlements:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;CBO projects that, if nothing is done to slow the overall growth of entitlement programs, they will grow by $465 billion over the next seven years, a 63 percent increase. Worse yet, CBO expects entitlements to consume 57 cents of every dollar spent by the federal government in 2002 -- over 8 cents more than is spent today.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The long-term forecasts reported by the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform, headed by Senators Robert Kerry (D-NE) and John Danforth (R-MO, now retired), are even more troubling. These projections suggest that entitlements will become a liability that cannot be sustained by the federal government, by the economy, or by the taxpayers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Some examples of the Commission's findings:
<blockquote><p>
<b>Example:</b> "The gap between Federal spending and revenues is growing rapidly. Absent policy changes, entitlement spending and interest on the national debt will consume almost all Federal revenues in 2010. In 2030, Federal revenues will not even cover entitlement spending."<sup>5</sup>
<p>
<b>Example:</b> "By 2030, unless appropriate policy changes are made in the interim, projected spending for Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and Federal employee retirement programs alone will consume all tax revenues.... If all other Federal programs (except interest on the national debt) grow no faster than the economy, total Federal outlays would exceed 37 percent of the economy. Today, outlays are 22 percent of the economy.... "<sup>6</sup>
<p>
<b>Example:</b> "The share of Medicare Part B cost paid by enrollees as monthly premiums has been shrinking since the program began. When the program started, the enrollee and the Federal government had a 50-50 partnership -- each paid 50 percent of the cost. Today, the Federal government pays 70 percent of Part B costs; by 2030 the government's share is projected to increase to 92 percent."<sup>7</sup>
<p></blockquote>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Entitlements grow as a share of budget. </b>Under the proposed FY 1997 Clinton budget, overall entitlement spending would increase by $365 billion (nearly 50 percent) over the next seven years. While the Clinton plan would slow the aggregate growth rate of these programs to an average of roughly 6 percent per year from a CBO-projected average of 7.2 percent per year, entitlement programs will increase substantially as a share of the overall federal budget. Currently, mandatory programs consume 48.7 cents of every dollar spent by the federal government. The Clinton budget plan would increase the share of federal spending dedicated to these programs to 58.8 cents of every federal dollar by FY 2002.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;One reason is Clinton's failure to address significantly the systemic problems within these programs. The other reason is that Clinton's budget plan achieves more than 55 percent of its overall deficit savings from discretionary programs -- which comprise just 36 percent of federal spending. As these annually appropriated programs shrink as a share of total spending, a greater share of the federal budget is consumed by "uncontrolled" entitlement spending.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Medicare is left at risk.</b> In April 1995, the Medicare Trustees issued a warning that the Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund was in severe financial imbalance and that Congress should take "timely action to establish long term financial stability for the program."<sup>8</sup> Indeed, recent figures from the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) show that in 1995, the HI program paid out $35.7 million more in benefits than it took in through the HI payroll tax, thus forcing HCFA to reduce the trust fund's accrued balance to pay its bills. This is a sign that the HI trust fund, which is expected to go bankrupt by the year 2002, could face a financial crisis even earlier than has been feared.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Despite these warning signs, the Clinton Administration's Medicare reform proposal falls short of restoring the long-term solvency of the program. Even though the President's budget promises to reduce the growth of Medicare spending by $124 billion over the next seven years compared to CBO projections, it provides too few details to justify such claims. The plan purports to allow beneficiaries more choices from the private sector, but it does not replace today's defined benefit program with a defined contribution program that truly gives America's seniors an unprecedented opportunity to choose their own health plan and range of benefits.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Furthermore, the President's budget proposal maintains a heavy taxpayer subsidy of Medicare's Part B premiums by requiring beneficiaries to pay only 25 percent of Part B program costs. The original Part B program required beneficiaries to pay premiums which reflected one-half of program costs. Maintaining the taxpayer subsidy at 75 percent means there are not enough incentives to encourage enrollees to compare the costs and benefits of more efficient private alternatives with the costs and benefits of the Part B program. The more the subsidy is reduced, the more level the playing field between private-sector plans and government. The elderly would have incentives to choose more efficient plans in the private sector. The likely result: not just a reduction in the subsidy, but a significant reduction in gross budget outlays for Medicare.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>More Medicaid costs are shifted to the states.</b> The Clinton Medicaid reform proposal would exacerbate the crisis facing most state governments: growing Medicaid costs that are siphoning off precious resources from such other priorities such as education, prisons, and infrastructure. Heritage Foundation analysts have calculated that "if no changes are made to current law, the states and the District of Columbia probably will need to raise taxes or cut other spending by $146 billion over seven years in order to meet their mandated obligations."<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Clinton's proposal would control federal Medicaid costs by some $59 billion over seven years by implementing a "per capita cap" on the amount Washington sends to states to provide health care for the poor and elderly. But this purported reform retains Medicaid's existing entitlement structure by maintaining most of the current eligibility requirements in Title XIX of the Social Security Act. Maintaining these federal strings could impose an additional $47.4 billion in Medicaid costs on already financially strapped states.<sup>10</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Limiting federal Medicaid expenditures while increasing the financial exposure of the states is irresponsible. The President's proposal does not allow states the flexibility they need to design benefit packages or other major program parameters. If the federal government is going to cap its Medicaid expenditures, the states must be allowed to establish new benefit packages, provider reimbursement systems, and -- most important -- eligibility criteria. While the Administration's proposal allows for some limited changes in managed care enrollment, it represents a large unfunded mandate to the states because they will not have the freedom to control costs as dictated by the federal per capita caps. The magnitude of an such an unfunded mandate will vary from state to state because of differences in population. However, a large state, such as California, could face additional costs of $4.4 billion from the per capita cap.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Welfare reform ignores the root causes of poverty.</b> The Clinton welfare reform proposal will hardly make a dent in the massive federal welfare system that has cost taxpayers $5.5 trillion since 1965. The federal welfare system is a vast network of 78 interrelated, overlapping, means-tested programs designed to assist poor or low-income Americans. The cost to all levels of government was $350 billion in 1994, with Washington contributing 72 percent. This amounts to $3,400 for every taxpaying household in America.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Clinton proposes to trim the welfare state by an unnoticeable $40 billion over the next seven years. Real reform would send programs back to the states with only a few necessary strings attached, but the Clinton plan keeps the existing structure of federal anti-poverty programs and talks vaguely about giving flexibility to the states. Clinton also talks in tough terms about imposing real work requirements on welfare recipients but the reforms drafted by the Administration contain only sham work requirements.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The most serious flaw in the Clinton welfare plan is its failure to address one of the major root causes of poverty: illegitimacy. Since 1965, the percentage of children born out of wedlock has grown from 7 percent of all children to 32 percent -- an almost five-fold increase. Rather than deal substantively with this problem, the Clinton plan simply tries to address the symptoms by spending more on job training and child care programs. 
<p>
<b>Spending Initiatives That Outweigh Spending Cuts</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While stating that "government should not do for individuals what they can do for themselves," the Clinton budget outlines a sweeping agenda of spending initiatives in areas such as education, high technology, crime fighting, and the environment. Remarkably, the discussion of this new spending falls under the heading "Spurring Economic Growth," thus confirming the Administration's strange and obsolete notion that directed government spending, not private spending, is the key to creating jobs and economic growth. Nowhere, however, does Clinton's budget provide even a hint of how it intends to achieve the $297 billion in discretionary spending cuts that comprise 55 percent of its deficit reduction plan. These details, presumably, will be outlined in the Administration's full FY 1997 budget, due to be published this month.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Clinton's spending initiatives would add yet another layer of bureaucracy to the hundreds of failed programs currently funded in the federal budget in areas the President claims are priorities. Clinton has an obligation to explain to taxpayers why these hundreds of existing programs have failed, and why they have not been eliminated, before trying to justify pumping even more money into these areas.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Some of these new spending priorities include:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Job training.</b> The budget proudly states that the Administration has shifted more money into job training programs and would increase funding for Skill Grants for dislocated workers. Yet: 
<p><ul>
<li>The General Accounting Office (GAO) reports that 14 separate federal departments and agencies currently fund some 164 job training programs at a cost to taxpayers of roughly $25 billion per year. Moreover, the few controlled studies that have been conducted show that these programs have little or no success either in putting people to work or in raising their wages.
</ul><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Education.</b> The Administration claims it has shifted more money to education programs such as Goals 2000 and the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities program. Now Clinton wants new programs to "connect every classroom to the information super-highway," in addition to expanded work-study for college students, merit scholarships for high school students, and charter schools. Yet: 
<p><ul>
<li>The Department of Education already manages roughly 240 programs, dozens of them targeted to the same students for whom Clinton would create new programs. Indeed, Goals 2000 does little to benefit students; it primarily funds state bureaucracies and duplicates many programs currently operated by the states. Also, many states already are experimenting with reform initiatives such as charter schools and do not need Washington's help. Moreover, there are some 240 programs targeted to "at-risk youth" scattered throughout such agencies as the Departments of Education, Health and Human Services, Justice, and Labor. Creating more programs targeted to these young people only adds to the bureaucracy.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Science and technology "investments."</b>  The Clinton budget places great emphasis on maintaining Administration's investments in high-technology spending. Yet:
<p><ul>
<li>These myriad "investment" programs have turned out to be little more than expensive corporate welfare. There is evidence to suggest that these programs not only do not create jobs, but actually may induce the recipient corporations to downsize their research and development departments.<sup>11</sup> Many corporations figure there is no reason to fund their own R&D if Washington will pick up the tab for them.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Crime.</b> The Clinton budget "fully funds the President's Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) initiative," which the Administration claims will put 100,000 new police officers on the street. Clinton claims this program is responsible for the hiring of 23,000 new policemen to date. Yet:
<p><ul>
<li> The problem with Clinton's promise to put 100,000 new police officers on the street by 2000 is that the math does not work. The 1994 crime bill, which authorized the COPS initiative, provided $8.4 billion in federal funds over six years, enough money either to put only 20,000 permanent new policemen on the street or to pay 100,000 officers less than $15,000 per year. Since police officers make more than the minimum wage, state and local governments that accept these federal funds will have to finance the remaining cost themselves -- a cost that could total $28 billion over six years.<sup>12</sup> Congress would change this program from a matching grant to a simple block grant, allowing local governments to use the funds for other law enforcement-related purposes such as purchasing equipment, paying overtime, and establishing neighborhood programs. Clinton has rejected these reforms, and the reason is obvious: Block granting the funds will not force local governments to pay for Clinton's campaign promises. 
</ul>
<p>

<b>Discretionary Spending "Cuts"</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton FY 1997 budget proposes to spend $111 billion more on discretionary programs than the Balanced Budget Act the President vetoed, while claiming to save $297 billion over seven years from these programs. How can this be true?  The truth is these savings are calculated from the CBO "baseline," which projects higher spending on discretionary programs in future years. Thus, simply freezing aggregate spending on these programs at FY 1995 levels "saves" $258 billion over seven years. The roughly $40 billion in additional "savings" (bringing the total to $297 billion) is due to Clinton's proposal to spend less in future years, below what was spent in 1995. However, the Clinton budget would implement 95 percent of these cuts in FY 2001 and FY 2002, thus leaving the tough decisions to a future President and Congress.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The era of big government is far from over. The Administration's repeated use of gimmicks and accounting ploys to "balance the budget" casts doubt on its sincerity in negotiating a balanced budget plan with Congress. At every turn, Clinton fought attempts to cut spending, or even to reduce the growth in spending. Clinton challenged CBO's conservative economic assumptions because they required greater savings to balance the budget. In other words, he wanted more money for favored programs while claiming to support a balanced budget. Clinton repeatedly called on Congress to reduce the size of the BBA's tax cut package, not because eliminating the tax cuts would balance the budget any faster (say in five years rather than seven), but because smaller tax cuts would allow more money for government spending. The record is clear: Bill Clinton prefers keeping money in the hands of Washington bureaucrats to keeping it in the pockets of American taxpayers.

(Updating Asian Studies Center <a href="asc139.html"><I>Backgrounder</I> No. 139</a>, "China's Threats to Taiwan Challenge U.S. Leadership in Asia," March 6, 1996)
</center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Early in the morning of March 8, China fired three nuclear-capable missiles into two areas close to the Republic of China on Taiwan as part of missile "tests" that will last until March 15. Moreover, from March 12 to March 20, China will hold large-scale naval military exercises that use live ammunition, also in an area close to Taiwan. These military actions are targeted at the ROC's March 23 presidential election and mark an escalation in Beijing's campaign to intimidate the citizens and leadership of democratic Taiwan. Beijing has designed the missile tests to emphasize China's ability to blockade Taiwan. The three missiles fired on March 8 fell into two zones astride Taiwan's two largest ports, and Beijing has warned commercial air and sea traffic to steer clear. The tests threaten both Taiwan's economic well-being and the safety of its citizens. They also stand as test of Washington's leadership and resolve, and challenge America's historic interest in maintaining freedom of the seas.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton Administration's March 10 decision to dispatch U.S. Navy aircraft carrier groups to waters near Taiwan to deter possible Chinese escalation was correct. Congress's response to these latest threats against Taiwan also has been strong. Speaker Newt Gingrich, for example, said they amounted to "an act of terror."  But while State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns called the missile tests "reckless and potentially dangerous," another State Department official told <I>The New York Times</I> the tests did not amount to an act of terror. Washington should protest China's missile intimidation in the strongest terms, reaffirm America's commitment to defending freedom of the seas, review U.S. commitments to Taiwan as stipulated in the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, and accelerate the introduction of U.S. missile defense systems into Asia.
<p>
<b>CHINA'S MISSILE CAMPAIGN TO THREATEN TAIWAN</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;China is the only Asian country using nuclear-capable missiles to intimidate its neighbors. The tests which will last from March 8 to March 15 mark the second time China has employed missiles to threaten the people of Taiwan. Last July 21 to 26, China launched four 1,125-mile-range DF-21 missiles and two 375-mile-range M-9 missiles into an area roughly 90 miles north of Taiwan. Both the DF-21 and the M-9 are designed to carry conventional, chemical, or nuclear warheads. So far, the M-9 has been used in the latest tests, which target two areas of roughly 500 square miles each. One target area is located about 30 miles off the northern coast of Taiwan, east of the port of Keelung. The second is 47 miles directly west of the southern port of Kaohsiung.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Clear Escalation of Tension.</b> The new missile tests mark a clear escalation in China's pressure against Taiwan. The location of the northern target area raises the possibility that Chinese missiles may fly over Taiwanese territory, possibly even the capital city of Taipei. The failure of one M-9 missile in last July's exercise also raises the danger of an accidental strike on Taiwan. Moreover, the March tests follow months of threats. For example, during an early 1996 trip to China, former Clinton Administration Pentagon official Charles Freeman reportedly was told that China "has prepared plans for a missile attack against Taiwan consisting of one conventional missile strike a day for 30 days." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As also occurred in July, the current tests are taking place alongside large-scale Chinese ground and naval exercises in areas near Taiwan. The latest exercises have featured practicing the largest airborne assault ever conducted by China, as well as a huge amphibious exercise aimed at Taiwan. And from March 12 to 20, naval exercises using live munitions will take place close to major air and sea routes in the Taiwan Strait.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Virtual Blockade.</b> These new missile tests and naval exercises amount to a blockade of major air and sea lanes critical to Taiwan's survival. The southern port of Kaohsiung and the northern port of Keelung account for about 70 percent of Taiwan's trade, and exports account for about 40 percent of Taiwan's gross domestic product. Because of these tests, some shipping will have to be diverted. Moreover, about 30 flights a day that use routes near the northern test site will have to be re-routed. China's missile intimidation has damaged Taiwan's economy and threatens the economic confidence of the people of Taiwan. The March 4 announcement of the missile tests caused the Taiwan stock market to drop by 62 points the next day; the stock market has fallen 625 points since July 1995. The missile tests also have caused panic buying of gold, and the Taiwan government has had to reassure people that food and fuel have been stockpiled in the event of a blockade. Missile strikes or damage to shipping will further depress investor confidence and cause shipping insurance rates to skyrocket.
<P>
<b>TIME FOR WASHINGTON TO SHOW RESOLVE</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;China's latest missile tests challenge America's interests in Asia. For over two centuries, the United States has defended freedom of the seas and stood for freedom of commerce. Indeed, these principles have been at the heart of America's open door approach to Asia and China. By using its military to create a virtual blockade near Taiwan's two major ports, and forcing a diversion of international air and sea traffic, China is challenging an enduring and vital American interest. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Beijing's actions also stand as a challenge to the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act (TRA). Section 2 of the TRA states that "It is the policy of the United States to consider any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, including boycotts or embargoes, a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific and of grave concern to the United States."  Section 3 directs the President "to inform Congress promptly of any threat to the security or economic system of the people of Taiwan.... " The tests also call into question the very basis on which the U.S. established relations with China: the assumption that Taiwan's status would be resolved peacefully by the Chinese themselves.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Above all, these tests are a challenge to American leadership and resolve in Asia. For over half a century, the United States has stood as the ultimate guarantor of stability and security in Asia. Given the stakes involved, the Clinton Administration's initial response to China's missile diplomacy was tragically weak. The Administration offered only a mild rebuke to China's missile tests in July 1995. Responding to the announcement of the current round of missile tests, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns argues that it is not "credible" to describe the missile tests as a blockade of Taiwan's ports. The Administration has yet to be as critical as former Clinton Administration CIA Director James Woolsey, who said the tests amount to a "de facto temporary and partial blockade [which is] aggressive, indefensible, dangerous.... " The Clinton Administration should undertake a stronger response to China's missiles. The U.S. should:
<p><ul>
<li>Strongly reject Beijing's use of military force. Since the U.S. is the only power able to deter China's threat to peace, the Administration should make clear to China that military action against Taiwan may undermine the basis for continued peaceful U.S.-PRC relations. The Administration should remind Chinese leaders that normalization of relations was premised on the peaceful resolution of Taiwan's status. The U.S. should tell China that its use of force against Taiwan threatens peace in Asia. 
<p>
<li> Reaffirm America's vital interest in the freedom of the seas. The Administration should inform China that its missile tests near Taiwan pose an unacceptable threat to internationally recognized freedom of the high seas and airways. Ships from the Japan-based 7th Fleet, now dispatched to international waters near Taiwan, should remain in this region after the March 23 election, both to deter China and to underscore U.S. commitment to freedom of the seas. The U.S. also should consult with Asian allies and friends regarding possible sanctions against Chinese sea and air carriers in the event the missile tests harm ships or aircraft.
<p>
<li> Report to Congress that China is posing a danger to Taiwan's economic system. These missile tests constitute an attempt to blockade Taiwan's ports and airports. They could presage a more deliberate attempt to blockade Taiwan. In accordance with the TRA, the Clinton Administration must report to Congress that these actions pose a threat to Taiwan's economy. 
<p>
<li> Sell Taiwan defensive arms consistent with the TRA. China's missile threats against Taiwan point to an urgent need for missile defense in the ROC. Thus, to enable Taiwan to defend itself against any possible missile attack, the U.S. should offer to sell the ROC the Patriot PAC-2 GEM missile defense system. This is the most modern operable missile defense system in America's arsenal. If China persists with its missile threats, the U.S. should sell Taiwan more advanced missile defense systems as they enter U.S. service. 
</ul><p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Beijing's latest missile tests near Taiwan's two major ports are, for Washington, an unacceptable escalation in China's attempt to undermine the free and democratic spirit of the people of Taiwan. These threatening tests, combined with large Chinese naval exercises, also constitute a direct challenge to key U.S. interests, including the peaceful resolution of Taiwan's future and maintaining the freedom of navigation in Asia. As the only nation capable of deterring China, the U.S. should strongly protest China's missile threats, reaffirm the freedom of the seas by deploying the 7th Fleet, and sell missile defense systems to Taiwan.

<h2>A Cop Next Door</h2>
<b>by Walter Oleksy</b>
</center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In 1991, the police department in Columbia, South Carolina, began offering low-interest mortgage loans to any officer willing to live in a high-crime or deteriorating neighborhood. One rundown house whose street address was 911 caught the attention of Officer James Brown. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"I told my wife, 'That house is meant for us,'" he says. Brown's wife and two young children weren't so sure. The one-story brick house needed repairs, and the neighborhood was suffering frequent burglaries.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The department offered the Browns a mortgage loan with a 4 percent interest rate and no money down. Their only out-of-pocket expense was $5 for a credit check. They bought the house for $70,000, including $28,000 in renovation costs, and have lived in it happily for more than four years. <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"I dreamed of having my own home, but never thought it would happen," says Brown. "My neighbors say they see a big difference since my family and I moved in and I park my squad car out front. They tell me they sleep feeling safer, knowing I'm living here with them. I think the police homeowner program is great for me and the city."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Brown did not know it at the time, but by buying and moving his family into the "911 house," he became one of the first police officers in the nation to take part in a small but growing and  successful element of community-policing programs across the nation. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"Police homeownership in high-risk neighborhoods is community-oriented policing at its very best," says Columbia police chief Charles Austin. "People in problem areas of our city used to complain that police aren't really sensitive to the problems of the community. 'Police don't live here,' they would say, 'so they don't really care what happens here.' Now they know that police officers live among them and do care."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Austin says the program is a major ingredient of his community-based policing plan. Overall crime rates have decreased 16 percent since 1991, and he attributes much of that  drop to the new home loan program, which induced 11 officers to move into some of the city's high-crime neighborhoods.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"Like most other cities, the fight against crime and deteriorating homes leads the list of needs," says Richard J. Semon, Columbia's community-development director. He says that the program has also furthered the goal of revitalizing the city's housing and promoting homeownership.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The results have been overwhelmingly positive: The ongoing presence of police can help sustain or renew a sense of stability to a community. Suzanne House, a neighbor of one of the Columbia policemen in the program, agrees. "We had police at our community meetings, but it wasn't quite the same, if they didn't live here. With a police officer and his family living here and parking his squad car in front of his house, it's made a big difference. It makes us neighbors feel more safe."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"There used to be a crack house a block away," says Columbia resident Brooks Dickerson. "Since a policeman moved in here, it's gone. The neighborhood's much quieter now." The program is improving neighborhoods in part because it transforms the attitudes of police patrolling those neighborhoods. "I used to just work the neighborhood," says Officer Charles Rowson. "Now I give it 150 percent more, because my family and I live here. I no longer leave it after my shift and figure it's someone else's problem." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"It makes you a better police officer if you live in the area you patrol," says Corporal Randy Blackwell. "I rode my patrol car around the area for several years, but didn't live there. Since I own a home in the neighborhood and know the people who live here, I have a totally different opinion of it and them. The city of Columbia is no longer just a place where I go to work. It's where I live. You take a different interest in it, if you live where you work."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Young police officers and their families like the loan program because the low-interest and no-money-down mortgages offer them a chance to own a home years earlier than they otherwise could afford. The home loans include generous rehabilitation funds for older, rundown homes. The buildings, once prime candidates for demolition, are remodeled into attractive like-new homes both inside and out, including brand-new kitchens and landscaping.<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It wasn't difficult to persuade Columbia bankers to support the effort. "Every bank we approached responded by saying yes," Semon says. "They agreed to provide 50 percent of financing below market rates, and each volunteered to do at least one loan." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"Public-private partnerships do work," says Wayne Lovelace, a vice president of First Citizens Bank of Columbia. "We get a good loan, we address a social need, and a responsible buyer gets a house they couldn't otherwise afford. We're glad to be part of the program." As a result of the program, Columbia's police department has won a prestigious "Innovations in Policing" award from the U.S. Conference of Mayors, based in Washington, D.C.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Since Columbia began its program, other cities have begun similar projects. In Sarasota, Florida, a homeownership program aimed at stabilizing certain neighborhoods offers participants up to 100 percent of the financing of a low-interest loan with no down payment and a take-home police car. Chicago's city council last year approved a program to assist police officers who buy homes in low and moderate-income neighborhoods. Suburban Elgin, Illinois, has offered a similar program since 1992.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Casino Reinvestment Development Authority in Atlantic City, New Jersey, has designed its own version of the concept, in cooperation with the police department and the Police Foundation, a research group in Washington, D.C. The program offers low-interest, 30-year, fixed-rate loans with no down-payments to police officers who move into designated neighborhoods and carry out certain community-oriented policing activities.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Dubbed the "3-2-1 Program," the financial incentives to officers depend on the crime rates of the neighborhood in which they choose to reside. In the more desirable Area 3, 3-percent mortgages are offered with a $300 application fee, three loan points, and no loan forgiveness. In Area 2, officers may receive 2-percent mortgages with a  $200 application fee, two loan points, and one year of loan forgiveness for every two years of residency. In the high-crime Area 1, participants in the program can get 1-percent mortgages with a $100 application fee, one loan point, and a year's forgiveness for each year of residency. Every officer is assigned a patrol car, which he must park in front of his home when off duty. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Nineteen officers who chose to participate in the program confirm that it makes people in the community feel safer, deters crime, and involves officers more deeply in the community they have sworn to protect. New Jersey's legislature is now considering a statewide version of the program. "Cops and crime can't coexist in the same neighborhood," says James Kennedy, the executive director of the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In many departments and cities, attempts to require officers to reside in the city they serve have become extremely contentious. Homeownership incentives may achieve a similar result without coercion. "When police officers are integrated into the fabric of the community," says Hubert Williams, the president of the Police Foundation, "they will get information that they could never get if they lived on the outer boundaries. And information is the life blood of a police department. The residency requirement is not very effective right now. We simply need another approach, and police homeownership in high-risk or deteriorating neighborhoods is proving to be a successful solution."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"Police should be part of a community," says Richard Semon, the director of Columbia's community-development department. "Police homeownership is not the entire solution, but it is one effort, one piece of the puzzle. We think it is a vital part of the solution of deterring crime and revitalizing our neighborhoods."<p><I>For more information about this program, contact <b>Richard Semon</b>, community development director, Community Services, City of Columbia, 1225 Laurel St., Columbia, S.C. 29217.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the great debate about affirmative action that is about to begin, opponents of racial quotas and preferences must be prepared to offer a better way of opening opportunity for racial groups that have historically been victims of discrimination. The answer is high academic standards for everyone, a solution that the Clinton administration is, unfortunately, resisting.<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The greatest tragedy of public education today is the low expectations it sets for poor children, especially blacks and Hispanics. The prevailing assumption among teachers and principals in all too many poor neighborhoods seems to be: "These kids can't learn, and even if they do, society is so racist that there's no opportunity for them anyway."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Talk about a self-fulfilling prophecy. Why study hard if your teacher doesn't think you can learn? Racial quotas and preferences reinforce this defeatism by sending the message that blacks and Hispanics can succeed academically and economically only if they are held to a lower standard than Asians and whites.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But the experience of countless schools and teachers shows that, when much is expected of them, black and Hispanic children can achieve at a very high level. Test scores for racial minorities can rise by quantum jumps without the ugly practice of "race-norming," where test scores for blacks and Hispanics are artificially raised to compensate for their racial status.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Consider the track record of Rafe Esquith, a fifth- and sixth-grade teacher at Hobart Elementary School in Los Angeles, near the site of the 1992 riots. Most children at Hobart are poor immigrants from families that don't speak English; 80 percent are Hispanic, 16 percent Asian, 2 percent African-American. Three-quarters have single parents, and many come from alcoholic families. But by the end of the sixth grade, his students have finished a year of algebra and classical literature -- including eight of Shakespeare's plays. His junior thespian crew, the "Hobart Shakespeareans," have performed with Britain's Royal Shakespeare Company. Their performance of Measure for Measure will open the World Shakespeare Congress in Los Angeles this June.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;How does Esquith bring out the best in his class? The same way outstanding teachers always do. He sets high standards, and gives his students the help they need to meet them. "I put my heart and soul into my teaching, and the kids know that. I demand the same from them." Esquith begins teaching his class of 40 students at 6:30 a.m. and teaches straight until 5 p.m. (They even eat lunch in the classroom.) By teaching his youngsters to solve difficult math equations and to read and perform Shakespeare early on, Esquith trains his kids to take on challenges that at first seem impossible.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The result: Last year, in the mathematics portion of the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills (a test administered to the Los Angeles Unified School District), his fifth-graders achieved average scores in the 98th percentile, while the school itself scored in the 64th percentile, and the district in the 47th percentile. On the English test, they scored in the 92nd percentile, while the school overall scored in the 47th percentile, and the district in the 35th percentile. His sixth-grade class produced similar results -- even though all of Esquith's students speak English as a second language, and, but for his devotion, most would be written off as "slow" or "troubled."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Esquith's devotion to his students doesn't stop when they graduate from elementary school. On weekends he gathers his former students to prepare them for the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). The walls of his classrooms are filled with banners of colleges and universities like Harvard and Berkeley, institutions his students have gone on to attend; their names appear next to their respective schools. Most of these students are the first in their family ever to attend college.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Esquith's story is compelling, not only because his students do well, but because he proves that high expectations and hard work produce results. His students may be poor, but they will be able to compete in the marketplace on a level playing field because they are well educated, and Esquith -- the recipient of the Walt Disney Outstanding Teacher of the Year award in 1992 -- can trump most private-school teachers any day. Esquith's secret -- which seems to be well kept from most of the education establishment -- is his conviction that poor, inner-city kids can learn, and that the keys to educational success are high standards and hard work.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Another example of the "aim high and achieve" model is Holy Angels Elementary School, described as an "oasis in the middle of the desert" by Jolene Pearl, a professor of education at Spring Arbor College. Every year, Pearl takes her students to Holy Angels to show them that a successful school need not be housed in a safe, affluent white neighborhood. Nor does it take a fortune to keep its door open. The 108-year-old South Side Catholic institution sits in the Kenwood-Oakland neighborhood of Chicago, where three out of four people live in poverty and violent crime is the rule rather than the exception. Holy Angels's enrollment includes 1,256 students -- all of whom are African-American -- from preschool to eighth grade, each paying a tuition of $40 to $45 per month. The school's motto: "Where Proud Black Youngsters Produce and Achieve." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"I feel like I'm in a war zone," replies Sister Helen Struder, the school's principal, when asked how she feels about the location of her school. You'd never guess that from the students' performance. A comparison of scores on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills published by the Chicago Public Schools shows that, in 1994, the number of Holy Angels eighth-graders scoring above the national norm in math was quadruple the average number of eighth-graders at the three area public schools on the same test. The data also show that twice as many Holy Angels eighth-graders scored above the national norm in reading as did the average of the three area public school eighth graders. <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;How did this happen?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Sister Helen, who has been on the school's staff since 1960, before reaching her post as principal a year ago, believes that the secret to the school's success is threefold: its basic curriculum (mathematics, English, reading, science, and social studies), its strict discipline (it teaches respect for self and others and holds students responsible for their actions), and its high academic expectations for its students. Instead of making excuses for the children, Sister Helen and Holy Angels teachers expect them "to paddle their own canoes." Instead of offering an array of extracurricular classes or dumbing down its curriculum to increase the "self-esteem" of its African-American pupils, Holy Angels offers a strict diet of math and reading and expects students to get the job done. The principal believes that "by success you build self-esteem."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;No one can attest to the success of a school like Holy Angels or a teacher like Rafe Esquith better than Barbara Lerner. A lawyer and psychologist, she was an outspoken advocate of the "minimum competence testing" movement in the late 1970s -- a grass-roots movement demanding that no student be allowed to graduate from high school without first passing a test proving he or she had mastered basic skills in reading and math. Lawyers from the Center for Law and Education at Harvard and a bevy of other "experts" tried to convince the federal courts that this requirement was unconstitutional because in Florida -- the first of many states to adopt such a test -- 80 to 90 percent of African-American students failed it on the first few tries. Lerner's 1983 testimony in <I>Debra P. v Turlington</I> (the case challenging Florida's minimum competence test) convinced the courts that minimum competence testing provided just the push these kids needed, pointing out that by the fifth attempt, more than 90 percent of them passed.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As Lerner noted in a 1991 article in Commentary, children who mastered the basics went on to improve their scores on more advanced tests like the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) too, because "[m]inimum competence is the entry ticket in the race for advanced competence and, as in any race, increasing the number of entrants increases the number who cross the finish line." That, she argued, is why the SAT scores of African-American students rose by more than 47 points between 1980 and 1989. Lerner believes that the only way to expand the success of the minimum competence exam is to make it the standard for grade-school graduation, and also to require children to pass an advanced competence test like the SAT to graduate from high school. Such a test would go beyond literacy and numeracy to measure abstract reasoning and problem-solving ability with both words and numbers. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Minimum competence tests have repeatedly been challenged in the courts by legal-services and civil-rights groups that contend, in Lerner's words, that the test "would hurt minority students the most, as a disproportionate number of them would fail the test and be denied high-school diplomas. That would stigmatize them for life, do severe damage to their self-esteem and motivation, and close off all further academic and career opportunities, locking them into a permanent underclass. The result would be a widening of the gap between the haves and the have-nots in American society, deepening our racial divisions and moving us away from equality and justice." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton administration makes a similar argument. In 1994, the U.S. Department of Education investigated Ohio's policy of requiring students to pass a ninth-grade proficiency test to see whether it violated the civil rights of minority students. Thanks to pressure from Republican congressman William Goodling, who depicted the Department of Education's involvement in Ohio as an "unwelcome intrusion into a state's education practices," the investigation was halted. But lawsuits and policies challenging advanced competency abound, and efforts to make earning a high-school diploma contingent upon passing a stringent exam bear a heavy political risk -- mainly because, at first, many students are likely to fail the tests. Currently, according to a 1995 report by the North Central Regional Education Laboratory, 17 states require all their high school students to pass some form of graduation test. Michigan, New York, and Tennessee offer state-endorsed diplomas, and New York, Ohio, and Tennessee offer honors diplomas.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;New York is one of the few states that has made huge strides in this area. Last year, thanks to Ramon Cortines, former chancellor of New York City's public schools, standards and accountability were reinstalled as the centerpiece of education in New York City. Cortines mandated Regents-level classes in mathematics and science for most incoming high-school students-to be phased in for sophomores, juniors, and seniors in the following three years. (Regents are college-level courses recommended by the state's education department and overseen by the Board of Regents. Students who take the achievement tests that correspond to the classes qualify for a Regents diploma.) Cortines's plan immediately eliminated many "bonehead" courses -- as he characterized them -- which typically had large minority enrollment. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;According to a report by the Hudson Institute, Education Reform 1994-1995, the results of the first year reveal that the course-failure rates rose among African-Americans and Hispanics, but also that the number of minorities taking and passing the more rigorous courses increased greatly. The enrollment of African-Americans in college-preparatory science rose by 129 percent and Hispanic enrollments by 265 percent. Compared with the previous school year, more than 6,500 additional African-Americans and 7,000 Hispanics passed the Regents science courses.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Nearly 50 percent more Hispanics took the test in 1995 than in 1994, and 2,033 passed it (280 more than the year before). About a third more African-American students took the exam, and 2,532 passed it (184 more than the year before). Cortines's bold efforts received a boost last year when State Education Commissioner Richard P. Mills required that all New York City students not enrolled in Regents courses do so. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Regents courses put pressure not only on students, but also on teachers. Many of the complaints about Cortines's and Mills's efforts come from educators unfamiliar with teaching Regents-level courses. But as Kay Toliver, an award-winning math teacher from East Harlem Tech puts it, the pressure to perform pays off.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;She should know. For 30 years, Toliver has been teaching elementary school and junior-high-school math at Public School 72/East Harlem Tech, a school for pre-kindergarten through eighth grade with 792 students, 88 percent of whom are Hispanic. She teaches pupils in grades four through eight in a program called the Challengers, designed for teaching mathematics in an integrated curriculum that emphasizes communications skills, history, and problem solving. She says she considers high expectations vital to success, "especially for students who are constantly being told they are 'disadvantaged' and who may have the impression that mathematics in particular is a subject beyond their abilities."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"Every student can succeed in mathematics, even if [he or she has] never before been successful," Toliver wrote in the Journal of Negro Education. "I let my students know two things from the beginning: (1) I am with them to teach, and (2) I expect to be met halfway." She's determined to eliminate the stigma attached to poor minority students as underachievers. "I believe [that] the greater the problems surrounding the students, the more important it is that they triumph in their education and thus receive the key to a better life." Last spring, her fifth-, sixth-, and seventh-graders averaged above the 50th percentile on New York City's annual standardized math test, while the school scored in the 30th percentile.)<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In 1993, an award-winning PBS documentary, Good Morning Miss Toliver, brought her efforts to a wider audience. Since then, she has given many teacher-training workshops, and the Foundation for Advancement in Science and Education, in Los Angeles, has underwritten two sets of teacher-training videos featuring Toliver.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;No wonder a good portion of her students end up in such elite schools as the Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics. Perhaps forcing students to take Regents-level courses will result in the creation of many more teachers like Kay Toliver. Yet until more states decide to follow New York's lead in devising and mandating courses and exams like the Regents, teachers like Toliver will need to take on the challenge by expecting more from their students.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Brother Bob Smith, the principal of Milwaukee's private Messmer High School, sets similar standards of excellence. "We won't allow students to perform poorly because they are poor, black, or from single-family homes and have often suffered years of neglect," he says. "Our kids are evaluated and reviewed in the middle and at the end of each quarter. Our kids see themselves as students, not as black and white or members of a group." Messmer has 320 students, of whom 65 percent are African-American, 10 percent are Hispanic, and 25 percent are white or of other ethnic background. And how does Brother Bob's "no-nonsense" recipe fare? Forty of his 52 juniors taking the PSAT last fall scored in the top 30th percent nationally, his African-American students hold the same grade-point average as the school's white students, 98 percent of his students graduate, and 80 percent move onto college. All this at a per-pupil cost less than half that of any of the public high schools in the Milwaukee school system.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Opponents of race-based affirmative action are constantly challenged to offer viable alternatives. Their answer often includes myriad empowerment ideas, such as school choice and vouchers, each of which has been carefully crafted to address specific aspects of the problems affirmative action has failed to solve. As the accomplishments of Rafe Esquith, Sister Helen Struder, Ramon Cortines, Kay Toliver, and Brother Bob Smith demonstrate, promoting high standards is an idea that will boost achievement in a way affirmative action never has and never will. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These educators refute the fears of the civil-rights establishment that high expectations will forever tarnish the spirit of minorities, and are proof that the best kind of "affirmative action" is that which will teach children the discipline they need to advance in the educational and professional arena.<p><I><b>Nina H.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Over the past few decades, government welfare programs have 
been designed to lift the burden of caring for the poor from ordinary people, by allowing them to write a 
check to pay the professionals who would solve problems. It is time for government to reassert a healthy 
pressure on the American people: Congress should phase out federal-assistance programs and push states to 
develop ways for individuals and community-based groups to take over poverty-fighting responsibility.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Our predecessors understood the Constitution’s charge to 
provide for the common defense but to promote the general welfare -- by ensuring an environment within 
which individual and community action could flourish. When, for example, Congress in 1854 passed a bill 
for federal construction and maintenance of mental hospitals, President Franklin Pierce vetoed the bill. 
“Should this bill become law, that Congress is to make provision for such objects, the foundations of 
charity will be dried up at home,” he said.


<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Pierce's veto was sustained. His concern about “dried up” 
charity was typical of the era: Municipal aid to the poor could dry up private charity; state relief could dry 
up city aid; federal programs could dry up state efforts. Hardly the way to promote the general welfare.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But the mood of that era -- not to mention the Constitutional 
vision for addressing social needs -- has been lost. The concept of the modern welfare state placed 
responsibility for fighting poverty not at the lowest level but the highest. National entitlement programs 
came to dominate the social-services scene. The reversal of Pierce’s doctrine was so complete that even 
conservatives in the 1980s, who favored reducing the growth of welfare programs, still talked of the 
importance of maintaining a federal safety net. They did not understand that the federal safety net was not 
only inefficient, but conceptually mistaken.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<I>What?</I> Criticize the safety net itself? Yes. When I took 
my children to the circus recently, I realized how infrequently the Ringling Brothers safety net is used. For 
an acrobat, a fall to the safety net is a failure; if he falls stunt after stunt, he will be fired. Most people 
during the Depression had the psychology of the acrobat: The newly installed federal safety net was to be 
used only when the choice was between it and a hole in the ground. But over time, as attitudes softened and 
welfare programs expanded, that desire to avoid using the safety net was often lost. The destigmatizing of 
welfare in the 1960s meant that the acrobats no longer needed to strain for those extra inches, because the 
audience would still applaud even if they fell into the safety net every time.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What America needs is not a safety net but a vast variety of 
small trampolines, suited to individual needs, movable so as to be present for individual crises, and 
providing a level of bounce fitted to the skill level and psychology of the individuals they are designed to 
save. Government’s role under such a plan is clear: Get rid of constraints on the construction and 
movement of trampolines, and -- if it does not appear that enough trampolines will be produced -- provided 
incentives to get more. In that way, government can promote the general welfare.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What would this mean in terms of practical policy? Nothing 
short of a revolutionary proposal: We must place in the hands of state officials all decisions about welfare 
and the financing of it, and then press them to put welfare entirely in the hands of church- and community-
based organizations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Under this radically decentralist proposal, Congress would 
acknowledge that even the block-grant concept violates common sense -- far better to leave the money in 
the states in the first place. Congress would acknowledge that block grants reduce accountability, for the 
goal of block grants is to free state governments from centralized control, but it also tends to free them 
from taxpayer control because the funds are viewed as “free money” blown in from Washington. Congress 
would acknowledge that block grants tend to breed scandal; without real accountability to either the 
national capital or the state’s citizenry, funds are wasted and pressure mounts for Congress to attach not 
just strings but ropes to hold the sides of the box together.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In this scenario, a bold Congress, pushed hard by the 
newcomers of 1994 and 1996, would not fall into the same old trap and recentralize. Instead, Congress 
would pass, effective at the end of the block-grant era, a massive tax cut, with federal taxes decreasing by 
the amount no longer block-granted. (A side benefit: If Congress moves toward a flat tax, the tax rate could 
be set lower than is currently anticipated.)
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;States would then use their own taxing authorities to implement 
new programs, or duplicate the old ones if they choose to do so. If a new Congress were to make that 
decision in 1997, states would have four years to plan for the post-federal welfare era. They could tax 
residents adequate amounts to care for the poor, but provide incentives for citizens to contribute sizable 
amounts of time or money to local poverty-fighting charities by providing exemptions to the new tax.
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is not as if a dollar-for-dollar replacement for the $350 billion 
annual cost (in 1994) of federal and state welfare spending (70 percent of it coming from Washington) is 
necessary: We know that much money is wasted and worse than wasted, actually causes harm. Yet, if more 
trampolines are needed, we should not be opposed theoretically to governments, once they have worked to 
reduce barriers, also working to promote the general welfare.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The best way for legislatures to do this would be to offer the 
average taxpayer a deal as follows: “Come the year 2001, under the Welfare Replacement Act of 1997, 
your federal tax burden will be reduced by an average of $3,000. We certainly do not want to be accused of 
being cruel or mean-spirited, so we will raise state taxes by an average of $2,500. However, we also want 
to promote personal involvement with community-based organizations that offer effective compassion to 
the poor, and if you provide to such an organization a combination of money and time totaling at least 
$3,000 -- thus leaving the quantity of societal commitment to the poor unchanged -- you will be exempt 
from the new tax.”
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This would obviously represent a sweeping change from the 
current system. Now, taxpayers who itemize can deduct from their taxable income the contributions they 
make to a wide range of religious, charitable, and educational organizations, at their marginal tax rate (the 
lowest is 15 percent, the highest is 39.6 percent). This is helpful, but not good enough, and movement 
toward a flat tax might eliminate that deduction anyway. Under the new system proposed here, states 
would push taxpayers in a massive way to become involved with groups that provide direct social services 
to the poor, and offer exemption from taxation for such purposes to those who were helping others in their 
own way.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	At least 11 critical questions about such a revolutionary 
departure from current practice immediately arise:
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <I>What percentage of taxpayers would choose to support local 
charities and thereby gain exemption?</I></b> That is very difficult to predict, but with four years of 
preparation it is likely that many would, resulting in a tremendous boost to nonprofit finances and a large 
increase of citizen involvement. Those who did not become involved would pay the new tax, and states 
could use that fund to pay for any missing trampolines.
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <I>Would church-based and community-based organizations be 
ready to expand or replicate themselves in order to make use of their new resources in a new 
century?</I></b> They would have time to prepare, and the encouragement of a new system would blow 
away the “compassion fatigue” that has built up over the years. 
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <I>Would acceptance of exemption-creating contributions force 
poverty-fighting charities to accept governmental control?</I></b> At the moment, charitable 
organizations that seek government grants come under government oversight; some church-related 
programs have gained financially but lost their souls in the process. Even nonreligious charities accepting 
public funds have been forced to treat all of their clients bureaucratically, within the parameters set by law 
and regulation, rather than dealing with each human being on an individual basis.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The advent of “new tax” exemptions would not automatically 
free up religious groups and other community-based institutions to participate as equals in the social 
services sector. Despite precedents set by the GI Bill and other programs that allowed consumer choice, the 
ACLU would not be amused by the removal of secular liberalism from its established, privileged place.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Still, the offer of an exemption (signifying a right not to pay 
because of other services rendered) is as clear a hands-off statement as a legislature can make. Exemptions 
offer a greater degree of protection than deductions, credits, or especially vouchers, since the latter requires 
government not only to overlook revenue but to send out checks. A political coalition strong enough to 
obtain tax exemptions should be strong enough to keep them from being abused by antireligious zealots.
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <I>Wouldn’t some exemptions from taxation go for funds sent to 
phony, needless, or simply ineffective projects? Wouldn’t these cases be cited by partisans of the 
welfare state as reasons for opposing the exemption system?</I></b> Certainly, and those cases would 
make an impact on people who are startled to find that some among their fellow human beings are foolish, 
incompetent, or gullible.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Markets work not because everyone exercises perfect 
judgment, but because, on balance, most people make good judgments most of the time. Even with all the 
anticipated human error, a charitable sector in which the funds are allocated by individual private decisions 
is likely to be less wasteful than the current system. Besides, with more resources at stake, more careful 
analysis of charitable effectiveness is likely to become common. Publications that examine charities the 
way a Consumer Reports examines products would emerge.
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <I>Wouldn’t acceptance of volunteer time as part of the 
exemption-creating contribution open the door to fraud?</I></b> It is true that proof regarding the 
giving of money tends to be clearer than that concerning time, the valuation of which can be complicated. 
Still, emphasis on the crucial meaning of compassion -- suffering with -- is vital, and a plan that provides 
incentives for contribution of money but not time is incomplete.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Many groups already keep records of volunteer hours, so 
bookkeeping would not be an insurmountable problem. Corruption could be kept to a minimum by keeping 
the general credit for exemption purposes at the level of the minimum wage -- enough to provide a bit of 
compensation for work time lost and to signify societal commitment to compassionate action, but not 
enough to promote widespread cheating.
<P>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <I>What would happen to health care for the poor?</I></b> 
Medicaid is the single biggest element of current federal and state welfare expense; of the $324 billion that 
federal and state agencies spent on welfare in 1993, $132 billion went for that one program. And yet, many 
cities have free or sharply-reduced-price clinics where some dedicated doctors and nurses volunteer their 
time. What can governments do to help such organizations?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In Jackson, Mississippi, the Voice of Calvary Family Health 
Center sees about 8,000 patients each year, and would like to expand its operations or start other clinics 
like it. Center director Lee Harper contrasts her clinic with higher-budgeted state operations and concludes, 
“When you have more money, you tend to waste more.” Still, she needs more funds. Job one, however, is 
getting more hours from volunteer doctors, dentists, and nurses. “If we get the health professionals, we’ll 
get the money.”
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Such an urgent need translates into a specific proposal that 
could be implemented at the federal level in lieu of all the macro-reform proposals of the 1990s: Give 
medical professionals tax credits for hours regularly worked at clinics. If a typical doctor, dentist, or nurse 
worked one day every two weeks at a clinic or in a similar way spent time to provide health care to poor 
individuals, billions of dollars in medical expenses could be saved. Participating health personnel, in 
return, could receive a tax credit equivalent to 10 percent of their salaries. Such a credit could be the 
cornerstone of the personal alternative to bureaucratic health-care plans that are rightly regarded with 
skepticism.
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <I>Why substitute a state tax (with exemptions) for a federal 
one? Why not simply reduce taxes and allow individuals to spend the money as they see fit?</I></b> 
Advocates of individual rather than governmental responsibility have the personal emphasis right, but will 
a reliance merely on individual goodwill and effort lead to the production of enough trampolines? For 
those who emphasize original sin rather than natural goodness, there is a middle ground between 
government and individual: Call it societal responsibility, within which government requires payment but 
leaves to the individual taxpayer how the money shall be spent.
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <i>Will it be possible to restrict tax-exempting contributions to 
those organizations that are actually engaged in fighting poverty and its associated 
pathologies?</I></b> In some cases the correct category will be obvious, but in others careful judgment 
will be required. For example, it would seem that general donations to a college or a private school should 
not be used for exemption purposes, but donations to a college or school scholarship fund for poor students 
should be. General donations to a church should not produce an exemption, but those to the church’s 
specific poverty-fighting endeavors (an anti-addiction program for example) should be. General donations 
to a hospital should not; donations to a free or reduced-rate clinic for the poor should.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Such categorization would be necessary, even though it could 
cut into the individual flexibility that straightforward tax reduction would allow. No matter how carefully 
state legislatures define the new tax category for poverty-fighting organizations, officials would have to 
write and apply regulations implementing the new tax. That authority potentially could allow a state 
agency to exclude organizations that it did not favor for ideological, theological, or political reasons. Some 
organizations might change what they do and the way they do it in order to conform to the regulatory 
standards.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Such a threat does not mean that the new system could not 
work. It does mean that eternal vigilance will continue to be the price of liberty.
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <I>Why not rely on pure voluntarism to do what is 
necessary?</I></b> The seeds of welfare replacement are already planted; if we wish to move quickly 
enough to save a generation of children during the first decade of the 21st century, those seeds need lots of 
water. If men were angels, no incentives for goodness would be necessary, but devolution to the states and 
further devolution through an exemption system is a good way for human beings to shift resources from 
the public sector to the private sector. Such a shift would provide a pool of capital for worthy charities to 
use in replicating themselves and thus replacing the welfare state.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The stimulation of voluntarism through tax exemption is an 
impure tactic, but our predecessors in this country, with their realistic view of human nature, were not 
above using impure motives to promote virtue. Colonial settlers who took in a poor person received 
compensation from the township, and some of them may occasionally have profited a bit (although that 
would be more than made up for by the time they spent mentoring the needy person). A farm family that 
adopted an orphan gained a farm hand, though the economic advantage was outweighed by the hard task of 
being new parents to someone who had grown up under tough conditions.
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <I>Why require $3,000 to receive the exemption from payment 
of $2,500?</I></b> If some people hesitate to give (in money or minimum-wage time) the greater amount 
necessary to receive an exemption, that is fine; the quality of their giving would probably be low. Some 
personal contribution by the taxpayer is important to build a sense of involvement with and responsibility 
for the work of the charitable organization. The goal is to have as many taxpayers as possible think through 
their giving, and not merely respond to direct-mail appeals.
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <I>Why would taxpayers be expected to make better decisions on 
groups to support than government officials have?</I></b> Competition has made the American 
economy the strongest in the history of humanity, and the American political system the envy of the world. 
The American people have proven themselves capable, on average and over the long haul, of making good 
economic and political judgments. Taxpayers who invested $500 of their own money and time in order to 
direct $2,500 to satisfying projects would be likely to make equally good judgments in the charitable 
sphere.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Decisions about where funds shall go would no longer be a 
function of political struggles over the budgets of government agencies, but would result from the 
decisions of millions of individual donors. Independent charitable organizations would for the first time in 
generations be on a level playing field with those groups favored by government. Some errors would 
occur, but there is every reason to expect this system of delivering assistance to the needy to be far more 
effective than the current model of top-down government monopoly.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Yes, some innovators would fail, but isn’t it better to win a 
football game 50-14 than to play so defensively as to fall into a 3-3 tie? Given the growing number of 
damaged children and ruined adults under our current regime, isn’t it better to take the rational risks that 
could liberate millions, rather than suffer constant winter without Christmas?
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In general, decentralization offers the best shot for each state to 
innovate in the way that is right for its unique population and specific problems. Since we do not know 
precisely which legislative plan would best promote the offering of individual compassion, an emphasis on 
state-level action maximizes the opportunity to find out for sure which tactics work best. Furthermore, 
there may be greater opportunity to move quickly in some states than in Washington.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While each state would have to sort out its particular 
problems, all must face, for example, rising rates of illegitimacy. Abstinence programs are a start. When 
pregnancy nevertheless results and marriage does not, states should foster group-living arrangements for 
women while pregnant and during the year or two afterwards, so that those who would otherwise be alone 
will have a support network. States should challenge biases against adoption, and stress the advantages to 
the child of adoption at birth (or up to age two, at the latest). Having a baby out of wedlock should not 
bring with it the reward of any governmental cash payments.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	No public-policy measure can take the place of the personal 
changes that are necessary to raise high the standard of American compassion. With supportive laws and 
rules compassionate individuals can make real progress toward reducing some of our most serious social 
pathologies, but the crucial change is still the one that goes on in each individual soul, not in the federal or 
state capitols.

Gingrich plan puts focus on Clinton
</FONT><HR WIDTH=50%>By Donald Lambro<BR><font size=1>
The Washington Times</font><HR WIDTH=30%></center>

<BR><DD>Republican leaders, decrying "the looming Clinton
recession," are crafting a legislative agenda for the campaign
year that focuses on economic growth, jobs, incomes and some
issues favored by social conservatives.
<BR><DD>GOP leaders on
Feb. 23 also began fine-tuning their message in an attempt to
better explain how their party's proposed budget and tax cuts
can help average working-class voters worried about a
declining economy.
<BR><DD>House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who
has been keeping a low profile during the early rounds of the
Republican primary fights, laid out the new message Feb. 23 in
a memorandum to GOP leaders that sought to ally his party
with growing voter anxiety and anger over job losses and
stagnant or falling incomes.
<BR><DD>"In the first caucus and
primary votes of 1996, the American electorate reminds us
clearly that the failing Clinton economy has short-changed
American workers and their families. Republicans understand
this anger," Mr. Gingrich said.
<BR><DD>Last year Republicans
passed tax and spending cuts to "allow families to keep more
of their hard-earned income" and to spur economic expansion
and job creation, he said. But in the end these and other
reforms to strengthen the economy "died at the tip of Bill
Clinton's veto pen."
<BR><DD>Haley Barbour, Republican National
Committee chairman, also attacked Mr. Clinton's economic
record Feb. 23, saying the "looming Clinton recession" was the
result of the president's decision to raise taxes in 1993 and
increase government regulations. "No wonder wages are
stagnant -- the government got your pay raise. It's no surprise
there are fewer jobs; the government is soaking up most of the
money that could be used for job creation," he said in a speech
to the Conservative Political Action Conference.
<BR><DD>"The
growing Clinton recession -- with its wage stagnation and
economic insecurity -- is the result of Clinton's high-tax,
big-government policies," he said.
<BR><DD>The combined
RNC-House Republican attacks are part of a new, coordinated
strategy to maintain a drumbeat of attacks on the White House
and the Democrats "from now until the November elections,"
GOP officials said.
<BR><DD>"Our message got lost last year in
the budget negotiations. We did not effectively explain what
our reforms would mean to average Americans. We need to
make sure that doesn't happen this year," said a senior House
GOP official.
<BR><DD>Mr. Gingrich's broadside came at a time of
increasing division and debate among the GOP presidential
candidates over the party's message, and increasing evidence
that GOP primary voters are responding to the economic
anxiety issues that Pat Buchanan and Steve Forbes have raised
in their campaigns.
<BR><DD>The Gingrich memorandum came as
welcome news to his GOP colleagues in the House, who have
been urging him to speak out much more forcefully against Mr.
Clinton and the Democrats to counter the primary fights that
have been dividing his party.
<BR><DD>"I'm glad he's speaking
out, finally. We need his voice in this debate about where we're
going," said Rep. Helen Chenoweth, a freshman Republican from
Idaho.
<BR><DD>Mr. Gingrich and his chief deputies continued to
work late last month on a new legislative strategy and a
stronger marketing plan aimed at highlighting policy
differences with Mr. Clinton in the campaign, especially
economic policy.
<BR><DD>His party's case for tax cuts and
fiscal reforms to spur economic growth was bolstered Feb. 23
by new government statistics showing the economy grew by
only 0.9 percent during the last three months of 1995. He also
acknowledged that the GOP has not done a good job of
connecting with the economic concerns of middle-class
families.
<BR><DD>"We must be prepared to communicate our
response to legitimate voter anger in a clearer and more
forceful manner than we have done so far," the speaker
said.
<BR><DD>"We are with the American people now and will
produce legislation that addresses their concerns throughout
the spring and summer."
<BR><DD>GOP officials who attended Mr.
Gingrich's strategy meetings last month said they were
focusing their agenda for the rest of the year on issues that
would "get the economy moving," create jobs and improve
incomes. Most of the agenda will be drawn from the "Contract
With America," including tax and budget cuts, curbs on
entitlements, and regulatory relief for
businesses.
<BR><DD>Rep. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, the GOP's
chief deputy whip, was assigned to develop a "market-driven"
health care reform plan that will include medical savings
accounts and provisions to allow workers to keep their health
care protection when they change jobs.
<BR><DD>"We want to
make sure that middle-class Americans can get health
insurance if they lose their job. We'll probably bring it up
before this summer," Mr. Hastert said.

<H2>Charities on the Dole</h2>

<b>by Kimberly Dennis</b>
</center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Those who expect America’s charities to replace government as a 
provider of social welfare ought to look a little closer. They will find that the so-called independent sector, 
which receives between one-quarter and one-third of its funds from taxpayers, isn’t so independent after 
all.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In fact, many social-service agencies actually receive most of their 
funding from government. Save the Children owes 60 percent of its budget to the generosity of taxpayers, 
Catholic Charities 65 percent, CARE 78 percent, and the United Cerebral Palsy Association more than 80 
percent. Topping this list is the inaptly named Volunteers of America, which receives 96 percent of its $51-
million budget from government sources.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The federal government now channels $39 billion a year in grant 
money through nonprofits. New York’s social-service economy employs more people than Wall Street. 
Private social-service agencies actually represent the city government’s largest group of vendors.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The government–nonprofit complex doesn’t just consume taxpayer 
money. It uses that money to lobby for government programs that would consume even more taxpayer dollars. Congressmen <a href="http://www.house.gov/istook/welcome.html">Ernest Istook</a> and David McIntosh have drawn widespread attention to this problem through their efforts to limit federal  
financing for nonprofits that engage in political advocacy. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We now know that the American Association of Retired Persons, 
which must share some of the blame for our teetering Social Security system, received $74 million in 
government funds in 1994. The Environmental Defense Fund, an advocate of stringent business regulation, 
got $500,000 in government support. The National Council of Senior Citizens, which received $71 million 
courtesy of taxpayers, recently spent much of its energy lobbying Congress on behalf of President 
Clinton’s health-care proposals.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Tax-funded nonprofits also compete with the very profitmaking 
businesses whose taxes support them. In Pennsylvania, a nonprofit hospital that receives government funds 
operates a marina. In New York, government-funded housing competes with private development, and 
homeless shelters crowd out cheap single-room-occupancy residences. In our nation’s capital, George 
Washington University, a nonprofit institution that receives public funds, operates a hotel and a restaurant.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Nonprofits that compete with businesses to provide of goods and 
services take advantage of tax exemption in many ways. In 1993, the Children’s Television Workshop 
received $22.5 million in tax-free royalties from the sale of Sesame Street products. A Sesame Street store 
just opened in an Indianapolis mall; one can only wonder how the owners of the toy shop a few doors away 
feel about losing business to a store that generates tax-free revenues.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The independent sector’s natural affinities should lie with the business 
sector. After all, its vitality depends on the wealth business creates. But as more and more support for 
nonprofits is channeled through government, the independent sector’s allegiances have shifted to Capitol 
Hill and the federal bureaucracy. It is not just that these institutions think their well-being (and hence 
society’s) depends on a generous government. They also view for-profit ventures as second-rate, morally 
inferior, and perhaps even evil. They’d rather see people eat in a soup kitchen than in a diner, live in a 
“habitat for humanity” than in a trailer park.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	There are, of course, many small, innovative, and values-driven grass-
roots charities that are addressing human needs much more efficiently than failed federal programs and 
social-service agencies. These groups mostly avoid government money, because they know that 
government support comes with strings attached.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	These strings involve more than just paperwork and regulations. 
Government support also changes charities’ incentives, giving them reasons to keep caseloads up instead of 
getting them down by successfully turning around peoples’ lives. It distorts their missions. It turns lean, 
cost-effective organizations into bloated bureaucracies, and dilutes their spiritual or religious message. In 
instances where the Salvation Army decided to accept government funds (which constitute about 15 
percent of its revenues), it stopped requiring church attendance as a condition of its assistance. 
Unfortunately, this experience is all too common. The charity that stays genuinely independent from 
government is still the exception.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Although charities are supposed to offer an alternative to government 
provision of social welfare, they have become so dependent upon and aligned with government that they 
no longer represent a way out of the welfare state. If we place our faith in private nonprofits as they are 
currently organized, we are in for a big disappointment. Before we can rely on charities to help us 
dismantle government, they must wean themselves off the dole.

<I>The following remarks were delivered at &quot;The New Majority:
 Democratic Governance in a Revolutionary Age&quot; conference,
hosted by The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation on January 22,
1996.  The conference explored the possibility of political realignment
and asked:  Is there a &quot;new majority&quot; taking shape in
America and other western-style democracies?  Who is part of the
new majority, what are its beliefs - and how is it related to
the transition from an industrial to an information-age economy?
 Which (if either) American political party is best positioned
to represent it?  And, what impact will it have on the 1996 presidential
election?</I>
<P>
<h3><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h3>
<B>by <a href="#webe">Vin Weber </a></B>
<P>
Along with the United States itself, America's key allies are
transforming themselves away from the industrial age that has
dominated the past century just as surely as they moved away from
the agrarian age in an earlier time.  While the outlines of the
new era are yet to be determined, we know that it will be overwhelmingly
influenced by the information technology that is now upon us -
every day we hear something new about the Internet, Cyberspace
and virtuality.
<P>
The private sector has been learning the lessons of the new age
for more than a decade. General Motors, IBM and AT&amp;T have
learned that bureaucratic, centralized organizations must be replaced
because success in the information age demands decentralization
and empowerment.  Government too must remake itself for a new
age.  The idea that programs run by a bureaucracy concentrated
in Washington, D.C. is the preferred method for addressing the
nation's problems is no longer tenable.
<P>
As the people remake government for the 21st century, three major
trends become clear: devolution, diffusion and connection. Devolution
is sending power and responsibility to the lowest level possible
for effective decision-making.  Shifting from Federal to state
or local control is just a trickle today. Diffusion is relying
on non-governmental organizations or individuals to perform many
of the functions government usurped during the industrial era.
 The use of vouchers, privatization, voluntary organizations,
charities and churches are among the tools of diffusion. The final
trend is connection. This has less to do with government than
with individuals. We must return to the sense of community we
once had.  The most important people are those closest to you.
You must want to help - and feel a responsibility for -  yourself,
your family, your friends and your neighbors.
<P>
Remaking government in such a manner is indeed a democratic revolution.
 Often times it appears that the leaders of such a revolution
are radicals, acting alone in the woods.  Yet if we look around
the world, we see that different cultures and political traditions
are facing basically the same set of facts as they too make the
transition to the information age. In bringing together the leading
agents of political change in America, Great Britain, Japan and
Canada, we found that to a remarkable degree their ideas reinforce
each other.  In their own way and working within their own political
traditions, they describe similar goals for achieving the best
form of government for the information age.
<P>
These leaders also demonstrate how important correct political
management is.  The degree of change required in government organization
is so great that delaying it, stifling it or trying to stop it
will only hurt citizens.  Yet in America, President Clinton has
adopted the rhetoric - &quot;the era of big government is over&quot;
- while actually governing in the opposite manner.  In Britain,
the democratic revolution is at risk by the Tory Prime Minister.
And in Canada, the Conservatives went from governing the country
to having only two seats in the Parliament after they failed to
offer the correct policies of progress.
<P>
As Americans debate the proper role of government in the 21st
century, it is important for them to see models of success and
failure.  By bringing together four remarkable leaders, we hope
to discover some lessons ourselves.
<P>
<h3><a name="age">The Age of New Realities</a></h3>
<B>by <a href="#ging">Newt Gingrich </a></B>
<P></a>
In thinking through what is similar that is driving Canada, Britain,
Japan and America, I think there are three large realities that
will shape everything else we're doing for a very long time.
<P>
The first is the world market.  The world market is going to impose
continuing pressure for competitive modification.  All of the
western democracies - and here I will include Japan as a western
democracy - are faced with the same challenge: how to become dramatically
more productive as societies in order to compete in a 21st century
market in which China and other countries such as Thailand, Pakistan
and India will be playing more and more competitive roles.   This
goes much beyond manufacturing, into the whole question of education,
of tax codes and of entrepreneurship.  The Europeans, frankly,
have been less successful at such adaptation, which is reflected
in very high unemployment rates.  Yet the world market will apply
continuing pressure, and America and Japan are going to face that
pressure fully as much as the Europeans.  
<P>
The second reality is the rise of the information age.  Alvin
and Heidi Tofler describe it as the Third Wave, and it is at least
comparable to the rise of the industrial world that Adam Smith
was writing about in the late 18th Century. It is a change so
large that it will force us to rethink everything we're doing.
 The degree to which we can do that in an open, positive, conscious
way will be dramatically better than if we just stumble into it.
The rise of an information age or of a Third Wave civilization
is going to affect every society on the planet, and I think all
of us have to get used to that and have to figure out therefore
what is it we're doing.  For instance, a new species was recently
discovered in Laos in the national park.  National parks are a
19th century American invention that have rapidly spread across
the planet.  They are an example of what happens as you go through
this kind of modification. All of us are going to find ways to
deal with the information age; they're going to turn out to be
remarkably similar over time, but those societies which are on
the cutting edge will have higher incomes and greater choices.
 Those societies which resist the information age will have lower
incomes and fewer choices.
<P>
The third thing challenging all of us is an expanding definition
of human.  If you go back to the 18th century, basically propertied
white males counted and everybody else was relatively less important.
Yet over the last 200 years, we've had a continually expanding
sense of what does it mean to be human.  As we get to a point
of including everybody and deciding that we're prepared to spend
resources to include them, we're going to be challenged with a
greater and greater intensity to deal with the question, how do
we include everyone to the fullest of their ability and how do
we compensate for those who might have been genetically or otherwise
disadvantaged?  
<P>
Those three factors, the world market, the information age and
the expanding definition of being human, are realities for all
societies and particularly for all democratic societies.  There
are also three facts that industrial societies in particular face.
<P>
The first fact is the failure of state central planning. The collapse
of the Soviet Empire demonstrated this most clearly.  Many of
our friends on the left bitterly regret that it failed and prefer
to ignore its demise.  The Clinton Administration is the last
stand in this country of a genuine belief that centralized planning
makes sense. But the fact is it just failed.  
<P>
The second fact is the failure of secular bureaucracy.  It turns
out that as ways of saving human beings, secular bureaucrats are
among the least successful.  We need to say that more often. 
For example, when our President talks about investing in education,
we should first say, all right, if you're spending $9,000 per
child in Washington, D.C., maybe the problem isn't money.  But
we're not willing to be blunt enough and tough enough about the
obvious failure of secular bureaucracy as a delivery system for
dramatically improving human beings.
<P>
The third fact is the failure of emphasizing redistribution over
production of wealth.  Going back in some ways to 19th century
French socialism, there has been a fascination with redistribution
of wealth, particularly by those who don't produce well.  Emphasized
by the news media and the academic classes - both of whom believe
it's wonderful to spend somebody else's money - the result has
been a focus for the last 70 years on the notion that if only
we accepted the finite limit of wealth and then redistributed
it, everybody would be better off.
<P>
In truth, the objective, historic, long-term fact is that societies
that focus on creating wealth outstrip societies that focus on
redistribution in improving the lot of the poorest people.  That's
an objective fact historically.  Societies that focus on getting
rich bring everybody up at a dramatically faster rate than societies
that focus on redistribution. In fact, if you try to raise the
bottom in a static model you rapidly get resistance from everybody
else, because, by definition in a static model, only achieving
it not by sharing the new wealth, which people are rather comfortable
doing, but by taking away from people what they already have.
<P>
Thus my core critique of the left as I think it is emerging in
the late 20th century is that: first, the state central planners
have failed; second, secular bureaucracies don't transform people;
and third, emphasizing redistribution is a dead loser in helping
the poor compared to focusing on the production of wealth.  This
leads me to seven principles that may be peculiarly an American
formulation.
<P>
First, that there's a spiritual basis of freedom.  There's a reason
that the Founding Fathers said we're endowed by our Creator. 
In fact, being human is a spiritual, not a biological fact, and
may be the most important thing that distinguishes us from purely
biological organisms.  If you don't have a system that says there's
a spiritual basis for being human, you have only a lawyer's definition
of human rights and that's a very shallow framework.  
<P>
Second is that we believe in the power of technological advance
to increase the potential for human goals. You get a better environment
over time and a better approach to helping the poor with a higher
technology society rather than with a Luddite approach. The truth
is that if you go back to the beginning of the Neolithic period,
over time and as a general principle, more technology is better
than less.  On balance technology tends to be used more for good
even though it can also produce gun powder and atomic weapons.
 
<P>
Third, the power of the entrepreneur and the free market to create
wealth is extraordinary.  Whenever possible it needs to be optimized.
 Entrepreneurs and the free market are likely to create more wealth
for more people and therefore over time actually improve a lot
of the poor better than either redistribution or secular bureaucracies.
 
<P>
Fourth is the importance of the individual and families.  That
is the core argument for tax cuts: who spends your money better,
you or a secular bureaucracy? We don't emphasize the moral content
behind tax cuts enough.  This is a moral fight.  Should you have
the right to your resources or should somebody you've never met
have the right to your resources, and if so, what's their claim?
 Why should they have the right to take from you? Yet we lack
the courage because we are still in a leftist world in which we
believe the money belongs to the government and who are we to
give you back your own money.  I think we need to be much more
aggressive and much more assertive in saying there's a moral basis
for tax cuts.  It's called individual freedom and the right of
families to spend their own money.  
<P>
Fifth is the power of volunteerism, which is in many ways a peculiarly
American contribution to the modern world.  Best described by
de Tocqueville, it is another argument for lower taxes.  How can
you be a volunteer if you're indentured to the state? If we want
more volunteerism, we need to leave more resources with those
who would volunteer.  It's a moral cause that requires we ask:
which does a better job of helping people, secular bureaucracies
or the variety of volunteer methods of reaching out?  
<P>
Sixth is the importance of appropriate government.  I am not an
extreme Libertarian.  I in fact believe there are many things
we want the government to do - protect our borders, stop the drug
trade, insure public health.  I'd like to make sure, for example,
that we don't go back to having yellow fever or malaria on a grand
basis.  These are not small things.  It is a very strong government
that can defend its borders, stop epidemics and maintain an honest
dollar.  I am for a strong government, but I'm for an appropriate
government. That means minimum bureaucracy, maximum free enterprise
and a tax code which encourages volunteerism and encourages families.
 
<P>
Lastly is the importance of language and grammar.  It goes back
in a sense to Orwell's argument in the <I>Politics in the English
Language,</I> which is an essay that every would-be revolutionary
should read.  The fact is that the left steals our language. 
The left defends the most grotesque destruction of human beings
in the modern social state by arguing that we would be cruel to
the poor by liberating them from the very shackles which the leftists
fasten on them.  I can imagine nothing worse for an American child
than subjecting them to the welfare system of Washington, D.C.,
and it's not for lack of money.  It is because the system is inherently
destructive of human beings. I can imagine nothing more liberating
for the children of Washington than to abolish their schools tomorrow
morning and replace them with a scholarship for every child of
$9,000 and allowing them to go to any school that wants to charge
them and actually teach them how to read and write.  
<P>
<h3><a name="rev">The Conservative Revolution</a></h3>
<B>by <a href="#redw">John Redwood </a></B>
<P>
With so many conservatives meeting to discuss revolution, it's
as if Edmund Burke could turn up at the Communist International.
 Should I be meeting like this with all of you with such an agenda?
 Yes, of course I should and we should, for only those who recognize
the revolutionary power of change as we hurtle toward the next
millennium have a chance of seizing the democratic mandate and
of conserving what is best in our traditions.
<P>
It was not we conservatives, after all, who unleashed the dynamic
hurricane of the third industrial revolution, nor was it western
conservatives who carried a keynote to government in the Philippines,
took to the streets in Romania and swept aside the Communists
or who tore down the blocks in the Berlin Wall hand by hand. 
It was the force of the people themselves in all their infinite
ingenuity and their diversity.  It was we conservatives who stood
firm for the principles and truths which now inspire so many around
the world, the truths of free trade, freedom under the law, of
one man, one vote.  We owe President Reagan and Prime Minister
Thatcher a debt of gratitude for standing up to the mighty U.S.S.R.
and precipitating its collapse from within while the Liberals
would have none of it, and if they had had none of it, we would
live in a much less interesting world.  
<P>
The mighty forces of change have given us hope for a better world,
a world free of Communist tyranny, a world where more look to
the ballot box to resolve their differences, a world where more
can hope to enjoy the fruits of global capitalism.  Never have
so many looked forward to such riches before.  
<P>
But those same forces have generated great feelings of insecurity
in western electorates.  So fast is change that people fear for
their own jobs.  Where will I be working next year they ask. 
What new things must I learn to carry on working?  Will I have
a job at all?  In the United States and the United Kingdom, fears
about jobs are allied to worries about the stability of the traditional
family.  All too many children will go to bed tonight in New York
or in London in a home with no father.  All too many children
are born into a home which has never known the presence of a father.
 And all too many modern marriages are straining to breaking point.
 
<P>
In such a world, voters look to politicians not just to lead a
revolution, but to reassure.  They want us to waive magic wands
to remove the uncertainties.  They see a bloated public sector
that is arrogated itself men, money and management in a stunning
array of powers, services and agencies.  They expect such a colossus
to help and protect them, but all too often they are bitterly
disappointed.  
<P>
Free schooling may be provided but some children fall further
and further behind because they are not well taught.  Free health
care is provided but only sometimes if you're prepared to queue
and wait a year.  Each subsidy in government intervention fails
to stop redundancies.  Incomes are taxed ever more highly to meet
the unsatiable demands of the expanding state.  The numbers on
welfare grow as more miss out on the technological roller coaster.
 
<P>
It was that American, John Kenneth Galbraith, who complained of
private affluence and public squalor as he rallied a former generation
to a program of more government.  Today we are running the risk
of private squalor and public affluence.  We have certainly reached
in many western societies public waste and enforced private prudence.
 The take home pay of government and the numbers on its payroll
has far expanded far more rapidly than that of most others.  
<P>
People feel let down by many traditional politicians.  As government
has grown, there has been a wish to hold office but shuffle off
responsibility.  In Europe, the European Commission is never to
blame for anything.  When something goes wrong, it seeks others
to be scapegoats.  Many politicians now wish to make elections
matters of image and presentation rather than of substance.  The
sound bite rules the airways even though it may not come from
the heart of he who uttered it and rarely comes from his pen.
 As a result, the people, the electors, come to fell manipulated,
cheapened or cheated.  
<P>
Conservatives must never lose faith in the people, and we must
never lose the faith of the people.  We must look them in the
eye and we must tell them the truth.  Spin doctors should not
be paid to lie, for that way only breeds mistrust.  I believe
a conservative revival is not only possible but vital to the continued
prosperity, discipline and success of advanced societies.  Newt
Gingrich has shown how quickly people will return to our colors
if they are held high and if the army is given a sense of direction.
 For the army to march, for the conservative's recruiting sergeant
to flourish, it needs clear principles, a record of success, a
strategic as well as a tactical purpose.  Only a conservative
agenda can today deliver this.
<P>
The first task of conservatives is to conquer government itself,
to gain some control over the scale and complexity of modern administration.
 Government has to be brought to answer and to bow to the court
of the people.  
<P>
The second task is to cut taxes as the cost of government come
down.  Advanced countries cannot compete with the developing world
if their tills are raided too often by the tax gatherer.
<P>
The third task is to remove obstacles to business success.  We
need freedom from too many rules and regulations so that enterprise
has a chance. Fourth is to ensure that the tax, benefit and legal
systems put families first, buttressing them rather than undermining
them.
<P>
The fifth task is to promote global trade and welcome the third
industrial revolution.  It will generate many more jobs.  It makes
working from home possible.  It could empower the house bound,
liberate the busy, even enliven the bored.  It is more opportunity
than threat.
<P>
Finally, the sixth task is to be true conservatives in protecting
and embellishing all that is best in our different inheritances.
 For Britain, that means the English language, our ancient and
modern noisy democracy, and our great institutions from Oxford
University to Botts Hospital now 900 years young.  For the United
States, that means living up to the sonorous words of Washington,
Jefferson and Lincoln on the rights of man and the pursuit of
happiness.  And for Canada, that means keeping together their
special federation and preserving Canadian identity, for a sense
of belonging matters more today than ever.    
<P>
As conservatives who understand the third industrial revolution,
we are not promising people an end to commercial change.  We cannot
and will not stand like some modern King Kanute and demand that
the software recedes.  We must embrace technological change and
free our people to prosper from it.  But to reassure them, we
must keep alive the flames of our own unique constitutions.  We
must remind people why they belong to families and communities
as well as to the global marketplace.  They gain their security
from the one and their prosperity from the other.  
<P>
Many of you must remind Americans why they should be proud of
America from sea to shining sea.  I must remind my fellow countrymen
why we should be proud to be British with the mother of parliaments
and mother of the free.
<P>
<h3><a name="japan">The Japanese Restoration</a></h3>
<P>
<B>by <a href="#mats">Iwao Matsuda </a></B>
<P>
Revolution is not a word that we Japanese like to use with regard
to our country.  In 1868, when a dynamic group of young reformers
took over the government, abolished feudalism and created the
political, economic and educational institutions of a modern nation
state, they chose the word restoration, not revolution, to describe
what they were doing.  History calls their achievement the Meji
Restoration.  
<P>
Today, when once again Japan needs top to bottom changes in its
political, economic, educational and social institutions, the
key word is reform rather than revolution.  Yet clearly the changes
that Japan requires are revolutionary.  If our program succeeds,
we will have brought about a revolution that will complete what
began with the Meji reformers more than 100 years ago.  It will
embody the most far reaching changes that our country has ever
known and enable us to join the ranks of  the world's normal democratic
states.  
<P>
What is a normal democratic state?  It is first of all a democracy.
 What we have in Japan today is democracy a la Japanese.  We have
the institutional forms of parliamentary government but the circumstance
is rather different from what is regarded as normal in American
and European democracies.  Ours is based on consensus politics
and a mentality that tends to exclude outsiders.  The goal of
the New Frontier Party is to bring about in government alteration
between two political parties that will compete with each other
on the basis of policy, not factions or personalities.  
<P>
For almost the entire post-war period, a single party - the Liberal
Democrats - held exclusive power.  Their monopoly was broken in
July 1993, when a group of reform minded Liberal Democrats rebelled
against the party leadership and established a new party.  I was
one of those Liberals.  Together with other opposition parties,
we won the general election and established a coalition government.
 Yet soon the Liberal Democrats made a deal with their sworn enemies,
the Socialists, and returned to power.  
<P>
To oppose what we regarded as this unholy alliance, all major
opposition parties except the Communists came together in December
1994 to establish the New Frontier Party.  Today, at least in
form, we have the beginning of a two party system.  On one side
stands the government, a coalition of Liberal Democrats, Socialists
and a minor party.  What holds this coalition together?  In my
view, it is a common desire to enjoy the perks  of government
power.  They mouth the slogans of reform but in fact they want
to keep their vested interests.
<P>
By contrast, the New Frontier Party is dedicated to the cause
of change.  We call for wide-ranging changes in politics, in the
economy, in education, in society.  In politics, we were partially
successful during our brief one year in power.  We changed the
election system from one of modified-seat election district to
one which has 300 single-seat constituencies and 200 proportional-representation
seats.  The first election under this system will be held sometime
before the summer of 1997.  It may not immediately bring about
a permanent two party system, but we are convinced that over time
minor parties will fade away.  The present Socialist Party will
be the top candidate for extinction.
<P>
The New Frontier Party's platform calls for clear choices in politics.
 We want to end government by bureaucracy and bring about government
by the people's elected legislators.  We will reduce the number
of ministries from 20 today to 15 after we come to power, and
we will have legislators taking a much more active load in their
ministry.
<P>
Our partnership with the United States is primary (of course with
Canada and England also).  The Cold War has ended but East Asia
remains a dangerous and uncertain place.  China is a huge question
mark, but more unpredictable and therefore more dangerous is North
Korea.  Asia needs the American security presence.  Yet the Japan
we want is one where we assume a much more active partnership
than the existing government.  We will raise our voice louder.
 We may not always agree with the United States, but we will never
forget that we are allies.  We want a permanent seat on the United
Nations Security Council, and we pledge to play a leading role
in its affairs.  The United Nations is far from perfect, but it
is the only international forum we have, and we want to be active
to make it better.  We will not shy away from peace keeping duties.
<P>
At home, we want small government at the center and more power
devolved to local entities. We will have about 300 local authorities
nationwide, small enough to be close to the borders, large enough
to carry out effective government, for which we will replace the
present hodgepodge of 47 prefects and more than 3,200 cities,
towns and villages.
<P>
In the economy, the principal weapon for reform will be deregulation.
 We have no illusions about the difficulty of our task.  Japan
has been a regulated society for more than 1,000 years.  We have
a lot of people, little land, and few natural resources for everyone
to share in an economy of scarcity.  There have to be regulations
and on whole people have accepted these regulations.  In modern
times, the concept of fairness, of equality, has taken precedence
over the concept of individual freedom.  We are a society without
large gaps between rich and poor, management and it's workers.
 We would like to keep it so, but not at the cost of stifling
individual freedom and individual initiative.  We want to experience
the kind of wave that has lifted the American economy and keeps
it far ahead of the others.  That is a wave that does not depend
upon manufacturing production. We need better ideas.  We need
better information.  We need to know how to put information to
work in a more efficient way for each one of us.  In short, we
need freedom.
<P>
I say this is a difficult task because most of us recognize the
need for change.  Many are afraid of living in a society with
few regulations, in a society where each individual will have
to be more self-reliant and take greater responsibility for his
own actions.  Nevertheless, there's no other way for Japan to
move into the 21st century and survive unless people become convinced
that the only alternative to deregulation is continued decline
and eventual extinction.
<P>
Educational reform may be the most important of the reforms we
propose.  Universal education involves one of the great achievements
of the Meji reformers.  Japan today is one of the world's most
literate nations, but our education remains in the 19th Century.
 It emphasizes rote line, stuffing the student with all sorts
of relevant and irrelevant information which he can regurgitate
in written examinations.  We need education that will foster self-reliance
and individual creativity.  The primary emphasis must be allowing
the individual to develop.  Education is an area which we may
not see results for 10 years or more, but we must begin now for
we are already far behind the leaders in this field.  
<P>
Underlying all these reforms is a need for a change in society
itself. How do we move from decisions by consensus into the essence
of democracy?  This is a making by the majority.  Ultimately,
we can only achieve our goals by a revolution within each individual
consciousness.  That takes time, but that is a task to which we
have dictated ourselves.
<P>
<h3><a name="three">The Three Revolutions</a></h3>
<P>
<B>by <a href="#mann">Preston Manning </a></B>
<P>
Our subject is a world in revolution.  Reformation might be the
gentler word.  Perhaps we can talk about revolution through reformation;
that's the Canadian way of seeking the middle. I begin by asking,
which revolution are we talking about? I ask this because it seems
to me there are several revolutions going on in the world at the
same time, and it is important to distinguish them and to think
through the relationship between them.  
<P>
The first revolution is the conservative revolution, the rejection
of Socialism, of liberal interventionism, of the ideology of the
master state in favor of market based solutions to economic problems,
of more personal responsibility for social security, balanced
budgets and limited governments. Examples, of course, of this
revolution are the factory example in Great Britain and the Contract
with America, a program of the new Republicans here in Washington.
 
<P>
In my country, Canada, this conservative revolution is also in
progress, but proceeding more slowly and sporadically, which is
the Canadian way.  We start, of course, with revolution; is it
a provincial or federal responsibility? At the provincial level
it is being led by conservative parties in the Province of Alberta
and the Province of Ontario, but at the national level the federal
Conservative Party has virtually disappeared.  Therefore, at the
national level the conservative revolution is being managed or
mismanaged by a pragmatic liberal administration that is not at
all enthusiastic about leading such a revolution but is being
pushed along by a third party, namely, the Reform Party.  If all
of this sounds confusing, it is, but it arises from the fact that
we Canadians are extreme moderates and tend to protect ourselves
from the excesses of revolutions by entrusting their management
to people who do not believe in them.  
<P>
So that's a synopsis of the conservative revolution that is in
progress in our country, but there is another revolution which
is going on in the world at the same time. There have been allusions
to it by other speakers, and this I will refer to as the structural
revolution, and in my country, this revolution is as pronounced
as the conservative revolution.  
<P>
The structural revolution has two conflicting components.  On
the one hand it is characterized by the removal of the internal
and external barriers to trade, the aggregation of local and provincial
economies into national economies, and then the aggregation of
those national economies and identities into larger global structures
like the North American Free Trade Area, the European Union or
the Asia Pacific Economic Community.  At the same time that the
aggregation into bigger and bigger units is going on, of course,
more and more people and more and more countries want to affirm
and exercise more local and personal control over social services
and cultural policies that directly affect the quality of their
own lives and their cultural and personal identities.  Thus, in
that respect, they identify more with smaller and more homogeneous
units of political organization - local governments and communities
- based often on regional or racial or linguistic or cultural
distinctiveness.  
<P>
In Canada, therefore, at the same time that our national economy
is being integrated into the North American global economy, this
structural revolution manifests itself in the form of regional
alienation in western Canada, Quebec separatism, talk of maritime
union in our atlantic provinces, provincial premiers demanding
more decentralization of federal power, and large municipalities
contemplating city-state status.  In other words, the ground behind
Canada, and I'd suggest many other countries, is moving in two
different directions, like the big crustal plates that geologists
tell us are the cause of earthquakes.
<P>
The challenge of governments includes the challenge of designing
structures capable of absorbing those stresses and strains. Five
years ago, the alignment of political parties in the Canadian
Parliament that could have been described on the traditional left-right-center
axis. Today it could be just as well described as consisting of
traditional federalists - mainly liberals - defending the old
nation-state structure, separatists from Quebec seeking extreme
devolution, and new federalists - reformers - seeking to create
the more flexible federal state that can handle both of these
forces in the 21st century.  
<P>
Perhaps both the conservative revolution and the structural revolution
are simply aspects of a broader revolution, the democratic revolution.
 For me it is this democratic revolution which is the ultimate
revolution and which should end up being the distinguishing revolution
of our times.  All over the world, ordinary people are seeking
to get more control in their own hands or in the hands of institutions
they can influence over the facts that most directly affect the
quality and content of their lives.  Thus they will support the
conservative revolution to the extent that it limits the spending
and taxing powers of governments and leaves more dollars in the
pockets of citizens, if this is done equitably.  They will support
the conservative revolution to the extent that it redresses the
intrusiveness of the liberal, social policy state, provided the
old intrusions are not replaced by new intrusions.
<P>
Public support for the structural revolution, for enlarging markets
to stimulate economic growth, to create better jobs for people
with higher incomes, and public support for strengthening the
power of local government at the expense of larger and more distant
governments, is also it seems to me a manifestation of this broader
democratic revolution. If those larger and more distant governments
necessary to manage our national and international affairs are
to retain their legitimacy, they must take steps both to facilitate
a new division of powers between themselves and the lower levels
of government and they themselves must become more democratic,
more representative, more accountable and more responsive to the
people that they serve.
<P>
I am personally supportive of the general direction of the conservative
revolution and the structural revolution, but I believe that their
success or failure will ultimately be measured by the extent to
which they serve the cause of the democratic revolution, a democratic
revolution which I suggest is happening in Canada and virtually
every other country in the world.

<h2>Taking a Byte out of Disability</h2>
<b>by John Hood</b>
</center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While cleaning up the hard disk on my computer recently, I came 
across an accessory that I had never noticed before called "Text to Speech." Intrigued, I opened it and 
discovered that my relatively low-end computer could convert standard text files into speech. It can read 
aloud whatever I wish, from a brief newspaper column to a massive document.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The voice sounds very much like the one you hear throughout A Brief 
History of Time, a movie based on the book by scientist Stephen Hawking. Struck down by a debilitating 
illness that robbed him of speech and most of his mobility, Hawking has nevertheless become the world's 
most celebrated physicist and cosmologist. His extraordinary accomplishments were made possible by 
technologies that allow him to operate a computer -- and even, through it, to speak to movie audiences.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What's amazing to me is not that such technologies exist, but that they 
are so commonplace as to be installed in a run-of-the-mill personal computer like mine. In fact, 
inexpensive programs and devices have dramatically expanded the economic opportunities of disabled 
Americans, not only improving their own lives but allowing all of us to benefit from previously untapped 
talents and resources.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Mark Beckwith of Greenville, Maine, is a quadriplegic. But he is also a 
draftsman for the Log Home Co., thanks to innovative products from a Massachusetts firm called Dragon 
Systems. For less than a thousand dollars, you can purchase DragonDictate and run sophisticated computer 
programs by voice. The system converts each word it hears into text by piecing together the word's 
components and then comparing the combination with acoustic models in its built-in vocabulary list. By 
speaking key commands such as "Shift-Alt-F4," the user can operate spreadsheets, word processors, and 
even the drafting programs that Beckwith uses to design house-building plans.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Other low-cost computer devices that aid disabled users include screen-
magnification software ($200 to $600), Braille-output printers and translators ($2,100 to $4,000), and 
head-pointer or Morse-code systems that allow severely disabled people to issue computer commands 
($500 to $1,400).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Toward the opposite end of the cost scale is another product that helps 
quadriplegics accomplish tasks, called EyeGaze. Developed by LC Technologies in Fairfax, Virginia, it 
allows users to turn on appliances, run machinery, type letters, and play video games with eye movements. 
The device uses beams of light to translate movements into computer commands. Even at a price of 
$25,000, EyeGaze offers many seriously disabled people opportunities they never thought they had.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The market for products to enable physically handicapped workers -- 
ranging from speech synthesis and voice-input systems to robotics, deaf relays, Braille text displays, text 
telephones, monitoring devices, and environmental controls -- includes such major players as IBM, AT&T, 
Xerox, Nynex, Digital Equipment, and Apple. Thought of more broadly, products ranging from 
pharmaceuticals to ergonomic office furniture are also part of this effort to empower the disabled. Prozac 
and other antidepressants have helped many workers keep their jobs and improve their performance. Pain 
relievers allow employees with arthritis and similar ailments to perform work without enduring 
excruciating pain. Redesigned desks, chairs, and other equipment have done the same for those with 
chronic back problems, who make up about 15 percent of all people considered "disabled."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Many observers who have taken notice of American businesses' 
interest in this market have attributed it to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), enacted in 1990 and 
fully implemented in 1994. The ADA, among other things, requires businesses with 15 or more employees 
to give "equal access" to all disabled workers and consumers. Portrayed as a civil-rights measure no less 
important than the 1960s legislation against racial discrimination, the ADA may have attracted the 
attention of some firms that otherwise wouldn't have entered the market for disabled-enabling products. 
But its overall effect on the employability of the disabled is a great deal more complicated.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For one thing, the ADA has mainly affected not hiring but firing. In its 
first two years, about half of all ADA claims involved alleged wrongful discharges, while only 12 percent 
charged discrimination in hiring disabled workers. In one case, a senior executive with terminal brain 
cancer who had been fired was awarded $222,000 because his employer could not prove in court that he 
was unable to perform the essential functions of his job. In all too many cases, it appears, workers 
discharged for a variety of reasons have added the ADA to their other legal means of obtaining large 
severance payments.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Second, the targeted beneficiaries of the ADA include very few of the 
seriously disabled Americans that both proponents and opponents of the law tend to talk about. About half 
a million Americans are wheelchair bound, but almost 50 million Americans are considered "disabled" for 
the purposes of the ADA. They include those with relatively minor physical or mental infirmities. And they 
make up the vast majority of plaintiffs in ADA lawsuits alleging wrongful termination.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Third, the ADA may actually hinder rather than advance opportunities 
for disabled workers. It's harder to prove discrimination in hiring than wrongful termination -- that's why 
lawsuits alleging the latter are so much more common. Rather than face the potential legal consequences of 
letting a disabled worker go, even for perfectly appropriate reasons, some employers may well want to 
limit their exposure to such suits by not hiring the disabled in the first place, accepting the risk of 
noncompliance on the hiring side in order to avoid the much greater risk of wrongful termination suits. 
And their caution may be vindicated by the rash of spurious ADA claims by people claiming to be disabled 
by obesity, kleptomania, sex addiction, severe body odor, and "multiple chemical sensitivity." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The fact is that efforts to expand opportunities for disabled people far 
predates the ADA. The term "disabled" is itself relative, meaningful only according to the tasks one wants 
to perform and the technology available to help one do so. We now have more people living with physical 
and mental infirmities than ever before. In the past, those born with birth defects often didn't make it past 
infancy. Injuries that today lead to loss of limbs or motor control used to be deadly.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	On the other hand, the number of people who are functionally disabled, 
especially as it relates to employment, is surely lower. For most of human history, persons lacking nimble 
fingers or strong backs had little prospect of making a living. The advent of farm implements and simple 
devices such as looms increased the number of people who could perform work quickly and easily, thus 
increasing the standard-of-living for all. Similarly, until the invention of eyeglasses, an enormous number 
of human beings became virtually unemployable at an early age.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Thanks to modern machinery and appliances, many jobs no longer 
require great physical strength and endurance. Now, the Information Age promises to expand the 
boundaries of human potential even further, as the mind -- not the body -- becomes the most valuable asset 
a worker or entrepreneur can bring to the marketplace.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This is true even for the hardest cases. Researchers at Rutgers and 
Princeton universities have found that computers have significantly enhanced job opportunities and 
boosted earnings for many people with spinal-cord injuries. The researchers found that, all else held equal, 
people who have computer skills at the time of their injuries generally return to work more quickly than 
those without such skills. They also discovered that disabled workers with computer skills suffer no 
disparity in pay versus their counterparts without disabilities, while those without such skills do get paid 
less.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Modern computer technologies are mostly the product of competitive 
private markets, not government programs or regulations. By decisively shifting the source of economic 
value to ideas and away from physical exertion, computers and other information technologies have helped 
Americans with serious disabilities far more than has the ADA. Indeed, while the percentage of the 
disabled who are employed rose, especially among women, in the 20 years preceding the passage of the 
law, it has since leveled off. The National Organization on Disabilities studied the issue in 1986 and again 
in 1994, finding that the percentage of working disabled stayed roughly the same, given the margin of 
sampling error: 33 percent in 1986 versus 31 percent in 1994. Of course, there could be many explanations 
for this, but as Brian Doherty of Reason magazine concluded, "there is certainly no evidence, despite all 
the costs, that the ADA has helped" the disabled gain employment.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Private firms have incentives to develop, manufacture, and market 
products to empower disabled workers regardless of government regulation. There is already significant 
consumer demand for these items. The disabled want them to improve their own prospects and quality of 
life. And their potential employers have an incentive to create jobs for the most talented and hard-working 
individuals. Long before the advent of the ADA, companies such as Du Pont and Marriott discovered that 
efficiently accommodating the needs of disabled workers can boost performance and employee morale.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"Many employees with disabilities have really overcome many 
obstacles to being successfully employed and have shown lots of perseverance and creativity in showing 
how a job can be done," says Lana Smart of the National Center for Disability Services.
Indeed, there is an important qualitative difference between the way regulators approach workplace 
disability and the way private firms and individuals do. For regulators, the disabled represent a cost that 
must be imposed on unwilling businesses. In the private market for labor, however, finding ways to 
unleash the creative talents of the disabled can yield significant returns for firms, workers, and consumers. 
The disabled are viewed as potentially valuable assets, rather than potentially costly liabilities. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	It may be true that some severely disabled individuals cannot be 
profitably employed today, because the costs of doing so exceed the value of the work they can do. But 
they used to think that about the nearsighted, the slender-bodied, and the club-footed. It must not be 
forgotten that people have always found ways to eliminate those barriers to employment, without the 
prodding of government regulators.

<h2>En Banc Hearing on Spectrum Allocation</h2>
<b>Before the Federal Communications Commission</b><P>
Statement of <a href="/pff/people/afellow.html#Pitsch">Peter K. Pitsch</a>
<P><br>
<B>Summary</B>
<P>
The overarching goal in managing the electromagnetic spectrum
should be to maximize its value to the American people. As in
other areas of our economy, the best means of achieving efficient
use of this resource is to rely principally on market forces.
<P>
There are three fundamental problems with the current system.
They span the 60-year history of <a href="http://www.fcc.gov">the FCC</a> and continue to this
day. They are systemic. One, the FCC like other central planners
lacks the information necessary to make efficient decisions. Two,
the administrative process has been used by special interests
to delay competition and innovation. Three, the current system
has held fallow or underutilized a substantial portion of the
spectrum for government purposes.
<P>
The simple solution to the current spectrum gridlock is to give
existing and new spectrum users more operational and technical
flexibility to use their spectrum the way they see fit so long
as they do not interfere with their cochannel and adjacent channel
&quot;neighbors.&quot; Once a licensee is given the freedom to
use its spectrum for a broad range of uses, the licensee has a
strong economic incentive to consider the relative merits of alternative
uses. The more flexibility the licensee has, the more likely it
is that its use will be the highest and best use reflecting the
spectrum's true opportunity cost to society. 
<P>
In <a href="/pff/telecom_revolution.html">&quot;The Telecom Revolution, An American Opportunity,&quot;</a>
the Progress &amp; Freedom working group (of which I am a member)
proposed two fundamental spectrum reforms. First, unallocated
private sector spectrum and underutilized government spectrum
should be made available to private users. The spectrum should
be structured in highly flexible parcels with minimal government
constraints. These parcels should give the legal protection and
freedoms that attach to property, viz., technical and operational
freedom, protection from trespass or unlawful takings, and the
ability to assign, lease or sell. Where there are mutually exclusive
bids for these new parcels, winners should be selected by auctions.
<P>
The second way to achieve spectrum reform is to deregulate or
privatize existing spectrum users. As with the newly allocated
spectrum, the Congress should move to give existing users full
flexibility to use their spectrum subject to interference and
international treaty constraints. Licensees should be encouraged
to negotiate with their &quot;neighbors&quot; to reach mutually
beneficial agreements on possible new uses of their spectrum.

<P>
The time has come for the FCC to dramatically reform the spectrum
process. Spectrum gridlock is a primary obstacle to the full exploitation
of the computer revolution. Few things will promote wireless computer
applications and local telephone competition as much as driving
down the cost of spectrum by several orders of magnitude. A centrally-planned,
government-run allocation system probably never made sense. It
has cost Americans billions of dollars in foregone wealth and
prosperity, but the accelerating pace of technical change and
the increasing complexity of the spectrum allocation decisions
that have to be made make the case for dramatic reform more compelling
than ever before.
<P>
<B>Testimony</B>
<P>
It is an honor to have this opportunity to speak before the Federal
Communications Commission on one of the most important telecommunications
opportunities facing America--reforming our management of the
electromagnetic spectrum. I do not come recently to this issue.
I was in the thick of FCC deliberations on spectrum policy in
the 1980s, first as Chief of the FCC's Office of Plans &amp; Policy
for Chairman Mark Fowler and second as Chief of Staff to Chairman
Dennis Patrick. During those years I strongly espoused reforms
that would give licensees more technical and operational control
over how they use their spectrum and the use of auctions for initial
assignments where there are mutually exclusive applications. Since
then I have consulted for various telecom companies on spectrum
and other FCC-related issues.
<P>
Most recently, I and several other analysts from a wide range
of think tanks helped write The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation's
report on the FCC, &quot;The Telecom Revolution, An American Opportunity.&quot;
In it, we recommended privatizing spectrum management.
<P>
The overarching goal in managing the electromagnetic spectrum
should be to maximize its value to the American people. As in
the rest of our economy, the best means of achieving efficient
use of the spectrum is to rely principally on market forces. In
my brief remarks today, I would like to catalog various types
of failure systemic to the current centrally-planned, government-run
spectrum regime, then identify the two ways in which spectrum
reform can be achieved, and lastly spend a few moments discussing
the tremendous importance of spectrum reform to America's economic
and competitive prospects.
<P>
There are three fundamental problems with the current system.
They span the 60-year history of the FCC and continue to this
day. They are systemic. One, the FCC like other central planners
lacks the information necessary to make efficient decisions. Two,
the administrative process has been used by special interests
to delay competition and innovation. Three, the current system
has held fallow or underutilized a substantial portion of the
spectrum for government purposes.
<P>
First, determining efficient use is a complex task requiring vast
amounts of continually updated information that is hopelessly
beyond the abilities of an administrative process. Markets, of
course, &quot;parallel-process&quot; information gathered by millions
of businesses and consumers to continually provide price signals
on the relative usefulness of the myriad competing demands and
uses of spectrum. In the case of spectrum, the information required
to make the necessary tradeoffs is greater than in most other
areas of the economy, because the pace of technological development
has created a raft of new uses for &quot;wireless&quot; communications
and new ways in which spectrum can be efficiently deployed. The
comparative advantage of markets is greater in such dynamic situations.
<P>
As a result, the FCC has consistently made simplistic and overly
rigid decisions that misallocated spectrum, created inefficient
industry structures, and locked in outdated technical standards.
For example, in the 1950s the FCC dramatically underallocated
spectrum to VHF television reducing the availability of television
channels and impeding the development of a third, fourth and fifth
national television network. In the 1970s it long delayed and
then underallocated spectrum to cellular mobile telephony, creating
only two cellular companies. This delay alone cost America $85
billion dollars. Time and again it imposed a nationwide grid that
did not account for local differences--underallocating forestry
spectrum in Idaho and overallocating it in New York City and vice
versa for taxicab spectrum. Finally, the FCC locked in an analog
technical standard for cellular telephony that was 20 years old
and out of date by the time the FCC got around to assigning cellular
licenses.
<P>
The second systemic failure of the current spectrum regime is
its susceptibility to capture by special interests opposed to
innovation and competition. In the face of political pressure,
the FCC has again and again delayed the allocation of spectrum
to innovative new services. Examples include Direct Broadcast
Television, so called &quot;wireless cable&quot;, low power TV,
VHF drop ins, and new FM channels. Few companies and no trade
association can resist the temptation to use the current regulatory
scheme to disadvantage new competition or innovation. H.L. Mencken's
quip applies with full force, &quot;It may be a sin to think evil
of others, but it is seldom a mistake.&quot; The sad reality is
that in this &quot;regulatory game&quot;, the established concentrated
economic interests typically triumph over the amorphous and diffuse
interests of consumers.
<P>
The FCC's &quot;public interest&quot; regulation of spectrum has
been used as a weapon against consumers. Regulated companies frequently
have embraced special public interest obligations in exchange
for protection from competitors and innovation. This &quot;taxation
by regulation&quot; by unelected regulators, followed by the inevitable
<B>quid pro quo</B>, has been extremely costly to consumers. Any
such deals should be made explicitly and only by Congress.
<P>
The third systemic failure of the current system of spectrum management
is the underutilization of spectrum by the government sector.
While there is some debate on how much spectrum is effectively
denied to the private sector, there can be little doubt that it
is in absolute terms a huge amount. Many governmental uses of
spectrum are vital; others are not. All of these uses should be
justified economically. Today government users of spectrum have
access to spectrum at far less cost than that available to non
government users. Recall that in the recent PCS auctions the winners
paid over $7 billion for 60 MHz of PCS spectrum. Moreover, because
government users do not operate under a profit incentive and often
have difficulty funding the use of new spectrum efficient technology,
they are probably far less efficient than private users.
<P>
The simple solution to the current spectrum gridlock is to give
existing and new spectrum users more operational and technical
flexibility to use their spectrum the way they see fit so long
as they do not interfere with their cochannel and adjacent channel
&quot;neighbors.&quot; The logic of this reform is easily illustrated.
Typically, a licensee has two choices: (1) use its spectrum for
a narrow purpose with the specific technology that the FCC has
designated or (2) give it back to the FCC. Given this choice,
the current spectrum use will be economic to the licensee as long
as it has any positive value. In economic terms the &quot;opportunity
cost&quot; of the spectrum to the licensee is zero. The cost to
society, of course, is the most valuable alternative use that
is foregone. Importantly, technological developments and the elimination
of other regulatory barriers has been dramatically increasing
the value of these alternative uses.
<P>
Once a licensee is given the freedom to use its spectrum for a
broad range of uses, however, the licensee has a strong economic
incentive to consider the relative merits of alternative uses.
The more flexibility the licensee has, the more likely it is that
its use will be the highest and best use reflecting the spectrum's
true opportunity cost to society.
<P>
In &quot;The Telecom Revolution, An American Opportunity,&quot;
the Progress &amp; Freedom working group proposed a four-part
plan to reform spectrum management. For sake of brevity, this
plan can be reduced to two mechanisms. First, the FCC should make
unallocated private sector spectrum and underutilized government
spectrum available to private users. The spectrum should be structured
in highly flexible parcels with minimal government constraints.
These parcels should give the legal protection and freedoms that
attach to property, viz., technical and operational freedom, protection
from trespass or unlawful takings, and the ability to assign,
lease or sell. Of course, these new users should be subject to
antitrust and other laws that apply to businesses generally. Where
there are mutually exclusive bids for these new parcels, winners
should be selected by auctions. The use of simultaneous multiple
round auctions should allow users to aggregate spectrum (both
in bandwidth and geographically) to reduce the costs of introducing
equipment, resolving interference disputes, and marketing a new
service.
<P>
A few words about auctions are in order. They are the most efficient
means of assigning licenses where there are mutually exclusive
applicants for three reasons. First, they make assignments more
quickly than administrative hearings and lotteries. A three-year
delay imposed by comparative hearings or lotteries can easily
wipe out a full one-fourth of the present value of the license.
Second, they assign the spectrum to those who are most likely
to put it to its highest valued use. Third, they make these assignments
at less cost to society. Instead of using scarce resources in
expensive lotteries and comparative hearings, applicants compete
by adding zeros to the size of the transfer payment they are willing
to make to the government.
<P>
Note that the primary value of auctions is not that they raise
money for the government. Care should be taken that auctions do
not become an obstacle to the principal goal of reducing spectrum
scarcity. Spectrum should be released as rapidly and efficiently
as possible, even if that reduces the government's auction proceeds,
because the goal is to free up spectrum for the benefit of the
American economy. Indeed, if the FCC is doing its job right auction
prices for comparable parcels of spectrum should fall over time.
<P>
The second way to achieve spectrum reform is to deregulate or
privatize existing spectrum users. As with the newly allocated
spectrum, the FCC should move to give existing users full flexibility
to use their spectrum subject to interference and international
treaty constraints. Licensees should be encouraged to negotiate
with their &quot;neighbors&quot; to reach mutually beneficial
agreements on possible new uses of their spectrum. This approach
creates a private incentive to &quot;reallocate&quot; spectrum
and take on the vested interests that can be counted to oppose
new competition and innovation. (Evan Kwerel and John Williams
of the FCC have illustrated one way in which this approach could
be used in the UHF spectrum.) Likewise, the government agencies
should be encouraged to sell or sublease their spectrum to the
private sector.
<P>
Those who see privatizing existing spectrum as a government &quot;giveaway&quot;
miss the point. The existing users have for the most part purchased
their spectrum in the resale market. It is not fair, efficient
or politically feasible to require them to pay for their spectrum
again. Furthermore, top down grants of flexible spectrum will
be difficult because the existing users will collectively oppose
the release of hundreds of MHz in flexible allocations. Privatizing
existing spectrum will create a competition among existing licensees
to move &quot;beach front&quot; spectrum from its current &quot;land
dump&quot; uses. In this parlance, the current &quot;beach property
owners&quot; may not appreciate these efforts, but they will not
be able to stop them. Indeed, they might well choose to join them.
In the end, America's &quot;beach-consuming public&quot; will
benefit.
<P>
It should be noted that these approaches do not require all or
nothing. You can do them in degree. In fact the Commission, under
Chairmen Fowler, Patrick, Sikes and Hundt, has increasingly utilized
the concepts of flexibility and private negotiation. Examples
include giving cellular licensees flexibility, allowing ITFS licensees
to lease spectrum to wireless cable operators, allowing FM radio
stations to use their subcarriers for paging and other uses, allowing
PCS licensees to buy out microwave licensees in their license
areas, opening the eligibility of SMRS licensees, and consolidating
land mobile pools. Working within the limits of the administrative
process and the current law has been a difficult task and they
and their fellow commissioners and many key staffers deserve credit
for what they have done.
<P>
The time has come, however, for the FCC to dramatically speed
up this process. A centrally-planned, government-run allocation
system probably never made sense. It has cost Americans billions
of dollars in foregone wealth and prosperity, but the accelerating
pace of technical change and the increasing complexity of the
spectrum allocation decisions that have to be made make the case
for dramatic reform more compelling than ever before.
<P>
We are all familiar with the rapid change in the computer industry.
In the space of five years, <a href="http://www.ibm.com">IBM</a> lost roughly $70 billion dollars
of market capitalization. In the same period, many small hardware
and software companies grew exponentially, more than offsetting
those mainframe losses. Who can seriously question the likelihood
that if <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a>, <a href="http://www.intel.com">Intel</a>, <a href="http://www.compaq.com">Compaq</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> had required FCC spectrum
to get to the market, the personal computer revolution would have
been postponed.
<P>
In the same way, spectrum gridlock is a primary obstacle to the
full exploitation of the computer revolution. Few things will
promote wireless computer applications and local telephone competition
as much as driving down the cost of spectrum by several orders
of magnitude. Fundamental spectrum reform would build on the U.S.'s
current but perishable lead in the global digital derby. America
is positioned to leave other countries in a cloud of silicon dust.
A regulatory framework that slows innovation in this area, despite
any plausible shortrun efficiency gains it might achieve, will
foreclose a tremendous opportunity for the American people.

<br>
<h2>On the Road to Digital Freedom</h2>
<P>

The Telecommunications Act of  1996 (TCA) represents the most
sweeping reform of telecommunications law in more than 60 years.
 In principle, the new legislation will enable local telephone
companies, long distance companies, cable TV companies, direct
broadcast satellite providers, over-the-air broadcasters, cellular
companies and a host of others to compete against one another
to provide all sorts of communications and information services
in the converging market for digital information and information
technology.  The potential benefits for consumers and for America's
position in the world are beyond calculation.
<P>
The key word in the previous sentence, however, is <I>potential</I>.
 As some commentators have noted, TCA is not, in and of itself,
a deregulatory bill.  Indeed, it mandates over 80 new rulemakings
by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and delegates
significant authority to state regulators.  If the FCC and the
states use their authority to reduce regulation and encourage
competition, TCA can lead to an efficient, deregulated regime
for the new digital information marketplace and put America on
the road to digital freedom.
<P>
But TCA does not mandate such a result.  In most cases, it gives
the FCC and the states authority to deregulate, but it does not
require that they do so.  For example:
<UL>
<LI>Regulators will oversee the opening of local telephone markets
to competition.  Along the way they will have to address many
difficult technical and economic issues including interconnection,
unbundling, number portability, resale, dialing parity and right-of-way
access.  The nature and pace of the transition is left largely
to regulatory discretion.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Regulators will also implement very broad provisions designed
to change dramatically the current system of &quot;universal service&quot;
subsidies, aiming to target them more to low income households,
collect them in a competitively-neutral fashion and otherwise
reduce them where possible.  
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The Telecommunications Act of 1996 provides that the FCC &quot;shall
forbear&quot; from regulating where public interest criteria are
met.  How the FCC uses its discretion in implementing this provision
will have a dramatic impact on the pace of deregulation.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The final days of legislative debate spotlighted the importance
of issues associated with the electromagnetic spectrum.  In coming
months, both the FCC and Congress will consider how current spectrum
management practices should be reformed.

<P>

<P>
The smoothness and even success of the transition to a competitive
digital marketplace will depend upon how well these issues are
handled.  The consequences for America's future are enormous:
 
<UL>
<LI>Digital information products and services are the most rapidly
growing segment of the world economy, expected to account for
$1 trillion or more in sales by the year 2000.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Technological advances in these areas are the driving force
behind a global transition from an industrial age economy to an
information age economy, literally transforming every aspect of
the world economy, and society itself.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The social consequences of the transition are profound, and
implementation of TCA will have profound consequences for how
digital technologies are made available to all segments of the
population.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>America's leadership in the world, and ultimately its national
security, are dependent on continuing its leadership role in information
technology.

<h3>The Working Group</h3>

<P>
Early last year House Telecom Subcommittee Chairman Jack Fields
asked the Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation for its recommendations
on reforming the Federal Communications Commission.  PFF assembled
a &quot;working group&quot; of top-flight telecom experts and
scholars, many of whom had been senior staffers at the FCC for
several years.  The working group includes:
<UL>
<LI>Dr. Robert Crandall, Brookings Institution;
<LI>Dr. Jeffrey Eisenach, Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation;
<LI>James Gattuso, Esq., Citizens For A Sound Economy;
<LI>Dr. Thomas Hazlett, University of California, Davis;
<LI>Peter W. Huber, Manhattan Institute;
<LI>Dr. George A. Keyworth, Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation;
<LI>Dr. Thomas Lenard, Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation;
<LI>William C. Myers, Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation;
<LI>Peter Pitsch, Esq., Hudson Institute;
<LI>Kenneth Robinson, Esq.;
<LI>Gregory Sidak, Esq., American Enterprise Institute; and
<LI>Adam Thierer, Heritage Foundation.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
Last May, the working group produced  a replacement model for
the FCC entitled <I>The Telecom Revolution, An American Opportunity</I>.
 This report outlined an approach for eliminating much of the
current regulatory apparatus and replacing the FCC with a smaller,
leaner oversight agency designed to promote competition.   The
working group report played an important role in educating public
policy leaders and members of the public about the nature of the
transition to a digital environment, and served as the focus of
PFF testimony before both Congress and the FCC; members of the
working group met with leaders in both Houses of Congress on numerous
occasions to brief them on their findings.
<P>
In 1996, Congress has again turned to the working group, with
the chairs of the major oversight committees in both Houses requesting
specific assistance from PFF with respect to issues ranging from
spectrum management, to forebearance, to the structure of the
FCC itself.  FCC Chairman Reed Hundt has also sought PFF's input
and advice.
<P>
<h3>The Project and its Activities</h3>

<P>
PFF's May 1995 report concluded that the pace of technological
change has fundamentally changed the political economy of regulation.
 Innovation has made effective competition possible throughout
the telecom market.  It has also dramatically increased the cost
of regulatory delays and impediments.  The FCC needed to be replaced
by a new, smaller, more focused agency.  
<P>
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 has provided the means and
added impetus for achieving this goal.  The new legislation requires
state and federal regulators to assure that a competitive 14-point
checklist of conditions are met in local exchange markets, before
allowing the regional Bell operating companies to enter the in-region
long distance and equipment manufacturing markets.  The implementation
of the interconnection, network unbundling, and related pricing
issues will be major battlegrounds.  This process is important
to the efficient development of local telecommunications competition
and the expeditious development of additional competition in long
distance and equipment markets.  
<P>
Fashioning universal service reforms will present a stiff political
challenge.  Many interests will press for the expansion of the
definition of universal service.  If these subsidies are not reduced
and targeted, a competitively-neutral system that does not impede
new technology will be difficult to achieve.  The legislation
sets forward specific universal service principles to be observed,
but also gives the FCC considerable latitude to reform the system.
 A convincing record and strategy will be needed to carry out
true reform. 
<P>
To free up needed administrative resources and eliminate counterproductive
regulation, the FCC will need to forbear from regulating in many
areas.  Suitable areas for deregulation will need to be identified
and justified.  At the same time, the FCC will be wrestling with
a raft of other issues ranging from antenna preemption to video
services provided by telephone companies. 
<P>
The legislation has also created an enormous opportunity for the
FCC to spur local telephone competition and the development of
 new wireless services by making more spectrum available through
market mechanisms.  Practical ways of dealing with interference
and other objections to &quot;dezoning&quot; the spectrum will
need to be developed.  Alternative mechanisms of freeing up spectrum,
such as variants of the PCS overlay approach and a more &quot;bottom-up&quot;
approach used in the case of Nextel, will need to be closely examined
and appraised.
<P>
In short, much more detailed work will be needed to effect a smooth
transition to a truly competitive digital information marketplace.
 The updated FCC replacement project will provide a detailed plan
of action building on the new legislation, focusing both on the
implementation of TCA and the need for additional legislation
to further speed the transition.  Given TCA's reliance on devolution
to the states, a telecommunications model for state law and regulation
will also be developed.  Specifically, <I>On The Road to Digital
Freedom</I> will provide important research in six main areas:
<UL>
<LI>The FCC role in creating competitive market conditions in
local telecommunications markets;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The FCC role in assuring universal service goals are met;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Spectrum management reforms that could be undertaken by the
FCC or legislated by Congress;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Specific areas in which the FCC should forbear from regulating;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Specific areas of FCC regulation that Congress should eliminate
or transfer to other agencies; and,
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The role and specific direction the states should take in
speeding the transition to a competitive digital marketplace.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
The project will produce three major written products and three
related events.
<P>
A draft update of the replacement model for the FCC will be produced
by mid-April, 1996.  This first effort will focus on spectrum
and forbearance issues and be timed to inform expected hearings
in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives on spectrum and
FCC restructuring issues.  It will provide the basis for a PFF
strategic summit in mid-April on the implications of the Telecommunications
Act of 1996.  
<P>
The final draft of the FCC replacement report will be completed
by July 1996, prior to Congress' August recess and the Foundation's
August Aspen Summit, at which the report will be presented and
debated.  
<P>
Finally, an expanded stand-alone report on state regulatory issues
will be completed by November 1996 and released in time to inform
state legislative deliberations in 1997.  State telecommunications
licensing and regulation recommendations will be presented to
state legislative leaders at a winter workshop, perhaps hosted
in conjunction with the American Legislative Exchange Council.
<P>
In addition to these reports and events, the Foundation will maintain
a site on the Internet, at which key issues will be presented
and debated; will arrange expert testimony before appropriate
state and Congressional legislative committees, upon request;
issue Progress on Point alerts, as appropriate; and otherwise
inform the national debate on telecommunications and information
technology policy.
<P>
The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation will provide overall direction
for the project and will have ultimate responsibility for the
final product.  From PFF, the project team will include Dr. George
A. Keyworth, II, Chairman; Dr. Jeffrey Eisenach, President; William
Myers, Vice President for Policy; and Dr. Thomas Lenard, Senior
Fellow and Director of Regulatory Studies.  Peter Pitsch, Esq.,
now an adjunct fellow at PFF, will direct the project.  Participation
of other working group members is expected to provide input on
all important aspects of the project.

<h2>In the Trenches of A City's War on Poverty</h2>
<b>by Kim A. Lawton</b>
<p><p><P></center>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For Marcia, release from a California prison was 
both a blessing and a curse: She suddenly had to figure out how to care for herself and her infant 
son. An abuser of heroin and cocaine for more than 20 years, she had few job skills or prospects. 
She had been on welfare, but balked at returning to that treadmill. And if she checked into a drug 
treatment program, she probably would be separated from her baby. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"I knew that I was going to begin using [drugs] again . . 
. and I knew that I didn't want to do that," says Marcia, who asked not to be fully identified. "I 
just was tired of it all." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Then she heard about House of Grace, a residential 
program in San Jose for abused, homeless, or addicted women. It is one of the few recovery 
programs in the county that allows mothers to stay with their children. As soon as Marcia and her 
son moved into the program's renovated apartment complex in December 1994, house director 
Denise Lutcher got actively involved in her life. Lutcher and her staff went to work assessing 
Marcia's physical, emotional, vocational, and spiritual needs. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For residents like Marcia, that list of needs is 
usually long. Women receive counseling, attend recovery classes, complete their education, and 
learn life skills such as managing a budget and caring for their children. But they must also 
follow a clear set of rules. They must wean themselves from welfare and other government aid 
within six months. They are permitted no televisions or telephones in their rooms. A resident 
who fails her weekly drug test just once faces immediate expulsion. And the women must attend 
Bible classes and chapel.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"The program helped me to get a hold of my life 
because of the tools they teach," says Marcia. Today, at 42, she is entering the final phases of her 
recovery program at the House of Grace. She has enrolled in a local college, where she is earning 
top grades in a program on computing and information systems. She holds a part-time job. Her 
son, now two, is flourishing in a community with other stable parents.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	House of Grace typifies the strategy -- and the 
success -- of a community-based and religiously rooted approach to helping the urban poor. It is 
one of several programs set up by CityTeam Ministries, a private, nondenominational Christian 
agency working in the inner city of San Jose. Last year, CityTeam administered a budget of $7 
million and a staff of nearly a hundred, and provided intensive, on-going help to more than 5,000 
individuals and families -- all without a dollar of public funds. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As noted in a recent Hudson Institute report, the 
agency has transformed itself to meet the changing social needs of San Jose. As the city grew 
from a small industrial town in the 1950s to a world technology capital, it drew thousands of 
poor Anglo, Vietnamese, and Latino families, out-of-work laborers, gangs, and crack addicts. 
Meanwhile, CityTeam evolved from a homeless shelter for white, middle-aged alcoholic men 
into a comprehensive program for homeless and drug-addicted women, children at risk, and 
entire families living in or on the edge of poverty. And it has done so by mobilizing an army of 
volunteers and donors, energizing a committed and innovative staff, and applying an intensive, 
holistic approach to solving problems.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Each of CityTeam's programs combines a 
philosophy of compassionate intervention mixed with strict accountability, an emphasis on long-
term changes in destructive behavioral patterns, and a strong religious underpinning. The Bible is 
the main guide both to morality and to practical living.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While some state agencies were devoting a lot of 
time and money to providing the homeless with food and housing, CityTeam began to focus on 
drug and alcohol addiction -- which it considers the root causes of most homelessness -- and in 
1983 established a residential recovery program. While most state-funded recovery programs last 
about 30 days, CityTeam staff believe more time is needed for permanent changes; participants 
remain in recovery programs for between 18 and 24 months. And while government-supported 
rehabilitation programs demand that staff members have degrees in social work, the rescue 
mission's house manager is himself a former crack addict and a graduate of the group's recovery 
and Christian training programs; he's now completing his master's degree.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Field workers realized that preventing addiction 
meant reaching children before they began using drugs. From this insight emerged a youth 
program that includes Camp May-Mac, a summer camp for at-risk inner-city children. 
Throughout the year, CityTeam keeps about a thousand kids busy with regular recreational 
activities, neighborhood clubs, tutoring, leadership development, and Bible studies. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But even here their approach is unconventional: The 
group's youth workers actually move into the troubled neighborhoods of east San Jose in order to 
build stable relationships with children at risk. CityTeam President Pat Robertson says kids know 
where the organization's workers live and know that they can reach those workers anytime, day 
or night. "[We] are not just commuting in and out," he says. "The problems of the community are 
our problems."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Whole families are helped through the agency's 
family-relief center, where counselors distinguish urgent and immediate needs from long-term, 
underlying issues. Volunteers distribute food, clothing, and furniture, provide rent assistance, 
assemble holiday food boxes and kits of school supplies, and teach English as a second-language 
to Spanish and Vietnamese residents. Volunteers also act as unofficial caseworkers, following up 
with client families. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Harry Brown, the vice president for administration, 
says CityTeam's extensive volunteer network enables the agency to provide a level of support 
and personal help that rivals publicly funded programs in the city. CityTeam volunteers -- about 
3,000 in any year -- are involved in everything from baby-sitting to tutoring to prayer. Most 
volunteers are recruited through local churches or ads. While some volunteers work only once a 
year, others offer a regular commitment.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	CityTeam applies the same targeted grass-roots 
approach to fundraising as it does to delivering social services. Most staff members spend up to 
eight hours a week fundraising, providing the agency with about 40,000 active donors -- an 
impressive base for a local charity -- with average contributions of less than $200. "It's Joe and 
Sally Smith at 50 bucks a month who sustain our organization," says Brown. "It's possible 
because there are a large number of stakeholders who believe in the goal and are willing to 
participate in the process."
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	According to a 1995 study by Independent Sector, 
an umbrella group for nongovernmental organizations, most private charities rely heavily on 
direct government subsidies. But Robertson says that because of CityTeam's strong religious 
emphasis, the ministry consistently refuses to accept any government aid, which imposes rules 
against proselytizing clients and discriminating among job applicants. At CityTeam, all staff 
members must share the agency's evangelical Christian beliefs; most programs require 
mandatory chapel attendance or Bible studies and encourage involvement in local churches. "We 
focus on what it means to be a disciple of Jesus Christ and how that influences life on a practical 
level," says Curt Floski, the director of the Rescue Mission and Recovery Program.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Staff members say the religious component, with its 
emphasis on personal transformation, is indispensable. An internal 1992 study seems to 
corroborate that: Of the men who had graduated from CityTeam's addiction-recovery program 
between 1986 and 1992, more than 60 percent were still "working and clean and sober." National 
experts have found that among low-income and low-education groups -- the agency's principal 
client population -- recovery success rates typically remain below 16 percent.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Can the CityTeam approach be duplicated in other 
urban areas? The group launched a branch outside Philadelphia in the mid-1980s, and it has 
earned high marks from community leaders. "They have done more to end human suffering in 
Chester [Pennsylvania] than any other organization I know of," says Jack Holefelder, the 
president of the Delaware County Chamber of Commerce.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In San Jose, CityTeam has established the 
International Center for Urban Training. Through seminars, instructional manuals, and work in 
agency projects, trainees learn about the group's holistic service philosophy. The staff also teach 
techniques for fundraising, volunteer recruitment, strategic planning, public affairs, and 
government relations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Officials say they are committed to developing 
models of ministry that can be broadly replicated to help the poor. "One of the things you find is 
that needs out there are relatively common, and the solutions that apply to them also have 
relatively common applications," Brown says. "You have to have a set of core values [relevant] 
to the issues, and then you have to consistently implement those values." And the vital dynamic, 
Robertson says, is personal involvement and intervention: "Programs are best done at the local 
level when you can look people eyeball to eyeball." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The people who challenged Marcia to change made 
a crucial difference in her life. For the first time, she says, she learned that she possessed both 
abilities and responsibilities -- and that it was time to offer them to her family and community. 
Now she spends her evenings teaching "life skills" seminars to other women living at the House 
of Grace. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Marcia learned it was possible to walk away from a 
life of addiction, and she has remained drug free. And most importantly, she says, she acquired a 
spiritual foundation for her life. "It's everything that I needed," she says, "things that I lacked for 
so long, or that I was too medicated to even realize were missing."

<hr width=50%></center>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The destruction by Cuban MIGs of two U.S.-registered civilian
aircraft flying over international waters in the Florida Straits
on February 24, 1996, proves once again that Fidel Castro will
never allow real economic and democratic reforms in Cuba. The
Castro regime is lying when it claims that the downed aircraft
were inside the 12-mile territorial limit recognized by international
law. The first aircraft shot down was approximately five miles
north of Cuban airspace, and the second was at least 16 nautical
miles north of Cuban airspace. Four American citizens were killed.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As usual, the Clinton Administration’s rhetoric was sharp, but its initial actions were timid.  In fact, the President did not get tough with Castro until it became clear that there was strong bipartisan support in Congress for immediate tightening of the economic sanctions against Castro.  As a result, on February 28, 1996, the Administration and Congress finally reached agreement on a new version of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act (H.R. 927, the "Libertad" bill) that is much tougher than the House and Senate versions passed last fall.  The new provisions include:
<p><ul>
<li> A section that gives the weight of law to all executive orders and regulations regarding Cuba, thereby ensuring that the economic embargo against Cuba cannot be lifted by presidential order unless there is a democratic transition in Cuba without Castro.
<p>
<li> The mandatory denial of U.S. visas to anyone -- corporate officers, principals, or shareholders -- who acquires or uses American-owned property confiscated in Cuba by the Castro regime.
<p>
<li> The inclusion of Title III, allowing U.S. citizens to use American courts to sue foreign companies and individuals who buy confiscated property in Cuba.  This was not in the bill approved by the Senate last fall.  However, to win Clinton’s support, congressional negotiators agreed to language that gives the President the authority to waive the implementation of Title III for six-month periods.  Since the waiver can be renewed, this means that Title III could be delayed indefinitely.
</ul><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Administration and Congress hailed the compromise package as the toughest bill ever passed to bring about the demise of Castro.  However, while passage of the "Libertad" bill is a major step forward, Castro'’s regime is not likely to be very impressed.  In addition to tightening economic sanctions against Cuba, the U.S. government should make it clear to Castro that any further violations of international law or unprovoked military attacks against American citizens will be countered with appropriate and decisive force. Specifically, the U.S. government should:


























<P><ul>
<li><b> Announce that the U.S. will enforce international laws in the region.</b> This means that Cuba's so-called Air Defense Zone ends
at the 12-mile limit established by international law, not the
24th parallel as claimed by the Castro regime. The U.S. should
make clear to Cuba that any more attacks against civilian aircraft
or boats outside Cuba's 12-mile territorial limit will prompt
an immediate and proportional response by America's armed forces.
To make sure Castro gets the point, U.S. warplanes should patrol
the Florida Straits below the 24th parallel and should respond
to any provocation by Cuban air, sea, or ground-based forces both
immediately and forcefully. A similar policy was pursued with
regard to Libya. In February 1986, U.S. Navy aviators shot down
two Libyan MIGs threatening them in international airspace over
the Gulf of Sidra.<BR>

<P>
<li><b> Inform Castro that a new refugee crisis will be considered a
hostile act against the national security of the United States.</b>
The Castro regime has agreed to abide by the immigration act signed
in 1995 between the U.S. and Cuba. This agreement stipulates that
up to 20,000 Cuban &eacute;migr&eacute;s will be issued visas
annually, that the Castro government will not permit any new mass
departures by sea of illegal Cuban immigrants, and that any Cubans
intercepted at sea by U.S. naval forces will be repatriated to
a Cuban port. The U.S. should insist that all aspects of this
agreement be respected by all parties. <BR>

<P>
<li><b>Ban all cash remittances to Cuba from the U.S.</b> This undoubtedly
would affect many Cubans who depend on regular remittances from
their relatives in the U.S., but it also would deprive the Castro
regime of a source of hard currency that now totals over $500
million a year.<BR>

<P>
<li><b> Prohibit all visits to Cuba by American citizens.</b> This prohibition
should include journalists, academics, and business people and
should be extended to include visits by way of third countries.
Similarly, Cuban journalists, academics, and other professionals
should not be granted visas to visit the U.S. until the Castro
regime allows independent Cuban professionals and opposition leaders
the same travel privileges it allows its communist apparatchiks.
<BR>

<P>
<li><b> Declare that U.S. countermeasures are aimed at Castro, not the
Cuban people.</b> Radio and television broadcasts to Cuba on Radio
Mart&iacute; and TV Mart&iacute; should be expanded to inform
the Cuban people that U.S. economic sanctions are directed not
at the Cuban people, but at Fidel and Raul Castro. To undermine
the Castro regime's efforts to rally the support of the Cuban
people with anti-American communist propaganda, the U.S. should
launch a vigorous, sustained effort to inform them that when Castro
leaves power, the U.S. will lift the trade embargo, quickly restore
Cuba's most favored nation status, and remain committed to supporting
the economic and democratic reconstruction of Cuba. To make sure
the broadcasts are beamed into Cuba, U.S. aircraft with broadcasting
equipment should be stationed permanently in the international
skies over the Florida Straits to break the Cuban government's
jamming efforts. Any aggressive acts against these aircraft by
Cuban forces should be countered immediately by American Navy
and Air Force units patrolling the area.<BR>

<P>
<li><b> Impose tight controls over the activities and movements of Cuban
officials in the U.S.</b> Efforts by the Castro regime to spread its
lies and propaganda in the U.S. should be banned. If the regime
does not allow democratic and human rights groups to meet freely
and openly in Cuba, and does not allow Americans to participate
in such meetings, the U.S. should not allow Cuban officials to
participate in any similar events within the United States. Moreover,
any Cuban official who violates this restriction should be expelled
from the U.S.<BR>

<P>
<li><b> Declare that the U.S. opposes activation of the nuclear reactor
in Cuba.</b> The U.S. should make clear to Castro that America will
not allow Cuba to build and operate a nuclear reactor on the island,
even if the reactor is to be used only for electrical power generation.
Since 1991, construction of a nuclear reactor near Cienfuegos,
about 130 miles east of Havana on Cuba's southern coast, has been
stopped by a lack of funding to complete the project. Three-quarters
of the construction needed to finish the project has been completed.
The plant is not the same design as the Chernobyl reactor; it
more closely matches safer ones built in East Germany during the
Cold War. However, these plants were shut down by West German
officials after unification because of their poor safety record,
and the unfinished reactor in Cuba has been built with faulty
rods and shoddy materials. If completed, Cuba's reactor could
pose a broad safety risk to U.S. lives and property in Florida
and the U.S. Southeast Coast.

True social security

Want to save the Social Security system? Start privatizing it. If that sounds like the advice of some crazed conservative with a political death wish, then think again. In February, the New York Times reported that a Clinton administration advisory panel is on the verge of recommending that a portion of workers' payroll taxes be invested in the stock market. Some members of the panel would even allow workers to make their own investment decisions.
<br><dd>
"Our proposal," said Sylvester Schieber, an employee benefits specialist and member of the Advisory Council on Social Security, "would give people the widest choice of investment options. People could invest their Social Security money as they invest the money in their individual retirement accounts. Beyond the floor of protection provided by Social Security, we should let people participate fully in this economic miracle that we call America. It's paternalistic to assume that people cannot take action in their own self-interest."

<br><dd>
Washington, of course, is filled with well-intentioned paternalistic types who presume to know more about what's good for people than the people themselves. That includes saving for retirement. In all likelihood, someone with a similar mindset on the council leaked the news of its draft findings in order to rally opposition to it. That's just the way Washington works. The 13-member panel, which was appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala in June 1994, is scheduled to issue its findings in the spring.

<br><dd>
According to the Times, there are at least two key recommendations in the current draft. First, eight of the 13 members favor shifting some portion of Social Security investments from long-term, interest-bearing government securities into common stocks. Edward Gramlich, professor of economics and dean of the University of Michigan's School of Public Policy, rightly notes that stocks have significantly outperformed bonds over the long term. Panel member Robert Ball, a Democrat and former Social Security commissioner, would invest up to 40 percent of program revenues in the market based on recommendations by a board of government money managers.

<br><dd>
Second, some panel members actually favor creating an individual account for each person covered by Social Security. Although Social Security would still hold the accounts, beneficiaries would choose from, say, 10 options on how the account would be invested.

<br><dd>
These aren't the only issues at stake here. The level of Federal Insurance Contributions Act taxes, the eligibility age of Social Security recipients, changes in benefits and the timing of any reforms in the program would all have to be taken into account should the federal government decide to implement them. In that regard, reformers should keep a couple of things in mind. First, the sooner the reforms, the easier it would be to accommodate them. Waiting until Social Security is on the verge of going broke, as it will if the program continues at present, would require drastic changes in eligibility, taxation and benefit requirements.

<br><dd>
Second, the Social Security program today is nothing more than a transfer of tax funds from one generation to the next. Unlike other investment instruments such as stocks, therefore, investing in Social Security is nothing more than a bet on the willingness of future workers to pay payroll taxes. Given its choice, the Clinton administration's advisory council would rather bet on the stock market.

<h2>Revolution</h2>
by <a href="/pff/people/sfellow.html#Vlahos">Michael Vlahos</a>
<P>
<P>
&#147;Revolution&#148; is one of those words.
<P>
Arguably, it is an American sacred word, like Freedom and Democracy,
Progress and Liberty.  But how we trivialize, and in turn, are
terrified by it!
<P>
It is a word perfect in its diminutive:  The HealthRider is a
&#147;revolutionary&#148; product;  Connecticut&#146;s state government
calls recycling &#147;the next American Revolution;&#148;  each
new electoral shift is hailed as a &#147;revolution.&#148;  We
like revolution as Progress Plus, as long as it stays in the comfort
zone of the familiar, and what we know as the good.  It is Big
Change we control.
<P>
Which is clearly what revolution is not.
<P>
We know this too, so we love the word, but we are afraid of it
too.  We love the revolution we made.  But after 1776 came 1789.
 Big Change was Shanghaied.  High-octane <I>Pilgrim&#146;s Progress</I>
was ditched for the <I>Beau Savage</I>, who led a descent into
the primitive, to The Terror.  Our sober, civic revolution was
stolen by firebrand French wordsmiths.
<P>
And the word itself was abducted too.  Passed from Robspierre
to Rosa, from Lenin to Stalin to the Khmer Rouge, the word has
stayed blood-red, like the roses, cockades, and little red books
that are its symbols.
<P>
We Americans have never recaptured revolution.  We lay claim only
to a patch of thin turf by the great shore, that strip of change
at the edge of Progress.  We are wary now, even afraid, of change
beyond Progress.  We no longer know what to do with revolution.
<P>
But we cannot escape it.  Big change is here:  brought not by
barbarians at the gate, but by ourselves.  We are the barbarians
of big change.  We are the red-capped <I>sans culottes</I>.
<P>
America is again making revolution, and spreading it across the
world.  This revolution should not be confused with political
plots or electoral sallies against an Old Order.  This revolution
is much bigger than that;  like the industrial revolution, it
promises a transformation of America life.  But as tidally overwhelming
as it feels, it is no less of our own making.  And clearly, there
are those who are making it happen, just as there are those who
would sacrifice everything to hold its onset back just one more
day.  Like any revolution.
<P>
The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation&#146;s monthly lunches offer
us a chance to talk about Big Change as revolution.  They were
inspired by the fermentive talk that came before the first Bastille
Day&#150;those notorious <I>salons</I>&#150;but they are not meant
to imitate the outcome.  The logo roses on our <I>Notes From Salon
&#145;89</I> are meant to remind us of two things.  First that,
though it was stolen way back when, the word is now up for recapture.
 And second, the shock of other times tells us that revolution
is not about freeze frame shots from <I>Dr. Zhivago</I> or <I>A
Tale of Two Cities</I>.  Revolution is not some far away, long
ago story, so removed from us as to be nothing more than material
for a Hollywood meringue.
<P>
Revolution waits in the wings of every age.  It comes rarely,
but it comes for a reason.  Revolution is the moment when change
long pent up at last tears the fabric of life;  when all the elements
that allow us daily to accommodate to change, for a moment, fail.
 Revolution is the brief, free space between two worlds, and our
time in that space allows us to make the journey from old to new.
<P>
And who knows?  Perhaps Progress will prevail somehow, and the
Big Change will be managed and massaged so that, when it is over,
we never knew what happened.  It is possible.
<P>
Every fiber of mind teases and coaxes us down that road.  But
we don&#146;t need to worry about continuity:  we must confront
the equally possible prospect of its <I>absence</I>.
<P>
And to see possibility, we need to recapture the word:  Revolution.
 Part of that comes when we talk about it &#133; which is what
we intend to keep doing at our lunches.
<P>
We hope you will let us know if you are interested in joining
us.

<title>Agriculture Reform; Can House Succeed Where Senate Failed? -- Heritage</title>

<h3>AGRICULTURE REFORM: CAN HOUSE SUCCEED WHERE SENATE FAILED?</h3>

Director, Agricultural Policy Project<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Issue Bulletin No. 221<br>
February 28, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The House of Representatives this week will consider 
H.R. 2854, the Agriculture Market Transition Act, to reform the nation's farm programs. This bill is 
companion legislation to the Senate-passed farm bill, S. 1541, the Agricultural Reform and 
Improvement Act of 1996, which falls far short of significant reform. S. 1541 also includes many 
costly nutrition, rural development, and environmental provisions that were added to get it passed 
in the Senate. Lawmakers in the House now have the opportunity to rectify the deficiencies of the 
Senate bill.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Both S. 1541 and H.R. 2854 replace traditional subsidies 
for the four major crops -- wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice -- with a system of fixed, declining 
payments through the year 2002. They also would eliminate acreage reduction programs. These 
reforms would give producers the needed flexibility to make planting decisions based on the 
demands of consumers rather than on supply controls from Washington, which have idled millions 
of acres of productive U.S. farmland and undermined U.S. agricultural competitiveness in world 
markets.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; However, both bills also retain the marketing loan 
provisions for the four major crops, in addition to soybeans. Marketing loans allow producers to 
repay to the government only what they receive for their crops, even if it is less than the amount of 
the loan, and pocket the difference. Retaining these marketing loans means that cotton and rice 
producers, in particular, would be able to circumvent the payment limitation. Leaving this 
mechanism in place runs the risk that future loan rates might exceed the market-clearing level, 
causing the United States either to lose export markets or to force the taxpayer to finance wasteful 
government-stimulated overproduction.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Furthermore, neither the Senate-passed bill nor the bill 
pending in the House reforms the $1.5 billion-a-year Conservation Reserve Program (CRP); 
instead, both merely cap it at the current 36.4 million acres. Only about 7 million of the acres in the 
CRP are highly erodible, while the majority -- or close to 20 million acres -- constitute some of the 
most productive land in the United States. The remaining acres are quite capable of sustainable 
production if used in conjunction with appropriate conservation practices.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The Senate bill also retains permanent law. This means 
that, if no further legislative action is taken before 2002, farm programs would revert to the 1938 
and 1949 Acts, leading to the return of traditional subsidy and supply control policies. As reported 
out of the House Agriculture Committee, H.R. 2854 repeals permanent law. If the Senate provision 
prevails over the House version, supporters of a centrally planned agriculture in the future could 
point to any slight downturn in commodity prices or land values as justification for returning to 
government controls. The only way to prevent a return to these failed policies is to repeal 
permanent law.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Unfortunately, both S. 1541 and H.R. 2854 reauthorize 
the sugar and peanut programs for seven years, with only inconsequential reforms. Although both 
bills do terminate marketing allotments for sugar and implement a one cent-per-pound penalty on 
forfeited sugar, they also freeze the support price at a level roughly twice the world market price 
rather than legislate any real reduction or phase-down. In the case of peanuts, for instance, both 
bills reduce the quota support rate from $678 a ton to $610 a ton, still well above the world price, 
and fail to reform the restrictive quota program. Moreover, while the Senate bill also fails to reform 
the dairy program, the dairy provisions included in H.R. 2854 actually would expand the extent of 
government regulation and intervention in the U.S. dairy industry.<sup>1</sup>
<p>

<b>Costly Add-ons to the Senate Bill</b> 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Several costly items are attached to the Senate bill. S. 
1541 authorizes an additional $1.4 billion for a new Environmental Quality Incentive Program, 
supposedly intended to make it easier for farmers and ranchers to apply for assistance with 
conservation projects. The Senate bill also reauthorizes the food stamp program for seven years 
without any reform. Although traditionally considered in conjunction with the commodity 
programs, the food stamp program was added to the bill on the Senate floor to gain additional votes 
and without any consideration of how this might affect overall reform of the welfare delivery 
system. Finally, S. 1541 creates a new Fund for Rural America, authorizing $300 million for the 
next three years to be used for housing and infrastructure grants and loans. None of these provisions 
is included in the House bill. As there is no need to move these provisions at this time to meet the 
deadline of the 1996 crop season, they should be dealt with in a separate piece of legislation. 

<p>
<b>The House's Opportunity</b> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The House is expected to consider H.R. 2854, the 
Agriculture Market Transition Act, as early as February 28. If the House Rules Committee 
approves a rule allowing for amendments, there would be an opportunity to provide greater reform 
in the House bill than was achieved in the Senate. If there is such a rule, the House can achieve real 
reform of agricultural policy by taking the following actions:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Conservation Reserve Program.</b> The House should include a provision that would 
give producers the flexibility to remove non-environmentally sensitive land from the program. 
Farmers holding CRP contracts on such land should be given the option to withdraw from the 
program. The millions of sustainable acres in the program should be eligible for planting now, 
when demand for U.S. grain and oilseeds is at record levels. The government should not stand in 
the way of this opportunity to produce for strong prices and growing markets.
<p>
<li><b>Sugar and Peanut Programs.</b> Real reform of these programs can be accomplished by 
providing market-driven transitional phase-downs of support prices and elimination of restrictive 
quotas and allotments. Without such reform, the existing sugar cartel -- a handful of wealthy 
processors -- will continue to determine who has the right to produce sugar in this country, and the 
peanut quota system will continue to restrict production to a limited few, based on inheritance.
<p>
<li><b>Dairy Program.</b> The House should scrap the provisions in H.R. 2854 which expand 
government regulation and intervention in the U.S. dairy industry and replace that section of the bill 
with a program that phases out the subsidy system and eliminates the archaic Milk Marketing Order 
system. To phase out the subsidies without getting rid of the marketing orders means that the 
government continues to manipulate the dairy markets and to determine winners and losers, putting 
dairy farmers in certain regions of the country at an unfair disadvantage.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
<li><b> Marketing Loan Program.</b> The House should eliminate the marketing loans for 
wheat, feed grains, cotton, rice, and oilseeds, thus eliminating the huge payments that circumvent 
the payment limitations and go primarily to the wealthiest farmers. 
</ul><p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; With minor exceptions, the Senate has failed to reform 
agricultural policy in its version of the farm bill. However, the House has an opportunity to make 
significant changes in the bill reported out of the House Agriculture Committee. Lawmakers should 
seize that opportunity to craft a farm bill that lets farmers and consumers in the market, rather than 
bureaucrats in Washington, determine what should be grown and produced in America and where 
that production should take place.

<h3>HOW THE PROPOSED DAIRY "REFORM" WILL IMPOSE HEAVY COSTS ON 
AMERICANS</h3>

By John E. Frydenlund<br>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The <a href="http://www.house.gov">House of 
Representatives</a> is scheduled this week to consider <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov">H.R. 
2854</a>, the Agricultural Market Transition Act, as part of the reauthorization of the nation's farm 
programs. In several respects, the legislation is similar to the "Freedom to Farm" provisions 
included in the Balanced Budget Act, in that H.R. 2854 would lead to significant and valuable 
reforms of some farm programs, particularly those covering wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Unfortunately, H.R. 2854 does not include necessary 
reforms of the indefensible sugar, peanut, or conservation reserve programs. Worse still, the dairy 
provisions of H.R. 2854, as reported out of the House Agriculture Committee, not only fail to 
provide any reform of the dairy program, but instead would greatly expand the extent of 
government regulation and intervention in the U.S. dairy industry. This approach is wholly 
inconsistent with the fundamental premise of H.R. 2854, which is to provide for a transition away 
from government control over agriculture. It also departs from the approach of the Freedom to 
Farm legislation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Specifically, the dairy provisions do not move toward a 
market-oriented economy in any manner. Nor is there even an attempt to provide changes equitable 
with what is being done for some other agricultural commodities. Instead, H.R. 2854 artificially 
raises prices for producers through unprecedented mandates, unwarranted manipulation of the 
market, and increased government regulation that benefits a few narrow interests at the expense of 
processors, consumers, and taxpayers. To read the press releases coming out of the House 
Agriculture Committee, one would think that real reform of the dairy program would be achieved 
by this legislation. But the true nature and costs of these anti-competitive proposals are not 
disclosed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; By law, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is 
required to estimate the direct costs of the dairy provisions on processors and manufacturers of 
dairy products. The CBO estimates that the extra cost of $800 million to $1.1 billion annually 
imposed on processors and manufacturers will be passed on to consumers. This estimate is derived 
from the bill's requirement that milk sold for fluid uses contain greater amounts of nonfat solids 
than currently required, and from a provision that would lock in higher fluid milk prices under the 
archaic Milk Marketing Order System.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; As far as the CBO estimates go, they probably are 
accurate. However, because these estimates analyze only direct costs, and fail to take into account 
the cumulative effects of all the dairy provisions, they seriously understate the additional indirect 
costs that would be imposed on the dairy processing and manufacturing sector of the industry, on 
taxpayers, and on the consumer.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The legislation also includes a price support increase, 
subsidized exports, and other provisions. According to some estimates, these provisions will 
impose additional costs on the processing and manufacturing industry of at least $1.4 billion 
annually, based on current prices. The CBO did not score the direct costs of these provisions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Most important, the CBO's estimates of the direct costs of 
higher mandated prices and increased regulation of the dairy industry do not take into account that a 
national mandate in the legislation would force the addition of nonfat solids to milk, as included in 
this legislation, requiring the use of an additional 400 million pounds of nonfat dry milk each year. 
The last time there was a short supply of nonfat dry milk, similar to what could be expected as a 
result of this requirement, was 1989. That episode suggests that resulting prices would be 
substantially higher than the current price used in the CBO analysis. Ultimately, fluid milk prices to 
consumers are likely to increase by roughly 50 cents per gallon. No one has estimated how such an 
increase would affect retail sales of milk.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The cost of this legislation would fall most heavily on the 
poor. U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) 1994 data indicate that dairy products account for 
over 10 percent of consumer expenditures on food products. For the poorest Americans, that 
percentage would be even higher, which means that the hidden milk tax being proposed by the 
House Agriculture Committee would hit hardest those people least able to afford it.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The CBO thus has failed adequately to estimate the cost 
of this mislabeled dairy "reform" bill on processors, manufacturers, and consumers. The CBO even 
claims that the dairy provisions will save the federal treasury almost half a billion dollars, compared 
with the FY 1996 budget resolution baseline, over the next seven years. This estimate, however, 
does not account for the legislation's increased costs to the federal government's feeding and 
nutrition programs. According to USDA's estimates, the cost of child nutrition and food stamp 
programs alone would rise by $1 billion over the FY 1997-2002 time period. Women, Infants and 
Children (WIC) program costs would increase by more than $130 million over the period if the 
present caseload were maintained.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; When Congress considers H.R. 2854 this week, 
lawmakers need to be aware that the legislation's present dairy provisions will impose additional 
direct costs on dairy processors, manufacturers, and consumers which far exceed the estimates 
made by the CBO. Members of Congress also need to be aware that CBO has not even considered 
the costs of the legislation to USDA's feeding and nutrition programs. This anti-reform measure, 
disguised as reform, actually could impose a hidden milk tax of almost $4 billion annually on 
consumers, passed on in the form of a 50 cent increase in the price of every gallon of milk. On top 
of that, the taxpayers will take an additional hit of close to $500 million. The House Agriculture 
Committee's dairy legislation is costly, but it is not reform.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Flush with a handful of money he had just won at a bowling 
tournament, Joe Koslowski invited some friends to celebrate with him at the nearby Atlantic City casinos. 
Joe, then 16, and all his buddies were allowed in despite the age limit of 21. Once inside, Joe's good 
fortune continued; he parlayed his bowling winnings into a couple of thousand dollars.
<P>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	After his initial success, Joe returned to the casinos frequently. 
His winning streak eventually ended, but his taste for the thrill of gambling did not. Once out of cash, he 
opened credit accounts under family members' names, using cash advances from the credit cards to 
gamble.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The whole scheme finally came crashing in on Joe last year, 
after he had amassed $20,000 in debt. Now at age 20, Joe, who had no prior criminal record, is serving 
time in a Pennsylvania federal prison for credit-card fraud. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Joe is one of tens of thousands of young people who fall 
victim to America's gambling obsession every year. At least three-quarters of the nation's teens engage in 
some form of gambling. Much of it, of course, is fairly innocuous and occurs among peers: weekend poker 
games, betting on football, the annual NCAA basketball tournament pool. Adolescents have become 
increasingly adept, however, at gaining access to state-sanctioned gambling -- lotteries, casinos, electronic 
poker -- which often becomes a bridge to compulsive or addictive behavior. In 1995, University of 
Minnesota researchers reported that more than half of underage Minnesota teens surveyed had participated 
in some form of legalized gambling. An earlier survey of Atlantic City high-school students revealed that 
nearly two-thirds had gambled at the city's casinos. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	It is becoming painfully apparent that the only jackpot 
awaiting many of these young people is a life out of control: More than a million adolescents are already 
addicted to gambling, according to Durand Jacobs, a clinical professor of psychiatry at Loma Linda 
University Medical School and an expert on youth gambling. Further, Jacobs says, the gambling addiction 
rate among teens is three times that among adults.  In a recent review of major youth-gambling studies in 
North America, Howard Shaffer, director of the Center for Addiction Studies at Harvard Medical School, 
concluded that roughly one in six teens experiences gambling-related problems, while about 6 percent are 
actually addicted, or pathological, gamblers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The New Jersey Council on Compulsive Gambling, which 
operates a national toll-free hotline (1-800-GAMBLER), reports that callers under 21 phoned the hotline 
4,300 times in 1994, accounting for 11 percent of total calls. Ed Looney, the council's executive director, 
says many of these young people find themselves in desperate straits. He tells of a call regarding a 16-year-
old who had slit his wrists after losing $6,000 -- four years of newspaper delivery earnings -- on the lottery 
in a single day. He tells of the college student from the Midwest who dropped out of school because he lost 
his tuition money gambling; of the 19-year-old New Jersey youth who sold his car for a fraction of its 
value so he could get back into the casinos; of the numerous calls from kids too scared to go back to school 
because they can't pay back their bookies.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 The phenomenon of youth gambling is not entirely new, but 
its rapid growth and startling magnitude is alarming. Says Valerie Lorenz, head of Baltimore's Center for 
Compulsive Gambling, "We never saw a teenage gambler 10 years ago. Now we see them regularly." 
Moreover, the most addictive forms of gambling -- eagerly promoted by more and more state governments 
in search of tax revenue -- can produce ripple effects in young lives that undermine families, communities, 
and civic order. As we move into the next century, Shaffer says, "We're going to have major issues with 
youth gambling that will equal or eclipse the problems that we have with substance abuse." 
<P>
<b>A Slippery Slope?</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Experts draw a distinction between the "problem" gambler 
and the "pathological" gambler. According to Shaffer, pathological gamblers exhibit three basic 
characteristics: an inability to stop gambling despite massive losses, a sense of lost control, and a 
compulsion or craving to gamble. Problem gamblers can be affected in less severe ways, including 
difficulty concentrating, failure to fulfill family, school, or work obligations, general irritability, and 
sleeplessness. The two, however, are closely connected. Shaffer refers to problem gamblers as being "in 
transition," either moving toward or away from pathological gambling behaviors. Individuals may 
frequently move in and out of these designations. It is estimated that 1 to 3 percent of the adult population 
are pathological gamblers, but nearly twice that number are problem gamblers.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Probably 90 percent of the population can gamble 
"recreationally," but a significant minority cannot. Moreover, all forms of gambling can be addictive for 
teens, as well as adults, though they vary in their potency. The most addictive, such as electronic poker, 
contain the element of rapid "action" and occur in relative isolation, Shaffer says. Video gambling and slot 
machines are inherently more dangerous than bingo or the lottery. But the lottery frequently serves as a 
gateway to other gambling activities for teens. Once exposed to even a relatively benign form of gambling 
such as the lottery, many find themselves craving greater excitement. Studies bear this out: Participation in 
other forms of gambling is higher in those states that have lotteries.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Many problem and pathological gamblers -- adolescents or adults 
-- become debtors. Once they get in over their heads, teen gamblers follow the cue of their elders: They 
turn to crime. Jacobs contends that at least one in 10 juveniles has used illegal means such as stealing, 
shoplifting, selling drugs, or prostitution to obtain money to pay off gambling-related debts. A 1994 study 
of Massachusetts youth found that 5 percent had been arrested for gambling-related problems.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Despite the extent and impact of youth gambling, Jacobs says, 
the level of public awareness is "absolutely abysmal." A few recent high-profile press reports, along with a 
meeting last spring of the North American Think Tank on Youth Gambling Issues at Harvard, have begun 
to bring the issue to the public's attention. Teens themselves remain largely unaware of the dangers 
associated with gambling. Shaffer found that only one-quarter of Massachusetts youth surveyed rated 
gambling as potentially dangerous, compared with 60 percent or more who perceived the dangers in 
alcohol, tobacco, and drugs.
 <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Gambling in all its forms is proving to be nearly irresistible to 
a rising generation that frequently tells pollsters of its apprehensions about a bleak economic outlook. 
Traditional forms of gambling such as church bingo have generally  been able to restrain compulsive 
betting. Government promotion of gambling, including the $350 million states spend advertising the 
lottery, has been more pernicious. It communicates to young people the subtly destructive notion that the 
work ethic is passé, that all they need is "a dollar and a dream," as one lottery advertisement puts it. 
Perhaps that's why an average of 200,000 minors have been turned away from Atlantic City casinos every 
year for the past decade, according to figures from the New Jersey Casino Control Commission. Another 
24,000 underage gamblers are escorted from the casino floor annually. Many more gamble in the casinos 
undetected. Ironically, many state lotteries are pitched to the electorate as a honey pot for public education. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"By sending young people the message that they need to 
gamble to get ahead," Shaffer says, "we're telling them not to study calculus, not to study science, and we 
shouldn't be surprised that America is now falling behind other cultures in terms of intellectual pursuits."
<p>
<b>A National Compulsion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	If young people follow the lead of the adult gambling culture 
around them, they'll squander much more than their intellectual energy. Americans will legally wager 
more money this year than they will spend on groceries -- some $500 billion. That number represents a 
3,000 percent increase since 1976. Utah and Hawaii are the only states that prohibit all forms of gambling, 
though Hawaii is considering casinos. Casinos are now legal in about half the states and constitute nearly 
half of total gambling revenues, which are growing at the rate of 15 percent annually.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"America is on a gambling binge," says Congressman Frank 
Wolf, who is pushing legislation to establish a national commission to study the effects of legalized 
gambling. The growth will undoubtedly continue, at least in the short run, as state and local governments 
scramble for an even bigger slice of the gambling revenue pie. In 1994, governments received $1.4 billion 
from casinos alone. Lotteries contributed another $10 billion to state coffers. That same year, revenue-
hungry state legislatures considered more than 1,600 gambling-related bills.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Unfortunately, government's addiction to gambling has been 
transmitted to the public. Nationwide, it is estimated that about 10 million Americans have a gambling 
habit that is out of control. A recent surge in the number of problem and pathological gamblers is strongly 
correlated with the explosion of legalized gambling opportunities. An unlikely source for a case study is 
Iowa. A 1989 survey indicated that 1.7 percent of Iowa residents were problem or pathological gamblers. 
Shortly thereafter the state added riverboat casinos and casinos on Indian lands and also expanded 
parimutuel wagering. A subsequent survey last year showed the percentage of Iowans with a serious 
gambling problem had ballooned to 5.4 percent. An additional 78,000 Iowa adults had become hooked on 
gambling in that six-year period.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Iowa study is consistent with other findings. John Kindt, a 
professor of commerce and legal policy at the University of Illinois, says that when gambling activities are 
legalized and made accessible to new jurisdictions, increases in the numbers of addicted gamblers range 
between 100 and 550 percent. These newly created addicts are turning in overwhelming numbers for help -
- help that the mental-health community is ill-equipped to supply. According to the National Council on 
Problem Gambling, there are fewer than a hundred treatment programs nationwide for pathological 
gamblers, as compared with some 13,000 such programs for alcoholism and other substance-abuse 
problems. Tens of thousands are seeking help through local Gamblers Anonymous groups; GA has added 
four hundred new chapters in the United States in the last five years. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Testifying before the House Judiciary Committee last 
September, American Gaming Association (AGA) president Frank Fahrenkopf Jr. claimed that the 
gambling industry is making substantial efforts to address the problem. So far, however, little has been 
done. "The casino industry is heavily dependent on the revenues of psychologically sick people," says 
Earl Grinols, an economist at the University of Illinois, who calculates that more than half of a casino's 
take comes from problem and pathological gamblers. University of Minnesota researchers found that a 
mere 2 percent of gamblers in that state accounted for nearly two-thirds of all money spent on the state's 
casinos, charitable pulltab games, lottery, and the like.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Experts warn that the number of gambling addicts has yet to 
crest. In fact, Jacobs predicts that it will be the nation's fastest-growing addictive behavior. In addition to 
greater availability of traditional gambling venues, the emergence of hi-tech video gambling machines, 
gambling on the Internet, and interactive telephone and television gambling will undoubtedly contribute to 
the problem. These addictions will come with enormous social and economic price tags, as social scientists 
and researchers -- and millions of families -- have already discovered.
<p>
<b>Gambling with the Family</b> 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In August 1993, Mike and Sharon James (not their real 
names) and their two preschool children left a successful business in East Liverpool, Ohio, for promising 
job prospects in Charleston, S.C. The couple had been in Charleston one month when Sharon received an 
overdrawn notice from the bank. Puzzled, she contacted the bank to clear up the "error"; the couple had 
several thousand dollars in their checking account set aside for a down payment on a house.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Sharon discovered that her husband of 10 years had made 
several withdrawals in recent weeks, many in the neighborhood of $1,000. When she questioned Mike, she 
learned that he had spent the money on South Carolina's ubiquitous video poker machines. Despite 
Sharon's pleas and attempts at treatment, Mike couldn't kick the habit. He squandered the family's 
remaining savings, hocked many of their possessions, even cashed in the children's savings bonds, and left 
the family $20,000 in debt. Finally, Sharon filed for divorce. Mike wound up in the county jail for 
delinquency in child-support payments and for writing bad checks.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"This man was a wonderful person, a very caring father," 
says Sharon. "I really believe he didn't realize what he was doing, because he was never like that before. 
This addiction just grabs you and twists you. It destroyed him and us."
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Similar stories abound in gambling communities across the 
nation. Yet the scope of the problem is tragically underestimated, largely because so little research has been 
undertaken regarding gambling's impact on the family. The meager available data comes primarily from 
surveys of small groups of compulsive gamblers seeking treatment. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Last year the Illinois Council on Compulsive Gambling 
surveyed nearly 200 Gamblers Anonymous members and found that 16 percent were divorced due to their 
gambling addictions; another 10 percent had separated as a result. In an earlier study of spouses of 
compulsive gamblers, Valerie Lorenz discovered that 78 percent had threatened separation or divorce, and 
half had carried through on their threats. Jacobs surveyed 850 high-school students in Southern California 
and found that children of compulsive gamblers were almost twice as likely to experience the trauma of a 
broken home.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In Harrison County, Mississippi, the hub of the state's casino 
industry, the number of divorces rose from 440 in 1992 to nearly 1,100 in 1993, the first full year after 
casinos. Judge William L. Stewart, who has served on chancery court along Mississippi's Gulf Coast for 17 
years, says he knows gambling to be a factor in about a third of the divorce cases he now oversees. "Other 
than the general decline of morality in society, I don't believe there has been a single factor [affecting 
divorce rates] like this. It's just not a normal thing. This thing is huge. It has a tremendous effect on a 
community." 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Spousal and child abuse and neglect are other problems 
attendant to gambling addictions, as reports from social-service agencies in gambling communities 
consistently attest. The Gulf Coast Women's Center in Biloxi, Mississippi, has averaged 400 additional 
crisis calls per month since the advent of casinos there. Central City, Colorado, reported a six-fold rise in 
child protection cases in the year after casinos arrived. Jeffrey Bloomberg, former state's attorney for the 
Deadwood, South Dakota area, cited a similar increase in his September 1994 congressional testimony, and 
described how children were being left in cars all night while their parents gambled. Earl Grinols points out 
that Nevada led the nation in deaths of children attributable to abuse from 1979 to 1988, a period when 
casino gambling was illegal everywhere else except in Atlantic City. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Children of compulsive gamblers also suffer in other ways. 
Jacobs found that such youth have a greater propensity for substance abuse, lower academic achievement, 
juvenile delinquency, and poorer mental health. They are also far more likely to develop gambling 
addictions themselves. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Compulsive gamblers are at much greater risk for other 
harmful behaviors. According to Henry Lesieur, about half of compulsive gamblers experience problems 
with alcohol and substance abuse. Lesieur also notes that compulsive gamblers are five to 10 times more 
likely to attempt suicide than is the general population. The National Council on Problem Gambling states 
that 20 percent of compulsive gamblers attempt suicide. Many succeed. A 19-year-old Iowa college 
student, a St. Louis-area housewife and church volunteer, and an Illinois businessman are a few of the 
recent self-inflicted casualties that have received press attention, but hundreds of others go relatively 
unnoticed year after year. Nevada has the highest suicide rate in the nation. In Gulfport, Mississippi, 
attempted suicides rose more than 200 percent in the first two years of casinos, while suicide attempts 
soared from six to 66 in nearby Biloxi in the first year alone. Family members of compulsive gamblers are 
also at greatly increased risk for suicide, according to Lesieur.
<p>
<b>Showdown in River City</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Over the last decade the gambling industry has done a 
phenomenal job of selling itself as an economic elixir to communities strapped for revenue. Inflated 
promises of jobs, tourism, and additional tax monies have seduced politicians and citizens in dozens of 
states and communities. The numbers, however, are beginning to catch up with the gambling forces. As 
Americans become more aware of the societal devastation wrought by legalized gambling, the industry is 
finding it increasingly difficult, and ever more expensive, to peddle its wares. In recent elections, gambling 
interests have outspent opponents by margins of 10, 20, even 50 to one, and are still losing far more often 
than not.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Jefferson City, Missouri, which voted for casino riverboats in 
1992, voted them out last November. Fledgling efforts are underway in Louisiana, Wisconsin, and 
elsewhere to repeal legalized gambling. Even the industry's own polls show that gambling's acceptance 
appears to be waning.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The issue, however, is far from decided. Gambling interests 
have targeted several key states again this year -- California, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, New York, Ohio, 
Pennsylvania, and Texas, among others - for expansion. In New York, the gambling lobby last year helped 
introduce a form of keno called "Quick Draw." It puts casino-style gambling right in front of teens, 
appearing in bowling alleys, supermarkets, and even candy shops to lure kids into shooting high-tech craps. 
If these and other efforts are successful, it will be a sure bet that millions more Americans -- many of them 
children -- will slip into addiction, and the destitution and darkness that go with it.

<p>
<b>Crimeland </b>
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The gambling industry has launched a major offensive to try to 
convince Americans that they don't know what they know: Gambling breeds crime. The industry has hired 
a handful of law-enforcement officials and academics to assert that gambling is no more conducive to 
crime than Disney World. It's a Mickey Mouse argument.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Data from gambling communities points to an overwhelming 
link between legalized gambling and criminal activity. Three years after the arrival of casinos, Atlantic 
City rose from fiftieth to first in the nation among cities in per capita crime. Nevada continually ranks near 
the top in crime per capita.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The experiences of newer gambling communities mirror those 
of Nevada and Atlantic City.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Within five years of permitting limited stakes casinos in 
Deadwood, South Dakota, serious crimes jumped 93 percent. Mississippi's Gulf Coast welcomed casinos 
in August of 1992. After a year, bank robberies had increased from one to 13, and armed robberies tripled. 
In Ledyard, Connecticut, home of the nation's richest casino, rape, robbery, car theft, and larceny all 
increased more than 400 percent in the first three years after Foxwoods opened.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"The fact is in every city that casinos have been introduced in 
any significant way, crime in the streets has gone up, and there has been a marked rise," says 
Massachusetts attorney general Scott Harshbarger. Frank J. Kelley, Michigan's attorney general for more 
than 30 years, told the International Conference on Gambling in 1994 that "there has never been an issue 
that has disturbed me any more than the proliferation of gambling in our state."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Last October, Maryland Attorney General J. Joseph Curran 
Jr., issued a notable report on the gambling-crime link. Curran concluded: "[C]asinos would bring a 
substantial increase in crime to our State. There would be more violent crime, more crimes against 
property, more insurance fraud, more white collar crime, more juvenile crime, more drug and alcohol-
related crime, more domestic violence and child abuse, and more organized crime."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The gambling industry insists that the crime link is solely a 
factor of more people visiting these communities. The testimony of the law-enforcement community, 
gambling's demonstrated ties to organized crime, and the millions of gambling addicts who become 
criminals as a result of their addictions attest otherwise. One might say the gambling industry's denial of 
these facts is just plain Goofy.
<p>

<b>Cashiering Casinos</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Despite shoestring budgets, grass-roots groups in dozens of states 
are doing a surprisingly effective job of stalling the gambling juggernaut:
 <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Mirage Casinos finally cut its losses at more than $10 million 
and left Bridgeport, Connecticut, late last year after failing in its four-year push to construct the nation's 
largest casino. With support from the media and the governor, and a non-stop public-relations barrage, the 
casino deal looked like a sure thing. But the dogged persistence of various anti-gambling groups prevailed.
 <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Pennsylvanians Against Gambling Expansion (PAGE) has 
employed a two-pronged strategy to thwart riverboat casinos. PAGE gathered about 44,000 petition 
signatures, which it presented to the governor at a widely publicized press conference. PAGE has been 
working behind the scenes with key legislators, from both the Democratic and Republican parties, to keep 
gambling bills from reaching a vote.
 <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Eleven different casino companies hired lobbyists last year in 
hopes of squeezing casinos into Maryland. They had planned to close the deal by this spring. Maryland's 
No Casino group derailed the plan largely via a series of anti-casino rallies held around the state last fall. 
Gambling lobbyists have now forsaken their attempts to get casinos in Maryland.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Last November, voters in Washington state trounced Initiative 
651, which would have allowed unrestricted gambling on Indian lands.
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Fifty gambling lobbyists descended on Virginia last year to 
push for riverboat casinos. Virginians Deserve Better blunted their efforts by joining with dozens of 
minority pastors in targeted areas of southern Virginia.
 <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Florida's No Casinos is preparing to repel the gambling 
industry's fourth casino initiative, expected this fall. No Casinos has built a broad coalition including 
liberal and conservative religious groups, law-enforcement officials, business and political leaders, and 
tourism interests.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Rev. Tom Grey, coordinator for the National Coalition 
Against Legalized Gambling, says state-based affiliates prevailed -- via referendum, the legislature, or the 
courts -- in 21 of 23 contests over the last couple of years.

Curdling the cream in the Clinton coffee
</FONT></center>
<br><dd>
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. The front page of The Washington Times on the morning after New Hampshire was a caution correctly read in the White House, where, despite the hired bravado of the president's regiments of lawyers, the fog shrouding Bill Clinton's view of November grows thicker, the knot of fear in Miss Hillary's tummy expands to the size of an artichoke-y.
<br><dd>
<I>Buchanan wins New Hampshire vote/Stuns Dole;/Alexander a strong third</I>. This was the stuff of good cheer all around: dissension in the enemy's camp, a cracking coalition, rage in the ranks, mutiny at the officers' club. You couldn't blame the president and Miss Hillary for the smiles that sweetened their morning coffee.

<br><dd>
But here's the smaller headline that curdled the cream in that coffee: <I>Arkansas bankers indicted for loans/Fraud suspected in Clinton races</I>. The front page of The Washington Post, for once, offered scant solace: <I>Arkansas bankers indicted in scheme/to help fund 1990 Clinton campaign</I>.

<br><dd>
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

<br><dd>
The amnesia epidemic that has swept through the White House -- there's been nothing like it since the AIDS epidemic swept through San Francisco like Epsom salts -- continued Feb. 22 as Harold Ickes, with the rattled mien of a flustered Ichabod Crane, couldn't remember much about anything, beginning with why the White House only last week found another hundred pages of Whitewater documents it had said were lost. "Inadvertent," Mr. Ickes described it.

<br><dd>
One of the panelists noticed the notation, "DK Draft," and asked whether this meant that Donald Kendall, the president's lawyer for bank-robbery affairs, had written it. Mr. Ickes, in the White House refrain now so familiar to all, replied that he didn't remember. Of course.

<br><dd>
Mr. Ickes demonstrated the testiness and combativeness that White House aides cower before, particularly when he employs testiness and combativeness to protect Miss Hillary. Once he dropped his mask of toughness. Sen. Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina recalled that his father was known in FDR's Cabinet as "Honest Harold," and asked him, in the down-home vernacular: "If God had granted him to be in this room, would he say, 'Boy, you're doing a good job,' or, 'Son, you're with the wrong crowd, get out,'?"

<br><dd>
With an ever so slight crack in his voice, the son replied: "I think he would have approved of what I was doing, because we've done nothing wrong."

<br><dd>
Another panelist wondered about another passage in the notes which the White House has only now deigned to turn over to the Senate Whitewater committee: An investigation, said one notetaker, "may result in focus on friends and associates of the president, begin to 'squeeze' them, and some may be subject to indictment."

<br><dd>
Mr. Ickes, a labor lawyer in New York before he came down to help Hillary dismantle American medicine, insisted that not only did he not know who wrote the memo, he didn't even know what the term "squeezed" meant. How would a New York labor lawyer have ever heard about putting the "squeeze" on a witness?
<br><dd>
During a break in the testimony, Mr. Ickes' own pleader, the ubiquitous and expensive Uncle Bob Bennett, who is also the president's lawyer for bimbo eruptions, couldn't imagine why anyone would think his client had done anything wrong.
<br><dd>
&quot;I don't know what's wrong with that,&quot; he said of Mr. Ickes' answer. &quot;This is a big piece of cotton candy. You bite into it and there is nothing there.&quot;
<br><dd>
Expensive pleader or not, Mr. Bennett sounds as if he's having difficulty persuading himself. And over at the White House, the president's press agent, Mike McCurry, took pains to underscore the need for presidential aides to make sure they turn over all Whitewater documents. Leon Panetta, the White House chief of staff, &quot;doesn't want documents dribbling out. He wants everyone to turn everything upside down and produce whatever needs to be produced.&quot;
<br><dd>
Sure he does. But what he really doesn't want is anything to enhance the perception, now deeply ingrained in the Washington consciousness, that what the Clintons are producing is not documents but alibis, excuses, and yarns.
<br><dd>
This week the Senate must decide whether to extend the Whitewater committee's life and writ. Even Chris Dodd, the panelist from Connecticut and the general chairman of the Democratic National Committee (talk about your conflicts of interest) says he's &quot;troubled&quot; by the White House delays but naturally he sees &quot;nothing of substance&quot; to justify an extension. Says he, invoking an odd analogy: &quot;This has gone on longer than the O.J. Simpson trial.&quot; But everyone knows that if Bob Dole can't manage to win this one, he's outta here.
<br><dd>

<a name="mender"><h2>Marriage Menders</h2></a><br>
<b>by Elizabeth Schoenfeld</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	A report last year by the Council on Families in 
America characterized America's culture of divorce this way: "Relationships between men and 
women are not getting better; by many measures, they are getting worse. They are becoming 
more difficult, fragile, and unhappy. . . . The promises of the divorce revolution proved empty, 
its consequences devastating for both adults and children." Researchers predict that roughly half 
of existing marriages will break up, and nearly three out of five new unions will end in divorce or 
permanent separation. For many couples, such odds can make their sacred vows seem more like a 
crapshoot.
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Along with the problem of illegitimacy, failed and 
failing marriages are at the root of the nation's worst social ills. But what can we do about it? 
Public policymakers need to reconsider the legal regime governing marriage and divorce, from 
reform of no-fault divorce laws to longer waiting periods for divorcing parents. In the next issue 
of <i>Policy Review</i>, we'll examine which states have the lowest divorce rates, where 
legislatures are trying to make divorce more difficult, and other efforts to reverse the 
proliferation of divorces. 
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Public policy, however, is only one part of any 
solution. Over the past 20 years, research has revealed or confirmed the elements of successful 
marriages. Many programs, support groups, and therapy techniques are now available to 
strengthen even the most troubled relationships. The religiously based Marriage Encounter and 
Family Life weekend retreats, for example, have renewed the faith and commitment of thousands 
of couples. In the pages that follow, we profile a few of the ideas for forming more perfect 
unions, in the hope that they take root in families, communities, and religious congregations 
around the country.
<p>
<a name="div">
<b>Divorce Buster</b></a>
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In the 1960s, as divorce rates began to climb, many 
family counselors began to see divorce itself as a therapeutic option of first resort. Therapist 
Michele Weiner-Davis recalls a fellow counselor who claimed that 90 percent of the marriages in 
his practice were dead on arrival. Weiner-Davis herself used to believe that many marital 
problems were insurmountable.
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	No longer. "The vast majority of relationship 
problems are solvable and the vast majority of marriages are worth the effort required to make 
them work," she writes. "Now I do whatever I can to help people find solutions to their marital 
problems so that they can stay together."
<p> 
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Why the change? Weiner-Davis says she's seen up 
close the suffering and disillusionment that can come with divorce. And blaming one spouse as 
the source of the problems, she says, is a mistake, because "it doesn't take into account the roles 
both partners play in the deterioration of the relationship." Bad habits and behaviors developed 
over years go with them when they end the marriage.
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"I don't believe in 'saving marriages,'" she says. "I 
believe in divorcing the old marriage and beginning a new one -- with the same partner." With 
that creed in hand, Weiner-Davis pioneered the use of Solution-Oriented Brief Therapy (SBT) in 
marriage counseling. Unlike traditional therapy methods, which tend to focus on problems and 
on the past, SBT emphasizes solutions. For example, rather than encouraging couples to talk 
about childhood disappointments and how they may be affecting their relationship, SBT asks 
them to define what they want to accomplish in their reconciliation, and then to devise a strategy 
for meeting these goals.
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In her own practice, Weiner-Davis has found that 
SBT can salvage at least four out of five seriously troubled marriages. She says that couples can 
begin to turn their relationships around within a month, even if only one spouse wants to save the 
marriage. She promotes SBT in her recent bestseller, <i>Divorce Busting: A Step-By-Step 
Approach to Making Your Marriage Loving Again</i> (Fireside).

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i>	For information about SBT therapists, send a self-
addressed stamped envelope to Michele Weiner-Davis, P.O. Box 197, Woodstock, Ill. 60098. 
Tel.: 815-337-8000. Also available is a home-study course with six audio cassettes and a 
workbook called Keeping Love Alive.</i>
<p>
<a name="lang">
<b>The Language of Diplomacy </b></a>
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	One of the most common reasons marriages break 
up is that husbands and wives don't know how to communicate or handle conflicts. The problem 
may be not what you fight about, but how you fight. The good news is that just about anyone -- 
even the most emotionally inept -- can learn skills in communication and conflict resolution. 
There are numerous seminars to prevent divorces and enhance marriages. Here are three that are 
especially well researched and effective. In each of them, participants follow the curriculum in 
small groups and then huddle with instructors for individual coaching.
<P>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>PREP.</b> "We have a Geneva Convention for 
the way we conduct warfare," says Howard Markman, the director of the Center for Marital and 
Family Studies and developer of the Prevention and Relationship Enhancement Program (PREP). 
"What we need is a sort of Geneva Convention for handling marital conflict." PREP supplies just 
that by imparting rules that couples can use to negotiate the minefields of marriage, including 
calling "timeouts" when a conflict gets out of hand and taking turns listening to each other. The 
"how-to"s of conflict resolution are taught in a five-session workshop that offers plenty of 
practice and coaching. PREP recently won a four-year grant from the National Institute for 
Mental Health to train clergy in administering the program. The PREP approach can be 
previewed in a book called <i>Fighting for Your Marriage: Positive Steps for Preventing 
Divorce and Preserving a Lasting Love</i>, by Howard Markman, Scott Stanley, and Susan L. 
Blumberg (Jossey-Bass).
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i>	For information about counselors trained in the 
PREP approach, send a self-addressed stamped envelope to PREP, Inc./Referrals, 1780 S. 
Bellaire Street, Suite 621, Denver, Colo. 80222. Tel.: 303-750-8798.</I>
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>	Couple Communication.</b> More than 
500,000 couples have been helped by this program, which provides practical skills in four to six 
sessions. The program uses tools such as the "Listening Cycle," which helps spouses ascertain, 
for example, whether they are really listening to each other or just waiting for their turn to talk. 
Developed by Sherod Miller, Phyllis Miller, Daniel Wackman, and Elam Nunnally at the 
University of Minnesota, the curriculum is praised by therapists for being easy to use.

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i>	For more information, call 1-800-328-5099, or 
write to Interpersonal Communication Programs, Inc., 7201 S. Broadway, #11, Littleton, Colo. 
80122</I>.
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>	Relationship Enhancement Therapy.</b> 
Pioneered by Bernard and Louise Guerney, this approach stands out for long-term effectiveness 
when measured against marriage-enrichment programs, including Marriage Encounter. In part, 
its success can be attributed to the greater length of its program (nine to 10 weeks of two-hour 
sessions), but it also provides a unique emphasis on the teaching of empathy.
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i>	There are a few RE centers around the country, but 
Bernard Guerney, its originator, can be reached in Bethesda, Md., at 301-986-1479.
</i>
<p>
<a name="better">
<b>Better Wed Than Dead</b></a>
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Couples may want to think twice before saying "I 
don't." Recent research indicates that getting a divorce could kill you. For men, "being divorced 
and a nonsmoker is only slightly less dangerous than smoking a pack or more a day and staying 
married," says David B. Larson, the president of the National Institute for Healthcare Research, a 
think tank located in Rockville, Maryland.
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Divorced men are twice as likely as married men to 
die prematurely from cardiovascular disease, four times more likely to die from suicide, and 
seven times more likely to die from pneumonia. Divorced women, on the other hand, have lower 
fatality rates than their married counterparts, but are more likely to suffer acute or chronic 
disease. And both sexes face a greater likelihood of accidental death for six months before and 
after divorce.
<P>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Separating spouses aren't the only ones to suffer the 
medical effects of a divorce. Children of divorce are 50 percent more likely to develop asthma, 
and 20 to 30 percent more likely to suffer an injury. And the deleterious effects last long beyond 
childhood. One long-term study at the University of California at Riverside found that people 
whose parents divorced before they were 21 faced a one-third greater risk of dying in any given 
year. Men whose parents had divorced had a median life span of 70 years, while those whose 
parents stayed married lived 10 years longer; for women, the figures were 82 versus 86 years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	If you value your health, get regular exercise, eat 
plenty of fruits and vegetables -- and stay married. Of course, tense marriages carry their own 
health risks: A study by researchers at Ohio State University has found that couples who engage 
in fierce fighting suffer impaired immune systems.
<p>
<a name="count">
<b>Counting the Costs </b></a>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Anyone interested in family issues but intimidated 
by the dense prose of academic journals will appreciate a recent book from the National Institute 
for Healthcare Research. Need to know how divorce contributes to health-care costs or the 
relationship between marital disruption and juvenile delinquency? It can all be found in <i>The 
Costly Consequences of Divorce: Assessing the Clinical, Economic, and Public Health Impact of 
Marital Disruption in the United States</i>, by David B. Larson, James P. Swyers, and Susan S. 
Larson. This 282-page manual is a mother lode of up-to-date research on everything from 
changes in attitudes about marriage and divorce to the morbidity consequences of divorce to the 
ingredients for marital satisfaction.
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Some of the reasons examined for marital instability 
may not surprise: premarital pregnancy, short courtships, exposure to divorce as a child. "Those 
who marry before age 20," the book notes, "are twice as likely to divorce as those who wait until 
their twenties." But contrary to conventional wisdom, there is growing evidence that those who 
live together before marriage will experience poorer quality marriages and higher divorce rates 
than those who do not.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The book also gathers the latest data on the effect of 
religious commitment on marriage. One study found that marital dissolution among white men is 
three times more common for those who never attend church than those who attend at least twice 
a month. Protestants and Catholics as a group have higher divorce rates than Jews, but within 
each faith, the decisive issue is the degree of religious commitment. Part of the reason, 
researchers suggest, is that "those who actively participate in their church have a wide network of 
friends and associates to turn to for help in times of distress."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Although packed with social-science data, this book 
is surprisingly friendly to the lay reader -- call it Cliff Notes for policy analysts. And it's a 
bargain at $40.

<b>A Modesto Proposal</b></a>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;We can save 90 percent of all marriages in America," 
boldly asserts Michael J. McManus, an ethics and religion columnist. Considering that the 
United States is the divorce capital of the world, that sounds like a pipe dream. But McManus, a 
sort of avuncular modern-day prophet, has seen what works -- and what doesn't -- in the 
marriage-making business. Calling churches little more than "blessing machines," he takes them 
to task for what he sees as an abject failure to support and nurture marriages (see his article "Veil 
of Tears," <i>Policy Review</i>, Winter 1994).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	To counter this trend, McManus has drafted a 
practical blueprint for organizing congregations to adopt a united Community Marriage Policy, a 
sort of civil compact that requires prospective newlyweds to meet minimum standards of 
preparation and marriage enrichment. The bottom line: Participating churches pledge not to 
marry couples who refuse to enroll in the premarital program. McManus reasons that, since 
almost three-quarters of first marriages take place in a religious setting, church is a strategic 
place to begin rolling back divorce rates.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	McManus also encourages congregations to locate 
"mentoring couples" to help the engaged and newly married in their midst -- giving them advice 
on making their marriages and families work. "There are some 350,000 churches in America," he 
says, "and every one of the them has couples with solid marriages who've never been asked, 
trained, equipped, or inspired to do this job." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This church-based strategy is taking root -- and 
seems to be bearing fruit. In 1986, Modesto, California, became the first city to institute a 
Community Marriage Policy. Since then, about 40 towns from Fairbanks, Alaska, to 
Montgomery, Alabama, have enacted such policies. After Modesto established its Community 
Marriage Policy, divorce rates dropped by 15 percent, and Peoria, Illinois, has experienced a 20 
percent decline in its divorce rate since the churches in town signed a marriage policy in 1991.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For a fuller explication of the Community Marriage 
Policy idea, read McManus's book, <i>Marriage Savers: Helping Your Friends and Family 
Avoid Divorce</i> (Zondervan). Marriage Savers not only spells out ideas for organizing 
churches, but also is one of the best all-around resources for anyone who wants to throw a 
lifeline to a friend, a family member, anyone who seems to be drowning in America's culture of 
divorce.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Though moralistic in tone and filled with biblical 
references, the book brims with optimism. McManus also offers a set of six videotapes based on 
the book and a study guide aimed at church groups for a total price of $199.
<p>

Community Marriage Policy, contact Michael J. McManus, president, Marriage Savers Institute,

<b>Showcasing Success </b></a>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Between 800 to 1,200 people in the marriage-saving 
business -- mentor couples, religious leaders, and marital therapists -- will trek to Fort Worth, 
Texas, for the Second International Marriage Enrichment Conference, May 23 through May 25. 
Designed to showcase some of the leading marriage-building techniques, the conference will 
include workshops on communication skills and marriage preparation, as well as more than 40 
seminars on topics ranging from the special needs of parents of preschoolers to maintaining 
sexual intimacy after recovery from a heart attack. The event is cosponsored by the Association 
for Couples in Marriage Enrichment (A.C.M.E.) and several other marriage groups.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Woods also serve as copresidents of A.C.M.E., 
a nonprofit, nonsectarian membership organization based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. 
This group was founded in 1973 by David and Vera Mace, a husband-and-wife team of marital 
therapists. The organization also acts as an informal clearinghouse for those interested in 
marriage-renewal efforts nationwide, and promotes marital support groups in local communities. 
Consisting of more than 1,100 couples, the organization puts out a bimonthly newsletter and 
coordinates weekend retreats, skills-learning classes, and seminars.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<Font size="+2">A</font>merica is entering a great age of social 
entrepreneurship, rivaling the private organizational creativity of 100 years ago. The mid-to-late 19th and 
early 20th centuries saw the creation of the Red Cross, the Scouts movement, the Carnegie libraries, the 
NAACP, thousands of colleges and universities, and countless other private organizations. As Americans 
turn away from reliance on Washington, they are once again applying Yankee ingenuity by building 
private institutions to address our great cultural crises. Already we are seeing new experiments such as 
privately funded voucher programs that enable poor schoolchildren to escape inadequate public schools, 
organizations that seek to rehabilitate prisoners through religious conversion, and groups such as Promise 
Keepers that aim to instill responsibility among fathers and husbands.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Here are some practical ideas for improving life from some of 
America's most visionary thinkers. We asked each contributor to describe an institution he or she hopes 
will be created or expanded over the next 20 years.

<b><i>Police Training for Youth</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I always knew what I wanted to do when I grew up: I always 
wanted to be a cop. Growing up in Boston, I admired the police and the responsibility they took for others. 
From my earliest years, when police officers helped me across the street on my way to school, they were 
strong role models. It was a natural thing for me to emulate them.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For a lot of kids today, it's not so simple. Many kids are 
alienated from the police, and their peers reinforce the alienation. Instead of seeing cops as assisting 
people, they see them as authority figures to be defied. Before many young people mature and finally 
realize that they'd like to have police careers, they already have police records. It's a tragic waste of kids 
who could have made good, even great, police officers. It's also a big problem for society because -- as 
demographers warn -- the late 1990s will bring an increase in the youth population and a likely rise in the 
crime rate.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For all these reasons, I have a dream of developing a youth 
police career path to provide the children of New York City with police role models in their developmental 
years. By exposing kids to positive interactions with police, the career path would help keep them focused 
and directed in their teen years and simultaneously ensure the police department of a stronger field of 
candidates from which to choose.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Although we would continue to reach into elementary schools 
with antidrug programs, the official police youth career path would begin with kids in their early teens, 
who could attend a youth academy for six weeks in the summer beginning at age 12. The academy would 
familiarize them with the police department and heighten their interest in police careers while giving them 
a strong dose of antidrug and antigang education. The NYPD ran a successful pilot youth academy in 
Brooklyn last summer with 150 attendees, and we've raised the funds, from private and government 
sources, to enroll a thousand attendees from all over the city this summer.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
After the youth academy, we would recruit kids into the next step in a youth career path -- the Law 
Enforcement Explorers, a division of the Boy Scouts of America, open to young men and women ages 14 
to 21. Now established in 66 of the New York City police department's 97 precincts, transit districts, and 
housing service areas, the NYPD Explorers serve about 2,000 young people with a program of character 
building, citizenship training, and physical fitness. 

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While participating in the Explorers, young people could also 
attend a specialty high school for students interested in policing, fire fighting, and other public-safety 
careers. A public-safety high school, now in the early planning stages, would show young people how their 
academic work builds toward their desired careers and use examples from police and other public-safety 
agencies as teaching tools. It would also surround them with like-minded students with similar goals, 
exerting a very different and more beneficial kind of peer pressure.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The NYPD is raising the qualifications for police officers this 
year, requiring candidates to have 60 college credits and to have reached the age of 22. In a continuation of 
the youth career path, students attending colleges in the City University system could serve as police 
cadets, a police internship offering college credits for working in unpaid, part-time positions with the 
NYPD. The department would also assist cadets in finding part-time paying jobs in the private security 
industry or in the New York City school security system, both of which have had difficulty in recruiting 
quality personnel. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In either capacity, cadets could practice the skills of projecting 
authority, mediating conflicts, and defusing potentially violent situations. Another advantage of using them 
in the school security system -- which Mayor Giuliani is planning to place under the direction of the NYPD 
in the near future -- is that these young security guards would serve as role models to the next generation of 
young people. Unlike the cadet program we have now -- which provides stipends to 320 cadets a year out 
of city and federal funds -- this program would earn its own way. By the time the cadets were ready to 
enter the police department, they'd have a significant work history, college background, and police 
training. They would probably require less training at our police academy, and would certainly be better 
prepared for the discipline and lifestyle of police work. Our academy would thus build a police force from 
a better base of candidates.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Peer pressure leads many young people astray. In some of the 
more impoverished neighborhoods, just hanging out on the street corner can be a career path straight to 
crime. Through the police youth career path, we would offer the kids the opportunity to hang out with us. 
If we capture them early, it can make all the difference in the world. The kids get a focus and a goal, 
private security and school security get better employees, and the city gets a much better crop of candidates 
for police officers. The department would have a larger pool of minority candidates and a larger pool of 
candidates who live in the city. The very group -- teenagers and young adults -- that is predicted to cause 
all the law-enforcement problems in the late 1990s can begin to be part of the solution. In my dream, 
everybody wins.

<b><i>A Great-Books Junior College</i></b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	My idea is to create a new one- or two-year junior college for 
bright students (or even not-so-bright students) to earn the education they did not receive in high school 
and won't get in college. Actually I heard this idea first from Hillel Fradkin of the Bradley Foundation. But 
it's a good one, and I think it can work.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I begin with reference to a resource of which I am painfully 
aware: a cohort of unemployed Ph.D.s of (academically) conservative bent who are well educated in the 
works of great authors. To these political philosophers could be added others in history, literature, 
languages, science, and mathematics to teach a curriculum encompassing all that is necessary and 
fundamental and currently neglected or perverted in higher education.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This junior college would draw inspiration partly from disdain 
for political correctness and dislike of the educationists' notion of "self-esteem." But it would also be 
devoted to the love of learning and powered by the enthusiasm of youth. Its graduates could go on to name 
universities with prestigious degrees, football teams, and alumni associations. At these institutions, most of 
them now tired and corrupt, they would be welcomed -- or at least tolerated -- as something fresh, new, and 
strong.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	American education today is perhaps too weak even to resist 
its chosen enemies -- those who believe in quality. A new institution like this would serve a need and make 
a point. All it requires, really, is an entrepreneur.

<b><i>"Pick Up Your Room"</i></b>

<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This one is going to be tricky. I dream of seeing the revival of 
the institution of childhood. That would mean: Children would be taught to clean up their rooms before 
they started on the environment. Their ability to keep domestic peace would be valued over their opinions 
on world peace. A 12-year-old would own a gun only to hunt squirrels. The streets would be safe for 
children to play outside, unwatched, until dusk. They could get into scrapes with other kids without 
activating a battalion of police and social workers. Girls would be left alone to have tea parties if they 
wished, and boys to play with war toys.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In the schools, teachers would be more concerned about a 
child's grades than his self-esteem. Sex would never be considered "safe." Television, even -- or especially 
-- public television, would never be considered educational. Children would address their teachers -- and 
all adults -- as Mr. and Miss, or as "Sir" and "Ma'am," and not, like impertinent phone solicitors, by their 
first names.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Of course, a revival of the institution of childhood implies a 
revival of the institution of parenthood. Mothers and fathers might by tired, nagging, grumpy, and 
uncomprehending -- but they would be present. A baby sitter would once again be called a baby sitter and 
not a "caregiver." During the day, she would sit in furry slippers in the living room, watching soaps. She 
certainly would not be expected to hold degrees in Early Childhood Education, because nobody would 
imagine that a baby sitter could substitute for parental love, attention, and discipline.

<P>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As I said: It's going to be tricky.

<b><i>A Dream That Won't Die</i></b>

<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	My dream is not a new one. It is now 40 years old. It is a 
dream of institutional change that will enable parents to choose the schools their children go to. It is a 
dream of a private educational industry that can  compete on equal terms with our present system of 
elementary and secondary schooling -- a governmental monopoly dominated by the teachers' unions for the 
benefit of its officials and members, not of the students.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Today, a parent who chooses to send his child to a private 
school is required to pay twice for his child's schooling -- once in the form of taxes and once in the form of 
tuition. This imposes a heavy burden on lower income classes and ensures that only the well-do-to are free 
to choose. We can and should remedy that inequity by allowing students who choose to go to private rather 
than public schools to receive scholarships or vouchers equal to a substantial fraction of what the state 
would have been required to spend.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	No institution in our country is as technologically backward as 
schooling. We school children today just as we did 200 years ago: A teacher in a classroom instructing a 
group of students. Some schools have added computers but, in the main, have not made effective use of 
them. If we opened the gate to widespread competition, we would enjoy a dramatic change in technology. I 
cannot predict what that change would be, any more than one could have predicted the consequences of 
breaking up AT&T's monopoly on telephone service, or of inventing an elementary personal computer in a 
garage.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Similarly, a widespread scholarship system of the kind I 
describe would open the door to an influx of innovative enterprises offering different kinds of schooling to 
attract customers. Faced with competition, the public schools would have to improve or close down. No 
doubt some would be unable to stand the heat, but others would rapidly improve. The result would be a 
large, creative, highly developed, private educational industry that offers schooling for every taste, plus a 
vastly improved but somewhat smaller public-school system. A widening gap between the earnings of less 
skilled and more skilled workers threatens our social cohesion; an improvement in the quality of schooling, 
especially for lower-income families and the so-called underclass, would make a major contribution to 
closing that gap.

<b><i>Private Science Funding</i></b>

<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The visionary institution builders of the last century 
bequeathed us not only orphanages and schools but observatories and research universities; not only 
institutions to uplift the unfortunate but also ones to explore the universe. Since the end of World War II, 
however, science has become dependent upon government as a funder and direct employer. The results 
have been mixed: We've enjoyed a tremendous expansion of knowledge and suffered the inevitable 
corruption spawned by the bureaucratic process, which favors the cautious, the well-known, and the 
politically connected.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Fortunately, government is beginning to lose its quasi-
monopoly on scientific funding. Since the explosion of commercial opportunities in the biological sciences, 
Wall Street has become a major source of research money. Meanwhile, the new fortunes of our age, and 
some philanthropic innovators, are creating models for 21st-century scientific philanthropy.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The most striking example may be the privatization of the 
Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) since Congress defunded it in 1993. With money from such 
technology entrepreneurs as David Packard and William Hewlett (founders of Hewlett-Packard), Paul 
Allen (Microsoft), and Gordon Moore (Intel), the reborn Project Phoenix continues to scan the skies with 
radio telescopes, seeking signs of life.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Quite unlike bureaucracies, the rich are quirky. Their tastes in 
science may be eccentric -- witness the experiment in living known as Biosphere II. And as the MacArthur 
Foundation's "genius grants" demonstrate, they may endow trendy leftism along with innovative, cross-
disciplinary science and true iconoclasm. Such is the trade off we tolerate in exchange for dispensing with 
the application forms, the lobbying, the disciplinary boundaries, and the scientific conservatism of 
government grantmaking.

<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Wealthy benefactors often have a personal interest in what 
they fund. Michael Milken suffers from prostrate cancer. His millions have energized the search for a cure, 
thanks to quick-turnaround grant-making -- a total of $25 million -- and another $4 million in philanthropic 
"venture capital" to create a consortium for pooling resources and data. I hope we shall see many more 
such experiments.

<b><i>Metropolitan Home</i></b>

<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Our fragmented metropolitan areas have come to resemble 
battlefields where national corporations, developers, county planning boards, historical societies, 
environmental lobbies, and neighborhood groups slog it out. City planning nowadays means staking out 
one's own turf and keeping interlopers at bay, be they Wal-Mart, the builders of affordable housing, theme 
parks, or simply development in general. Some have proposed federal regulations to mandate regional 
quotas for housing or to force metropolitan cooperation. The last time we attempted top-down city 
planning was in the 1960s. These disastrous, federally funded renewal programs bulldozed neighborhoods 
and erected acres of public housing -- much of which is now dysfunctional. That is not the way.

<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Perhaps the last successful effort to improve American cities 
was the nationwide movement for civic amelioration during the first two decades of this century. The 
movement was spearheaded by business leaders, municipal politicians, social reformers, and architects, and 
found its chief impetus in the American Civic Association, founded in 1903. If only we could find the will 
-- and the spirit -- to develop a civic association for the 1990s.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This is not about "saving the cities." Our old, decaying urban 
areas are just part of the problem. Nor is it about recreating a lost urban past. We must first recognize that 
our new metropolitan way of life will take us in new directions. A revived civic association could provide a 
vision for an urban future that seems to be missing today. It would also encourage dialogue among the 
warring metropolitan factions. I propose a national organization with local chapters, bound by the principle 
that only citizens acting locally have the power to improve their surroundings. Communities -- unlike 
markets -- don't just happen; they have to be earned.

<b><i>A Capitalist Labor Movement</i></b>

<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The most important private institution created by American 
society in the early decades of the 20th century was the American labor movement. The greatest 
institutional need in American society as the 20th century ends is for a new labor movement.

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Though the phrase "cold war" entered the English language after 
World War II, a cold war between democratic capitalism and totalitarian communism had begun decades 
before World War II and lasted for decades after it. Capitalist society won that war for political and 
military as well as economic reasons, but to the extent that victory can be stated in economic terms, it was 
the victory of capitalism's private labor movement over communism's worker state. Communism was never 
militarily defeated, and the hunger in the former communist states for Western-style political democracy is 
moderate. But eventually the most repressive regimes in history were overwhelmed by worker demands for 
the abundance enjoyed by the West.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Today, the condition of Western workers is in steady 
deterioration for reasons that the early labor movement would be incapable of addressing. Capital is 
organized across national boundaries; labor is not. In an unequal contest, labor grows more disorganized 
and weaker in the West, most especially in the United States, with each passing year. Wages stagnate, 
benefits are eliminated, the work week lengthens, safety conditions worsen.

<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Meanwhile, capital scours the world for the cheapest, most 
disorganized, most easily exploited labor -- including child labor, prison labor, and even outright slave 
labor. Unless this deterioration can be arrested, we may see once again the desperate conditions that in the 
late 19th century made the worker state seem a reasonable alternative.

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;What would a new capitalist labor movement -- private, just as the 
first one was private -- look like? I don't know, but thanks to mutual funds and pension plans, stockholders 
and workers are increasingly the same people.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The new stockholders have not found a way to collectivize 
and mobilize their capital on behalf of themselves as, simultaneously, labor. If they could do this, they 
might be seen as creating a new kind of labor movement. The strike would not be the tool of choice for this 
labor movement; but if the movement could impose its will in other ways, the middle class that the first 
labor movement played so large a part in creating might begin to recover from its current, precipitous 
decline.

<b><i>Hand Up for Homeless</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Bill Williams was living in the alleys of Long Beach this time 
last year. He was well educated and had exceptional verbal skills, but used his "smarts" to do little jobs 
until he had enough money to buy his drugs for the day. He would "zone out," promising himself that 
tomorrow he would change. This went on for three years.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Finally, one day he called "Info Line" and was told about 
P.A.T.H. (People Assisting the Homeless) in West Los Angeles. He lied about having been drug free for 30 
days and was admitted to Phase I of P.A.T.H.'s residential program.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Today he is an account executive at a publication called 
Senior Life. He has his own apartment and drives a company car.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Today Bill Williams and hundreds like him are hard-working, 
taxpaying members of society. Why? Because representatives from churches, synagogues, and the business 
community met 10 years ago and decided that they would try to do something to help the growing numbers 
of homeless people gravitating toward the affluent Westside of Los Angeles.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Residents of the P.A.T.H. home-site are required to seek 
employment immediately. They are also obliged to keep the building clean and do their own laundry; in 
return they occupy a room in a newly remodeled building -- a safe and cheerful environment. A tight 
spending constraint limits them to a bus pass and $10 a week for incidental expenses.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Members of the P.A.T.H. community have recently learned to 
write resumés, contact potential employers, and acquire computer skills at P.A.T.H.'s Job Access Center 
located in the same building.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While at P.A.T.H., men and women (and children over four) 
live with others who are also determined to change their lives. Peer pressure and support, a small but caring 
staff, an executive director with a "staff sergeant" approach and confidence that "tough love" works -- all 
these contribute to a rehabilitation/success rate that exceeds 90 percent. P.A.T.H.'s board of directors raises 
half its budget in the private sector, and possesses the courage and vision to make P.A.T.H., as one resident 
called it, the "Rolls Royce of homeless programs."

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The people who started P.A.T.H. had a dream. Prompted by 
the needs of the community, they decided to help people who had a chance to return to the mainstream. 
Other communities could emulate P.A.T.H. There are many other folks like Bill Williams who need a hand 
up, not a handout.

<b><i>Venture Capital for Charter Schools</i></b>

<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Suppose you believe in the continuing importance of public 
education but deplore the heavy hand of centralized school bureaucracy and reject the Progressive-era 
vision of "the one best system." What do you do? One answer is charter schools -- described by education 
historian Diane Ravitch as "semi-autonomous, public entities that are freed from most bureaucratic rule and 
regulations by state and local authorities in return for a commitment to meet explicit performance goals."

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Nineteen states now have laws authorizing charter schools, 
and hundreds have come into existence. Still, it's hard to get them launched; high start-up costs discourage 
all but the hardiest parents, teachers, and nonprofits. Here as elsewhere, lowering the barriers to 
entrepreneurship would pay rich dividends in the future.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I'd like to see private institutions emerge in every city to 
provide seed money, on a competitive basis, to local coalitions willing to plan and execute new kinds of 
public schools. The tax code should permit tax credits, up to a limit of (say) $100, for contributions to these 
institutions. Foundations would be important players. I wouldn't rule out public-sector contributions to 
these institutions -- but only in the form of one-time endowments.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The fledgling Fund for New York City Public Education, 
while not exactly in this mold, illustrates the possibilities. Of an applicant pool of about 175 would-be 
educational innovators, according to the New York Times, "at least 10 will be awarded start-up grants of 
about $125,000 each, paid in installments over three years." Many others will get technical assistance. And 
dozens of new coalitions, catalyzed by the possibility of early assistance, may choose to proceed even 
without it.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While the debate over vouchers rages across the ideological 
battlefront, can't we come together around the modest but important goal of liberating entrepreneurial 
energy within the public-school sector?

<b><i>A College for My Children</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Inevitably, my most cherished dream involves my three children.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I'd like to believe that by the time they're ready for college 
(the oldest is now nine) there might be a college worth attending, without threatening their sanity and 
decency with the current mania for politically correct lies. There's simply not enough time for my kids to 
count on the sweeping changes that are desperately needed in virtually all the institutions of higher 
education in this country. But we do have a chance to capture (or even to create) one elite college or 
university as a haven and an example.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	To accomplish this, traditionalists and conservatives must 
organize and pool their resources. Last year, when Yale University arrogantly returned a $20 million gift to 
Lee Bass because that donation would have required a focus on Western civilization as uniquely worthy of 
attention, I decided that my alma mater could henceforth do without my own modest contributions.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Instead, I would like to combine those resources with funds 
from thousands of other disillusioned university alumni who want to establish an alternative to the trendy, 
libertine, left-wing hegemony of the Ivy League. It's time that loyal graduates of Harvard and Stanford (not 
to mention Vassar and Amherst) woke up to the fact that their admirable and instinctive support for 
institutions that once nurtured them involves not only a tragic waste of money, but the continued 
endorsement of the most destructive forces in American life. Corporations must also recognize that their 
huge contributions to elite educational institutions are funding attitudes and activities that undermine the 
very survival of the free-enterprise system.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Those who dissent from the prevailing statist and relativist 
pieties should assemble their resources and use that power to steer one selected institution in a more 
positive direction. Maybe $20 million wasn't enough to influence Yale, but let's try raising the ante, and 
focus on a somewhat smaller target -- say, for the sake of argument, Dartmouth or Williams (two gorgeous 
campuses!). It should be possible at least to install a new administration at an appropriate campus that 
would mobilize the forces of the market and offer a first-class conservative/moderate alternative to the 
prevailing folly. With 30 or 40 elite institutions hewing to an identical left-wing line, wouldn't one 
university, positioned self-consciously toward the right, enjoy an instant competitive advantage, attracting 
the finest students and faculty? And speaking of faculty, if corporations could be persuaded to endow 
chairs generously, think of the intellectual dream team that might be assembled under one academic roof. 
Perhaps one could lure away the brilliant fellows of <a href="/heritage">Heritage</a> (or AEI or Hoover 
or Cato) for a few years of inspired teaching. How about Bill Bennett as president? For key academic 
positions, you could choose Sowell, Stelzer, Bork, Wilson, Kristol (any Kristol), Himmelfarb, Steele, 
Gilder, Williams, Blankenhorn, Whitehead, Elshtain, Arkes, or any number of other intellectual luminaries. 
It's my dream, but you're more than welcome to play the game of filling in the blanks.
<p>
	The remarkable achievements of little Hillsdale College -- in remotest rural Michigan, with only 
1,200 students and no graduate school -- give some indication of the potential for this scheme. Under the 
inspired leadership of President George Roche, Hillsdale has pursued a courageous conservative path, 
refusing all government aid and exerting surprising national influence. It is also earning a constantly 
improving reputation for academic excellence. If no established "big name" campus can be successfully 
coopted, with priceless assets of atmospheric mystique and proud traditions (which are being trashed every 
day), then the resources accumulated for that purpose might well be pumped into the Michigan institution 
to enable it to step boldly into the academic major leagues.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Looking at higher education today, there's an obvious 
opportunity. It makes no market sense for every elite institution to target students and professors with the 
same liberal values.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	By the same token, it makes no market sense for every TV 
network, or news division, or movie studio, to target precisely the same consumers of popular culture. 
There should be room for more wholesome, more conservative alternatives, and money to by made by 
offering them -- but that's another dream. . . .

<b><i>Public-Private Job Training</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	If, as President Reagan said, "the best social program devised 
is a job," then those without jobs, or without the skills that employers demand, need some help to acquire 
those skills and join productive society. We need programs that work with the private sector to provide 
well-constructed and economical training in job skills. The best example of this that I know of is "Jobs for 
America's Graduates" (JAG).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	JAG grew out of the successful "Jobs for Delaware's 
Graduates" (JDG), a program I created in 1979 while governor of Delaware. JDG, a nonprofit partnership 
charged with preparing, counseling, and placing high-school seniors in career jobs, was so successful that it 
spawned JAG for the purpose of spreading Delaware's success throughout the country.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Having helped 175,000 young people, JAG today is one of the 
largest organizations of its kind, and one of the most successful. Ninety percent of the at-risk young people 
enrolled in JAG graduate from school, and within nine months, the proportion that has found a job, enlisted 
in the military, or enrolled in post-secondary education or training is 80 percent -- 30 percentage points 
above the results for non-JAG youths with similar profiles. JAG achieves these results at a cost of just 
$1,200 per participant, less than one-third the average cost of similar programs around the nation. The 
taxes paid by the participants upon joining the workforce more than pay for the program.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	JAG works because it is overseen by and responsible to the 
private sector, because its leaders are accountable for results, and because the young people themselves 
must meet the employability standards of businesses and take charge of their lives.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Supporting America's youth, reducing the cost of social 
programs, and protecting the future base of our taxpayers are good, sound, conservative principles. As we 
approach the 21st century, "Jobs for America's Graduates" puts these principles to work.

<b><i>Report Cards for Schools</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Colin Powell went to public school in the Bronx. Like so 
many other Americans, he owes his start in life to that great institution, free public education. But today, 
not all schools give kids enough chance to succeed. At some public schools in the Bronx, textbooks are in 
such short supply that children have to share in class, and afterward the books are collected and sent down 
the hall to another waiting class. Are spending cuts to blame for the shortage? No.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	From 1980 to 1993, for example, spending on New York City 
public schools increased 148 percent, even though the number of students increased only 3 percent. Even 
after taking inflation into account, New York City spent 37 percent more per pupil in 1993 than in 1980.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Spending on central administration grew almost five times as 
fast as spending for regular classroom teaching. Too much of our education funds went for bureaucrats, not 
books; administrators, not educators; red tape, not learning aids.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The problem is not merely citywide, it is statewide: From 
1980 to 1993, school enrollment in New York declined by 9 percent, but spending shot up by 142 percent. 
School districts spent more and more and taxed local residents again and again. Yet many teachers have to 
reach into their own pockets to pay for classroom supplies.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The answer is not to spend more, but to spend more wisely. A 
school report card would help parents and taxpayers hold school boards accountable for how our scarce 
education dollars are spent and how well students perform. School boards should be required to publish 
one annually on every school under their purview, with figures on spending per pupil and students' 
performance on standardized tests. Parents and taxpayers have a right to know how their schools stack up 
and whether their education dollars are producing results.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	School report cards should be a new addition to an important 
American institution -- public school. Parents, taxpayers, and teachers need to hold school boards and 
elected officials accountable for spending, so that scarce education dollars are used wisely to give every 
child a chance in life.

<b><i>Faithful Professions</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Writing of Americans in the early 19th century, Tocqueville 
observed not that they were great institution-builders nor that they were great organizers, but that they had 
mastered the "science of association," which he thought necessary to the maintenance of civil society itself. 
He chose the term "association" carefully, for it invokes not just the structure through which individuals act 
together, but also the very act of coming together and, for Tocqueville especially, the community of 
opinion and sentiment that collective action at once depends upon and helps to form.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I note this because for each of my "dreams," the need is 
clearer than the institutional or organizational means of addressing it. First, I think that achieving peace in 
our current culture wars depends on transcending the hostility toward religion that now seems entrenched 
in the secular professions: law, medicine, journalism, teaching. As a first step, perhaps like-minded 
individuals within the ranks of each profession would associate, dedicated to informing their professional 
activities with the witness of their religious faith. Whether or not such association begins among members 
of the same church or denomination -- though the movement might be stronger if it does -- it must become 
ecumenical, or federative, if it is to succeed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	My second hope is that society reestablish respect for the 
vocation of mothers and dissolve the pernicious, ubiquitous social pressure upon mothers to leave their 
children with someone else and go make money. Here the organizational means to the end seem even more 
elusive -- a "Home Makers" on the model of "Promise Keepers" doesn't quite seem fitting -- although the 
freedom of mothers to nourish and nurture requires fathers to resume their duty to provide and protect. 
These tasks involve in no small part recovering the wisdom once embedded in tradition now abandoned, 
and then bringing that wisdom to life in contemporary circumstances. In this, the current wave of 
institution-building differs from the Progressive urge to remake society in the then-clear light of modern 
science, but it also recalls in a way the task that faced Tocqueville's Americans as they marched across an 
untamed continent, bringing civilization as they knew it to a savage land.

<b><i>Motor Trend for Schools</i></b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Twenty years from now, the failures of government-run 
schools will be so obvious that America will have either moved to a voucher system or else be in the 
process of doing so. Yet there are no final victories in politics, so friends of educational choice must work 
over the next 20 years to create a civic infrastructure to nurture this new design for freedom. All Americans 
-- not just parents -- ought to be able to trust that fraud in the educational marketplace will be punished, 
and that educational incompetence will be identified, so that parents can choose to take their children 
elsewhere. Yet because the workings of the invisible hand are so alien to education, voluntary nonprofit 
groups simply must be part of this process.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Inspired perhaps by Margaret Thatcher's prochoice reforms, 
the British government publishes "League Tables," which rate school performance nationwide. Such 
watchdogging can be useful, but the experience of "Goals 2000" in the past six years reminds American 
conservatives that politicians can abuse or even invert any assessment function left in their control.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	So America circa 2016 will need a range of nongovernmental 
entities rating schools' performance by various criteria and publicizing their findings. For years, Americans 
have relied on Consumer Reports to help them evaluate everything from potholders to pickup trucks. And 
Money and Motor Trend, to name just two magazines, have both carved out commercial niches for 
themselves as guides to investments and automobiles, respectively. Yet because education will always be 
more than just a commodity, those who would lead America to a renaissance of citizenship should 
encourage religious, fraternal, and neighborhood groups—whether or not they themselves choose to 
participate in the voucher-driven education market—to issue their own report cards on school performance.

<b><i>Group Homes for Welfare Moms</i></b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The best way to reform welfare, as I suggested in <i>The 
Dream and the Nightmare</i> in 1993 and in a series of articles since, requires the creation of a new 
institution -- a national network of communal hostels, or group homes, for welfare mothers and their 
children. Such hostels would focus on the welfare of children, not the job prospects of young women. The 
hostels would provide structured, caring environments for nurturing citizens with consciences and the 
ability to learn. By the time today's underclass children are in Head Start, let alone school, it's very late to 
begin teaching the cognitive and moral categories that are learned in early childhood, that families 
normally teach, and that underclass children don't adequately acquire. Without mastery of these categories, 
it is hard to think, to apply yourself, and therefore to learn.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The hostels should have rules of conduct for the mothers who 
live there, to help them get control of their lives, but above all to ensure the order and structure children 
need. In the same vein, the hostels should require mothers to take daily workshops in child rearing to learn 
some of the basics that young underclass women often don't know: that babies cry because they have 
needs, not because they are "bad"; that children need to be talked to and responded to, not ignored and not 
hit, if they are to grow up able to function as members of society.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	No doubt such a system will discourage many unmarried 
women unable to support babies from having them -- a worthwhile result. No less important, the smaller 
number of babies born under such circumstances, despite all of society's discouragement, will get a fair 
chance to grow up happy and productive citizens. However sweeping this reform, it must be weighed 
against today's dreadful welfare system, which condemns millions of children to grow up with so much 
human talent unawakened, lost to themselves and to society.

<b><i>A Religious Reawakening</i></b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Most of our nation's great problems stem from a decline in 
morality. A string of unbalanced federal budgets nearly four decades long reflects a moral failure to live 
within our means. A rapidly growing $5-trillion national debt evinces the immorality of one generation 
imposing an unpardonable burden on future generations to pay for what essentially amounts to bread and 
circuses. The pretense of the charity of the welfare state represents our immoral struggle to live at the 
expense of others. Part and parcel of this welfare state is the intergenerational extortion of the young and 
yet-to-be-born by older Americans through Social Security and Medicare. Then there is the politics of 
"entitlement" that has spawned unprecedented dependency.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Governments cannot patch up the public and private 
imprudence that scars the modern American landscape. The ameliorative action government can take is to 
eliminate those programs and laws that have undermined traditional values and morality. Just as language 
evolved intrinsically, without government direction or control, so did moral or ethical standards. Honesty, 
restraint, self-reliance, and social cooperation evolved as standards because they produced greater 
tranquillity and generated more wealth than their counterparts.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Much of our moral code has religious roots. Government 
attack on religion, under the contrivance of adhering to the "Establishment Clause," has played an 
important role in the decline of morality. It is religious teachings that bolster the moral standards against 
lying, treachery, deceit, fornication, adultery, confiscation, and instant gratification. Religion promotes 
loyalty to family, friends, and community. Marxists and those in America who see the state as supreme find 
moral relativism far more friendly to their agenda than the absolutism of religion.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	My dream of an American moral reawakening will reduce 
both the size and scope of problems we now call on government to solve. The problems that remain will be 
dealt with more compassionately through family, social organizations, and community as they were for 
most of our history.

<b><i>Work Requirements for Public Housing</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	My dream is that sometime soon, the billions of dollars 
invested in public-housing bricks and mortar will be transformed into the sites of regenerated central-city 
working neighborhoods. There is reason to believe we have the ability to bring about such a change. Right 
now, although not a desirable place to live for most families, public housing embodies a large public 
subsidy to each family who benefits from it, equal in many instances to the monthly AFDC cash grant 
itself.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But although the cash value of a public-housing subsidy 
makes it a boon of sorts, free or almost free housing fosters an attitude that one's apartment unit, and by 
extension the surrounding project, are not worth the effort of maintaining standards. Destructive behaviors 
by residents and those in the surrounding community reinforce and reflect this attitude.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I envision reforms to require work as a condition of living in 
public housing, either in the private sector or in a community-service job to improve one's housing site or 
perform other neighborhood building activities. In the welfare-reform field, we have discovered the power 
of universal work requirements and expectations. In the current environment, individuals improving their 
lives through work are isolated and demoralized by those in the larger dependent environment around 
them. But public-housing sites have the potential to create a controlled physical space where expectations 
of work are enforced. For the formerly idle, enforced work initially may not be pleasant, but at least 
everybody will find themselves in the same boat.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Beginning in March, residents of Milwaukee's largest public-
housing project will receive welfare payments only in proportion to required work completed; over time, 
this work requirement will be a condition of their lease as well. Fashioning work requirements to improve 
and build urban communities of the future will be our major challenge.

<b><i>New TV Shows</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	First, I propose two television productions. One would be 
called America's Legal Nightmares, and would expose myriad real-life instances of citizens persecuted by 
the state -- by the EPA, for example, or by Child Protection Services. The second, American Stories, is 
Michael Medved's companion idea; this program would celebrate individuals who have transcended 
personal hardships.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Second, before we can launch any systematic efforts to develop 
private charity, we must establish a reliable, independent referee of charities' effectiveness and reliability. 
The few organizations that track private charities lack the resources to follow any but the largest ones. 
When they evaluate a charity's finances, they must rely on its own accounting, for which the rules are 
notoriously lax and potentially misleading. We need to establish explicit financial reporting standards for 
501(c)(3) public charities and fund organizations both to evaluate and rate them by Marvin Olasky's 
criteria of effective compassion, and disseminate these findings, perhaps on the Internet.

<b><i>A Revival Parallel to the Evangelicals</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As <a href="/heritage/kirk/kirklink.html">Russell Kirk</a> 
wrote, culture arises from the cult. Nonreligious people can be good people, as many a Stoic proved. But 
there never were very many Stoics. Human nature being what it is, most people need a religious foundation 
for their morals, if their morals are to be sound. Only the Transcendent has power enough to overcome 
their natural inclination to "do their own thing."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	It follows that if America's culture is to be rescued from the 
sewer into which it has fallen, we need a revival of religion. In theory, a number of religions offer a sound 
moral basis; it should be no surprise that the Confucian cultures of East Asia believe we could learn some 
things from them. But it is difficult to envision Confucianism or another non-Christian religion suddenly 
sweeping America. For reasons of history, if a religious revival is to happen here, it will be Christian. The 
choice is that or nothing.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Such a revival has in fact been under way for some time, 
spearheaded by the Protestant Evangelicals. They have done fruitful work, and the fact that there is any 
resistance at all to the destroyers of our culture is largely their doing. However, much of the citizenry 
remains beyond their reach. For many reasons, these people are uncomfortable with either the Evangelical 
message or the Evangelical style. No one is at fault for this; it is a fact of life that people differ.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I dream of an effort parallel to the Protestant Evangelical 
revival, not in competition with it. Both would be aimed at the unchurched, not each other.
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The new effort would be led by a real new order; a new religious 
order, similar to older orders such as the Benedictines, the Cistercians, and the like. It would be liturgical, 
apostolic, and sacramental, but it would not be part of any of the four churches with those characteristics 
(the Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholics, and orthodox remnants of the Anglicans and Scandinavian 
Lutherans). It would be supported by all of them, it would draw from all of them, and it would be 
recognized as legitimate by all of them. But the key difference is that it would not require anyone to join 
any organization to partake of a liturgical and sacramental religious life led by clergy who were part of the 
apostolic succession. In our sad times, it is probably necessary to say that this new order would adhere 
rigorously to the creeds and the doctrines of the Church as laid down and universally accepted before the 
split of 1054 a.d. And it would preach and practice, within the limits of human frailty, traditional Christian 
morals.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	It would dismiss with complete disinterest all the turf fights, 
jurisdictional squabbles, historic slights, and other ephemera that stand between the liturgical, apostolic, 
and sacramental church and people hungry for that church. It would thus bolster the sound elements, not 
only within our own culture, but in other nations as well.

As our cover design illustrates,
the Republican Party presently has a serious public relations
problem. It is viewed as being too heavily weighted toward balancing
budgets and too light on compassion; in other words, out of balance.
<P>
Regarding the current budget debate,
polls show the largest share of the public--about 44 percent--blames
the Republican-controlled Congress for the paralyzing federal
government shutdown, a third blame President Clinton and about
half as many blame both.
<P>
In many regions once hostile to
Clinton, bumper stickers proclaiming, &quot;Clinton! At Least
He Cares,&quot; have replaced the more familiar, &quot;Impeach
Clinton.&quot;
<P>
&quot;The difficulty the Republican
Party faces,&quot; says Rob Mosbacher, a GOP activist in Texas
and son of the former Secretary of Commerce, &quot;is convincing
the American people that it is equally as enthusiastic about helping
people solve their problems as it is about cutting spending.&quot;
<P>
Author James Pinkerton agrees:
&quot;What the Republicans haven't done,&quot; says Pinkerton,
a former aide to President Bush, &quot;is convince the people
at the bottom half of the economy that there's something there
for them. I think they made a vision mistake by not going after
corporate welfare more energetically.&quot;
<P>
But rather than shore up their
credentials as good fiscal managers, the negotiations and subsequent
shutdown have instead made them look irresponsible and inept.
According to <I>U.S. News &amp; World Report</I>, preliminary
estimates suggest that the three-week episode cost at least $1
billion--on top of the estimated $700 million price tag for the
more extensive shutdown that lasted four working days last November.
<P>
The lack of balance in the GOP
message may explain the recent surge of Malcolm &quot;Steve&quot;
Forbes in Iowa and New Hampshire presidential polls. Although
Forbes has seemingly insurmountable political liabilities--being
the son of a wealthy man, having inherited hundreds of millions
of dollars, and possessing no elective experience--voters long
for a positive, upbeat message, which the millionaire publisher
provides along with his controversial flat tax proposal.
<P>
The remainder of the GOP presidential
field, including front-runner Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas, would
hardly be called an inspirational bunch. With the exceptions of
Lamar Alexander and Sen. Richard Lugar, they seem to be driven
more by the politics of fear, blame and resentment, than by optimism,
idealism or vision.
<P>
But there are some bright spots
on the Republican horizon. There are some GOP pols who understand
that perception is indeed reality. Freshman Rep. Sam Brownback
of Kansas blunted some voter outrage in his district by giving
back his pay during the first shutdown and setting up an escrow
account for it during the second.
<P>
Republican Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana
has authored a 19-part legislative agenda called the Project for
American Renewal, which includes a $500 tax credit for charitable
gifts. &quot;We need to reorient people back to what effective
compassion really means.&quot;
<P>
And Empower America founder Jack
Kemp recently unveiled recommendations for a single, low tax rate
for all Americans. Kemp and 13 others formed the National Commission
on Economic Growth and Tax Reform last year, at the behest of
Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich to unify Republicans on the
question of taxes.
<P>
In his comments at the Jan. 17
press conference where the commission's report was released, Kemp
stressed the importance of relieving the tax burden on the poor
and on working men and women. The former Secretary of Housing
and Urban Development is widely known--and is sometimes criticized--for
his ability to empathize with Americans at all income levels.
<P>
To turn around the public perception
that Republicans are mean-spirited, party leaders need to secure
more media exposure for spokespersons like Brownback, Coats, Kemp
and others who understand that, to become a majority party, they
must get votes not only from avowed conservatives, but from moderates
and independents as well.
<P>
Our three contributors to this
discussion of the GOP are all members of the party themselves.
Lynn Martin is a former congress member and was Secretary of Labor
during the Bush administration. Martin expresses confidence that
the GOP is aware of its errors and is working to correct them.
<P>
Walley Naylor is executive director
of the Mississippi Christian Coalition. In his piece, Naylor writes
that the party once represented a beacon of hope, but today &quot;that
beacon has burned out.&quot;
<P>
Jerry T. Burley ran unsuccessfully
in 1994 as the Republican nominee for Texas' 18th Congressional
District. Burley posits that the public's perception of party
members as a whole takes a toll on the prospects of those who
run for office championing the GOP banner.
<P>
Interestingly, all three link
the Republican Party's image of being insensitive toward the poor
to its failure to attract a significant portion of black votes.

<i>Issue Briefing</i><P>
<h2>School Choice</h2>
<P><i>February 23, 1996</i><P></center><hr>
<P> 
 In 1983, President Reagan's Commission on Excellence in Schools
released its report, <I>A Nation At Risk</I>, warning of major
problems plaguing the public school system.  Today, more than
ten years later, low test scores, consistently high drop-out rates,
drug use, and increasing violence characterize many of our public
schools.  American education is still in crisis, and we need a
change.
<P>
 The current system is harmful to students and undermines parental
authority.  People around the country sense this:  In 1994, twenty-five
states had some form of school choice legislation pending or introduced.
 Denis Doyle, writing in <I>The Wall Street Journal</I> (June
13, 1995) indicates that teachers, both public and private, are
more likely to send their children to private schools than the
general public (17.1 percent vs. 13.1 percent).  And in urban
areas like Boston, Chicago, and Cleveland, the percentage of public
school teachers who send their children to private schools is
much higher.  The widespread support for school choice is part
of the &quot;parents' rights movement,&quot; in this case an attempt
by parents to regain control from an education bureaucracy that
has stripped individual schools of their autonomy and incentives
to meet student needs.
<P>
 School vouchers would provide all parents -- regardless of income
level -- with an equal opportunity to secure a quality education
for their child.  If parents are pleased with the public school
their child attends, as many parents will be, the voucher will
simply stay with that school.  If they are not, parents now have
a choice -- they can send their child elsewhere, to another public
school, or to a private or religious school.  This is the same
concept we use in higher education; students can use government
grants and loans to attend the University of Indiana, or Notre
Dame, or Yeshiva University.  Higher education performs better
because of it.
<P>
 School choice allows all schools -- including private and religious
schools -- to compete for public dollars.  In addition, a voucher
system will save taxpayers money, and would promote a healthy
scholastic rivalry between public and private schools, as well
as among public schools, challenging them to serve parents and
students better.
<P>
 The intellectual debate about school choice is just about over.
 School choice is the most important and far-reaching education
reform in America.  It empowers parents to select schools that
reflect the values and the academic goals that they hold for their
children.

       <hr width=50%></center><p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"I love my nation but I fear my government." So read a bumper sticker I saw in Topeka, Kansas, during my first campaign for political office. I was running for Congress and I had to wonder: Was this not the same government that had mobilized the nation to win World War II, that had defeated communism, that had built the interstate highway system? What had gone so desperately wrong? A few months later, I understood perfectly the meaning of that message. 
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Americans deeply believe in the principles of America, but they don't see them reflected in their government. Americans believe in freedom, democracy, moral values, family, community, and free markets. Yet their government seizes their rights without their consent. Government has become their master, not their servant.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	To address these concerns, I ran a campaign in 1994 based on three words: Reduce, Reform, and Return. Reduce the size and scope of the federal government. Reform the Congress. Return to the basic values that had built the country: work and family and the recognition of a higher moral authority.
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While many were rightfully skeptical back then that what I said would ever happen, none says so now. We are finally seeing some progress toward reversing a trend thought unstoppable: the growth of government, the irresponsibility of Congress, and the loss of the moral character upon which the nation was founded. The current debate over the budget is about more than simply learning to live within our means. It is a turning point in the history of the federal government. The crucial issue is who should be in charge of major programs like welfare and Medicaid -- the bureaucrats and regulators and members of Congress in Washington, or the American people and their elected state and local representatives.
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Our Founding Fathers designed the federal government to be limited. But in the name of compassion, the federal government now tries to do all things for all people. We have discovered, by spending trillions of dollars and taking rights and freedoms away from individuals, that government cannot solve all of our problems. Indeed, exceeding the authority for which the system was designed hurts people.
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I certainly discovered this in the district I  represent.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	LeCompton, Kansas, has a population of 750. At the city hall one day, I met Jeff Goodrick, who showed me a ramp that has provided access to the handicapped for 20 years. Under the new Americans with Disabilities Act, the town was told to replace this ramp for an estimated cost of $15,000, even though the design of the old ramp had never denied anyone access to the tiny city hall. The new one was to be slightly longer, with a slightly more gradual slope. The people of LeCompton don't have the money to pay for this new ramp without sacrificing other services essential to their community. Their freedom had been diminished, and for what?
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In Erie, Kansas, I walked up and down the main street while I was campaigning. I entered a small repair shop and visited with the owner, Rex Bohrer. He had the thick, callused hands of a man who has not lived a life of leisure. I asked him for his vote. Rex stared up at me from behind an air-conditioner he was repairing and said, "You runnin' for the U.S. Congress?" --  to which I answered a timid "yes." He said, "I want to talk to you." He led me to the front of his shop and showed me a government manual containing more than 50 pages of fine print telling him how he must repair refrigerators under new regulations regarding the chemical freon. He asked, "What the heck am I supposed to do with this? I don't understand this manual, and you tell me that if I violate any provision it could cost me $10,000. What am I supposed to do?"
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I didn't know. I certainly do not want to pollute the environment with dangerous chemicals. But here was an honest citizen trying to earn an honest wage who was being directed by an impossibly complex manual and who face fines of up to $10,000 if he violates any of its provisions. Rex's only recourse is to quit the business that he needs for survival. What is he to do?
<P> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In Girard, Kansas, I was speaking to the seniors of Girard High School about the Social Security trust fund. A number of these students had already paid some Social Security taxes. I asked how many of them expected to receive anything from Social Security when they reached the age of 65. Out of nearly 100 students, only four raised their hands. Then I asked how many of them believed in extraterrestrials. About 15 hands went up. This mirrors the responses of young people everywhere. Nationwide, fewer Americans under 25 believe that they will receive anything from Social Security when they retire than believe in UFOs. 
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In Troy, a farming community in northeast Kansas, I held a town meeting about the need to balance the budget and cut the government back for the sake of future generations. Blaine Holder held up his hand and said, "Well, I can tell you how to do away with the entire U.S. Department of Agriculture and the farm programs, but we as farmers have to have some sort of promise that the government won't use food as a political weapon. We need a contract with the State Department that if they ever use food as a diplomatic weapon, they will reimburse us for the reduction in price that we receive because of our government's actions. If the government would enter into a contract of this nature with the American farmer, I think many of them would be willing to do without all of the government interference and price supports." Of course, Blaine thought the possibility of such a contract was hopeless. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In nearly every town hall I visit, I hear complaints about our tax system. The complicated and frequently politically driven statutes that now make up our tax code compromise our economic growth and provoke class envy. No one can understand the 10,000 pages of tax laws; even the tax lawyers complain about its complexity. When America's taxpayers call the IRS for information, they get five different answers from five different agents. Whatever happened to a tax code designed only for raising federal revenue? How did we end up with a system that micromanages our lives and our economy?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Everywhere I go, I hear stories that reveal an overreaching regime distorted by the false notion that centralized authority will lead this nation on the right path. In fact, the American people believe they can handle most of their problems better than the federal government can. They are right.
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	How has a nation conceived in liberty and opposition to tyranny arrived at a point today where citizens are more fearful of their own government threatening their rights than they are of any other government? <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We got off track by forgetting our core principles. But the good news is there is a way out. It's called the Constitution. However much we may have strayed from the precepts of that document, Americans continue to revere it and the principles it enshrines. Ratified by our founding generation and amended by succeeding generations, the Constitution stands equally for self-government and limited government. It is the instrument with which we empowered the federal government in the first place. But it is also the instrument with which we limited that government. If we would only return to those principles of limited government, then our nation, our economy, our liberties, and our social fiber will grow stronger than we have seen for a generation.
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The bureaucratic model of growth and prosperity for a nation has been shown wanting all over the world, from communism in the former U.S.S.R., to socialism throughout Europe, to the welfare state in America. Those running for office in 1996 will find that one of the keys to success and leadership will be a vision of hope, of a brighter future with a smaller government -- one that is at last turning toward its constitutional principles and away from the idea that a centralized, bureaucratic government will solve all of our problems.
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We must create an environment in which Americans look first to themselves and to each other for help, not to their congressmen. We must return to a society where people rely on their communities and do not regard their government as a substitute for civil society. 
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Faith-based institutions can address the needs of the poor more compassionately than federal bureaucrats can. Right now America could profit tremendously from a Fourth Awakening of the moral and spiritual fiber of this country. The government cannot lead that and it certainly should not thwart it. Government should take the Hippocratic Oath to "do no harm" to the values, the faith, and the moral and spiritual roots of the people of this deeply spiritual land. 
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We must restore the master-servant relationship between the people and the government. The people, of course, are the master, and government the servant, but even the best servant can't do everything. We must remind ourselves, as Ronald Reagan once said, that a government big enough to do everything for everybody is big enough to take everything from everyone. 
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Constitution gives the federal government a limited number of important enumerated powers -- for example, to borrow money, to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the states, to establish post offices and post roads, to declare war, to coin money, to lay and collect taxes for all these purposes. Powers not granted and enumerated are retained by the states and the people. Much of the federal government literally has no constitutional basis. And that is where we find ourselves today.
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The underlying principles limiting the federal government are embodied in our founding documents -- the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Civil War Amendments. These documents paint a picture of government, and the role of government in human affairs, that is subtle and profound. As the product of many compromises, the Constitution is not perfect; in fact, one of its compromises took a civil war to resolve. The process of refinement began with the Bill of Rights, which concludes -- in the Ninth and Tenth Amendments -- with a succinct statement of the Constitution's blueprint for a government of enumerated powers and delegated to the government by the people. Finally, the Civil War Amendments ended the immoral institution of slavery, then corrected the imbalance between federal and state power by adding a federal check on the states' power, thus adding greater force to the Declaration of Independence's original promise of liberty and equality for all. 
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In the Declaration of Independence, we find the American vision of freedom and responsibility in its purest form. The Declaration's essence is captured in the few short phrases that begin with the most important phrase of all, "We hold these truths to be self-evident." In that simple line, Thomas Jefferson placed us squarely in the natural-law or higher-law tradition, which holds that there are "self-evident truths" of right or wrong. And what is that higher law? It begins with a premise of moral equality --  "all men are created equal" --  then defines our equality by reference to our "inalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	There, in a nutshell, is the moral vision -- a world in which moral people are free to pursue their own happiness, constrained only by the equal rights of others to do the same. It is not the responsibility of government to secure our happiness for us. That is our responsibility -- and our right. The role of government, rather, is to secure our rights, as the Declaration goes on to say. That is its basic function. But to be just or legitimate, government's powers must be derived "from the consent of the governed." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We have evolved this century from a constitutional government to a government that behaves without regard to constitutional principle. That moral vision in which people have the right and responsibility to pursue their own happiness has been lost. The federal government no longer derives its powers from the people -- it just takes them. This is why citizens distrust their government so much today. It is time that we re-limit our federal government so it can perform its proper functions well, and leave to the people and the states those functions which the federal government was never intended to perform.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	If we can begin to restore a constitutional government, I foresee an America where freedom and responsibility grow for individuals, families, and communities. Freedom and responsibility cannot be separated. Our freedoms never belonged to the federal government, but to the individual. We must make our government return them.<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I foresee an America that is the most family-friendly nation on earth. The family, not the government, should be the backbone of society. Government should cease trying to supplant it. When we are careless, legislative initiatives can harm families. By pledging to spare families from additional legislative and regulatory tinkering, we will do more to protect the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness than any federal legislative quick-fix.
<P> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I also foresee an America where far fewer decisions are made by Washington, and more are made by individuals, markets, or localities. Imagine the federal government, operating within its limited role, serving as a model of efficiency and effectiveness. A federal government focused on its constitutional missions -- rather than creating new ones -- could become a model for other governments. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	So, how do we return to a constitutional government? To start, we can give the American people a clear choice in the next election. I propose that all Republican candidates running for president, the U.S. Senate, and the U.S. House of Representatives start working together to develop a specific plan to return to a limited federal government as intended by our Founding Fathers. We must develop an agenda to recover the rights of individuals from their government. <p><b>A New Contract With America</b><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Call it a new Contract With America -- one that passes laws, not merely proposes them. Our party's greatest asset is our message, not our messengers. We should stake the future of our party -- and the country -- on a certain set of ideas, a governing moral code, rather than on any particular politician. Our goal should be to implement reforms consistent with those timeless principles embodied in the Constitution. 
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Our pledge to the American people should be clear: "If you elect a Republican president and maintain Republican majorities in the House of Representatives and the Senate, we will do the following . . . ." Here are some broad outlines for such a contract: <p><b>I. Reduce Government Spending</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We will reduce the size of the federal government by a tangible measurement over a period of four years. My preference would be a reduction of federal spending from 22 percent of our GDP to 15 percent or less (which may take longer than four years). Imagine taking these resources from the hands of government and putting them back into the pockets of families and entrepreneurs.<P><b>II. Transform the Tax System</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We will remove all social engineering from the U.S. tax code to create a new tax system designed strictly for the purpose of raising revenue efficiently. The power to lay and collect taxes was meant to fund the enumerated powers, not to become a political device in and of itself. Today, we discourage certain behaviors and reward others based purely on the whims of those who control the tax leviathan. <p><b>III. Reorganize the Executive Branch</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We will redesign the executive branch to be consistent with its constitutional authority instead of one still operating on 20th-century, centralized government experiments. We will replace the 14 cabinet-level agencies, which impose more than half a trillion dollars worth of regulations upon the U.S. economy each year, with perhaps nine, and restrict their regulatory powers under constitutional principles. The Constitution does not authorize at the federal level, for example, many of the activities within the departments of Housing and Urban Development, Commerce, Education, and Energy. <p><b>IV. Create a Constitutional Caucus</b>
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We will form a constitutional caucus or commission to evaluate all federal programs for an authorizing principle under the Constitution. A constitutional cleansing of the federal government is long overdue. Furthermore, Congress should require that all legislative proposals cite their precise constitutional authority before they can be enacted. In the case of existing illegitimate programs, Congress should identify and debate which ones should be returned to the states or phased out entirely.<p><b>V. Seek Change with Compassion</b>
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As we phase out unconstitutional programs, we will implement change with compassion, so that people currently dependent upon federal programs will have time to prepare for the transition and enjoy the empowerment they receive from their new freedoms. <p><b>VI. Pay Off the National Debt</b>
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We will implement a plan not only to balance the budget, but to run surpluses and pay off our $5-trillion national debt over 30 years, so that our children can decide their own future. <p><b>VII. Remove Barriers to Good Citizenship</b>
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We will erase from the books all laws, regulations, and other barriers that prevent local voluntary and civic institutions from helping their neighbors. Faith-based and civic institutions that are leading the fight for a civil society should not be stymied and penalized by mountains of federal laws and regulations that merely supplant local acts of kindness with the cold attitude of "government knows best." Why do we have a poverty class at all, when we spend an average of $36,000 in federal, state, and local welfare funds on every family below the poverty level? Because as much as 70 cents of each government anti-poverty dollar doesn't even reach the poor -- it is engulfed by administrative overhead and "professional" personnel. We will form a task force to conduct an exhaustive investigation of rules and laws that are interfering with those faith-based and civic institutions that are working to revive their communities and families. Then we will implement its recommendations. Local church and community groups can do far more to bring their people back to self-sufficiency than a central planner could ever hope to achieve. 
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	There are conservatives who believe that, with the proper leadership, the federal government can engineer the comeback of the family and civil society. But we should not yield to such temptations. If we are trying to end social engineering from the left, how can we justify it from the right? Our highest goals should not rely on new legislative initiatives as much as on the proper legislative restraint.
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	With this platform and this contract with the American people, we will continue to be the party of ideas and of commitment to constitutional principles, to prosperity, to a revived citizenry, and to a government on the side of those who want the culture in America to reflect their basic values. This is more important now than ever before, because government thwarts those values by attempting to replace them. Today, on behalf of the "public good," government crowds out the individual's "pursuit of happiness" --  including private investment and private charity -- by replacing them with government substitutes.
<p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We face today a set of deep-seated problems --overweening government, massive public debt, and crippling dependence on federal programs. But we face as well a historic opportunity to base our solutions upon our very roots as a nation, and upon our principles as a people -- freedom and responsibility. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Let us seize the opportunity before us by recovering those principles. If we restore government to its proper role under our Constitution, we will look back in years to come and say that the moment was right, and we were a match for that moment. And our children and grandchildren will thank us. <p><i><b><a href=" http://www.house.gov/brownback/welcome.html"> Sam Brownback</a></b> is a freshman Republican congressman from Kansas.</i>

<P><FONT SIZE=6>The fault-lines of today's divorce policies</FONT>
<P><HR WIDTH=50%>
By Suzanne Fields<BR>
The Washington Times
<HR width = 30%>
</CENTER>

<P>Once upon a time a private eye could build a flourishing business with a cheap camera, a good skeleton key and an appetite for the prurient, setting up a married man in a compromising position with a woman not his wife. A quick snap and the photograph was on its way to his lawyer.

<P>Not only would the &quot;unfaithful&quot; husband pay a premium for these fraudulently scandalous photos, artlessly staged, but his &quot;betrayed&quot; wife could appreciate them, too. She wanted a divorce as badly as he did and they had to prove someone's sexual infidelity to get one.

<P>Other scenarios were not so hypocritically benign, with the private eyes sneaking around hedges at the Bide-Away Motel, an out-of-the-way apartment or house, all to get the goods on someone's private pleasures.

<P>&quot;No-fault&quot; divorce became the simple-minded cure for all this. No-fault divorce, an erroneous label stolen from a no-fault automobile insurance policy, suggests that marriage is a little like a traffic accident, with the same high speed that bends the colliding parties out of shape but without the body and fender shop to put everything aright again. The intent of the law was to make divorce easier, more humane and less hypocritical for both parties. Feminists quickly saluted it as a means of asserting their independent rights.

<P>This was OK when both parties wanted the divorce. The law merely reduced employment opportunities for professional snoops. But many times no-fault divorce put the wife at a severe disadvantage, enabling her husband to make a unilateral decision which overnight reduced her standard of living, whether she had a job or not.

<P>State Rep. Jessie F. Dalman, a Republican, introduced a bill Feb. 14 in Michigan - with a bow to St. Valentine -  to repeal no-fault provisions when one spouse still wants to preserve the marriage. This places Michigan on the cutting edge of the movement to think again about the preservation of the terms of endearment. Other states are moving that way, too.

<P>In the Michigan bill, unilateral divorce would be repealed, with certain obvious exceptions - if the party wanting the divorce could prove the other spouse abusive, addicted, adulterous or in prison. At the least, judges would move more slowly in granting a divorce when half of the loving (or not-so-loving) couple wants to remain in the state of bliss.

<P>Every state now has some form of &quot;no-fault&quot; divorce. This approach has been especially unkind to women and children. Maggie Gallagher, in her forthcoming book &quot;The Abolition of Marriage,&quot; demonstrates how no-fault divorce literally allows one spouse to get away with murder, the &quot;murder of a marriage.&quot; Unilateral divorce radically alters the legal and moral basis of marriage: &quot;Today, while it still takes two to marry, it only takes one to divorce.&quot;

<P>Ms. Gallagher makes the larger argument that no-fault divorce dilutes the marriage contract, rendering it considerably less binding than, for example, a contract to sell a car or a cow. When the law supports the one who flees commitment(s), more marriages &quot;irretrievably break down.&quot; Chalk up another victim of the iron law of unintended consequences.

<P>Women in the 1960s and 1970s who should have known better were brainwashed into believing that a man who wanted a divorce should no longer pay alimony, just child support. &quot;Let the wife eat the cake she bakes.&quot;

<P>Brian Willats, communications director of public policy for the Family Forum in Lansing, Mich., a think tank that studies family issues, supports the Michigan bill because he thinks it strengthens the leverage of the &quot;virtuous spouse,&quot; the one who lives up to the marriage vows and doesn't want to break them. It tips the balance of power to the steady spouse, reducing the clout of the wandering spouse seeking greener pastures.

<P>This also restores a missing solemnity, a certain dignity, to the idea of the marriage contract. We've all heard, ad nauseam, the litany of ills that follow the single divorced parent, the poverty that attaches itself to the spirit as well as to the pocketbook, to society and to the family.

<P>When two people no longer want to stay together, they ought to be able to split their blanket. But not so fast: If one spouse objects, he or usually she should get an opportunity and a little more time to seek a reconciliation. If it takes two to say &quot;I do,&quot; shouldn't it also take two to say &quot;I don't&quot;?

<h2>How to Speak up for the GOP Revolution</h2>

by <a href="/pff/people/sfellow.html#Higgins">Heather Higgins</a>
<P>
We have heard much in the past year about the internal divisions
of the Republican coalition and how those strains would first
polarize, then fracture, this revolutionary venture.  The moderates,
we were told, would balk at the cruelty of the &quot;Contract
with America&quot; and break from the extremism of the budget.
 The extremists, went the theory, would alienate the moderates
by rejecting the politically possible in pursuit of the politically
pure.  We were blessed with those profound insights before the
election; which continued after the election; they went on through
the Contract (remember how the &quot;hard part&quot; was always
just ahead?), up into the appropriations process and the budget
debate; and now they are part of the primary campaigns.  The point
has been that collapse is just around the corner.
<P>
It isn't.  Not because there aren't differences -- there are.
 But because Republicans know there are, and have therefore quite
consciously worked on operating as a team.  They know that in
any majority coalition, by definition, there will be differences.
 The problem is to first find the  common ground and the common
language that holds the coalition together and advances its agenda.
<P>
This is not only common sense, it has been the reality of our
political life since the founding.  The American Revolution became
possible when those favoring economic liberty joined forces with
those seeking a virtuous society.  Yet that coalition, so much
an analogue to the present day, only coalesced when the two sides
learned a common vocabulary -- words such as &quot;liberty&quot;
and &quot;providence&quot; that galvanized all concerned.
<P>
If there is a problem with the Republican coalition, however,
it is that much of the managing is by deferral -- the &quot;tough&quot;
issues are on hold until later in 1996, or even 1997.  This is
understandable; control of Congress came more quickly than expected
and is still numerically slim, making the immediate challenges
first  a swift transition and then advancing an identifiable GOP
legislative agenda.  Not much time, if any, was left for the further
careful stitching together of  this quilted coalition.  This is
the weakness that is about to be exploited, as the latest  argument
for internal division in the Republican ranks.
<P>
The claim is this.  The Republican split is not so much between
moderates and extremists.  Rather, on the one side is the &quot;Leave
Us Alone&quot; coalition, identified in a phrase made famous by
key Republican strategist Grover Norquist when characterizing
the commonalties between gun owners, taxpayers, home-schoolers,
small business owners and others (Mr. Norquist contrasts this
with the &quot;Takings&quot; coalition of  Democrats, comprised
of those who want something from government that has been taken from others.)   On the other is
what the Wall Street Journal  portrayed on the last Friday of
the year alternatively as &quot;civil-society Republicans,&quot;
 communitarians&quot;, &quot;big-government conservatives&quot;
those who ostensibly wish to use the power of the state to promote
virtue, for example through tax credits for charitable giving.
<P>
Leave aside the flaws in the argument -- for example, the fact
that there are  substantial differences between the policy preferences
of communitarians as opposed to civil-society conservatives, or
the fact that tax credits are endorsed by many in the &quot;Leave
Us Alone&quot; coalition as an excellent way of removing power
from the state and restoring it to citizens.  The argument that
there is a conflict of visions is still powerful.  It captures
a real concern felt within republican ranks.  The fear is this:
Presume we do leave folks alone, then what happens?  Saying they
want to be left alone sounds pretty anti-social and selfish. 
Will sufficient people contribute to charity and help those who
need help?  Or will they look at the infirm, the aged, the sick
and the needy and choose to leave them alone?
<P>
What is meant by the &quot;Leave Us Alone&quot; coalition is quite
different from how it often has been characterized.  It's not
that Republicans aren't clear what they mean -- talk to strategists
like Mr. Norquist and it becomes apparent that they have a robust
vision of a strong civil society fully committed to addressing
our social problems.  But Republicans need to remember that these
are arguments that have not been articulated in political discourse
for some time.  In speaking about these ideas therefore -- particularly
given the Democrats' tireless depiction of Republicans as selfish,
greedy, and uncaring, they cannot use the shorthand they use among
themselves.  Rather, Republicans need to develop and use the common
ideas and language of the coalition if they are to resonate with
voters.
<P>
To say that Republicans represent a &quot;Leave Us Alone&quot;
coalition is simply and quite legitimately to explain what Republicans
want. To prevent a wedge being driven into the coalition, however,
it is critical that Republicans also start addressing why they
want it, and why others should as well.  Left in a vacuum, the
phrase &quot;leave us alone&quot; to the unaccustomed ear makes
no distinction between liberty and license, or civic-mindedness
and self-indulgence.  It provides no vision of  the kind of society
Republicans propose, and gives no assurance that the results will
improve, rather than worsen, the current situation.
<P>
In truth, however, the traditional American vision of limited
government and a strong civil society is a noble one.  Republicans
need to explain that in their view, Americans are trustworthy,
responsible adults. And adults should be &quot;left alone&quot;
in order to better carry out their obligations as citizens, in
order to exercise the responsibilities of authentic liberty.
<P>
Authentic liberty is not license; it is the freedom to do what
we ought to do, not whatever we want to do. And the freer a society,
the less intrusive the state, the more compelling the obligations
of individual citizens.
<P>
As commentator Dennis Prager points out, in the Torah, Moses doesn't
say to Pharaoh, &quot;Let my people go.&quot;  Rather, he says
&quot;Let my people go that they may worship their God.&quot;
 Or as Edmund Burke said, &quot;But what is liberty without wisdom,
and without virtue?  It is the greatest of all possible evils;
for it is folly, vice, and madness, without tuition or restraint.
 Liberty without purpose devolves into license and has little
social claim; liberty with purpose has the moral authority to carry a revolution.  The distinction is critical and needs to be articulated.
<P>
This language will be difficult for some.  As a coalition, for
example, Republicans tend to have a hard time with anything smacking
of &quot;caring&quot; and &quot;compassion&quot;.  It's not that
they object to the real article -- anyone who believes in minimal
government has indeed a deeper obligation to private charity --
but that in political discourse those words became a code for
&quot;government program.&quot;
<P>
Moral vocabulary, too, will be difficult.  The Progressive era
moved Americans away from a language of internal virtue and external
principles, providing instead a lifetime for the deliberately
relative language of &quot;values.&quot; Yet slowly, people are
beginning to realize that in life &quot;value-neutral&quot; is
itself a set of values, and that there are indeed some virtues
critical to any society which aspires to democracy, prosperity, and freedom.
<P>
Liberty is arguably the most powerful idea in American life, made
so by the complexity of the idea and the many visions to which
it speaks.  As David Fisher explains in &quot;Albion's Seed&quot;,
the &quot;most important fact about American liberty is that is
has never been a single idea, but a set of different and even
contrary traditions in creative tensions with one another... It
has become the most powerful determinant of a voluntary society
in the United States.  In fact, this plurality of freedoms may
prove to be the nation's most enduring legacy to the world.&quot;
<P>
Harnessed properly, understood in the context of its obligations
to civil society, liberty is also the resonant image that will
speak compellingly to the Republican coalition and convincingly
to the nation.

<TITLE>A Seven Step Recovery Program -- PFF
</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul>
<blockquote>
<a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>
<br>
<h2>A Seven Step Recovery Program</h2>
<P>
by <a href="/pff/people/director.html#Huffington">Arianna Huffington</a>
<P>
The GOP has had a string of bad news recently: For the first time
since 1962, a Democrat was elected to the Senate from Oregon;
in a recent ABC/Washington Post poll, 74% disagreed with how the
Republican Congress is handling the economy (versus 50% disagreeing
with Clinton's performance); the GOP has been completely outmaneuvered
by Clinton on the balanced budget and has even retreated on its
promise not to raise the debt ceiling.
<P>
There are two ways for the GOP to deal with all these setbacks.
One: They can spin them. Two: They can heed them as the wake-up
call they are. So far they've chosen the spin cycle. They're comforting
themselves with transparent excuses: The defeat in Oregon was
too narrow to be significant; Oregon was one of only three states
to elect a new Democratic governor in 1994; Oregon voted for Dukakis
in 1988; it's the Senate with wimpy Republicans caving in; it's
the uncompromising House freshmen, recalcitrant and extremist;
it's Clinton, the Great Empathizer; it's Dick Morris, the brilliant
strategist.
<P>
As anyone familiar with 12-step programs can tell you, there is
nothing as inventive as the human mind in denial. And since the
GOP is unquestionably in denial, here is my suggested seven step
recovery program. (In the budget saving spirit of the times, we
have reduced 12 steps to 7.)
<P>
The first step for the GOP is to acknowledge that it has a problem.
<P>
The second step is to stop whining, especially about the media.
As some sage once said, the Constitution guarantees a free press
-- it does not guarantee a fair press. The GOP should forget about
whether the media is misrepresenting their message and go about
improving it.
<P>
The third step is to stop sounding like accountants and to begin
sounding like leaders. The good news for Republicans is that 80
percent of the American public wants a balanced budget. The bad
news for them is that so does Bill Clinton -- in seven years with
CBO numbers. So Republicans need to move the debate beyond balancing
the budget, not because this battle is over, but because, for
the moment, the President has framed the debate in way that makes
it impossible for Republicans to win. Both sides want to balance
the budget, but the President, in his own words, wants to &quot;balance
the budget in a way that reflects our values.&quot;
<P>
The fourth step is for the GOP to stop repeating, ad nauseum,
that it is not cutting anything -- but merely reducing the rate
of growth. This may be factually correct, but didn't Republicans
campaign on the theme of cutting things -- cutting government,
cutting entitlements, cutting taxes? Did they come to power to
reduce the rate of growth of government or did they came to power
to reduce government?
<P>
So instead of being so defensive about what they are doing, I
suggest that they take step five and be courageous enough to tell
the American people just what they want to do: reverse 60 years
of New Deal and Great Society thinking, according to which all
solutions to social and economic problems revolve around government.
Yes, this is bold, but a time of crisis requires boldness, decisiveness,
and honesty. This rethinking of the role of government has to
go hand in hand with a fundamental redefinition of the role of
the citizen -- challenging the American people to meet less from
Washington with more from themselves and their communities.
<P>
The sixth step, without which the revolution will remain stalled,
is to talk about community solutions -- about what is working
around America. They must talk about it not once in a while but
as frequently and as seriously as they have been talking about
balancing the budget. The GOP must go beyond just talking about
dismantling government, and start talking about what they are
going to replace it with. This is a critical step. When Newt Gingrich
first became Speaker, he was going to hold Congressional &quot;success
hearings.&quot; He was going to bring to the Capitol the community
leaders who are making things work and are turning lives around
-- introducing them to the American public as the people who embody
the alternative vision of rebuilding America.
<P>
The final step is to bring a sense of urgency to the debate --
to shift it from balancing the books in seven years to taking
steps right now to reform conditions in education, in welfare,
in the ways we deal with those most in need among us. Let Dick
Gephardt and David Bonior defend a broken system of government
programs that has left millions of children hungry, abused or
neglected, and let the Republicans speak of weaving a real safety
net from the involvement and resources -- in time and money --
of millions of Americans.
<P>
Instead of spinning all these setbacks or blaming the media, it
is time the GOP took these seven simple steps to produce a message
that has both economic and moral truth on its side. If Republicans
truly want to recover from what ails them, they must seize the
moral high ground without which no party can be a majority party.

"Union leaders this week said  the election push was a way the new leadership could quickly 
demonstrate results for both the public and the AFL-CIO's member unions."

"The Oregon race provides a vital first chapter in a new textbook on politics we're going to write 
this year, as we  build the core of a powerful new grassroots movement."
<P>
  -- AFL-CIO President John Sweeney, January 31, 1996<sup>2 </sup>
<p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; After decades of declining political influence, labor 
unions have pledged to multiply their election efforts this year with a $35 million war chest. The 
first real test of organized labor's new activism -- Oregon's special election for a United States 
Senate seat -- resulted in a narrow victory for the candidate heavily backed by big labor. Similar 
efforts can be expected in numerous House and Senate races this fall.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; When AFL-CIO President John Sweeney swept into 
leadership of the nation's largest labor federation last fall, he did so on an agenda of action, 
pledging more active organization drives to help increase the union rolls in America and promising 
vocal political campaigns to promote the union's movement's liberal agenda. Every indication was 
that the AFL-CIO would be a major force in 1996.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Shortly after Sweeney's election, voters went to the polls 
in a few political contests around the country. These November 1995 contests did yet not have the 
full Sweeney imprint (he had been in office only for a few weeks), but organized labor nonetheless 
managed to demonstrate a significant presence in several states. In fact, after the elections, Sweeney 
attempted to take credit for the supposed public turn to the left he claimed had occurred.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Earlier this year, the AFL-CIO had its first test for 1996. 
In the special election to fill the seat of former Oregon Republican Senator Bob Packwood, big 
labor lined its horses up behind Democratic Congressman Ron Wyden. With substantial backing 
from organized labor, Wyden managed to beat Republican Gordon Smith narrowly in a mail-in 
election.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; As this pivotal election year proceeds, the AFL-CIO and 
other labor organizations will continue to invest heavily in campaign activity. Unfortunately, much 
of this politicking will be funded through mandatory worker dues, and much is unreported and 
unregulated by federal election laws. Direct PAC donations and independent expenditure 
campaigns on behalf of specific candidates represent only a portion of organized labor's political 
activities. It behooves Members of Congress to pay careful attention to these activities. Hard-
working union members should not be compelled to surrender their own pay, earned by their own 
sweat and toil, to finance political activity to which they may well object.
<p>
<b>THE PRELUDE:  KENTUCKY AND MISSISSIPPI '95</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The AFL-CIO's claim to victory in 1995 lies in the 
Kentucky governor's race between Paul Patton (D) and Larry Forgy (R). The national federation's 
propaganda organ, the <i>AFL-CIO News</i>, bragged that "even Forgy, in a call to the Louisville 
Courier-Journal, conceded that labor had made the difference, not only in heavily unionized 
counties but in helping turn out the African-American vote through the A. Phillip Randolph 
Institute."<sup>3 </sup>  (The A. Phillip Randolph Institute is an arm of the AFL-CIO dedicated to 
reaching out to African-American unionists.)
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; According to the <i>News</i>, 83,000 phone calls and 
158,000 pieces of mail led labor's efforts. The same report went on to disclose that 7 federation 
employees joined 9 activists from other labor unions to put a significant political operation in place 
on the ground in Kentucky, and that "two members of the Electrical Workers and CWA 
[Communication Workers of America] also were working with the [A. Phillip Randolph Institute]."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; In the end, Patton defeated Forgy by a slim 51-49 margin.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The story in Mississippi was similar, except for the 
outcome. Incumbent Republican Governor Kirk Fordice was pitted against Democrat Dick Molpus. 
The AFL-CIO and other labor groups committed 3 full-time staff and 10 part-time workers to the 
race. The <i>AFL-CIO News</i> reports that the unions dropped 44,000 pieces of mail and placed 
20,000 phone calls in an effort to promote Molpus. While organized labor's contribution may have 
helped narrow what appeared to be a blowout, the end result was that Fordice won with 55 percent 
of the vote.
<p>
<b>THE OPENING SALVO:  OREGON '96</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The first meaningful test of organized labor's muscle in 
the new year has occurred over the past few weeks in Oregon, where voters were inundated with 
aggressive tactics by big labor to help influence the outcome of the special election. According to 
AFL-CIO documents and press reports, 37 union activists (12 from the AFL-CIO alone) worked 
full-time to elect a Democratic Senator<sup>4 </sup>  --"an unusually large number of political 
operatives" from unions, according to <i>The Washington Post</i>.<sup> 5</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Steve Rosenthal, the AFL-CIO's political director, 
bragged that "We're mailing endorsement pieces to 75,000 union members and persuasion pieces to 
an estimated 40,000."  The AFL-CIO newsletter noted that "another 100,000 fliers comparing the 
candidates' records are being produced, and phone banks have been set up across the state."   
Shortly after the election was complete, AFL-CIO President Sweeney announced that the union had 
made more than 230,000 phone calls and sent over 350,000 pieces of mail.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The AFL-CIO did not act alone, however. By joining 
forces with at least 11 individual unions, it was able to mount a considerable presence in this one 
targeted race. Among the other participants were the American Federation of Teachers, American 
Federation of Government Employees, National Association of Letter Carriers, and International 
Brotherhood of Teamsters. The considerable firepower mustered by these organizations resulted in 
more than $183,000 in political action committee donations to the Democratic candidate. Not one 
penny of union money went to Republican Gordon Smith.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Of course, impact is not measured in direct PAC spending 
alone. Phone banks, direct mail, paid advertising, and grassroots organizing are all significant 
activities that labor used in Oregon and can be expected to use throughout this year to promote 
favored political candidates. Many of these activities can be funded out of forced dues. In Oregon, 
these efforts were worth hundreds of thousands of dollars more than direct, reported expenditures.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Union tactics played a significant role in the Oregon 
election. In fact, organized labor's activities themselves came under scrutiny by the media and the 
voters. The Teamsters were heavily criticized for an ad blaming the death of a teenage worker on 
the Republican candidate's business. Even the beneficiary of the Teamsters efforts, Ron Wyden, 
was forced to issue a public statement disavowing the ad and encouraging the union to pull it.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Union politics are nothing new. There is no question that 
organized labor has a right to participate in the electoral process. Unfortunately, in many states like 
Oregon, unions rely on coerced funding -- in the form of mandatory union dues -- to finance many 
of their political activities. Therefore, every hard-working union member in Oregon supported the 
candidacy of Ron Wyden with his sweat and toil -- even if he cast his vote against Wyden.
<p>
<b>THE ROAD AHEAD:  ELECTION '96</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; AFL-CIO President John Sweeney decided that his new 
leadership team must make its mark quickly. They have decided that their goal of organizing more 
than a million workers is too ambitious to be completed in the near term, and that they therefore 
should devote much of their resources to political action for a quick score.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The Plan. In keeping with that decision, the labor 
federation recently announced its intent to spend $35 million on election activities this year --as 
much as 7 times the normal budget and nearly two-thirds of the cost of a presidential general 
election campaign. This allocation will support:
<p><ul>
<li>Targeting 75 House districts, with 1-4 full-time staff in each;
<p>
<li>Creating a base of at least 100 activists (volunteers and paid) in every congressional district;
<p>
<li>Hiring state field directors in 36-40 states;
<p>
<li>Placing 2,500 workers in the field for the final October/November get-out-the-vote efforts;
<p>
<li>Reassigning 12-15 organizers and adding them to the 16-member political field staff, for a total 
of 31 traveling political operatives; and
<p>
<li>Financing a "massive media fund" to deliver the union's political messages.<sup> 6</sup>
<p></ul>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Rosenthal, even before the election results were known, 
indicated what labor's post-election response would be. He told the <i>Washington Post</i> that 
"The election in Oregon stands by itself" but that "At the same time, it's a national election, and we 
hope it will be similar to Harris Wofford's victory in 1991, and could well set the tone for 
1996."<sup>7 </sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Warming up for November. The 1996 campaign is 
already underway in places other than Oregon. Some 400 unionists, under the banner of the AFL-
CIO's Stand Up campaign, protested outside a recent gathering of freshman Republicans in 
Baltimore, Maryland. While the protesters condemned all of the freshmen, a special target was 
Representative Bob Ehrlich (R-MD), who represents a nearby congressional district. Their signs 
carried messages urging voters to make Ehrlich a one-term Congressman. Similar treatment can be 
expected by 74 other House members who have been placed on the AFL-CIO's national hit list.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The AFL-CIO's renewed focus on politics is clearly 
demonstrated by the fact that the organization's "Union Summer" campaign, which will use 1,000 
or more college students and entry-level workers to help organize unions in non-union workplaces, 
will be diverted to politics in the fall. Originally, it appeared that this organizing campaign would 
be the crown jewel for the new leadership, but they have been forced to shift their attention to a 
playing field on which they believe they can win:  the 1996 elections.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; AFL-CIO Leadership "Impressed" with Union-Led 
Turmoil in France. Unfortunately, it appears that Sweeney and his new team at the AFL-CIO 
envision a much more aggressive and confrontational plan than previous union leaders have 
pursued. In a speech late last year before the Association for a Better New York, Sweeney provided 
the following insight into his thinking:
<p><blockquote>
	I was in Europe last week, traveling with President Clinton, and I couldn't help but 
be impressed with what is going on in France. In this country, when we're faced 
with cuts in vital services that benefit workers and the poor, we shut down a few 
parts of the government. In France, the workers shut down the country -- even 
though only 8 percent of the work force is organized!<sup> 8</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; While Sweeney expressed his hope that such a situation 
would not be necessary in the United States, even suggesting the idea is shameful. The chaos and 
violence of the national shutdown caused by French unions would not likely be admired by many 
Americans but appears to be a possible harbinger of the AFL-CIO's intentions.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Compelling Union Workers to Pay for Politics. The new 
AFL-CIO leadership has implicitly acknowledged their reliance on forced union membership and 
compulsory dues to promote their agenda. One of the resolutions proposed by the Sweeney slate at 
last year's convention lamented:
<p><blockquote>
	The November 1994 elections capped a decades-long decline in labor's political 
influence, a trend closely connected to the decline in union density. This erosion 
also reflects labor's regional weaknesses, the seeds of which were planted decades 
ago by our failure to make adequate in-roads in right-to-work states.<sup>9 </sup>
<p></blockquote>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; By admitting a link between political weakness and 
voluntary fundraising, Sweeney's leadership is conceding that organized labor's strength lies where 
workers are compelled to pay union dues as a condition of employment.
<p>
<b>COERCED AND HIDDEN FUNDING</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Many of the AFL-CIO's political activities, like those of 
the federation's member unions, are financed not through voluntary PAC contributions by 
members, but by forced dues. Those activities that are issue-oriented (like television ads against 
Medicare reform, for example) often are paid for with these coerced dollars.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; As Members of Congress consider campaign finance 
reform legislation, they should ask whether it is fair to force every union member to pay for the 
ideological warfare of union officials. Corporations may not provide this sort of direct candidate 
support, and neither should their labor counterparts.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Campaign finance reform should not be entered into 
lightly. Meaningful reform must level the playing field and ensure that only voluntary contributions 
are used for politics. As the election season heats up, Members of Congress should note the 
activities of labor unions and remember where the money comes from.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The AFL-CIO has indicated clearly that aggressive 
political activities by labor unions --paid for on the backs of the union rank and file -- will continue 
throughout this high-stakes election year. Organized labor's renewed political activism promises to 
be a major factor in the 1996 elections. While unions should be as free as other organizations to 
pursue their political goals, the coercive nature of union funding, and the regulatory advantages 
unions enjoy, are unjust and unfair.

<P><FONT SIZE=6>How many Madison millions?</FONT>
<HR WIDTH=50%> 
</CENTER>

<P>Just how much money has the failure of the Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association cost taxpayers? Depending on the source, the timing of the estimate, and the method of calculation, the taxpayer-absorbed losses have been variously estimated at $47 million, $50 million, $60 million, $65 million and $68 million. At one time or another, each of these figures was accurate, but currently even the $68 million estimate substantially understates the cost to taxpayers.

<P>According to a spokesman at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), which is the government agency now responsible for keeping score, Madison's bankruptcy has so far cost $73 million. And that is only through 1994. The burden literally grows daily, and no estimate of its ultimate cost can be made at this time.

<P>Why these losses continue to escalate and how Hillary Clinton and the president contributed to them are worth reviewing. After all, Mr. and Mrs. Clinton relentlessly campaigned in 1991 and 1992 by denouncing the 1980s as &quot;a gilded age of greed and selfishness, of irresponsibility and excess.&quot;

<P>For all practical purposes, and contrary to the assertions of Richard Ben-Veniste, the minority counsel for the Senate Whitewater committee, all of the bad loans contributing to Madison's financial debacle had been granted before July 1986. At that time, the federal government removed Madison's owner, James McDougal, and placed Madison under direct federal supervision, ending the hemorrhaging. When Madison was formally closed down in 1989, the feds estimated its losses at that time to be $47 million, which essentially represented the difference between the cost of paying off depositors and the then-estimated value of Madison's assets.

<P>Over time, however, the ultimate value of Madison's assets continued to decline, according to the FDIC. As in the case of most failed S&amp;Ls, some loans that were believed to be partially recoverable when the thrift was closed eventually proved to be worthless, adding to the initial loss estimate of $47 million. And taxpayers, of course, had to continue to pay property taxes for Madison's failed real-estate ventures until they were sold for losses. While in receivership, interest payments applicable to Madison's borrowings from the federal financing bank continue to accrue, marginally adding to the taxpayers' burden. And litigation expenses are a factor as well. So as not to divulge to potential targets the scope of the government's legal efforts, the FDIC won't provide a breakdown of the sources of increases in the taxpayers' liability until litigation is concluded.

<P>In an absolute sense, compared to some failed S&amp;Ls whose costs exceeded $1 billion, Madison's $73 million taxpayer hit is small. According to FDIC records, however, the percentage of Madison's losses relative to its deposit base is very high even by S&amp;L bankruptcy standards, exceeding 60 percent. That means for every $100,000 of taxpayer-insured brokered deposits - so-called &quot;hot money&quot; - that Madison was able to attract by offering significantly higher interest rates than its competitors, more than $60,000 went down a rathole. This is a truly astonishing accomplishment - Madison's loan losses proved to be more than 20 times the federally required capital base of 3 percent of deposits.

<P>Of even greater interest is the fact that Madison's loan activity increased dramatically after Mrs. Clinton was hired in April 1985 to represent the thrift before the state regulatory body responsible for approving Madison's plan to meet federally mandated recapitalization requirements. Approval was given in May 1985 after Mrs. Clinton telephoned the chief state regulator, who, as a former law student and campaign volunteer of Gov. Clinton, had been appointed by him four months earlier. In 1985's third and fourth quarters, Madison's mortgage loans increased by $32 million. This six-month, $32 million mortgage-portfolio increase was nearly four times the size of Madison's entire mortgage portfolio as of Dec. 31, 1983, when the feds issued numerous cease-and-desist orders.

<P>As sordid as all of this is, just be thankful that 1996's campaign will not be a replay of 1992's, when the thoroughly corrupt, congenitally hypocritical Arkansas crew lectured Americans about the moral hazards of &quot;the corrupt, do-nothing values of the 1980s.&quot;

<I>Long day.  Ache all over.</I>  She had already kicked off her
shoes.  <I>Where's the boy?  His city screen should be on.  As
soon as learning time's up, he's all over the back streets.</I>
 But she just wants to lie back in her bed, turn to her favorite
stage door hangout;  not join, just watch.  The day was rough.
 Rush delivery behind schedule just because one in a box of tomato
cubes was bruised.  Lying back, she reaches for the navpad.  <I>My
favorite place or something different?</I>  She subscribes to
several byte cities, Metro Disney, Main Street, Maple Avenue,
Opreyville, The Village, City on the Hill (strictly for Sundays),
and even Downtown USA.  <I>Take the keys to our city!  Downtown
USA!  Yeah, it was the biggest, but what a zoo!  Metropolis was
the kinkiest, better save that for Saturday night.</I>  So she
opts for the less stressed out fun of TBA [The Big Apple].  She
cranks up the City Screen;  <I>make it early evening</I>.  The
whole wall, an enormous living rendition of Monet's <I>Water Lilies</I>,
dissolves like fine rain into a great central square.  Times Square.
 But this is not the tired, seedy theme park of today.  No, this
is the halcyon Times Square of the last century!
<P>
<I>Yeah, this was cool.  All that old neon.  City lights!</I>
 She steered herself to a chrome yellow checker, told the agent

 Part of being a full citizen of the Big Apple.  She was off,
peering without craning her neck, at the fantasia of old New York,
sort of circa 1939, more fetidly baroque than any single imagination
could ever have encompassed ... spires and ziggurats and lurid
Babylonian bronze entablature, bigger and wilder than any made

this time period, was bedazzled. <I>125th Street, The Apollo --

<P>
Welcome to the fourth life of the American city:  our new urban
world;  America after the Big Change.  <I><B>Byte City!</B></I>
<P>
Not science fiction.  Not prediction.  Not the future -- Just
a way of talking about how we get there.  Because getting there
means that something <B>Big </B>happens.  People will exclaim:
 <I>It's a revolution!</I>
<P>
Well, if it's a revolution, then Big Change means upheaval.  Revolution
cannot be rouged and face-lifted into pretty Progress.  Revolution
is not mere improvement.  Revolutions are upendings.  Old ways
actually lie down and die right at our feet, like statues of Louis
or Lenin.
<P>
Everyone says we are living in such a time.  Look at their big
titles for Big Change:  Toffler talks <I>Third Wave</I>, or Drucker's
orotund <I>Transformation of American Life</I>.  But then, nothing
dreadful happens.  Nothing even fantastic happens.  Tomorrow is
wonderful, different, difficult, but a lot like today.  Only more
so, like a straight line on a chart.  And problems?  <I>Weeell</I>,
they can be <I>managed</I>.
<P>
But revolution will force on us the integrity of destruction.
 We can pretend that everything will stay the same even as everything
changes, but revolution will not listen.  Fortunately.
<P>
If this is revolution beginning to hit, then let's talk about
the real thing. That is the reason for <I>Byte City</I>.  Byte
City meets the acid strip dip of Big Change.  It's big enough
to change our lives like the last Big Change.  Remember:  The
<I>Industrial</I> Revolution?  It blew the old world apart, it
made a new one, and it gave us new life.
<P>
And we still think of it as Modern.  Well, get over it.  It's
now the oldest old order around.  Not just <I>Rust Belt</I>, but
<I>Big City</I>, <I>Edge City</I>, the Paramus Mall too.  Dead,
Dead, Dead.  Byte City is a way to kill the old world in our minds
before it's torn up right in front of us.  Byte City is a way
to get to change as big as coal, steam, pig iron, and iron rails
wrought right where we live.
<P>
That wall-plastering, flat-panel <I>virtu-screen</I> is a portal
into a new urban world.  Our gut tells us that this tool literally
pries open a door into a new way of life.  Thinking it through
is like asking a Scot in 1775:  <I>Tell us about the railroad.</I>
<P>
Would he have said:  <I>Sure:  iron horse, new net of cities belching
smoke, it's all coming, I can see it.  O yeah</I>.
<P>
Or would he scratch his head, squint, and say: <I> Sure would
make stagecoaches faster, if they could go on rails.  Heavier
loads too, easier for drays to haul.  But the teams would need
good gravel beds, or they might bust their hooves.</I>
<P>
Byte City's one cut at the time traveler's question to us.  We
might not do any better than our Scottish cousin, but at least
we have his revolution as guide.  The upheaval that would revvv
up <I>his</I> lifetime helps us see the roar that is already growling
in our <I>own</I>.  <I>Byte City</I> is a metaphor of revolution
<I>now</I> we can stack up against revolutions <I>then</I>:
<P>
Like the one that hit Britain after 1815, and the United States
after 1876.  And they help us look ahead because they happened
to people like us.
<P>
<U><I>They are us</I></U>:  near in time, same in space.
<P>
Kinship helps, because we can watch how they got through it, and
we can pace ourselves.  Big Change is history's gauntlet.  We
have to get through it too.
<P>
So their stories may be our own.  But still ours to tell.  Technology
hits, but <U><I>we</I></U> do the transformation;  <U><I>we</I></U>
make the moves;  <U><I>we</I></U> do the change.
<P>
And it all seems to start after big wars of ideas, big heroic
journeys;  finished, only to find a new one has begun, for
<ul>
<B>Britain</B> after the <I>Napoleonic Wars</I>.
<P>
<B>The United States</B> at the end of <I>Reconstruction</I>.

<P>
Start with <I><B>The Driver</B></I>.  <I>Iron horse, locomotive,
train</I>:  The railroad drove change.  And it was more than change's
tool.  It worked into our brain as song and story and myth.  It
became the industrial world's kinetic cathedral.
<P>
Because it had the raw power of faith.  <B>It was the god of destruction</B>.
 Steam was a juggernaut where worshippers of <I>The Modern</I>
threw down their old world, to be crushed under its wheels.  <B>It
was the icon of power</B>. The railroads reeked the highest octanes
of power, Apollo Program stuff, done by billionaire barons and
tycoons.  <B>It was the layer down of judgment</B>.  Its terrible
mix of underworld and the machine--belching cinders, its engine
roaring through the night--told all that <I>The Modern</I> had
no room for the sentimentality of old ways of life [Didn't DOS
do the same?  We, the new, sneered at the pathetic losers who
needed an interface to play].
<P>
But what did the rails make possible?  They made the new city;
 they raised it up as the main place, the place we lived.  People
and industry were joined, and trapped, in bleak sites of mutual
need.  And the rails brought us there.
<P>
And it was, truly, transformation.  The railroad's impact immediately
and visibly moved peoples' lives.  A plaintive cry from the <I>The
Nation</I>, in 1873:
<center><P>
<I>The locomotive is coming in contact with the very framework
of our institutions ...</I>
</center><P>
Contact.  Like the great host of a plague bacillus, or a horde
of lepers.  The end of small town America, Erie Canal America
... <I>&quot;low bridge, coming to a town ... &quot;</I>
<P>
And how it swarmed!  It was fast.  We're so proud of our burn
cycle for CPUs.  But the speed burn of change in last-century
US and Britain should wipe that smirk clean off.  The entire rail
net of Britain was built in just fifteen years, from 1841 to 1855.
 After the Civil War, from 1865 to 1873, thirty thousand miles
were laid here.  Life transformed in the span of one young adulthood.
<P>
Charles Francis Adams, old elite, 1868, clothed his shock in romantic
metaphor, back after five years in the Court of St. James:
<center>
<P>
<I>Had we been Tyrian traders of the year 100 BC landing from
a galley fresh from Gibraltar, we could hardly have been stranger
or the shore of a world, so changed from what it had been ten
years before.</I>

</center>
<P>
And what was the city?  It was:  <I><B>Where We Live</B></I>.
 Think sentimental, think Adams' Beacon Hill;  then think what
took its place.  You have just defined <I>revolution</I>.  Because
revolution made a new city, and the new city was the place where
peoples' lives were upended as they entered.  The city stripped
off old identity.  People naked of meaning jostled and elbowed
their way, packed together in brick and cobbled isometric planes,
until they found something new.  Migrations to the new cities
threw whole worlds together, cramming entire tribes into tenements
by the 7th Avenue El.  Forget the old romance of the bazaar, the
ancient trade city's waterfront teeming with Lascars, Phoenicians,
Tartars, and Greeks.
<P>
That was original city, <I>entrepot</I> city.  Trade made, on
river and sea-nexus, like London or New York.  From its hub spoked
the hinterland network of villages and towns.  How different was
the new net of industrial urbs!  Take a classic of its kind, Springfield,
Ohio. At its height, home for 80,000.  Springfield was a local
industrial hub anchored by three big national plants:  Crowell-Collier,
International Harvester, and Robbins and Myers.  And what remained
of the old agricultural world of Clark County brought its bounty
there in homage to the new city, to the farmer's market in the
neo-Romanesque city hall, stone tower shining city pride just
like 15th century Siena or Bologna.  Oak-shaded Wittenburg was
its civilization-badge, with a football team Ronald Reagan could
have played on, while oysters on ice came every morning by those
rails, fresh from Chesapeake Bay.
<P>
America's whole world was wired by railroad;  cities wired within
by streetcars, and wired without into a national network of cities,
with the former <I>entrepot</I> cities now grown to giant <I>metropoli</I>:
 Chicago, New York, LA.  If we think of the city as a node in
the network of our lives, it is the merest step of imagination
to see what <I>Byte City</I> will be for us.
<P>
The big screen of <I>Byte City</I>, ten or twenty years from now,
is today's railroad, today's god of destruction and creation.
 The railroad was <I>force majeure</I> in English:  it moved people
to the city, moved in goods they wanted, and moved out goods they
made.  The virtu-screen doesn't move anything ... but it brings
everything to us.  The city is in our living room, or wherever
we want it to be.  The portal becomes a vehicle, and like the
railroad before, <I>&quot;it is coming into contact with the very
framework&quot;</I> of our lives.

<P>
So then the next piece of Big Change:  <I><B>Loss of Order and
Connectedness</B></I>.  The new net clung to the heels of the
rails:  Life cobbling to the factories clustering around each
new depot.  People poured into them, searching first for jobs,
and then for a sense of belonging.  Migrants from farm to slum
could not bring with them their own old net of traditions, the
rooted weave of relationships that was small town America.
<P>
Small town America was our mythic heart.  As Robert Weibe tells
it,
<ul>
&quot;small-town life was America's norm in the mid-seventies
<I>[1870s].</I>  Groups of these towns fell into satellite patterns
about a larger center <I>[the entrepot]</I>, to which they looked
for markets and supplies, credits and news.  But however much
they actually relied upon an outside world, they still managed
to retain the sense of living largely to themselves.  With farms
generally fanning around them, these communities moved to the
rhythms of agriculture: the pace of the sun's day, the working
and watching of the crop months, the cycle of the seasons.&quot;
</ul>
Alien.  Weird.  Wild.  New cities broke rhythm itself by busting
the rule of order.  Nature's rules now knelt to human imagination.
 Cities of wonder -- and inescapable wonderment only added to
their sense of <I>anomie</I>.  It was easier for migrants to take
the filth, disease, and toxicity of the new net than the squeeze
of a reality overwhelming and fantastical.  New building systems
of iron made easy Neo-Classical fantasies that Palladio could
but have dreamed of:  symbolized in Britain by the Crystal Palace
of Victoria's heyday;  then, in America, by the Skyscraper, the
<I>El</I>, and endless canyons of steel.  The landscape itself
disoriented in its strangeness,.  It was both harsh and dreamlike,
as in T. S. Eliot's image from <I>The Wasteland</I>:  &quot;<I>unreal
city, under the brown fog of a winter dawn ...&quot;</I>
<P>
We have all read stories of the city's capacity for <I>anomie</I>:
 like my grandfather coming to New York as a boy, hawking fruit
and flopping in a tenement room with twenty others on the lower
East Side; then the rails to Springfield for a job, and ending
up in the wrong Springfield:  Ohio, not Massachusetts.  There
are so many unspoken stories about those times embedded in our
minds, in the place where myth resides.
<P>
But people could make the warp from farm to factory, cabin to
tenement.  Living conditions and physical alienation were not
the problem:  loss of identity was.  Loss of connection hurt when
people were torn, not from the soil, but from their own defining
labor, the worth that came from work.  For example, the industrial
revolution savaged the place of the craftsman in society.  Pittsburgh,
known before 1860 as the &quot;Craftsman's Empire,&quot; became
in just twenty years a kingdom of steel, where labor replaced
craft.  And the furnaces offered no status equal to what was lost.
<P>
What had been lost was identity itself.  The new world of the
assembly line seemed to reduce men and women to mere auxiliaries
of the machine.

<P>
Call this a problem of <I><B>More Money, Less Meaning</B></I>.
 Our soft, clean mind mode cringes before their cities of disease
and death.  Death rates in Britain stayed the same from 1820 to
1870, even though life expectancy was soaring in the countryside.
 Why?  Because city air and water was killing so many.  A Southern
slave in 1850 lived twenty years longer than the average Northern
industrial worker.  But that Northerner just shrugged.  Farm life
scraped hard too.
<P>
They liked the money.  Wages were higher in the new cities.  For
young men freed from the farm, <U>a lot more money</U>.  For example,
real wages in U.S. industry grew more than 40 percent between
1865 and 1873.  People could put up with the crazed atmosphere
of the this world:  the weltering, roiling, pinball pulse of the
new city.  They could put up with the disorientation, and they
could put up with the physical abuse.  Because they had more money,
they believed their quality of life was improving.
<P>
Ah, but then come &quot;depressions.&quot;  <I>The Panic of 1873!</I>
 Progress was replaced by uncertainty.  And uncertainty exploded:
<P>
<center>
<I>Will I be paid a good wage, will I be able to raise a family
in a decent place, will I be treated with dignity for what I do?</I>
</center>
<P>
A wave of depressions followed fast on industry's tide.  They
banged home the brittleness of industrial identity.  Lay-off,
throw out -- <I>You'll work for this, right?</I> -- because new
labor had no given status.  Society had no rules, no custom and
taboos, to regulate the new.  Sure, craftsmen and farmers had
stature and place in the old order of things, but this was waning
work.  No one knew what status to give the new work.
<P>
Money is only a parts-maker for status.  Money is always there,
pieces in the machine of meaning:  a badge of rank, a tool of
display;  but cash only helps make the whole work.  Identity is
a mysterious endowment of society.  Money is no substitute.  Money
can prop up identity in doubt, but only for a time.  People need
to know where they stand with each other.
<P>
So money propped up status in the new work -- for a while.  But
when the market cracked, so to did the identity of the new worker.
 Kicked out of work, wages cut;  arbitrary, brutal signs that
told the new workers:  <I>you are no longer what you were</I>.
 <I>Maybe you are no better than a slave</I>.  And old social
compacts were torn up across all old divides.  What happened to
farmers and craftsmen also happened to yesterday's middle management:
nostalgia's fat, jolly traders who thronged the <I>entrepot</I>
cities and fed the small towns.
<P>
Big change ripping up old meaning lived on in folk songs and literature
alike.  Then our memory of the trauma condensed down to a few
quaint characters  What happened to John Henry?  What happened
to Old Fezziwig?
<P>
What happened to them is the story of a <B>spike</B>.  The total
the Big Change --  the transformation -- took decades, but the
stories come out of a time when a single generation took the main
hit.  Before that, change was being accommodated.  Sure, you could
see the stretch marks, but it was still the same old place.  Things
kept changing and changing and changing ... and then ... then
it was suddenly a whole new place.
<P>
<I>Where am I?</I>  This is the spike.  It hits one generation;
they are the <I>before and after</I> people.  Theirs is the moment
of crisis, they are the ones who make the psychic passage from
one world to another.
<P>
The crisis is not physical.  It is not about problems like pollution
or plagues or panics.  The crisis is about a mind jump.  And there
is one group that just can't make it:
<P>
The Old Order. The Ruling Class.  The Elite.
<P>
Whatever the <I>Blue Book</I> cut is on who runs things, throw
it out.  Throw out the book too.  Because establishments are all
about staying <I>established</I>.  When Big Change happens and
they can't see it, they become <I>dis-.</I>
<P>
They still have power.  Sure, like Gorbachev's generals still
had tanks.  Thousands of them.  <U>They had power, but they did
not have authority</U>.
<P>
And authority is about belief.  Elites get to be elites because
people believe in them, and they believe in their ideas.  All
Old Orders were once New Ideas told by people with fire in their
eyes.  And their message was simple:  we know where we are all
going, and we can get you there.  These people become the new
elite because the majority of <I>all the people</I> believe them.
<P>
Elites fail because they forget this is why they are there.  They
come to think that they are there to preserve a world <U>where
they rule</U>.  They come to speak only to themselves, and, while
change is roaring through society, the only people who still believe
them are themselves.  Worse for them, they come to think that
self-belief is what authority is all about.
<P>
And that is when they really lose it.

<P>
History always remembers the moment when a ruling society discovers
it can no longer rule, because it has lost the belief of its people:
 the moment that  <I><B>Old Ideas [and Elites] Lose Authority</B></I>
<P>
How do old elites come to fail in the face of Big Change?  They
make four big mistakes:
<P>
<ul>
<I><B>R</B>uling Elites cannot see the change, in part because
it hits right after a period of triumph for them, a time when
their own authority has been unquestioned.</I>
<P>
<I><B>W</B>hen faced with change, elites try to deny what is happening.</I>
<P>
<I><B>W</B>hen the change cannot be held off, ruling elites try
to control, or &quot;manage&quot; change to preserve their position.</I>
<P>
<I><B>W</B>hen the handwriting is on the wall, many among the
elite embrace the new vision, ensuring survival for many ...</I>
<P>
</ul>
... but it is too late for Old Elite society as a whole. The irony
of it all is that the unraveling begins at the moment the ruling
elite is least disposed to accept it.  It happens at the moment
of their triumph.
<P>
Look at the British ruling class after 1815.  23 years fighting
Napoleon ... now <I>Boney</I> was finally doing time on St. Helena.
 Five coalitions it took to do him in;  an Iliad of a war.  But
when it was done, the British latifundial elite -- you know, rolling
estates and country &quot;homes&quot; big as Versailles -- owned
the world, superpower-care-free as a fox hunt.  And right then,
that instant, it all began to strip itself away.  Why?  Because
the entire energy and effort of British society, of British life,
had come to be written as a great struggle.  The elite's bible
was Bonaparte, where he was the Devil of change and upheaval.
 So when he was banished at last, the ruling class thought:  <I>We
have conquered change itself!</I>  Could they just imagine that
by beating Boney, they would lose their last claim on control
of their own?  <I>No</I>. Their world was swirling around them,
and they thought -- <I>wonder of wonders!</I> -- that their authority
was never more majestic.  Double false pride.
<P>
The same thing was true of the United States, which had just fought
its own foreign war.  It happened to be against our own people,
<I>The South</I>.  Like a well-lathered 16-part miniseries, it
wasn't just a war.  It started in the 1850s, with the rise of
Radical Republicanism.  There was Bleeding Kansas, Abe Lincoln's
election, John Brown's body, the Big Bang Battle Hymn of the Republic.
 And after Appomatox, the saga continued.  Crusading war dissolved
into crusading politics:  the uplifting of the wicked called <I>Reconstruction</I>.
 Good <I>vs.</I> Evil, national energy tasked to ideology, and
speechifying leaders -- for 20 years, from 1856 to 1876, we had
our own Iliad.  While gilt-edged Brit elite sang <I>See the Conquering
Hero Comes!</I>, ours claimed emotional authority from <I>The
Union Forever!</I>  Serial melodrama, year after year, was the
elite theater of authority.
<P>
Cold War sound familiar now?  Was Washingtonian strutting any
different, gloating in its <I>End of History</I> triumphalism?
 Call <I>Johnny Reb</I> and<I> Jean Crapaud</I> bad miniseries,
but they had <U>action</U>.  Cold War was plain bad soap opera.
 Like<I> General Hospital</I>, it got very tedious, lapsing in
the end into a stream of mock crises and snore summits.  But the
Sponsors loved it.  And why not?  The Soviet Union had settled
in like welfare squatters on the first floor of American life.
 Commies consumed attention, they sanctioned elite power.  What
could be more important than 50,000 nukes in your face?
<P>
Fifty years should have ratified forever;  but then, suddenly,
it all went away.  And since then, America has suffered the sordid
spectacle of a ruling elite desperately trying to justify its
right to rule on one hand, while PC-bullying the rest of us to
keep taking orders on the other.
<P>
And while that old elite spent the early 1990s in earnest gush
that America would not make it without more elite control -- <I>We're
in economic decline, we need an industrial policy!  We need to
run the world or it will be a mess!  We need national health care!</I>
-- the rest of society was moving toward the first act of revolution.
<P>
Elites make revolutions happen.  They are why we have revolutions
at all:  because elites try to postpone change.  And while they
get their <I>Best and Brightest</I> to tell us why change is bad,
or why it shouldn't happen unless they regulate it ... it happens.
<P>
And in order for it to happen, change has to overcome elite resistance.
 What old elites achieve is the opposite of what they want.  Their
resistance speeds up the very unraveling of authority that they
fear.  Boom!  They garrotte themselves.. We call the public execution:
 revolution.
<P>
Elites not only make revolution possible, <I>they are its midwives</I>.

<P>
So the next movement:  <I><B>Old Elites Fail, New Do Not Lead</B></I>.
<P>
But what does elite failure look like?  Elite failure doesn't
mean inevitable tumbrels and a Terror.  The erosion of the old
order and its authority rushes toward a series of happenings that
end the sway of the old ruling elites, and usher in a period without
leadership.  Those who have made economic revolution are not like
the old order they unseat.  They are not the bureaucrats who rise
to high estate as <I>Masters of the Job Description</I>.  Their
roughshod power comes from making things happen, not trying to
stop them.  That is why their Homeric title would be <I>Breakers
of Bureaucrats, </I>because that is what they do while they make
change happen.  They don't know anything about creating a new
system, they would howl at the prospect of <I>going into government</I>.
 They would say:
<P>
<blockquote>
<I>Let a new path emerge naturally from the new world.  You can't
force a new path.  That's exactly why the old order failed.  They
tried to hold back change.  And if holding back change was the
problem, then change itself is the solution.  The old won't work,
but everything new will.</I>
</blockquote>
<P>
Makers of economic revolution are the necessary agents of change,
but not necessarily the new leaders of society.  Aged elites in
both Britain and the United States flunked the leadership test
when upheaval hit hardest.  Everyone could see that those in charge
blew it.  But the new enterprisers who spearheaded revolution
also failed.  Omission, not commission -- but still failure. 
The standard was theirs to hold.  They just failed to pick it
up.
<P>
The United States and Britain then snagged in midstream, lodged
on a mudbank period of drift in politics, juxtaposed crazily with
the roaring whitewater energies of economic change.  The result:
 the disorder and disconnectedness in peoples lives grew.  Society
itself seemed about to fall apart, while old <I>and</I> new elites,
fearful of the outcome, twitched feebly, with some shaky rattling
of armed authority from above. 
<P>
But feeble gestures only lashed the alienation of the rest from
ruling elites that had squandered their authority.
<P>
How did the elite fail in Britain?  The gentry made a good start
by ignoring what was happening.  Few were actually involved in
business.  There were no landed people who were also corporate
owners in Parliament in 1820, or in 1830.  More tied in with business
as the revolution gathered steam, but gently.  <I>I have  a nephew
in business;  I'm a barrister, you know</I>.  A few might sit
on a corporate board somewhere.  But they let the world pass them
by.  The new Barons--as in Beer Barons, known as <I>The Beerage</I>--were
knocking on the temple doors.
<P>
Then they went out and undercut themselves in style.  If any figure
helped to delegitimate the old order, it was George IV.  Call
him <I>The Prince of Pleasure</I>; let him prove it at 96-course
meals.  Let his friend Beau Brummel offer the only gift of his
regime to society:  the starched collar.
<P>
And this ruling class didn't even try to wonk -- they just let
their policies plain fail.  The politics of that old order are
remembered in the union workhouses, the poorhouse, debtors' prisons,
Luddite loom-smashing, and Redcoats firing on the crowd at Peterloo.
 But political failure was in Britain a far cry from political
fall.  Taking gentry power apart took more than a generation.
 You don't remember?  That's the trouble.  It's so far away now,
like looking at life through dark historical mica.
<P>
The United States?  What failure here?  The pearl of Radical Republicanism
was ground down in the embarrassments of, and backlash against,
a forever unfinished, internal war of ideology.
<P>
Forever repression of the South was failing.  It was failing because
of exhaustion and recognition:  exhaustion over the strain of
beating down our own Reb face in the mirror;  and recognition
that its goals <I>could not</I> be achieved [and so many in the
North, sadly, who did not want them to be achieved].
<P>
But there were <I>undercurrents</I> too, and the undercurrants
that helped kill Reconstruction were more interesting.  Among
them was a gathering in the gut that the <I>Grapes of Wrath</I>
elite -- who had blazed to trample Rebel vineyards -- was giving
way to a group of New Men, <I>Organization Men</I> of the Grant
Administration who cared nothing for America's soul, but plenty
for promises of patronage, and the river of rewards from the new
<I>machine politics</I>.
<P>
And this replacement-Republican elite resisted the claims of the
thronging new workers of the industrial cities.  But the workers
kept claiming, pushed by economic &quot;panic&quot; and depression.
 Their champions began to talk about something called a &quot;moral
economy,&quot; and Ira Steward wrote that<I> &quot;something of
slavery&quot;</I> remained in the North.
<P>
What happened in America in the later 1870s was that the crusading
vision that created Reconstruction was coming home.  It was no
longer held aloft by an elite that once led the grand, rolling
bayonet charge down Cemetery Ridge;  but by regular people, people
who were now forced to defend themselves against the young changelings
of the righteous elite that so recently led them into battle.

<P>
There was a <I><B>Demand for New Meaning</B></I>.
<P>
People began to rebel against their own elite because they felt
betrayed by it, and the people were right.  Grant's New Men seized
fast advantage of industry's stripping of work's status.  And
where the elite firebrands of the 1850s would do anything to give
all Americans full citizenship, their young changelings of the
1870s fought to take it away from all but a few.  The Organization
Men feared full citizenship for all, because they feared it would
mean a workers' world:  the end of their own world.  But turning
on their old ideals, the Republican New Men set out on a corrosive
path, betraying their fathers, denying their heritage, and foretelling
their own, eventual fall.
<P>
Because demand for new meaning would not be denied;  someone was
going to come along and supply it.  And they would lay claim to
leadership.  But first, how was this demand expressed?
<P>
In Britain, early on, there were rural bonfires, from the Luddite
to the Captain Swing disturbances.  But these were the lashings
out of a dying countryside, futile and distant flares of things
to come.
<P>
The real demand could be felt as industry really took root in
Britain, with the migrations in full flood.  Unionism, and then
the Chartist movement were able in the 1840s to put real pressure
on the ruling elite, <I>through politics</I>.  The peoples' demand
-- politely put.
<P>
In the United States, it was more violent.  As Grant's New Men
rose to be <I>Robber Barons</I> in a <I>Gilded Age</I> [what a
turn of phrase on <I>Golden Age</I>!], they defended their civic
order, and their property, by building forts in the heart of every
city.  These arsenals still exist.  What were called armories,
were really castles, strongholds of the robber Barons.
<P>
They were thrown up after the labor rebellions --The Great Strike
of 1877.  They were there so the army and militia could drag out
the guns and sweep the streets.
<P>
Because everyone remembered the whole of Philadelphia's railroad
yards in flames.  If the railroad was the centerpiece of transformation,
the symbol of new elite power, then imagine the elite's shock
as they watched them burn into the night.  Out came the army,
the guns, the grapeshot ... Ergo, the armories.
<P>
And ergo, labor unions.  The number of major unions in America
went from 3 to 21 in the 1870s.
<P>
But as workers mobilized to fight against the elite, society slid
into crisis.  And what is <I>crisis</I>?  It is not <I>coming
apart</I>;  it is the dawning fear that we will unless ... 
<P>
Remember the mind jump from the old world to the new?  In the
gilded age we weren't making it;  and the longer it was ignored,
the harder, our gut said, it would be to get to the other side.
 As Henry Holt wrote in 1895:
<P>
<I>... the large majority of intellectual people </I>[read: elites]<I>
are peacefully sitting on a crust covering a mephitic chasm, or,
as many think, a volcano.</I>
<P>
It was a crisis that the absence of a ruling idea seemed to make
inevitable.

<br>--John Newton, 1831
</center>
<P>
And its absence for twenty years [<I>1876-1896</I>] became something
of a <I>desideratum</I>--the thing most wanted--in American life.
 Demand for new meaning went unfulfilled until <I><B>A Vision,
A Movement, and Order</B></I> came again to national life.
<P>
And not surprisingly,  it was found in elite form; that is, in
an elite that would lead.
<P>
And leadership meant religion.  Reaffirmation.  Religious revival
among American and British elites was a symbol to everyone else
that they could believe in elites again.  A bond of trust with
regular people was renewed.  But there was more.  Revival connected
personal religious calling to civic calling.  Individuals among
the renewed elite suddenly had authority again:  their voices
for reform rang true.  People got excited again.  People believed
again.  Things got done.
<P>
In Britain, this was called Methodism.  Methodist membership soared
in the decades after Wesley's death in 1791, from about 50,000
to more than 500,000 in 1840.  The important thing to know is
that Methodism became the religion of the new elite.
<P>
Methodism gave a new elite something far better than power:  moral
authority.  And this authority was not just put to the reform
of religion: the revolt of chapel [Methodism] against Church [the
ruling class' state religion].  Righteous Methodists brought their
reform faith to bear on all society.  They would cleanse a society
corrupted by Old Order thinking ... through modern thought.  They
would bring in universities and <I>&quot;institutes&quot;</I>
of expertise based on scientific methods.  Above all, they would
legitimate a <I>new class</I> of professionals, who could face
the problems of the world with an integrity [from the Latin <I>purity</I>.
 Clean!] given by reason and education.
<P>
The most important symbol of the new liberalism was the person
of the monarch herself.  The Georgian kings were the family heads
of their ruling society;  they represented the landed class and
their right to rule--and also, in George IV, their vanity, backwardness,
and profligacy.  Victoria, crowned just five years after the first
Reform Act, deliberately set a new course, where monarchy followed
reform, and by embracing it, decisively legitimated it.  Victoria,
in her person, embodied the new elite ethos.  Her sobriety, modesty,
and rectitude gave liberalism national authority.  Here was a
middle class, modern monarch, championing the new agenda of teetotalers,
social crusaders, and engineers.
<P>
And the idea of a democratic franchise gradually took root.  The
sway of the landed elite was worn away between the two reform
acts of 1832 and 1867, and the Beerage was co-opted into the new
spirit of the age.  The Corn Laws were repealed, and a ten-hour
work week was passed in 1841.
<P>
But getting to the new vision -- giving order to a chaotic transformation
in national life -- was long and hard-fought.
<P>
The vision was not even conceived until well after the initial
pulse of economic revolution, and no part of the new vision came
from the old order.  Nothing.  <I>Nada</I>.  And from the rollicking
new elites? -- A new way of life, a new context, a new physical
texture of existence.  But not meaning, not vision, and certainly
-- save for the same elites in their cozy brownstones -- not <I>order</I>.
<P>
The vision came out of a different elite that itself emerged as
individuals deserting both the old order elite and the new industrial
elite.
<P>
The Progressive movement renewed the American ruling class in
much the same way as Methodism led Britain's social revival, fifty
years later.  But our driving religious impulse was Presbyterianism,
offering a kind of Calvinist <I>noblesse oblige</I>, which gave
the early Progressives their high sense of order, determinism
and drive.
<P>
So much of Britain's reform was mirrored in America's elite revival:
<P>
<U><I>Temperance</I></U><I>:</I>  British <I>Teetotalism</I> transmuted
into our own, <I>Prohibition</I>;
<P>
<U><I>Anti-serfdom</I></U><I>:</I>  Not only a kindred lineage
from Wilberforce [<I>the Brit who stopped the slave trade</I>]
to Abolition, but a stretching of the anti-slavery metaphor to
industrial labor;
<P>
<U><I>The Rule of Reason</I></U><I>:</I>  From Bentham [<I>such
a modern guy he had himself stuffed and put on display in London
U., the place he founded</I>] and Britain's university surge,
to a skyrocketing of American engineering [<I>see below</I>] Ph.D.'s,
just before the Progressive era;  and,
<P>
<U><I>Administration by the Engineer</I></U><I>:</I>  The great
fairs in St. Louis and Chicago presaged the Progressive new wave,
just as the Great Exhibition of 1850 gave physical symbolism to
a new sense of order in British society.  Both built their vision
of progress on the physical mastery of the engineer <I>[hence,
the easy glide to &quot;social engineering&quot;].</I>
<P>
The Progressive movement had achieved its goals by 1920.  The
two <U><I>Time</I></U> cover men of the new generation, smooth
bringers of enlightened government and managed society, were Bernard
Baruch and Herbert Hoover.  Their gaze locked to a cloudless future.
<P>
But the nature of labor could not be jammed into an ordered dream
society.  One problem was the decline in agricultural jobs.  Farm
labor still nearly equaled manufacturing in 1900:  13 million
manual [industrial and related] workers, vice 11 million farm
laborers.  The broad swathe of what was now called &quot;white
collar&quot; was still small, at 5 million. 
<P>
Progressives had carefully crafted a world celebrating the worker,
where every American -- <I>as worker </I>-- could manufacture
their own American Dream.  The new managers expected that farm
labor would plummet as mechanized agriculture advanced.
<P>
What they did not anticipate was a decline in assembly line jobs.
 Not only were fewer and fewer needed in agriculture, but fewer
and fewer were needed to make things.  The obvious response was
to coax demand to keep pace with manufacturing efficiency.  Gone
would be the late-century terror of slumps and industrial surplus.
 Some say that to do this the managers created a cult of consumerism,
of ever-growing demand, to keep the workers' world going.  Sly
Pied Pipers!
<P>
But the Progressives' all-knowing vision seemed to crack and totter
after 1929.  The spiral into all-consuming depression could not
be managed;  the movement had failed.  But Progressive elite society
was unfazed by crisis.  It responded by turning on, and demonizing
the small-<I>c</I> conservatives among its own, those who had
run America since 1920.  And Herbert Hoover, master engineer,
became the gaunt-eyed icon of a vision that had failed because
of its conservatism.  The vision was not wrong; it had simply
not gone far enough.
<P>
Bad old Republican progressives had blown it because they let
the chaos of the market continue, but they <I>sinned</I> in believing
that private institutions could keep order and stability through
mere mediation.  It was not enough, the <I>Renewed Progressive</I>
said, for enlightened government just to regulate and advise;
 the state should intervene in the actual workings of society,
in order to insure progress and stay future catastrophe.
<P>
FDR did not bring revolution;  he found a way to renew peoples'
trust in the old elite -- <I>with a new face</I>.  His <I>Brain
Trust</I> borrowed the nicest-sounding tidbits from European social
democrats, but stayed true to the original Progressives' Presbyterian
patterns, especially the <I>noblesse oblige</I> part.  <I>Renewed
Progressives</I> wanted real government management of society,
but stopped short of advocating government ownership.  Their role
models were not gods nor fathers, but headmasters and ministers.
 The whole nation was their classroom and congregation.  They
would make things better -- manage industry right, give social
welfare to all, and coax an equality of outcome in American life
-- by preaching and instructing.
<P>
This elite makeover made sense to Americans.  Then world war actually
renewed emotional ties between people and their elites.  And World
War Two was a rip-snorting celebration of socialism.  The state
took over all our energies -- <I>they owned them!</I> -- for four
years, and they gave us a great adventure in return.  When Americans
came out into the sun and promises of peace, they gave FDR's brand
of progress their full faith and trust.
<P>
But there was no going back to the fervid installment consumerism
of the 1920s.  <I>Boy, but we could make!</I>  American workers
-- many of them women -- made everything world war demanded with
ease.  <I>And this</I> <I>with 12 million workers in uniform,
off the assembly lines</I>.  Recognition hit, at the moment of
the workers' world's biggest win, that the US was no longer for
workers only.
<P>
But we were still pretty creative:  we countered with a new class
of managers.  And a big new labor sector called &quot;management
services&quot; met two needs.  It allowed the economy to increase
total work, rather than rationing it <I>[meaning fewer jobs and
more social welfare]</I>, or reducing it <I>[meaning fractional
jobs for all].</I>
<P>
And much of this new work came with higher status.  This meant
that most millions of Americans could tie &quot;a better life
for our children&quot; to a promotion in <I>class</I>.  The GI
Bill made college the subsidized brass ring of the common man,
and college for all made us all <I>[eventually]</I> middle class.
 Upward mobility for all of us! What a concept!
<P>
This outward and upward expansion of labor unleashed a people
just past depression and war.  Full of pent-up demand for goods,
and, equally, full of pent-up expectations.  The elite had found
a way to meet them both.  Their seductive shibboleth:
<P>
<I>&quot;The American Dream.&quot;</I>
<P>
<CENTER><B>*.*.*.*.*</B></CENTER>
<P>
<br>
<br>
<center>
<I><B>&quot;Gee, Wally ...&quot;</B></I>
</center>
<P>
The new order worked like a big block <I>Chevy 454</I>.  And many
continued to believe that enlightened Government and the GI Bill,
had helped make it work.  In the 1950s and 60's, at belief's crest,
75% of Americans thought Government should help manage society.
<P>
LBJs <I>Great Society</I> was the floodtide of our faith in government.
<P>
What had been achieved?  The United States was no longer a worker's
world, it was now a middle class world.  In 1948, two-thirds of
Americans identified themselves as &quot;working class.&quot;
 By the 1960s, most said instead, &quot;middle class.&quot;  The
early TV sitcoms etched an indelible portrait of idealized American
life, a mythology now gathered under the collective mantle of
 <I>Leave It to Beaver</I>. [As nostalgic, <I>Nick at Nite</I>
Yuppies rush to embrace old sitcoms, they lay bare the same Old
Order reflex to revolution as Keats and Shelley lamenting a lost
countryside, or readers of <I>Tom Sawyer</I> and <I>Huckleberry
Finn</I> the demise of small town America].
<P>
People now lived in what academics would call <I>&quot;the mature
variation&quot;</I> of the industrial network of cities.  We called
it <I>suburbia</I>.  Auto and interstates made its sprawl possible,
and the sprawl itself made possible the big upstairs move in status
[for most].  The tract house and its passionste sidekick, the
white picket fence, was the campaign ribbon of a better life that
kept close people and their elites.
<P>
This was the third stage of urban America:  its life cramming
first into the strip shopping center, and then hitting its brief,
glittering zenith with <I>Edge City</I>, The Great American Mall.
 It is the place we still inhabit.  It is the mature end state
of classic industrial society.  It is a world that made room for
too-efficient manufacturing by creating a new management class
and service economy that soaked up the spilling excess of labor.
<P>
It all peaked around 1970.  That year, there were 40 million industrial-related
workers, only 2 million on the farm, and 38 million white collars
in America.
<P>
The new elites had brought order out of the chaos of industrialization.
 Their assembly line world worked.  First they rooted meaning
in the worker, then grafted on this social sod a middle class
world of management and services, living off its harvest.
<P>
Education and entertainment showed how well-oiled it all was.
 Education had become a machine designed to socialize and prepare
workers for an assembly line world, and managers for a world of
<I>pyramid-climbing</I>.  And new entertainment technologies were
harnessed to please and pacify.  Movies, radio, and television
-- unlike vaudeville and opera -- were based on a detached, objectified
relationship between artist and audience, and encouraged far more
passivity than traditional theaters.  And passive people make
controlling people very happy.
<P>
But now, no matter how smooth its control, the elite worried about
how to split up the still-shrinking pool of jobs.  And by jobs,
they meant <I>real</I> jobs.  And in industrial iconography, 
<I>real jobs</I> = <U>manufacturing</U>.  Real jobs would go away
because of -- dread word of that day -- <I>automation</I>.
<P>
This fear was an elite commonplace:  you could catch it in Kurt
Vonnegut's <I>Cat's Cradle</I>, or in high-tone, hard-back rags
like <I>Horizon</I>.  Look at Dennis Gabor's &quot;The Perils
of Leisure,&quot; from the Summer, 1964 issue -- the warm apogee
of the Great Society.  Productivity says Gabor, keeps growing
in the industrial world at a steady <I>x</I> percent, so high
that no social welfare spending can outpace it.  Eventually, said
the trendline, only the privileged would work.  The article's
substance, in fact, is in its opening cartoon, by David Levine.
 First, we see the bad old days, with working people in harness,
pulling a cigar-corpulent plutocrat on a wheeled palanquin.  Then,
we see tomorrow:  with happy mill workers playing cards on that
same, cushy float;  pulled now by three dapper, winking, Harvard
engineers.
<P>
The end of work itself was in sight:
<P>
<blockquote>
<I>For the first time in history we are now faced with the possibility
of a world in which only a gifted minority need work, to keep
the great majority in idle luxury.</I>
</blockquote>
<P>
This scene of the story ends here, in the mid-1960s, with elite
certainty that the engineering ethos -- managing the human condition
-- had triumphed.  The only problem they saw:  only the engineers
would have jobs.
<P>
But they were wrong.  Totally wrong.
<P>
How could they have been so far off the mark?
<P>
They took a straight line -- or like Gabor, just fondly cited
it as ever-truth -- and pushed it out.  All else stayed constant.
 What they overlooked, <I>or perhaps could not bring themselves
to believe</I>, was that human imagination itself was about to
change how the world worked.  New wealth and new jobs would be
created out of nothing:  <U><I>by creating new demand</I></U>.
 
<P>
This demand would be like the new demand created more than a century
before, at the beginning of industrial revolution.  The irony
for the now-aging elite was that their very success encouraged
innovation that would shake their world apart.  The Progressive
elites of late-20th century America made for themselves the same
predicament as the landed gentry of late-18th century Britain.
 Their wealth and ethos of improvement unwittingly set in train
the industrial revolution that would unseat them.
<P>
And this, Ladies and Gentlemen, is the roller-coaster of <I>our</I>
revolution heading toward its first plunge:

<P>
&quot;Discovery&quot; means a burn-jump:  flash-link idea to technology.
 But we can't do that.  It's still too hard if Flashy ads can
trumpet TV [!!!] <I>as the future</I>.
<P>
<I><B>Humbug!</B></I>  We could demo the virtu-screen <I><B>&amp;</B></I>
Byte City <U>in five years</U>.
<P>
But maybe it doesn't matter whether we see, because we are stumbling
blind toward Byte City anyway through Big Money.  The coalitions
that will build Byte City have just been made.
<P>
And the big combos aren't waiting for the idea.  These are the
big alliances, the merging of corporate muscle in <I>tele-communications</I>
-- Bell South, Bell Atlantic, MCI -- with <I>entertainment </I>--
Disney, Time Warner -- with <I>software</I> -- Apple, Microsoft,
IBM -- and with the big <I>Cable</I> companies.  More than enough
to make <I>Byte City</I> happen ... when they finally figure it
out.
<P>
It doesn't matter that they are still fumbling with stagecoach
metaphors, when the railroad is waiting to be built.  It doesn't
matter that they still speak the language of <I>computer</I> and
<I>TV</I> and <I>telephone</I> and <I>Information Superhighway</I>
... when each one of these tools is poised on the crumbling edge
of historical oblivion.  It doesn't matter, because
<P>
Byte City, the rollercoaster rush to revolution, awaits, simply,
its own 
<P><I>Logos</I>, 
<br><B>The Word.</B>
<P>
The network of Byte Cities will be constructed on top of the on-line
services' road network that exists today.  We still think of <I>The
Net</I> as a communications mesh, but it is really a transportation
network.  It will be like the railroad of the last century because
it will do the same thing the railroads did to our lives.  But
instead of a physical locomotive, taking us to the city, the virtu-screen
will be a <I>virtual</I> engine, bringing the city to us.
<P>
We are only perhaps 20 years away from living, and working, in
the virtual public square of Byte City.  And when it hits us,
its power to entrance will be irresistible, but just as irresistibly,
it will disrupt the inherited rhythm of our lives.
<P>
Keep in mind that this will be nothing like looking at a television,
no matter how big the TV image gets.  Marshall McLuhan told us
that TV was a &quot;cool&quot; medium, because the screen was
always in the way, scratching at our emotional bond with the moving
imagery on it.  The interface was the emotional distance that
diminishes TV &quot;reality.&quot;
<P>
The wall-high virtu-screen parts ways with all of its vacuum-tube
progenitors because
<P>
<I>There is no interface.</I>
<P>
It is not only big like a movie screen, it has the picture fidelity
of life.  High-definition, digital imagery is <I>here</I>, but
the truly life-like is <I>there</I>, only a few years away.  You
will not hit the pavement of Byte City streets, but you will walk
the sidewalks none the less.
<P>
You will appear on those streets, visible to others, in a simulated
form:  a digital composite.  Most, surely, you will also appear
in slightly <I>[or highly!]</I> idealized form.  A whole service
niche will spring up, like the Pinkertons of the last century,
to verify that those we meet in Byte City are who they say they
are ... Countering <I>[of course!]</I> the artistry of an even
bigger new niche, the persona-<I>couturiers</I>;  from <I>haute</I>
to almost off-the-rack.
<P>
In fact, demand for a yet-unimagined range of services will surge
to meet the needs of this fabulous, overwhelming, new urban world.
 There will be so much to do, so much that one wants to do, that
our sense of <I>needs</I> will be wrestling with almost constant
redefinition.  Is it so different now?  <I>I <U>need</U> that
new computer?</I>  Really.  Just take that urge up an order of
magnitude.
<P>
You will work there, you will want to play there, you can do <I>[almost]</I>
everything there.  And each of the Byte Cities -- some big, some
very intimate -- will savagely compete for your time and your
precious subscription.
<P>
But one thing they will not compete for, one thing they will all
strive actively to assuage, will be the eventual <I>anomie</I>
they spread, seeping into our spirits even as we work and cavort
in the cool, passionate swirl of neon and gilded <I>chiaroscuro</I>.
<P>
Because it will change the way we relate to people.  Think about
it:  If you can meet with anyone, anywhere, any time, interact
with them, do anything with them -- immediately, intimately, but
<I>virtually</I> -- the potential for initial social disruption
is as great as that visited on the flood of urban migrants to
the brick cities of smokestacks and furnaces that scarred England
two centuries ago.
<P>
Those cities physically threw people together.  Our revolution
will also throw people together, but the impact of intimacy --
for work or play -- without barriers of time and space, will stretch
and stress our social patterns to the limit.
<P>
How will it do this?  Let's look at three torquings of necessary
intimacy:

<P>
keep us tribally blooded.  Not with the band, out for the hunt,
but in a theater of its training.  Sports is our ritual connection
to the tribe working together for survival, seeking great elk
kills.  Sports takes us back to origins, keeping our oldest identity
alive.
<P>
But sports changes to fit new worlds of work.  And sports is not
like work, sports is not for work.  Sports gives us things that
new worlds of work take away.  So when mill and assembly line
made us stand all day, sports let us sit down.  Baseball is America's
industrial sport, the theater that let a tired worker sit down
in the cool evening, have a beer, and watch them play ball.. 
Watching is as important as playing;  they are both equal parts
of the ritual sharing, because in a mass society, if the hunt
is to be tribally shared, the theater must encompass all.  Hence
the 100,000 Bowl, a stadium for the whole <I>polis</I>;  or <I>Monday
Night Football</I>, for the biggest tribe of all.  <I>Nation</I>
meant tribe for the Romans, and nation came from the verb, <I>to
be born</I>.
<P>
But Byte City forces us to get outside and play.  Now we work
in our own cells, we labor without moving, we sweat virtually.
 That vast virtu-screen becomes our master, we long for escape.
 Our urge to feel the primitive overwhelms us.  Forget baseball,
football, basketball, all the ball-pushing million-dollar heroes
do for us -- we want to get out.  Today, in places like Moab,
Utah, yuppie precursors of the new world of work sit all day in
front of their vacuum tubes, longing for the five-hour, four-wheel
drive that will take them to some wind-scarred escarpment where
they can hang-glide, or kayak-surf, or snowboard to within a fingernail's
proximity of themselves, the once-Magdelian hunter, in that very
place, an elk and a glacier ago.
<P>
<br>
<CENTER><I><B>Speech</B></I></CENTER>
<P>
is more than how we talk.  It's about the identity we get from
how we talk.  Old Order types talk in writing, and they lament
what they call the end of literacy.  Whining:  <I>When people
stop writing, the greatest glory of human expression will die,
and with it, the heart of civilization itself.</I>
<P>
But the death of Old Order writing is the rebirth of our language.
 The death prose we now call <I>the written word</I> was once
alive with current.  When Samuel Johnson bleu stronge with so
grayte a noyse, written English was vital, rich, hot-blooded.
 We didn't even know how to spell until well into the 19th century:
<P>
Until well into the industrial era.  After the revolution.  The
new elites may have brought order, but they also brought formality,
control.  Over the last century, the enlightened elite wrung the
spirit out of language.  Bureaucrats made rigid the written word,
larded it with rules, a bid to control thought itself.  In industrial
end-times, <I>Elitespeak</I> is unreadable.  <I>Elitespeak</I>
is not for giving a message; it is for hiding it.  It is <I>anti-language</I>.
<P>
But now, as we lose our &quot;literacy,&quot; we liberate our
tongues.  New ways of telling fit new values to be told, all spoken
in a new place.  And telling it affirms what we are, as it overturns
what we are not.  So as we speak the truth, song returns to speech.
 And as we make new landscape heroic in virtual expanse, we come
back to Homeric, Hip-Hop cadence.  New language, new connection,
new message.
<P>
<br>
<CENTER><I><B>Sex</B></I></CENTER>
<P>
is to society what C4 is to civil engineering:  it is elemental
both to creation and to destruction.  That is why all cultures
work hard to harness sex, to make it celebrate and reinforce society
... because it also has the power to tear away at it.  Modern
lore remembers two tearing times:  the libertine French Revolution
[as in <I>Marat-Sade</I>:  &quot;What's the use of a revolution
without general copulation?&quot;], and the more widespread wildfire
of &quot;liberated,&quot; pre-AIDS America:  1790s, 1970s.  Neither
lasted long.
<P>
Byte City does not promote uncontrolled sex, it merely removes
the controls.  Remember, you can meet anyone, anywhere, anytime.
 And whatever you do is free of consequences.  Byte City's most
obvious limitation is also its biggest draw:  you can't actually
touch anyone, so no one gets hurt. <I> Physically</I>.  Old style,
uncontrolled sex meant a river of consequences:  unwanted births,
incurable diseases, collateral crimes aplenty, and marital mayhem.
 None of these would attain in <I>Byte City</I>, the ultimate
terminus of protected, vicarious, unbridled sex.
<P>
No culture has ever been offered such a painless feast.  No culture
has ever had its ethos so tested.  Culture controls sex by linking
it indissoluably to love.  Promiscuity requires cruel manipulation
of others while zeroing out love;  even in a society where sex
is available, only a few can sustain the drain on persona that
promiscuity demands.  Byte City's sexual <I>smorgasbord</I> makes
no such demands.
<P>
Everybody can do it:  we feel no pain, no pain is inflicted, identity
is hidden, and fantasex is limited only by mind and by byte.
<P>
But there is a fee.  This is real sex, and there will be consequences.
 How overwhelming?  Look at the constant pushing of the envelope
in on-line sex right now;  but this is nothing to the pulsing
explosion to come.  Baroque paraphernalia will be like quaaludes
in the high-quest:  virtual reality armor and implants, real-time
video changelings for digital personae, and wild, wild metamorphoses.
<P>
Morph sex itself will stretch us, in the end, back to ourselves.
 At that final limit, so far beyond what physical sex restrains,
the very terror we will feel will be in our own reflection;  in
what we have become.
<P>
<CENTER><B>*.*.*.*.*</B></CENTER>
<P>
<br>
<br>
<I><B>And</B></I> the free-wheeling, almost frontier spirit of
Byte City will push the <I>coming apart</I> we all feel is tearing
at American society.  When historians look back on this period,
perhaps they will shake their heads, thinking the clich&eacute;
of all historians:  <I>Couldn't they see it?  It was so obvious:
 the breakdown in family life, the 60% illegitimacy rates of the
early 1990s ... these were just the heralds of things to come?</I>
<P>
But people feel what is coming, even if their elite officially
denies it.  The elite denies by redefining the <I>tsunami</I>
to suit its own needs, even as the wave rises over them:  <I>A
changing labor force?  We can solve that with another federal
jobs retraining program</I>.  People are more honest;  they feel
the revolution's rumble in their guts.
<P>
Because they know the comfort of mature industrial times, the
apparent orderliness of a work force half-maker, half-manager,
has been eroding away for two decades.  But the erosion doesn't
stop;  it accelerates.  The industrial world is going away.
<P>
What does work -- and the identity work brings -- look like in
Byte City?
<P>
Say we end up in this world by 2020.  Byte City -- the new economy
-- will live on ideas.  If ideas are really the currency, if ideas
are really what make things happen, then <I>making it</I> will
be even more meritocratic than it is now.
<P>
It won't be enough to have a college degree from Yale and announce:
 <I>I'm Wolf's Head, <U>cum laude</U>, make me a Foreign Service
Officer</I> -- or some other bureaucratic lifestyle slot.  Or
-- <I>I rate a fat niche on the corporate pyramid at IBM</I>.
 No.  All job worth must be proven in Byte City.  Only a very
few will make it to the ether either ... and Murray's <I>Bell
Curve</I> won't be the best litmus test for their success.  I.Q.
measures what's in the box, but <B>Brain Lords</B> are made by
going out of the box.  That's what Byte City will thrive on, and
that's why they are the great winners, initially, in this world.
<P>
Brain Lords are not like the Robber Barons, nor their enlightened
engineer successors, the <I>Brain Trust</I>.  They are not empire-builders,
like Carnegie, nor do they wish to be managers of millions, like
Ira Magaziner.  Their goal is not control of others.  They seek
realization within their persons, like ancient heroes:  where
their brain power is like the strength and speed of Achilles.
 Tom Wolfe called them, wryly,<I> &quot;Masters of the Universe.&quot;</I>
 Milken, Gates, Spielberg:  they are the Achilles of Smart.
<P>
Yet the brain lords will not represent a heritable class.  They
will make it as individuals, and most of them will make it only
for a brief time.  Burn-out will be their limiting factor.  Like
their prototypes today in entertainment and the media, they will
use up their personal capital quickly.  The top job niche will
emphasize golden parachutes aplenty, with more relaxing work to
follow a forties' retirement.
<P>
Still successful, still needed, will be the <B>Upper Server</B>
society.  Lawyers and doctors will still make big money, but their
top echelon status will be undercut by a wholly new job persona:
 the Agent.
<P>
<B>Agents </B>will be the individual entrepreneur class, those
who offer tailored information services -- including law and medicine
and education! -- in Byte City.  Many in what we still call &quot;the
professions&quot; will squat in this niche.  The rising class
of personal information-providers and navigators will put real
downward social pressure on doctors and lawyers and academics,
because agents will get you -- or take you to -- the knowledge
you need, without a defilingly expensive appointment with the
almighty.
<P>
And maybe 10 percent of the workforce stays in production, whether
it's growing food or whether it's making things.  And they will
form a sort of upper tier themselves.  Because of the highly specialized
skills required to be a new manufacturer, <B>Makers</B> will usually
be part owners of their firms.
<P>
So say about 25 percent are doing well, very well.  And, given
the corrosion and damage to the young in illegitimate and single-parent
households today;  tomorrow's labor force will include a bottom,
an underclass, also about 25%.  This, tragically, will be double
the population share of those discarded in the bad old industrial
era.  These are <B>The Lost</B>;  and in revolutionary times,
societies have shown little inclination to find them.
<P>
And they can be sustained, as they are now, by the great wealth
unlocked by Byte City.  They can be sustained, but they can't
be ignored.  Those who bring order from the chaos of things to
come, those who come after us, will very likely make the rediscovery
of the lost their great task, just as the Victorians and the Progressives
in their day sought out the poor.
<P>
But what will the rest of us, the 50 percent in the middle, the
bedrock of the industrial world's great &quot;Middle Class;&quot;
 the true believers in &quot;The American Dream;&quot;  <I>what
will we do?</I>
<P>
Old Order, New Deal elitists still think that there won't be anything
to do.  Jeremy Rivkin's new book, <I>The End of Work</I>, rehashes
the old lie of the engineer class:  there is only so much that
can be produced, so as the work force gets more productive, there
will be fewer and fewer jobs.  And eventually, there won't be
any work anymore.  Let us, the enlightened engineers of the elite,
apportion work <I>equitably</I> [meaning:  <I>as we see fit</I>].
<P>
We know <I>[Oh! How we know!]</I> that this just isn't true. 
The mountainous evidence is everywhere about us.  Demand creates
wealth;  the industrial revolution created a whole new universe
of demand.  Look at the personal computer.  <I>Demand=Wealth</I>;
 created out of nothing, out of the thin air of an idea!
<P>
There will be plenty of jobs in Byte City.
<P>
There will be plenty of money.  The question is:  What status
will these jobs have?  Of all the old badges, the four-year college
degree will be the most worthless.  People still think:  <I>I
have a college degree, I can be in middle management and rise
to the top if I'm good; I can do it</I>.  That is the motivational
mythology of the industrial age.  It is a blind guide to tomorrow.
<P>
Work in Byte City is all about service.  And the bulk of work
will be in maintenance, sales, support, and delivery.  Like video
game advisors, telling you how to get through <I>Donkey Kong in
Paris</I>, or getting you those perfect tomato cubes from the
Safeway <I>Casbah </I>local warehouse, or showing you wares in
the Woolworth Palace in Mainstreet, USA, or fixing a damaged local
fiber optic line for an Opreyville subscriber, or working up a
new simulated persona for a customer who wants to make a splash
as Conan in <I>Dirty</I> <I>Rita's Party Place</I>.
<P>
A chilling possibility is this comeback of service.  But that
trend today is in full flood.  At least in Byte City, most of
us are serving each other.
<P>
The problem -- <I>always</I> -- is status.  Like those new workers
in the early industrial era, those in the mills and furnaces were
not offered the status of the craftsman they replaced.  They were
pushed to the limit, because there were no limits yet defined.
 They were abused because their undefined status did not culturally
protect them.
<P>
We, the majority, the 50 percent who will make Byte City work,
will go to work in our living rooms <I>[or even, closeted in our
bedrooms]</I> before the big screen, and we will suffer much the
same stripping of self as that majority entering the Midlands
milltowns of 1820 or the East Side sweatshops of 1880.  Already
Americans are working longer and longer hours.  Can you imagine
-- with &quot;<I>global competition&quot;</I> as the excuse --
people in Byte City standing in front of their screens, working
their customers, 12, 15 hours a day?  And with an end to commuting
for many, the Brain Lords will say, S<I>o much the more time to
work</I>.  <I>And you're working at home, right?</I>
<P>
So all this talk about class is upsetting?  Americans don't like
the word:  the elite don't want to be likened to Euristocrats;
 the rest of us don't want to be reminded that The People are
not in charge.  Or maybe just that we didn't <I>make it</I>.
<P>
Class in America is always there, and it rises right to the surface
of our thinking during Big Change.  Why?  Because those driving
change also seize its opportunities.  While old elites topple
and gutter-slide, the new are in chic media worship.  They are
<U>what's happening</U>, we are <U>what is done <I>to</I></U>.
 So while our lives are in free fall, they float, majestically,
in the ether of the new world.
<P>
But what we will see as the new class won't have any of its ancestors'
levers of control.  First it was land, then commodities, then
&quot;the means of production.&quot;  In this this century it
has been knowledge.  The mature industrial world was run by bureaucratic
machine.  And what was that?  It was a pyramid of professionals,
managers, engineers:  these were the noble titles of the twentieth
century's equestrian order of knowledge.  Control of knowledge
was power, and access to knowledge was carefully controlled.
<P>
No one will control knowledge in Byte City.  The new class will
only appear to us as swaggering Brain Lords; we will assume that
they are the new masters of the universe, Robber Barons reborn.
 Their moment will be even more evanescent than in industrial
times.  After the Big Change, when it all shakes down, Byte City
may be a place for Big Men, but not for Lords.  But during the
rollicking, roughshod rollercoaster wavetime, the Brain Lords
will be the riders of the transformation, the ones scoring big,
the arrogant makers and high rollers.  And because they are the
first to benefit big from the revolution, while its impact is
still crashing down on us, we will vent on them.
<P>
Because we will identify the new elites with the whole change,
<I>bad and good</I>.  And because they break the old but then
themselves do not lead, we at last despise them.  We flock to
their network, but then, as we live and work there, Byte City
becomes ours:  a public square, a community of many neighborhoods.
 And we will want a different vision of life in this place.
<P>
So the time will come, soon after the network is built, when we
will, as those before us, demand new meaning.
<P>
And we will find it along two paths unexpectedly familiar:  politics,
and religion.
<P>
The industrial world threw people together.  Their physical closeness,
<I>en masse</I>, allowed people to mobilize politically <I>en
masse</I>.  And they did.  And that was the birth of mass, plebiscitary
democracy.
<P>
But Byte City lets us escape the faceless experience of mass democracy.
 People today are rejecting machine politics because they sense
that the new tools of social connection, the very tools that will
soon fuse into Byte City, will give them the voice to speak decisively
in all decision-making;  and not, this time, in instant mass telephony
-- button-pushing robot Perotistas -- <U>but through thousands
of interest groups and factions.</U>
<P>
Byte City returns us to politics as The Founders meant it to be.
 But politics then -- <I>say, in 1800</I> -- were for a few thousands
of Americans only.  Byte City will let millions of civically motivated
citizens meet, and caucus, and <I>politick</I>:  anywhere, anytime.
<P>
And they will demand directly.  We can only marvel in advance
at the political turbulence that lies in wait.  <I>What will we
do with all those factions?</I>
<P>
Because Americans want unity too.  They want that mythic togetherness,
like a Raoul Walsh war film or a John Ford western 
<P>
<I>Around her neck, she wore a yellow ribbon,</I>
<br>
<I>She wore it in the springtime, and in the month of May,</I>
<br>
<I>And when I asked her, why the hell she wore it,</I>
<br>
<I>She wore it for her sweetheart in the US Cavalry ...</I>
<P>
American togetherness is slipping away.  Where can it be found
again?
<P>
Maybe in our search for meaning in Faith.  Byte City will open
up new communities of faith as we struggle with disorder in our
lives, and especially, a fracturing of how we relate to others.
 Byte City will redefine words like <I>temptation</I>, <I>abandonment</I>,
<I>anomie</I>.  What will be the basis for connection, for commitment?
 To whom will we owe allegiance, in whom can we repose our trust?
<P>
Byte City's very nature brings a breaking-down of secular society.
<P>
And out of the rootlessness and freaky chaos will come religious
revivals.  But they will not emerge from the Old Order <I>Mainline</I>
Churches -- <I>those bastions of the elite</I> -- nor from the
Evangelical patent-leather bureaucracies that have risen to such
estate in recent years.
<P>
Why <I>patent-leather</I>?  Because to fight the elite society
of the modern state, elite evangelicals organized themselves on
the same lines.  They learned the same machine politics, and they
crafted an agenda of state control.  This time, their state. 
They became the very Church their own prophets had once fled from.
 They became the very image of the thing they fought against.
 Now their <I>tele-ministries</I> and <I>coalitions</I> are full
partners in the Old Order landscape of squabbling necropoli.
<P>
<I>Cities of the Dead</I>.  The new cities are coming, and with
them, a maw of <I>anomie</I>.  The new revival will come as a
calling:  of people rising up.  It will be the evangelism that
meets spiritual crisis head-on, that is witnessed in the new wilderness
by those who speak the truth and give good news.  And the message
will meet the times.  It will not look backward, like the anti-progressive
Old Order, to some nostalgic golden age that we can get back to
if only we have the right regulatory structure, or pass the right
laws, or ... 
<P>
The next <I>Great Awakening</I> will happen in Byte City itself.
 Maybe many sects, hot competition, fighting over their skyrocketing
convert-count.  Yet chances are that it will rise from the grassroots
Of Catholic and Protestant evangalism, like Methodism did two
centuries ago.  And maybe like Methodism, a single vision will
sweep over us.  But the revival itself will meet a great wave
of national emotion.  And [<I>when it comes</I>] its talk will
be the center of our search for new American life.
<P>
[<I>Important!  It won't look like any ad on today's Religion
page!</I>]
<P>
That is why <I>how</I> Methodism came to Britain is what we need
to know, not that it was <I>Methodist</I>.  It came.  We need
to know why it came, because we are in for the same ride.  The
cultural paradox for us at the end of <I>The Modern</I> is that
religion didn't go away.  It's going to be more important.  Just
different.  And whatever it looks like, how we find faith will
be a big part of the way we join hands civically as Americans.
<P>
And what we demand, and how we demand it, will determine who rises
to give demand leadership and vision.  We can say with certainty
that it cannot come from the dying old order:  both deathbed <I>New
Dealers</I> and but slightly less moribund <I>New Democrats</I>.
 And we suspect that it will<U><I> not</I></U> come from the cocky
Brain Lords who build Byte City <I>[but we need them to build
it!].</I>
<P>
But we should know that the Brain Lords <I>will </I>build it,
and that it <I>will</I> change our lives forever.  We know further,
in spite of Social Democracy's sentimental gurglings, that the
future cannot be managed, nor its reality held back.
<P>
But we should comfort ourselves in the knowledge also that these
things have happened before.  Others survived their time of stress,
dislocation, and <I>anomie</I>.  Britain made it through its crisis
to a world that would later be enshrined by us [in <I>Sherlock
Holmes</I>, <I>Upstairs, Downstairs</I>] as among the best of
good times.  And the United States made it through its crisis
to a similar happy place in the American mind [in <I>Meet Me in
St. Louis, Easter Parade</I>].  Crisis was succeeded by a spirit
of confidence and of hope, and a reassertion of the inevitability,
and ultimate good, of Progress.
<P>
<I>How will it happen?  How will we get to these good times?</I>
<P>
That's another story.

<h2><I><B>The War After Byte City</B></I> </h2>
<P>
by <a href="/pff/people/sfellow.html#Vlahos">Michael Vlahos</a>
<PRE>
It was the greatest military power of its day.
Always the innovator, its technologies of war
		were the newest,
Its command &amp; control the best of the best.
Its ability to mobilize national resources
		was matchless,
Its traditions the envy and admiration of all;
And surely, imitated by all.
It was the world's military superpower,
And it owned war.

But now peace was everywhere.
Its great armies, mobilized for decades,
		were drawn down
What had been the center of grand strategy,
		the cockpit: Central Europe,
Was now a portrait of like-minded states.

So the great nation refocused,
Turning its military toward new roles.
It built a mobile deterrent force:
A rapidly deployable army that could be rushed
To quell a regional contingency (or two!),
		and restore stability.
It reshaped its military forces
Around a core, professional force,
That could be used flexibly to achieve
		the larger, strategic goal:
The preservation of a stable world system.


Of course, I describe France in 1860.
</PRE>
<P>
But there is something familiar there for us. Like France then,
we are today's <I>grande nation</I>. And we have been there for
awhile in this American century. Like France then, American culture
has set world fashion, and our English is the world language.
And we too seem set now in a long peace.
<P>
Does a passing historical resemblance tell us anything about the
future of our own national security, or the future of war itself?
And if France may have been, like us, the military superpower
of that era: <I>they were the defeated superpower in 1815.</I>

<P>
True. Yet in the long peace after the wars of Napoleon, France
regained a military preeminence only briefly lost at Waterloo.
By 1860, France again seemed astride the earth like a god of war:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Who wrote the doctrine of war everyone used? Henri Jomini.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Who was the innovator: The first breechloading rifle - the
<I>Chassepot</I> - the first shell gun - the <I>Paixhans</I> -
the first machine gun - the <I>Mitrailleuse</I> - the first ironclad
battleship - the <I>Gloire</I>?
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Whose army had real global reach? With successful offensive
&amp; peacekeeeping operations just recently concluded in Spain,
Italy, Algeria, the Crimea, and soon, even Mexico too?
</UL>
<P>
France in mid-century was a world power, using its military power
to balance and manage world order. France was pledged to preserving
a world system and nearly fifty years of stability. Like the US
today, France in 1860 was the <I>status quo</I> power ...
<P>
In a world where the <I>status quo</I>, stability, and the old
system itself ... Was about to end.
<P>
<I>And end they would in a big bang for France.</I> 
<P>
Ten years later, the <I>grande nation</I> would begin an historical
reeling from which it would never recover. War with the German
Federation would humiliate the French, destroy their reputation
for war forever, and end also their long certainty of national
greatness. <B>1</B> 
<P>
This could never happen to us. <I>Of course not</I>. Like all
analogies, this one is imperfect, and in mixing military metaphors,
manipulative even. <I>Of course</I>. But as different as they
are, two times and two peoples and two ways of war, France then
and the US now share the same strategic problem.
<P>
Big Change.
<P>
France didn't lose in 1871 because it was stupid or unlucky. Certainly,
its war technologies and combat experience were superior to Germany's.
<P>
France lost in 1871 because a revolution had swept Europe. And
that revolution changed war. But the French military and their
ruling national elites had not kept up. They had missed the revolution
in war.
<P>
But if you could go back to 1860 and tell this to French ruling
elites, they would be offended. They would protest: <I> &quot;We
have the world's most modern military machine. Look at our record
of innovation: superior French science and engineering has changed
the face of war!&quot; </I>And so everyone thought. You could
see it in every newspaper - just look at Daumier's grisly cartoon,
<I>Triumph of the Needle Gun. </I>New gun, new ship, new war.
<P>
If you went back and talked about a revolution in war, people
would nod their heads. <I>Yes, there is a revolution: the ironclad
revolution at sea, and the breechloading rifle - Chassepot and
Needle Gun - on land. Yes. These are revolutionary weapons</I>.
<P>
Everyone thought that revolutions in war are about new weapons.
<P>
But it was the big change in ordinary life, the life of people
in society, that had changed war. The new artifacts of daily life
were the bringers of revolution in war ... Like the railroad.
The railroad was the tool of Europe's transformation, the agent
at the heart of industrial revolution. The railroad had brought
whole pastoral worlds to the new cities of brick and iron.
<P>
And the railroad could also bring whole age cohorts of young men
to the new killing grounds of the needle gun. Between 1815 and
1870, industrial society created industrial war: war by mobilization,
war by train timetable. But in 1860, that war had not yet been
fought. It was still theory in the mind of Moltke. New war had
been enabled, but not enacted. France's elites were free for a
while yet to pursue old wars with modern cosmetics, wars still
won by quick offensive maneuver and long-service veterans, without
apprehension that this way of war was already dead.
<P>
And they could still believe the future of war was theirs: as
long as they stayed ahead of all others in weapons' technology,
and kept their warrior ethos stoked hot. There were no worries
here.
<P>
<B>This is the point of comparison:</B> 
<P>
We are in the midst of an economic upheaval equivalent to the
industrial revolution <I>in its capacity to transform our lives</I>.
And like the industrial revolution, this metamorphosis will reach
up to politics and to war, and remake them as well.
<P>
But America's ruling elites have defined a world system that does
not allow for the possibility of Big Change. Like the French plutocrats
of the 1850s, the old, Cold War establishment is pledged to preserve
the old paradigm at all costs. They define the US as the <I>status
quo</I> power, their sacred word is <I>stability</I>, and their
imperative verb is <I>to manage</I>.
<P>
And the military component of this ruling class sees American
military power as the ultimate world management tool. War is defined
as combat operations in pursuit of stability. Some in the national
security sub-culture talk quietly about a revolution in war. But
they describe this revolution like the French military innovators
of the 1850s: a revolution in weapons.
<P>
<B>This, then, is the hypothesis:</B> 

<P><UL>
<LI>The world economic revolution is true Big Change: what old
German philosophers would call a <I>phenomenon of world-historical
significance</I>. As it transforms individual societies across
the world, it changes the very patterns of relationship between
societies - what we call the world system. And so economic revolution
changes the world system as well as the world's societies. But
here, change comes first as systemic breakdown. New norms - perhaps
a new system - will evolve later.
</UL>
<P>

<UL>
<LI>Economic revolution will bring upheaval to world cultures
as old ways of life are torn apart. Upheaval will encourage new
belief systems, as people seek new meaning out of the shock of
Big Change. But change will hit different peoples in different
ways. Culture and environment will shape different demand for
new meaning around the world. New bodies of meaning that arise
- whether we call these religions or ideologies - will look different,
act different, and, most important, see big differences between
each other. New differences will lead to new human conflict.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>New war will serve the needs of new meaning. And the new ideologies
and religions born of economic revolution will use the new tools
of revolution to win. Industrial war used the new tools of railroad
and telegraph, assembly line and spreadsheet to serve the war
visions of the new ideologies: mass democracy and its competing
<I>-isms</I>. New war will be as determined, and as opportunistic.
And new meaning will have no ties to old war.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>But we, the <I>status quo</I> power, greatest of the old powers,
will not only still be fighting old war, we will still be <I>thinking</I>
old war. The successful bureaucracies of old war will continue
to refight old victories, and continue to dress future combat
in the cool desert camo of far battles long won. And we will still
have the world's best high-tech, and our people will have the
combat experience and the military professionalism. But our mythic
reputation, first built on a good war fought eight or nine decades
ago, will be both our glory and our curse.
</UL>

<P>
And we will await our Sedan.
<P>
Let's look at this bundled hypothesis point-by-point.
<P>

<I><B>A Time of Upheaval</B></I> 
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>Discontinuous Change a Surprise to US</I> 
</UL>

<P>
Of all world cultures, America believes in the sacredness of progress.
We like to say that this has been <I>A Century of Progress</I>:
meaning, by implication, that progress is a gradual, incremental
thing, accommodating itself to the world it finds, changing it
in polite if not always comfortable ways, giving us time to familiarize
ourselves with the new. Every wrench has been buffered by its
careful insertion into our lives. We didn't jump from Vaudeville
to color TV. It took decades.
<P>
Yet this is not a time of progress. Rather, it is a time of revolution.
Change, instead of stretching the fabric of reality, is about
to rip the canvas. But we are not prepared to see revolution for
what it is.
<P>
Part of our problem is that we have disarmed our own language.
In our vision of progress, we have used the word <I>revolution</I>
as a commonplace. It has been used as an accent, a spicing for
product debuts: Television was a revolution, the Atomic Bomb was
a revolution; and so the jet plane, then the VCR, Dolby sound,
and the microwave oven. These were products that amplified, and
altered, our lives, but in no way did any of them fundamentally
change our <I>way of life</I>.
<P>
We have forgotten what revolution is. And we are about to be reminded.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>The Second Surprise: It's Our Own Doing</I> 
</UL>

<P>
The Big Change isn't happening out there. We are making it happen
right here. We are bringing discontinuous change to ourselves.
<P>
The US, the premiere <I>status quo</I> power, is now that very
<I>status quo</I>'s undoing. We are the dynamic force actively
dismantling the old paradigm, the old world system,
<P>
<B>We are the system breaker.</B> 
<P>
<I>How's that?</I> 
<P>
We are the makers of revolution, like Britain's self-made industrial
revolution of the last century. We are bringing the new railroad
to American life, and like the railroad, our new net will transform,
first our lives, and then the life of the world.
<P>
As the railroad created a new network of cities and an urban,
industrial society, so this new network <I>[or the net after the
net after today's worldwide web] </I>that we are laying will replace
the urban, industrial world with a new city, a new gathering place
for American life <I>[what I call]</I> 
<P>
<B>Byte City.</B> 
<UL>
<LI><I>What does this mean?</I> 

<P>
<center><i>It means this for American business, and the American way of
life:</i> </center>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>There will be no distance - as well as no time - to transactions.
This happening now <I>[don't even ask!].</I> 
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>And there will be no distance, no time barriers as well to
meeting and working in Byte City. You will be able to meet anyone,
anywhere, anytime, with the fidelity of digitized life. It won't
be video-conferencing, and it won't require headgear.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>There will be a new standard of value, defined by the marketplace.
People will set value for knowledge. Directly, person-to-person.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The pressure for openness and transparency of transaction
will be absolute.
</UL>
</ul>
<P>
And this makes a new economy, built on knowledge services.
<br>
There is an explosion of productivity.
<br>
There is a whole new workforce.
<br>
And work takes on wholly new patterns <I>[commuting dies, for
example].</I> 
<P>
It is a new way of life for most Americans.
<P>
But there is also an end to the old workforce, and to the old
job ways, the old rhythms of life built around manufacturing,
and the servicing of the machine.
<P>
This means dislocation, anxiety, fear of the future.
<br>
And this is happening right now.
<P>
But it will get much worse.
<br>
Many will do very well in this new world, as they are right now,
<br>
But many will not.
<P>
We are in the beginning of an upheaval the likes of which we have
never known. Nor have our parents, nor theirs, nor theirs.
<P>
<CENTER><i>It means this for American politics:</i> </CENTER>
<P>
The last Big Change overthrew not just regular people's way of
life, but how all life was organized. How whole countries were
ruled. As millions of Americans find themselves in the fearful,
rollicking slide of Big Change, stripped of old meaning, they
will demand new meaning:
<P>
<blockquote>
<I>What is my status in society? How do I belong? What is my worth?
What kind of life can I expect for my family, what kind of future
for my children?</I> 
</blockquote
<P>
These questions, when asked collectively, will tear apart American
politics as we have known it. More exactly, the surge of change
will spell the end of the New Deal, Cold War elite, already under
siege. The world they still represent will have nothing to say
about <I>The Change</I>, but all of it will be seen to have failed.
<P>
And the technologies of the new net, of the not-yet-apprehended
<I>Byte City</I>, will make it possible for regular Americans
so long disenfranchised by machine politics and plebiscitary democracy
to gather and talk and act. Not to nominate petty demagogues,
for they will need no telegenic spokesmen: but to move, to speak,
to be felt directly: as groups of citizens.
<P>
Economic revolution transforms the US economy. Like the last revolution,
this change increases everyone's wealth, but not everyone's happiness.
The stress of social adaptation will mean a protracted period
of inward-turning by America. For as economic revolution liberates
great national energies, these passions unleashed demand resolution.
Like America after the Civil War, there will be very little energy
to spare for the rest of the world ...
<P>
Except that the revolution itself becomes our connection. What
we create here creates demand there. Everyone wants it; it is
the spellbinding new world, the promise of a better life for billions
still tied to sweatshop and factory, and silver billions' more
for elites that can bring its wonders home.
<P>
Like Britain then, we export the agent of transformation: our
new city high on that hill in cyberspace. And the violence of
our Big Change crashes and redoubles itself on them.
<P>

<I><B>How Big Change hits the world</B></I> 
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>The cultural dissonance of revolution</I> 
</UL>

<P>
There are reasons why we might expect that our economic revolution
will hit others harder than it hits us.
<P>
The forms of our revolution, as they are developed, tend to fit
our cultural norms and belief system. America is a chaotic culture;
it likes chaos, and even more important, it thrives on chaos.
Apparent chaos. Beneath the spectacle others see of us, there
is the same working pattern here of human culture everywhere:
custom and taboo keep us all in line.
<P>
But the<I> Byte City</I> spectacle will alternately thrill and
repel other cultures. It will thrill individuals with its seemingly
infinite possibilities. It will threaten their ruling classes
in their guts.
<P>
The new economy the US is building directly attacks the entrenched
hierarchies of the industrial world. Pseudo-democratic elites
whose rule depends on control of information will be confounded
by the absolute transparency of <I>Byte City</I>. A social welfare
system jointly created by elites and manufacturing workers cannot
be sustained in an economy where value is determined, not by job
status, and time in job, but directly: by what one actually offers
the new marketplace.
<P>
This means that the elaborate industrial paradigms of Europe and
Japan cannot long survive the advent of <I>Byte City</I> on their
ether's shores. But neither, given American market intimacy, and
the intimate demand of their own people, can it be kept out.
<P>
The problem is in adjustment. The US has already adjusted to structural
dismantling of manufacturing society. The US has made the big
investment in the new enterprises of revolution. And the US carries
much less of a social welfare overhead than the G-7's other six.
<P>
But consider the EC. In each European society, more than 50% of
GNP goes to government. This means that majority support for the
welfare state is built in. But keeping their social welfare world
means squeezing the productive sectors: in France, marginal tax
on business was just increased from 85% to 93%! Yet even this
would still work if there were enough productive enterprises to
sustain the overhead. European economies need the new enterprises
of the revolution, but these are so regulated that they have been
strangled almost to death. Just some stats. EC GNP equals the
US, but
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The value of its software is only about 20% of the US
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The EC has 47% of global manufacturing exports, but only 7%

<P>
Europeans buy US knowledge products and knowledge services: the
EC runs an $18 billion trade deficit with the US in software.
Smart Europeans who want to save on long distance call a service
in Oklahoma that places their <I>European</I> calls: they save
up to 50% that way. They are becoming parasites of America's revolution.
<P>
Europe's elites still believe that high value-added manufacturing,
like Mercedes and Italian shoes, can finance the industrial welfare
state. But there are no jobs there, and only so much value-added.
The real value-added is here: in the US, 50% of new capital investment
goes to electronics and information systems; in semi-conductors
alone, value in terms of total capital investment shot up from
7% in 1990, to 23% today.
<P>
Right now, real unemployment in Germany is close to 30%, the truth
masked by so many unemployed percentage points stashed in perpetual
job-training programs: Forty days guaranteed vacation cannot fig-leaf
a job world that rations work. In France, where unemployment is
officially 13%, the reality is also closer to a third - if the
marginally employed are counted. New French folklore fastens on
the numbers of <I>three-generation </I>families who have never
held a job.
<P>
As it barrels into this world, America's economic revolution brings
social revolution. The stratified industrial economies of Europe
and Japan - <I>[yes, Japan; 87% of Japanese workers are in globally
uncompetitive companies that receive some form of government subsidy]
</I>-<I> </I>are not prepared for the trauma that we are even
now bringing to them. The old, developed world is as brittle as
the thin civilization of late imperial Rome, its ruling elites
as dogged as 18th century <I>Chevaliers</I> facing The Great Fear,
and yet as helpless to stop its insatiable onrush.
<P>
And what happens to the Third World? What happens to those still
industrializing, still half-locked in the last revolution? If
so much disruption awaits those of the G-7, those who should be
ready but are not, how much worse will it be for those who still
daily deal in famine and industrial pollution?
<P>
To spectral witnesses like Bob Kaplan, the future belongs to the
Third World's masses of misery, where the driving force is not
economic revolution, but human and environmental degradation.
In his tortured landscape, cyberspace is the toy of neo-medieval
privilege, of a post-industrial caste secure in its pristine monasteries.
<P>
We can be sure that the agonies of Abidjan will not soon be relieved
by America's virtual public squares - the vision of <I>Byte City</I>.
But in Victorian times too, the industrial revolution brought
no succour to the slave markets of Mali. Today's transformation,
like the last, begins in a single place, and then fans out, staking
its claim over the historical reality it has created.
<P>
And these are like Victorian times in another way too. Third World
elites routinely, eagerly, spend their pampered youth in American
universities. As the architecture of a new world takes shape here,
ruling elites everywhere will rush to plug in! So the net that
transforms American life will pull in the gangsters and warlords
and languid princlings of Kaplan's forlorn anarchy.
<P>
And entrepreneurs. The economic revolution will make wealth everywhere.
Like the programmers of Bangalore, the new net will be a way out
and up for go-getters who need not get up and actually leave.
But these new enterprisers <I>will be working in America</I>.
And they will be less inclined to pay homage to physically local
rulers. And so ruling classes initially delighted will then clamp
down hard.
<P>
Just one story, from a Singapore Telecom exec-in-the-know:
<P>
<blockquote>
<I>My government doesn't care, it isn't listening in to our citizens
on the net; but I'll tell you one thing: Lee Quan et al freaked
out when they were told that there were 3000 unlicensed electronic
bulletin boards on the island! That's why we now have a national
web site. And [surprise] everybody posts there before they post
out. But we don't listen in.</I> 
</blockquote>
<P>
Sure. As Kishore Mahbubani, Singapore's permanent foreign secretary,
told me: &quot;We don't want America's decadence, but [to control]
there are other alternatives to <I>Pravda</I>.&quot;
<P>
Mechanisms of control will be everywhere; and not all will fail.
The industrial revolution that brought democracy to Britain brought
new paternalism to Germany: workers got protection, but old Junkers
kept political power. Through the wash of peoples we call the
Third World, there will be as many responses to the new as there
are cultures and tribes.
<P>
Those places lost today will likely stay lost. But many places
full of energy - like India and East Asia - will grow in huge
surges.
<P>
What is missing from analysis is how people respond to such creative
destruction. Kaplan controls humanity's outcome by reducing all
our options to a narrowing circle of choices in a world aching
just to survive. But economic revolution means expanding choices:
more stress, but more hope too. Fertile ground not for old, but
for new religions.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>The New Religions</I> 
</UL>

<P>
Economic revolution takes time to do its disruptive work. The
transformation of American life doesn't happen tomorrow, or next
year. It isn't ushered in by <I>Windows 95</I>, or forced into
our living rooms by set-top-box interactive TV. The world we are
building may only reach <I>initial</I> maturity - meaning an up-and-running
infrastructure - twenty years from now.
<P>
And its impact on the world will take still longer. We can anticipate
Big Change hitting Japan a bit before Europe. But both places
closest to us will be upended no later than a decade after we
take the first hit.
<P>
The great uncertainty rests with culture areas outside our own.
Even if social revolution in Europe is a calamity, it is difficult
to imagine <I>[though not impossible!] </I>the rise of a new ideology
there that would in its fulfillment of new meaning demand the
rejection of all things American.
<P>
It is far less difficult to imagine such an outcome among cultures
that historically have found fault with America. Those culture
areas that have suffered from contact with the West, and those
that believe especially that the US has inflicted on them a lasting
degradation of identity, will be receptive to new constructions
of meaning that celebrate <I><B>all</B></I> differences between
us - and them.
<P>
But even places that have been sympathetic to the American Crusade
since 1945 may respond with dismay to the theater of chaos that
economic revolution stages <I>- for all the world to see - </I>in
early next century America. Their dismay with us could have far
more historical consequence than the sum of all their current
frustrations. Consider:
<P>
Kaplan's terrible &quot;Coming Anarchy&quot; - like Freddie's
<I>Nightmares</I> observed in adulthood - translates into a sordid,
but not necessarily threatening, world. There are lots of unhappy
people out there, but their sad slide means they have less and
less with which to make us truly unhappy. Our national security
problem becomes our choice to be depressed by contemplating such
unhappiness.
<P>
But revolution gives us a <I>real</I> problem. It not only makes
things more interesting, it also makes them more threatening.
Revolution means the US has recreated economic life, but at the
cost of its former world leadership and the world system it led.
US allies from the old paradigm have been undercut, ironically,
by their former leader, whose economic revolution has sliced their
elites' authority off at the knees. Europe and Japan, plunged
into an economic clearance sale, have in pain and anger reorganized
their societies and their politics. And those 1980s dynamos of
growth, Dragons and Tigers, have exploded in their own dynamism.
<P>
<I><B>20xx. </B></I>There are new religions abroad.
<P>
New religions claim new allegiance. Industrial revolution created
<I>anomie</I>; <I>anomie</I> demanded meaning. And meaning came:
Positivism, Marxism, Socialism, Communism, Bolshevism, Fascism
...
<P>
We called these attempted new organizations of humanity <I>ideologies</I>.
Nonsense. They were new <I>religions</I>. And what is always distinctive
about new religions is their passionate conviction: that their
truth is the only truth. A world that creates several new religions
at once is a world eager for combat.
<P>

<I><B>How The New Make New War</B></I> 
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>No New War Without New Meaning</I> 
</UL>

<P>
There is no point looking at the world as it is, and then trying
to leap to the next war. We get stuck immediately in tortured
excursions that try to make of today's regime in Beijing or New
Delhi an adversary we could face in combat with a straight face.
Such exercises bring new meaning to the term, &quot;suspension
of disbelief.&quot;
<P>
And it gets harder the farther out we go with the same director
and cast - like a never-ending sequel to an old Defense Blockbuster:
<I> DPG XXIII, The Final Agony</I>. Planning tells us to take
today's snapshot - with all current trends holding - to some arbitrary,
even-numbered date called <I>the planning horizon</I>. This gives
us Beijing or New Delhi with <I>x+y</I> number of weapons more
than they have today. But the same, disbelieving face.
<P>
There will be no new war without new religions ... just as there
can be no revolution without a disruption of meaning. But that
disruption has already begun. So new religions are assured. It
is today's stale, crust-brittle constructions of meaning that
are not long to crumble.
<P>
<I>You don't believe this? </I>Why are we so shocked by Serbian
blood-vengeance, Chetchen blood-vengeance, Algerian blood-vengeance,
anybody's blood-vengeance, but not by its absent awareness among
our own?
<P>
<I>Meaning:</I> our elites take pride in denouncing these passions
as primitive, dismissing them as deviant: <I>If they can't be
put down, they should be condemned</I>. But these same elites
have no sense of the authentic source of these passions - a demand
for meaning in a world where stability and order have been ruthlessly
stripped away - and these passions abiding power - to fight starving
in the snow at 30 below, to make of yourself a living bomb, to
head-shot prisoners one after the other, without flinching, because
they are <I>The Stranger</I>. We watch, heads shaking, as the
edges of civilization slough and scale, and feel nothing but scorn
and superiority. The shock will come when it all hits home.
<P>
The shock at the violence of new religions - unlike our contempt
for today's brutal tribal chant - must be the shock of recognition
in revolution itself. Part of the experience of revolution is
overcoming that shock. Eventually, we will accommodate to upheavals
at the center, and they will seem different to us because they
happen here, or in places that we have long ago decided are civilizations'
centers. Not Serbia, not Daghistan; but Japan, France, China.
<I>The US</I>.
<P>
Revolution takes war away from the margins, from tribal splatterings
at the limits of what we control, and puts it back in the firmament
of the center, among close relations, in the heart of the world
<I>metropole</I>. It does this, of course, because revolution
so changes the world <I>bourse</I> that nothing else can stay
the same.
<P>
Conflicting new religions in a world after economic revolution
runs its course will be accepted by Americans. And we will surely
have run a course with many home grown cults and religions of
our own.
<P>
But we may be less ready to deal with triumphant, inimical, movements
that have us directly in their sights.
<P>
By less ready I mean less prepared to deal with the fruits of
their animus against us. Today, we chafe at the prospect of highly
motivated, Islamic revivalist groups doing their worst on us.
But compared to the potential power of a great new religious movement,
drawing strength from its millions and the surging technologies
of revolution, these zealot-clusters are nothing.
<P>
If new religious movements, like the Nazis or Bolsheviks of this
century, claim the energies of whole peoples - passionate, educated
millions - then the new world and its new meaning is really worth
worrying about.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>New War as the celebration of New Meaning</I> 
</UL>

<P>
We still think of Nazi Germany as somehow keener on new technology
than we: better tanks, guided missiles, jet planes; forgetting
that we pushed the technology envelope far more in our Good War
than they.
<P>
<I>German Scientists</I> became Cold War slang because of what
science and technology meant to the then-new-isms. And then we
shivered over <I>Sputnik</I> because of the meaning Soviets invested
in war's technology.
<P>
Soviet and Nazi religionists used the sharpest badges of modernism
- high-tech weapons of war - to celebrate <I>[and make us believe
in]</I> the inevitability of their triumph: hence the new wave
panzers and hot Heinkel formations of a Riefenstahl newsreel,
or ICBMs grimly rumbling across Red Square became the totems of
new meaning publically, flamboyantly celebrated.
<P>
Hitler's and Stalin's cults were receptive to new war because
new war could be used to emotionally insinuate the conviction
that their vision, their belief systems, were about to be unconditionally
fulfilled.
<P>
We have come to see war in stark contrast. We permit ourselves
some modest, tame association of war's technologies with our own
belief that mastery of such technology shows a kind of natural
superiority, but then we go and drown this almost-celebration
with apologies in advance of its demonstration. And how we have
done this too in historical retrospect, stripping former celebrations
even from The Good War, <I>even on its 50th</I>. To us, war can
never again be a celebration. It is at best a profession.
<P>
Why does distinction between war matter? It matters because war
for us serves a very different purpose than war for them. This
is the heart of the difference between <I>status quo </I>war and
revolutionary war; and it is the heart of the difference that
matters much more than the visible things that seem to make war.
<P>
Revolutionary war is not defined by revolutionary weapons, just
as <I>status quo </I>war is not defined by <I>status quo</I> weapons.
The weapons of war, and the way war is made, are vehicles
for realizing what this war represents, and in fact, what it is:
<B> Revolutionary War is the celebration, the realization, of
identity</B>.
<P>
This was true for the Hitler cult especially. It is important
also for us to understand how we defeated revolutionary war then.
The US met revolutionary war - the celebratory war of the new
cult - head-on: with a messianic fervor of our own. We made of
world war a <I>crusade</I> [in Ike's words], and used the power
of American movies and American music to infuse our &quot;war
effort&quot; with a religiousity of passionate commitment and
fulfillment. The power of mass, religious mobilization can be
glimpsed in the thrill Americans felt when hearing of Hiroshima.
The Good War built up enough messianism to carry us through a
dreary and depressing Cold War, twenty years and more down the
road. All the way to Vietnam.
<P>
Revolutionary war as enacted by the Hitler cult is worth remembering
because it was done to us. Memory should give us something real
with which to approach the future. Remember that it is a messy,
even unsatisfactory example, <I>but it is an example we all know</I>.
It is <I>unsat</I> because the thing that is to be feared in our
future - from the new religions - will not resemble the Hitler
cult; but war will have the same, celebratory purpose. For the
new religions, war will be essential to their becoming. The very
experience of war is realization of the new: you create yourself
by destroying the stranger.
<P>
This is why it is important to recognize the religious dimension
of Nazi, Soviet,<I> [and American] </I>war. And if The Good War
gave the US its Cold War momentum, The Great Patriotic War did
even more for the Soviet regime. It became the treasured, made-sacred
experience of the Soviet state and its peoples. It may have been
the only shared element of meaning holding up the rotten Church
of Lenin in its last decades.
<P>
But we, like the old Soviets, finally lost the talisman of The
Good War. Vietnam destroyed it, and young generations have all
but forgotten it. A half century of Cold War slowly turned its
back on the very celebratory war that immediately preceded it:
The Good War. The American way of war changed, and those who made
it, changed. Part of this was blamed on the A-Bomb, but there
was more at work than that. Things military became tied to a social
order: its own caste studiously, even excruciatingly niched in
the larger hierarchy of those who ran the Cold War, and Cold War
American life.
<P>
There is no longer an American Way of War in a national, and certainly
not in a religious sense. War has become a toolbox owned by the
ruling establishment. For the American overclass, war today is
a reverse affirmation: of everything that can be lost. This is
classic <I>status quo </I>thinking, of course. War is something
<I><B>not</B></I> to be fought, but its tools are always to be
<I><B>used</B></I> in support of that same <I>status quo</I>.
<P>
But preserving the late-twentieth century American <I>status quo</I>
is far different than France or Britain preserving the mid-ninteenth
century status quo. The difference: Americans don't like imperial
wars. Therefore, the Washington ruling establishment must manage
by demonstration and awe. This means maintaining very high force
levels for world management purposes, even in the absence of a
major competitor. These forces must be constantly and bullishly
in play - OOTW - and yet still not used. This helps to explain
why any successful war activity is immediately, and loudly trumpeted
as an advertisement for the national security sub-culture (which
includes defense industry and other civilian constituencies) as
a whole. In the face of domestic disinterest, a world management
force must be sold to Americans on the basis of a carefully crafted
package that combines residual nostalgia for the Good War crusade
and a coded message about preserving American military superiority:
<P>
<ul><I>We must stay on top [in control] or we will lose.</I> </ul>
<P>
The unintended emphasis, strangely for the superpower, is on losing.
In order to get the current force levels it wants for management,
the ruling elite must insinuate the notion that any retreat from
these levels is an historic loss or retreat for the American nation.
And in order to send this message - <I>as untrue as it is </I>-
these same elites must strike a tone of pessimism, even defeatism.
<P>
This mental stance is the starkest contrast to the unbounded optimism
of the religionist bound for revolutionary war: <I>The future
belongs to me</I>.
<P>
<P>
<I><B>Why We Stay Stuck In Old Think</B></I> 
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>The Old Establishment Will Resist Big Change Everywhere</I>

</UL>

<P>
Defenders of the world <I>status quo</I>, the Cold War elite is
visibly hunkered down in its final <I>Plaine du Jarres</I> command
post. America's current national establishment was crowned in
crisis. Exigency equalled authority, so Cold War became the perpetual
crisis that demanded a perpetual imperial ruling class. And it
is a big, messy world out there. Even when the Big crisis - the
Cold War - died, there seemed so many out there to take its place.
Change was always out there, and always bad; which meant, always
good, for the elite.
<P>
But the onset of Big Change within the US is like &quot;The World
Turned Upside Down&quot; <I>[The denouement-tune Cornwallis let
play at Yorktown]. </I>Elites have no authority to defend against,
let alone even define, domestic change as a threat to national
security. It is simply a threat to their own security: the security
of their position.
<P>
It is an overclass in need of a rescuing world crisis - not a
<I>real</I> crisis, but an emotional situation that renews their
authority - that limits our imagination: our ability even to prepare
for the next <I>[real]</I> war. But this would not matter for
those charged with America's defense. Except for one thing. They
too are part, an indissoluable part, of that same elite. How did
this happen? With the coming of Cold War, the Brass moved into
their big building in the Imperial City complex. Theirs was the
point of the Free World spear, but they were also allowed into
The Mandarin Club as the American Empire's warrior-diplomats.
And most important: they gained real political influence in support
of a real political constituency - one-third of the Federal workforce!
They got sucked into Free World rule.
<P>
So responding to world change, and a world revolution that is
American-made, is channeled by Washington's <I>ancien regime</I>
into rigid, familiar paths, with the unconscious complicity of
America's military societies. The leading corps of these societies
see a dense and dangerous thicket for their people, but one they
must enter and none the less. And they seek, with all the nature
and honor embedded in their ethos, to bring everyone out on the
other side.
<P>
Their watch has marked the beginning of that dense and dangerous
peacetime. So they have taken to cut for themselves three characteristic
paths through the thicket: footpaths to the future. Call them
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>Readiness, Reform, (r)evolution</I> 
</UL>

<P>
<CENTER><b>Readiness: </b></CENTER>
<P>
Readiness is a world view that believes in the robustness of control.
Things can be managed, and change can be held down, as long as
the we have the means. Readiness is the predominant peacetime
ethos of the Defense world.
<P>
One good opinion gives us the flavor of a true on-top, <I>status
quo</I> mind-set:
<P>
<blockquote>
The lessons and revelations ... of the Persian Gulf War victories
... mandate that a new style of warfare will be employed in future
elective wars. Technology offers the leverage that facilitates
the accomplishment of the new expectation imposed by the American
public. Our military can win decisively anywhere in the world.
It can defeat an adversary anywhere in world [sic!] in reasonable
amounts of time. The day of long drawn out warfare has past [sic!].
It can take battle to an enemy and with the proper technology
minimizes [sic!] our own casualties. It can destroy an enemy on
the battlefield while preserving, should it choose, the country,
national treasures and way of life of that enemy. [from a 1993
draft chapter, <I>Directed Battle, A Vision of the Future</I>]
</blockquote><P>
This quote was chosen because it represents, errors and all, an
authentic attitude rather than a massaged, politically disinfected,
nearly meaningless official statement.
<P>
Readiness defines the current enemy as the always-enemy, because
within its reasoning-loop, no big enemy could arise as long as
the superpower manages world conflict. &quot;Deterrence&quot;
migrates in this mind-set from a relationship designed to maintain
a permanent nuclear <I>status quo</I>, to a relationship where
vicious, but smaller regimes and bigger, but more benign regimes,
are both &quot;deterred&quot; from challenging a permanent American
world <I>status quo</I>.
<P>
The quote's emphasis on the Persian Gulf War as model is also
a feature of the predominant path. It implicitly freezes war by
codifying modern war as the last victorious engagement. This has
the benefit of freezing as well the institutions, relationships,
and force structure that fought that engagement. Modernity is
carefully contained within the realm of things that don't threaten
either institution, relationship, or force structure. So new technology
- and by extension, R&amp;D - is channelled into the development
of high-tech badges, refinements, or appliques to existing weapons'
phyla.
<P>
<CENTER><b>Reform:</b></CENTER> 
<P>
Reform's urge follows cherished American tradition. American military
reform - to some extent mirroring contemporary reform movements
in American society - seeks to improve bureaucratic performance
by improving efficiency. Intrinsic to its goal is the demonizing
of corruption and inefficiency. The core belief is that efficiency
is the <I>desideratum</I>: the thing most wanted. Efficiency solves
peacetime problems. It allows us to fight future battles without
increasing today's budgets. It is progressive in the sense that
it brings military society in-sych with what is considered better
and more modern in the current American spirit of the age. Admiral
Owens thus belongs to the lineage of all American reform, and
symbolizes military society's harmony with all of American society,
just as Root or Sims brought their services in tune with the Progressive
spirit of their day.
<P>
But this path is more of a response to domestic change than it
is preparation for future war. And it creates its own cultural
backlash. The example this time is from a former Defense Official's
reform briefing. The chart is entitled &quot;Achieving a Common
Futures-Oriented Framework For Defense Decision-Makers.&quot;
[<I><B>Chart 1</B></I>] The chart correctly - even powerfully
- identifies one of the deepest elements of corruption in the
DOD: the swarm of interest groups whose competing needs must be
resolved before any policy or budget can be made. The chart shows
the thick alphabet soup that must be adjudicated before even <I>thinking</I>
about the future can happen. He was fired for trying to do something
about it.
<P>
But reform, far from simplifying and sorting out the mess, often
only adds to it. The Joint Staff should have replaced several
layers in the bureaucratic pastry, like the service secretariats.
Instead, it is now yet another layer. Unless reform is the central
agenda of the highest authority, executed ruthlessly from above,
and responding to a widespread sense of crisis, indeed, a public
outcry for change, it only succeeds in creating yet another internal
interest group to be fed.
<P>
So reform's fulfillment waits, often until peacetime's end, for
crisis to make it so.
<P>
<CENTER><b>(r)evolution:</b></CENTER> 
<P>
Military &quot;revolutionaries&quot; within a peacetime status
quo elite tend to focus on new weapons. It was for true ninteenth
century French, it is true for the RMA guys today. Why?
<P>
For one thing, they can't even think about bucking the dominant
paradigm: preserving the <I>status quo</I>. They would quickly
be punished, or banished to the most terrible hell imaginable
for thinkers - obscurity - if they even suggested that military
change means deconstructing the old paradigm itself.
<P>
But then, even in obscurity, they could at least call themselves
<P>
(<B>R</B>)evolutionaries.
<P>
So focusing on weapons is politically safe. And if technology
change, which surely accompanies revolution, is big enough, <I>then
it actually looks like the technology change</I>. And the new
weapons it brings ... <I><B>are</B></I> the revolution.
<P>
A public example (because he now publishes openly) of this phenomena
is Andy Krepinevich's &quot;Funding Innovation: Low-Cost Operations
for Leveraging The Military Revolution:&quot;
<P>
<blockquote>
... in the 1920s, the U.S. military successfully laid the foundation
for success in the next great power competition by &quot;reinventing&quot;
itself in response to the geopolitical and military-technical
revolutions then under way. During the 1920s and 1930s, the military
services positioned themselves to engage in new and different
kinds of military operations - strategic aerial bombardment, amphibious
assault against stoutly defended positions and carrier-based air
strikes. And they did it on shoestring budgets. Denied the opportunity
to think &quot;richer&quot; about defense, the military services
thought &quot;smarter.&quot;
</blockquote>
<P>
He is right about one thing. They did think smarter. About stuff
that was already in play. There was no revolution during the 1920s
and 30s. The stuff that was introduced in the Great War just got
worked on. Airborne assault, armored maneuver, carrier task forces,
aerial bombardment, wolf packs - the whole repertoire of the second
war was rehearsed in the world's collective military mind after
the first; year after year, <I>for twenty years</I>. It was just
that some thought more efficiently than others.
<P>
But as real war, the second differed from the first merely in
embellishment and in efficiency. It was better theater. But there
had been no revolution.
<P>
Yet how advantageous to say that cruise missiles or stealth technology
or microprocessors have &quot;revolutionized&quot; war! Self-styled
(r)evolutionaries can appear to take on the Col. Blimps of the
readiness mind set, saying they're cutting R&amp;D and merely
building the forces of yesterday, <U><I>while in reality never
threatening either their position or their mindset. </I></U>
<P>
(r)evolutionaries are in this way much like reformers: they want
to make the current system better. To the reformer, corruption
translates into the sloth and obesity of the system. To the (r)evolutionary,
corruption translates into &quot;old think&quot; about fighting
war.
<P>
But the system, meaning the prevailing paradigm that encompasses
both the physical, the institutional, and the ideational aspects
of a war society: the system escapes all re-thinking.
<P>
<I>None of this presumes that those defending any of these three
paths to the future are moral invertebrates, corrupt of mind,
or alien to honor.</I> They are serious people, the finest we
have, whose thinking is leashed by a system that permits them
to address only part of a problem, to analyze these pieces in
strict mental compartments, and to assemble them at their peril.
And the system that controls thought is neither conscious nor
deliberate; but it is enfolding. It is a complete belief system,
the reality-defining component of culture itself.
<P>
So when the rhetorician asks
<P>
<I>But where is (<B>R</B>)evolution?</I> 
<P>
We must answer:
<br>
<I>It simply cannot exist.</I> 
<P>
[At any level ... until the larger revolution spends itself sweeping
our old way of life away.]
<P>
Here the French analogy, full circle, holds little historical
comfort. The French too, like us, had their military trajectories
of mind. They had their predominant path to the future, and it,
too, was <B>readiness</B>. They had their <I>jeune ecoles</I>,
fighting for <B>reform</B>, efficiency, purity of command and
operation. And they had <B>(r)evolutionaries</B>, engineers whose
visionary weapons promised to hold the key to future battle.
<P>
And none of the paths were wrong. An ethos of <B>Readiness</B>
made the French army the most combat-honed force on earth; an
ethos of <B>Reform</B> pushed France at last to respond to the
Prussian threat; and an ethos of <B>(r)evolution</B> gave the
<I>armee</I> of the <I>grande nation</I> the techiest tools of
war.
<P>
But as separate mental footpaths to the future, they would meet,
finally, only at the place of defeat. Reform bested readiness
too late; and the big army reforms that followed the shock of
Sadowa, and Austria's stunning defeat in 1866, only served to
throw the French army into confusion. It went into battle in 1870
not knowing itself.
<P>
And it could not possibly know itself in time, because it had
not taken the time to know war: how war was really changing, how
the new world was machining it, re-engineering it, so that it
became something new.
<P>
We have several steps to take before we can begin to know this.
The first is seeing the real change, and accepting the irony that
<I><B>we</B></I> are making the revolution that will transform
the world. The second step is connecting a transformation in life
to a metamorphosis of culture itself, and then of war, which is
culture's creature. The third step is confessing that, even though
we begin the revolution in life, that others - their red dreams
not yet imagined - will begin the revolution in war. Because war
will be both their celebration of birth and its <I>realization</I>.
<P>
But if these recognitions were all we needed to begin the road
to the next war, we would already be into the journey. But there
are other obstacles, the <I>anti-recognitions</I> of denial, that
are more intractable, that hold us in place like little trees
with long roots.
<P>
<ul>
There is our hallowed record of historical success: W<I>hy question
it?</I> 
<P>
So long since we met a real competitor: <I>Who is this upstart?</I>

<P>
The comforting feel of ongoing &quot;reform&quot;: <I>Been there.
Did that.</I> 
<P>
The power of our national myth: <I>We will always rise to crisis.</I>

<P>
The talisman of triumphant technology: <I>But we have the Death
Star!</I> 
</blockquote>
<P>
So we await our Sedan. To dismiss this prospect, we must dismiss
the possibility of a future foe: an equal challenger with evil
intent. And to dismiss this possibility, we must dismiss the transformative
power of Big Change, and assert that we can keep control not only
of our world system, <I>but what happens to it</I>, forever.
<P>
But no one can do this.
<P>
So we await our Sedan.
<P>
This much is certain.
<P>
The only uncertainty is in its outcome.

<h2>Republican Dreaming</h2>
by <a href="/pff/people/staff.html#O_Donnell">Richard F. O'Donnell</a>
<P>
 Today, two zealous camps dominate public discourse over our future.
Techno-utopian Pollyanna's are busy proclaiming the unadorned
good of information technology while the neo-Luddites oppose the
same technological change.
<P>
 Between these two groups are the vast majority of Americans,
who do not quite understand all the hype over the Internet, know
that ATM machines are convenient, but do not want their jobs automated
away.  The message Americans are waiting to hear is that through
all the dislocation and turmoil caused by the coming of the Knowledge
Age are tremendous opportunities for better lives, and that the
ideas which made this nation great can still work in the future.
<P>
 This may explain the amazing number of Republicans one encounters
these days who have basically written off the 1996 Presidential
election, conceding a second term to a man who by almost all measures
does not merit one.  Clinton's poll numbers may be up and he threw
effective tactical roadblocks in the budget battle, but why this
sense of defeatism?
<P>
Republicans should be excited and full of anticipation at completing
what they began in 1994:  the destruction of the Democratic party
as the governing majority in American politics. To do deliver
a knock-out punch in 1996, Republicans need to offer as a challenger
to Bill Clinton a candidate who addresses Presidential - not Congressional
- issues.  Dick Lugar was exactly right when he said that all
the candidates for the GOP nomination want to balance the budget,
restore the 10th Amendment and overhaul the tax code.  The problem
is, these are <I>not</I> the issues with which to win the Presidency.
<P>
 What won Ronald Reagan the White House in 1980 was not his list
of top three public policy priorities (stronger defense, lower
taxes and balanced budget), but the sense that he could make America
stand tall again.  He offered the hope and optimism for a better
future to a nation suffering, as Carter put it, the malaise of
the 1970s.
<P>
 The leadership Americans want from the Presidency is one which
transcends the public policy debate and from a moral high ground
offers America a principled vision on how to build a better future.
 Many Republicans respond that they do have a national figure
offering just such leadership:  Newt Gingrich.  Yet Newt Gingrich
is Speaker, and although he amazingly used that office during
the past year to become, in essence, America's head of government,
his job is still necessarily partisan and deals primarily with
tactical public policy issues.  Only a President with the skills
and - Clinton's weakness - moral authority, can don the mantle
of Head of State, transcend partisan politics and lead the majority
of Americans.
<P>
 Republicans who say &quot;we just need to nominate someone who
won't stop the Revolution and let Newt continue to supply the
vision&quot; are handing Bill Clinton the election.  The Republicans'
dilemma is a Speaker who talks like a President and Presidential
candidates who talk like Congressmen. Only a candidate whose message
is of Presidential caliber stands a chance of beating Clinton
- and saying &quot;Newt's the leader of the Revolution and I'm
with him&quot; is not of that level.
<P>
 Lost last fall amongst all the uproar over Clinton's national
&quot;funk&quot; gaffe was a theme to which he returned in his
State of the Union address and that comes close being a full-fledged
vision.   In September he said that it is the President's job
to lead Americans through the &quot;tumult and upheaval&quot;
of the information-saturated 1990's.  In the seventh paragraph
of the State of Union - before he said the era of big government
is over - Clinton said:  &quot;We live in an age of possibility.
A hundred years ago we moved from farm to factory.  Now we move
to an age of technology, information and global competition. 
These changes have opened vast new opportunities, but they also
present stiff challenges.&quot;  Alvin Toffler or Newt Gingrich
could not have said it better.
<P>
 Yet none of the candidates for 1996, including Clinton, are offering
a realistic vision of America in the Knowledge Age.  Through his
veneer Clinton is as obsessed with stagnating real wages as Bob
Dole is with the fact that it's &quot;his turn,&quot; as Phil
Gramm is with economics, as Dick Lugar is with nuclear terrorism,
and as Steve Forbes is with &quot;Voodoo II.&quot;
<P>
 All these messages fail to adequately address the disquiet Americans
feel about their nation's future in the Knowledge Age.  Does Windows
'95 herald an information driven renaissance, or are millions
of people going to be driven out of work by increased computerization?
 Pat Buchanan is the only GOP candidate remotely addressing these
issues; he is tapping into a true vein of anxiety among voters.
 Unfortunately, Buchanan is offering up neo-Luddite solutions
that are merely a reaction at being left behind as the future
arrives.
<P>
Americans aren't sure where their nation is headed, and are looking
for a Presidential candidate to honestly describe the nature of
our times.  The New Deal era provided us with a vision -- interstate
highways, television, moon landings -- that to a stunning degree
was realized.  Yet this success was bittersweet, because once
we achieved its promises, we had no replacement vision and consequently
lost our sense of direction.
<P>
 This calls for reinventing the American Dream for a new century,
which is tricky business. Irving Kristol recently identified one
reason:  &quot;America has come of age, the American dream has
been fulfilled to the degree that any dream ever is&quot;.  When
you've fulfilled your dreams, it is tempting to sit back and dream
no more.  The dream Kristol believes fulfilled -- and thus no
longer useful -- is one created for 20th century industrial America.
What we need now is a Dream for 21st century Knowledge-Age America.
<P>
 Currently none of the Presidential candidates is offering America
a new Dream. Democrats dream about high wages and universal health
insurance whereas Republicans dream of making a bundle. &quot;Necessities
or securities, but hardly the stuff of dreams,&quot; said <I>The
Nation</I>. The problem with both parties is that they are pecuniary.
<P>
 Yet, when all is said and done, Americans are Americans for reasons
larger than a dollar. Yes, we all want to be prosperous.  Yes,
we all want a less burdensome tax code.  But we hold other ends
in higher esteem.  Americans enjoy the sense of meaning that comes
from belonging to causes outside themselves, whether a revolution,
settling the frontier or racing to the moon.
<P>
 The great challenge for us today, something worthy of a Dream,
is to take all the new tools of the Knowledge Age and use them
to build a better society while minimizing the disruption and
dislocation these same tools will engender as we replace the ways
of the industrial world.
<P>
 It is this void which is driving the radical middle in American
politics.  Our nation is searching for a new Dream, for a new
goalpost toward which to strive.  Americans are looking for a
President who talks about more than just the public policy issues
of balanced budgets, states' rights and tax code reform.  Americans
want someone to show them that through all the confusion and seeming
chaos, the electronic frontier beckons us toward ever greater
freedom, creativity, individuality, community and progress.  If
the Republicans want to win the Presidency this year, their nominee
must, in addition to discussing the proper size and scope of government
in society, engage Americans in a discussion about the future
of their society itself.

<h2>
In Civilized Society, Shame Has Place
</h2>
By <a href="bennett.html">William J. Bennett</a> <p>
<i>Los Angeles Times</i>
<BR><i>January 26, 1996</i><P></center><hr>

<P> 

<p>
A few months ago, Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn. ), Sam Nunn (D-Ga. ) and I began a campaign to focus public scrutiny on certain daytime television talk shows and their sponsors. The objects of our criticism are not close calls. They are shows that typically cross way over the line. We have described their content as cultural rot. How else could one describe shows whose typical subjects include a 17-year-old girl boasting of having slept with more than 100 men, a 13-year-old talking about sexual experiences that began when she was 10 and "Women Who Marry Their Rapists."
<p>
A number of commentators have defended these talk shows for "reflecting reality," arguing that our campaign won't succeed and that sponsors are within their "rights" to advertise on their programs. It is useful, then, to explain what we are attempting to do and what we are not.
<p>
First, our campaign is not about rights. We are not trying to curb-free speech. I am a virtual absolutist on the 1st Amendment and we have been emphatic about not arguing for censorship. Nor is our goal to remove every last vestige of garbage from our social landscape; this is impossible in a free society.
<p>
But we are asking talk show hosts and advertisers to reconsider their support of some of this daytime television fare. If they continue their support, we are asking that they be able to justify publicly what they are doing, which is to "mainstream" trashy behavior.
<p>
Almost every society has its red-light districts. That is part of reality, and we all understand that. A free society can tolerate such districts. But society should also do what it can to discourage them and contain them. And so, too, with the popular culture version of red-light districts. They ought to remain on the periphery, away from Main Street, our living rooms, our schoolyards.
<p>
Recent postgame interviews with athletes help illustrate a similar point: NFL players feel free to curse on the field and in the locker room. Not many people object to that. But it is nonetheless true that what you have a right to do is not always right to do. And it is wrong for people, even athletes, to curse on camera for national television.
<p>
The aim of our campaign is to use nongovernmental means to make the case that such cultural trash should be less pervasive. We believe that a sense of shame still exists in the highest reaches of corporate America and in the entertainment industry. We believe, too, that progress can be made, through moral suasion, not government intervention. And we intend to keep making the case that civilization needs cultural guardrails, certain reliable standards of right and wrong that may not be enforceable in law but must be enforceable through conscience and consensus.
<p>
All of this requires that we make normative judgments. Of course, some people balk at any attempt to do this, even as they balk at any effort to declare some things worthy and some things unworthy of human consumption. Martin Luther King Jr. was right when he wrote in his "Letter from Birmingham City Jail" that something that uplifts human personality is just and some thing that degrades human personality is unjust.
<p>
Instead of simply lamenting the debased state of our popular culture, citizens need to do something about it. After all, we are witnessing the pollution of the human environment. Cleaning out our cultural air ducts won't happen by itself; it requires concerted effort and specific action. Five years ago, our effort would not have resonated nearly so much with the public. But we have hit a cultural nerve. What we are seeing, here and elsewhere, is the shock of recognition that in too many places, not just in back alleys but in the main thoroughfares, America has been cheapened. We, the American people, have allowed this desecration to occur. It is past time that we do something about it.

<h2>Shut the Criminals' Revolving Door</h2>
By <a href="bennett.html">William J. Bennett</a> <p>
<i>Los Angeles Times</i>
<BR><i>January 16, 1996</i><P></center><hr>

<P> 
<i>Influenced by those opposed to punishment, government has failed to keep citizens safe from known repeat violent offenders.</i><P>

<P>
During the past 25 years, much of the crime debate has been dominated by criminologists who are philosophically opposed to punishment. In an attempt to advance their agenda, they have perpetrated a wide array of myths. The recently released report of the bipartisan Council on Crime in America is an attempt to provide an alternative: a rigorous, empirical, real-world analysis of the current state of crime and punishment.

The report tells us that the nation faces at least three distinct but related crime challenges: preventing at-risk children from becoming criminals, protecting innocent people from becoming crime victims and restraining convicted criminals who are under the "supervision" of the criminal justice system (on probation, parole or pretrial release) from committing additional crimes.
<P>
<b>Prevention.</b> We know that children born into poor families-- matter their race, region, religion, demographic stripe or socioeconomic status-- they have decent families and grow up with responsible, caring adults in their lives, are far less likely to become either victims or victimizers. We also know that not all children are born so lucky.
<P>
America is now home to nearly 70 million children 18 or under. As many as 15 million of them are growing up in relative poverty, often in places where the institutions of civil society--families, churches, schools, voluntary associations--are in near-complete collapse. The report argues that neither more spending by government nor the mere withdrawal of government can prevent today's at-risk 4- to 7-year-old boys from becoming next decade's 14- to 17-year-old predatory street felons or the next century's first big class of adult career criminals. The key to prevention is moral education. That, in turn, depends on reviving the character-forming institutions of civil society. But we know that there is no easy way to accomplish that.
<P>
<b>Protection.</b> The recent widely reported drops in serious crime in New York, Houston and other cities were due largely to innovative community policing strategies, citizen anti-crime initiatives and continued "target-hardening" or increased security and personal safety measures by individuals and businesses. But these drops in crime may be merely a lull. The storm is gathering in the form of a demographic bulge of highly crime-prone boys. During the next 10 years, enormous upward pressure will be exerted on crime rates. Redoubling crime protection efforts will not keep the storm offshore. But it can help to minimize the damage and reduce the human and financial cost.
<P>
<b>Restraint.</b> The criminal justice system imprisons only one criminal per 100 violent crimes. Most violent prisoners serve less than half their time in prison before being released. In 1993, there were 43.6 million criminal victimizations in America, more than 10 million of them violent. Between 1985 and 1993, the rate at which boys 14 through 17 committed murder increased by about 50% for whites and 300% for blacks. A third of all violent crimes, including murders, are committed by felons out on probation, parole or pretrial release. What is involved here is more than a failure of public safety; it is a massive failure of governmental obligation. Citizens should not have to accept their government's prolonged, persistent failure to restrain violent and repeat criminals. A government incapable of restraining known, violent, repeat criminals within its custody cannot be trusted to take on more complicated and costly public functions.
<p>
There is also the matter of eroding public trust in our political institutions. A government that, amid much fanfare, passes wave after wave of get-tough anti-crime laws but proves toothless in the execution of those laws eviscerates pubic confidence in the integrity of lawmakers and the criminal justice system. Indeed, in 1993 and again in 1994, there was only one public institution in which the American people had less confidence than in Congress: the criminal justice system. No representative democracy can long survive this deep and disheartening lack of public trust. And the only way to restore public trust is to shut the revolving door.
<p>
A final point: A society tells as much about itself by what it punishes as what it praises, by what it condemns as well as what it encourages, by what receives reprobation as what receives approbation. The message of our justice system is all too clear to criminals and victims: Too often, for too many, it says "nobody cares" and "nothing matters." That has to change soon or the carnage and violence that have become almost permanent features of America's landscape will worsen.

the great railroad job</FONT></CENTER><P>When Bill Clinton says he &quot;feels
your pain,&quot; he means it. He wants to spread the pain around so that he can
feel everybody's.<P>Last week he made a good start.<P>You could ask Billy Dale.
You could ask David Kendall, his lawyer for financial felonies, now in the toils
of a grand jury himself. You could ask Bob Bennett, his lawyer for bimbo
misdemeanors. You could ask Mike McCurry, his press agent.<P>You could even ask
Hillary, but she's still taking pills for her amnesia.<P>Mr. Dale is entitled to
laugh last, if he feels like laughing through his pain. Never has a railroad job
failed so deliciously.<P>Mr. Dale is going to get back a lot of the money he was
forced to borrow to pay for the lawyers to help him defend himself against
Hillary's false witness. (Miss Hillary, who wants us to believe that she went to
Sunday school between the beatings she got at the hands of the roving gangs of
5-year-olds then terrorizing her Republican neighborhood, might spend a few hours
between grand jury appearances to reflect on what the Bible says about bearing
false witness. She could start with the 20th chapter of the Book of Exodus and
look in on Proverbs 19:05 and 21:28.)<P>Mike McCurry is not laughing, but neither
is Bob Bennett. Mr. Bennett was assigned by the president to get on TV to trash
Billy Dale, to ruin his reputation in retaliation for his having humiliated the
Clintons in court, and in his zest for the assignment poor Uncle Bob revealed
himself to be not only a great pleader - he's a member of that mighty fraternity
of Blackstones whom the innocent cannot afford - but almost as factually
challenged as his famous client.<P>He said, OK, Mr. Dale might have beaten the
rap, but it was not a knockout, only a TKO: Mr. Dale had offered to plead guilty
to embezzlement in return for a four-month prison sentence. This was great
breakfast theater, suggesting that just because Billy Dale was not a felon that
didn't mean he wasn't a bum. But it wasn't so. He never agreed to say he had done
something he hadn't. When he was called on it, Mr. Bennett was revealed to have
gotten his facts, such as they were, all wrong. (He also violated the confidence
that parties to plea-negotiating have a right to expect, if the ethics committee -
please do not laugh - of the bar association is listening.) What also was not
clear was why anyone would believe anything any mouthpiece, $500 an hour or not,
would say in such a situation. A lawyer's declamation in defense of his client is
about as useful as calling your mother as a character witness.<P>At the next press
briefing, a reporter started to ask Mike McCurry a perfectly reasonable question
about Uncle Bob and Billy Dale, but before the reporter could get to his question,
Mr. McCurry cut him off: &quot;People have said some things and, frankly, the
president finds some statements that have been made objectionable. I am referring
specifically to comments on plea bargaining. ... We didn't put Bennett out to say
anything bad about Billy Dale, that's the bottom line. We made it pretty clear
after that happened that we didn't appreciate that type of
commentary.&quot;<P>Nothing ambiguous about who and what Mike was talking about.
Bob Bennett read it that way, too, and he used up a pocketful of a luckless
client's quarters calling the White House until he finally got to the president,
who felt his pain at once. The president told him that he had done &quot;a great
job&quot; on Billy Dale.<P>By the end of the next day, Mike was feeling pain. He
was sent out to retract all the honorable stuff he had said about Mr. Bennett's
treatment of Billy Dale. &quot;It is not objectionable for the president's
attorney to defend the president once he is under attack during some of these
television talk-show programs. ... And it is not objectionable for Mr. Bennett
simply to repeat something that has been published. ... There was a notion ...
that the White House has a campaign out there to tar and feather Billy Dale. I'm
satisfied that's not true. I'm satisfied that the president would find that
objectionable if that were true.&quot;<P>This is now all so familiar. Depending on
who Mr. Clinton was talking to, he thought that (a) Bob Bennett had done &quot;a
great job&quot; trashing Billy Dale; (b) Mike McCurry had done &quot;a great
job&quot; telling Bob Bennett what a jerk he was for trashing Billy Dale; and (c)
Billy Dale had done &quot;a great job,&quot; too.<P>Attorney General Janet Reno
also did &quot;a great job,&quot; putting out a Justice Department report saying
that the White House did not pressure the FBI to investigate the travel-office
employees. This has infuriated some people at the FBI who understand that the only
people who did &quot;a great job&quot; were the railroad men: The director of the
FBI works for Janet Reno, who works for President Clinton, who works for the first
lady.<P>The job Hillary did, however, was not so great.<P>Copyright &#169 1996,

character vs. the politics of style</FONT><P> <HR WIDTH=50%>By Suzanne

</CENTER><BLOCKQUOTE><B><I><P>&quot;Character is the most effective means of
persuasion.&quot;<BR>-- Aristotle's
&quot;Rhetoric.&quot;</I></B></BLOCKQUOTE><P>No one studies rhetoric for the sake
of rhetoric any more. It's a politically incorrect discipline better left to those
funny men in togas in ancient Athens.<P>So why shouldn't Bill Clinton's State of
the Union speech and Bob Dole's response lack rhetorical flights of inspiration
and persuasion?<P>Most of the pop commentators gave Bill Clinton the usual edge,
but Bob Dole's remarks - not the unaccountably awkward delivery - actually had
more to say to the collective consciousness of a nation that is just now beginning
to listen to the men who want to be president in 1996.<P>Bob Dole was more clearly
focused, sharper with the points of criticism of Mr. Clinton's failed liberal
policies after the president had recited his new conservative agenda. But he
talked too fast from an empty room. He should have insisted on speaking from a
school or a courthouse in a small town in Kansas, or even Iowa or New Hampshire.
The contrast with the pomp and bombast of Washington would have been
exquisite.<P>We can take Aristotle's word for it. &quot;Persuasion,&quot; he wrote
2,500 years ago, &quot;is achieved by the speaker's personal character when the
speech is so spoken as to make us think him credible. His character may almost be
called the most effective means of persuasion.&quot;<P>Bill Clinton lacks that
most effective means of persuasion, credibility and character. He's the
quick-change artist, constantly challenging himself on the tight rope. He knows
how to talk the talk of conservatives when he's in the campaign mode, how to walk
the walk with veto pen in hand when he's with his fellow liberals.<P>Now in the
campaign mode, the president echoes Dan Quayle, Newt Gingrich and his merry band
of followers in the House, as well as Bob Dole, and his considerably less-merry
campers in the Senate. The president now seeks a welfare program that supports
families, unlike the present one which undermines families (and a lot like the one
he vetoed last month). He calls for smaller government, accepting the voters'
message in the 1994 elections, but thwarts attempts to cut the government we've
got down to size.<P>He pleads with the pop culture creators to produce movies,
television shows and CDs that &quot;you would want your own children and
grandchildren to enjoy.&quot; He could tell that to his Hollywood cronies, since
they're the ones who produce many of the very shows he affects to criticize.
They're also the ones who have contributed a significant portion of his $30
million campaign chest, and pols rarely want to offend big contributors. He
affected graciousness to Bob Dole, drawing attention to his service in World War
II, which also drew attention to Mr. Dole's age, like Mark Antony affecting praise
of Brutus at Caesar's funeral.<P>And Bob Dole is, as we all know, an honorable
man. He had the better lines but he didn't deliver them well. He hadn't quite
mastered the teleprompter and demonstrated a need for lessons in emphasis. By far
the most powerful sentence in his whole speech fused rhythm, thought and
conviction: &quot;Every political movement, and every public official, must locate
a place in his heart where compromise ends, a core of conviction where we keep our
conscience.&quot;<P>He tossed that sentence to the right wing of his party to let
them know he is more than the Washington deal-cutter, reinforcing the larger theme
that he intends to mock Bill Clinton on the issues of character and an authentic
political point of view.<P>The senator must find a way to turn wisdom, experience
and age to his advantage. It won't be easy. A young TV comedienne says Bob Dole
reminds her of her father, and why on earth would she vote for him. (But why would
she want to vote for her bumpkin uncle?) Bob Dole's not the kind of guy whose
briefs or boxers fascinate the MTV generation.<P>Despite his age, Bob Dole was hip
enough last month to board a flashy MTV bus in New Hampshire for a taped political
interview. He also talked to members at the Alpha Delta fraternity at Dartmouth
College, which was the model for the movie &quot;Animal House.&quot; He competed
with James Brown's shouting from boom boxes, amiably recalling his college days at
the University of Kansas, where pranksters at Kappa Sigma fraternity once carried
a brother's motorcycle to the third floor of the frat house.<P>&quot;Every
generation has its own set of problems, its own temptations,&quot; Mr. Dole told
them. &quot;We're not an old America, we're not a young America. We're one
America.&quot;<P>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for The Washington Times, is

<title>Gary Bauer's February, 1996 Letter</title>
<body>
<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>
<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>
February 7, 1996
<p>
Dear Friend:
<p>
Hillary Rodham Clinton has written a new book.  It isn't supposed
to be about herself, but in one disturbing sense it is a biography.
Mrs. Clinton's book -- <i>It Takes a Village and Other Lessons Children
Teach Us</i> -- attempts to write the biography of the next generation
of America's children.  I disagree with her message, and I want
to tell you why.
<p>
The book's title comes from an African proverb, &quot;It takes
a village to raise a child.&quot;  An article about the book in
<I>Newsweek</I> magazine helps make the proverb's meaning perfectly
clear.  One of  Mrs. Clinton's favorite expressions, the article
says, is, &quot;There is no such thing as other people's children.&quot;
After reading just a few chapters of <I>It Takes a Village</I>,
it becomes obvious that what she means by &quot;village&quot;
is really <b>more</b> Big Government.  What she means by &quot;family
values&quot; is the mush that's left over after the time-honored
traditions of men and women of faith have been driven from the
public square.
<p>
I believe that our problem today is that too many parents are
looking to the so-called village to care for their children, instead
of meeting this precious responsibility themselves.  Many other
parents are struggling to meet this responsibility themselves,
but they are overwhelmed by crushing taxes, stagnating incomes,
the relentless encroachment on parental rights by government,
and the destruction of values by an amoral culture.  From Calvin
Klein ads to the studios of Hollywood, there is indeed a &quot;village&quot;
seeking to raise our children -- a Greenwich Village of sexual license
and crass materialism.  I don't want my children raised this way,
and I am confident you don't want it for your children or grandchildren
either.
<p>
Kay Coles James, a former Vice President at the Family Research
Council, knows this African proverb well.  Kay, a black American who was 
born in the slums of Portsmouth, Virginia, has risen to prominence
in our national political life.  She has written how Mrs. Clinton's
slogan has made the rounds and how deeply wrong it is:
<p><blockquote>
<i>It is really quite simple, we are told, if only we would cede parental 
control to the village, all would be well.  Children would no longer grow 
up insecure or worried; they would be well-adjusted, well-developed,
and full of healthy self-esteem.  What a wonderful world it would be .
. . .</i>
<p>
<i>But the village cannot raise a child.  Children don't belong to the 
community. Children belong to the parents who tuck them in at
night, wipe away their tears, feed them their meals, and answer their 
questions. If the past thirty years have taught us anything, it is that 
stable, intact, two-parent families are the foundation of a healthy 
village.</i>[1]
</blockquote><p>
Kay is right.  The village <b>cannot</b> raise a child.  Increasingly,
the &quot;village&quot; is taking our children away from us.  And as I told you 
last month, that is why I have written a new book of my own, <I>Our Hopes, 
Our Dreams:  A Vision for America</I>. Like Mrs. Clinton's, my book is about 
families and children -- but there the similarity ends.
<p>
In fact, it would be difficult to imagine two books more diametrically
opposed on the major issues facing our families and our nation.  Mrs. 
Clinton writes with admiration of Western Europe's &quot;openness about 
sexuality&quot;[2] and wishes we were similarly enlightened.  <I>Our Hopes, 
Our Dreams</I> ponders how our sex-saturated society can restore the virtues 
of fidelity and chastity. (I wonder if Mrs. Clinton has watched any cable t.v. 
lately or checked the tabloids as she walked through a grocery check-out lane?)
<I>It Takes a Village</I> deplores abortions <b>only</b> if they
are &quot;unsafe&quot;[3] and argues that the &quot;village&quot;
should promote contraception to young people to &quot;help them
deal responsibly with the consequences of their actions.&quot;[4]
My book questions the future for a nation that has abandoned
the sanctity of human life and lost the meaning of holy matrimony.
<p>
Hillary Clinton, <I>Newsweek</I> says, champions a government
&quot;program for every problem&quot;[5] and accuses conservatives
of opposing Big Government because we desire &quot;to advance
narrow religious, political and economic agendas.&quot;[6] My book
yearns for a rebirth of family and community that restores the
federal government to its limited constitutional role.  Mrs. Clinton
believes that &quot;everyone should wait until the age of 21 before
having sex.&quot;[7] Not only should sex be within the bonds of
marriage, but I believe that the virtue of an action does not
depend on one's age.
<p>
Hillary Clinton believes that out-of-home child care is controversial
because, she says, &quot;Americans have never sufficiently valued
the work of caring for children&quot; and have long been ambivalent
&quot;about whether surrogate child care is acceptable.&quot;[8]
<I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> argues, instead, that America's
families place the highest value on caring for children.  Families
have told pollsters time and again that they not only favor parental
care of children, but also want public policies that support that
choice.
<p>
The first lady's book is receiving tremendous attention in the
national liberal media.  She has also been interviewed by the
major news magazines.  The best-seller lists will no doubt track
her book's sales with enthusiasm.  As you know, however, those
lists completely ignore books like mine which come from Christian
publishers such as Focus on the Family.  The media will try to
ignore our pro-family message, too.  In some ways the outcome
of the family policy debate in 1996 will be determined by whether
more Americans support Hillary Clinton's message of Big Government
and liberal values or whether they accept and embrace the message
of renewal and faith contained in <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I>.
With your help, we can win this first &quot;debate&quot; of 1996
by making sure <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> reaches as many Americans
as possible.  I hope you will choose to read this pocket-size
paperback and then help distribute it to your friends, neighbors,
co-workers, sunday school class and anyone else interested in
America's future.
<p>
Hillary Clinton, however, is not the only public figure tossing
around adjectives like &quot;extreme&quot; these days.  If you've
watched the long-running budget battle between the Congress and the 
White House, you've heard some of the nastiest descriptions ever
applied to elected legislators by the sitting president and his
staff.  Specifically, they've described the congressional freshman
class as everything from &quot;the far right&quot; to &quot;inflexible
extremists.&quot;
<p>
Listening to the president, you would think that these first-term
legislators hate the elderly, intend to starve the poor, abandon
children, trash the environment, and close schoolhouse doors.
The budget deadlock that gripped this city was even blamed on
these newcomers.  Last  March, I wrote to you that these very
same members of Congress &quot;bring to Washington a spirit of
service that is truly rare.&quot;  In the aftermath of the recent
government shutdown, has my opinion changed?
<p>
Not at all!  If anything, I hold the congressional freshman class
in even higher regard now than I did a year ago.  The reason is simple: 
they have kept their word. The vast majority of these members came to 
Washington as citizen-legislators. That is, they did not see themselves 
as part of a permanent governing class. They supported term limits. They 
promised to rein in runaway government.  They promised to cut taxes
on families with children.  They pledged to balance the budget
and eliminate useless bureaucracies.
<p>
I have often prayed with these deeply faithful new members, and
I wince as I see them daily attacked in the liberal press.  The
media have been an echo chamber for the White House, unfairly
charging the freshmen with denying funds for everything from Meals
on Wheels to school lunch programs.  Medicare is the primary example.
Throughout the budget battle, Bill Clinton accused these men
and women of seeking &quot;to strip our government and our country&quot;[9]
of its rightful role.  Clinton huffed that the Congress has held
some 40+ hearings on the Whitewater scandal, but only one on the
Medicare bill he was asked to sign.
<p>
Actually, Congress held over 50 hearings on Medicare, but
Bill Clinton &quot;counted&quot; only the one hearing
held on the actual bill.  Where was our adversary press on this
one?  Furthermore, Medicare spending under the GOP seven-year
balanced budget plan will increase by 89%.  Per-person spending
will also increase from just over $4,800 per year now to over
$7,000 in the year 2002.  To keep Medicare from going bankrupt,
seniors would pay an additional $7 per month, an &quot;increase&quot;
that happens only because the GOP plan keeps the beneficiaries'
share of the premium right where it is now at 31.5%.  The President's
alternative was to shift more of the costs of the program to taxpayers
who do not receive any of the benefits.  Moreover, the House-backed
plan provided the elderly with a new freedom, medical savings
accounts, to help them take charge of their own coverage and avoid
the threat of rationing posed by the Clintons' health reform model.
<p>
Watching the president's January press conference, this thought
occurred to me, too.  He pointed out that he has halved the budget
deficit in three years.  That's true -- even if you believe, as I
do, that the administration's policies are not the primary cause
of the decline.   Much of the additional revenue necessary to
reduce the deficit came as a result of Clinton's tax increase,
$280 billion over five years[10], the largest in our nation's history!
My question is this:  If Bill Clinton could cut the deficit in
half in three years, how can it be &quot;extremist&quot; for congressmen
to advocate wiping out the <i>other</i> half of the deficit in
seven years?
<p>
Let me share with you just a few of the House conservatives'
other extraordinary accomplishments for the family:
<p><ul>
<li>Passed a $500 per child tax credit for all families with
dependent children under the age of 18.  Insisted on the full amount
of this credit in tough negotiations with the Senate, and held their
ground during the federal shutdown when Clinton vetoed the budget bill.
<p>
<li>Passed a $5,000 credit for adoption expenses to facilitate
the placement of children in permanent homes.
<p>
<li>Restored the ability of the states to deny taxpayer funds
for abortions; denied federal funds for human embryo research;
adopted language to deny foreign aid funds to agencies like International
Planned Parenthood that promote and perform abortion overseas;
protected the accreditation of teaching hospitals that refuse
to participate in abortion training; restored the ban on use of
taxpayer funds to subsidize abortions under federal employee health plans; 
reimposed limits, lifted in 1993 by President Clinton, on the performance of 
abortions in U.S. military hospitals; passed a ban on partial-birth abortions. 
The first four items have been bottled up in the Senate, but none of these 
actions would have been possible without the pro-life members added to the House 
in 1994.
<p>
<li>Passed the first major welfare reform in a generation, designed to curb 
illegitimacy, encourage work and discourage the formation of single-parent 
households headed by teenagers.
<p>
<li>Forced a sharp reduction in funding for the National Endowment
for the Arts, leading to its elimination in two years, thereby putting
out of business this elitist agency that has been unable to distinguish art
from obscenity.
</ul><p>
In the coming year, these members are likely to endure even more
media abuse as they strive to deliver on their promises to protect
religious liberty and parental rights.  Rep. Steve Largent's (R-Okla.) 
Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act and religious liberty protections 
championed by Reps. Ernest Istook (R-Okla.) and Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) will 
be FRC priorities in 1996.  These are just some of the many ideas
we advocate to ensure that when it comes to our children, Mom
and Dad are village chiefs!
<p>
In closing, let me thank you for the support you have provided
to FRC during the past year.  Your encouragement and financial
gifts will keep us fighting hard for the values we share.  <b>I
hope you'll take a moment to review the enclosed reply card and
that you will choose to help us distribute <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I>
to every American home.  Also, please ask your local Christian
Book Store to carry this important book.</b>
<p>
Sincerely,
<p><br>
Gary L. Bauer<br>
President
<p>
P.S.  I am thankful for your faithful friendship and support.
My family joins me in praying that God will richly bless you
and yours during this tumultuous time.

<TITLE>Broadcast Spectrum: Putting Principles First -- PFF
</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>
<P>
<i>January 31, 1996</i><P>
<h2>Broadcast Spectrum: Putting Principles First</h2>
by The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation's <a href="#board">FCC Working Group</a>
<P>
For the last several months, House and Senate conferees have worked
diligently to iron out differences between the telecommunications
bills passed by their respective bodies.  They have reached apparent
closure on a compromise that would begin the process of creating
a new telecom &quot;playing field&quot; based on policies of competition,
open entry and market forces.
<P>Recently, disagreements have arisen
on one of the bill's major provisions, which addresses the allocation
of a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum for use by broadcasters.
 These disagreements threaten to delay or even derail final action
on a bill which has the potential to generate tremendous benefits
for consumers.
<P>
As background, the FCC is proposing to allocate
6 MHz licenses in today's UHF TV band  for the development of
so-called &quot;Advanced Television&quot; (ATV)(1), a new digital
technology that has indeed shown great promise.  Enormous controversy
exists over how these licenses should be assigned.  The current
legislation would require the FCC to limit eligibility for these
licenses to existing broadcasters who would, at some unspecified
time in the future, return their current spectrum to the government
following a transition to the new digital system(2).  Others,
most notably Senator Dole, contend that the licenses should be
assigned on the basis of competitive bidding or auctions among
all comers, a move the FCC believes could generate $10 to $70
billion in revenues. 
<P>
What's gotten lost in this debate is principle,
and the principle is property.  The paramount goal of spectrum
reform should be to channel existing broadcast spectrum -- and
new, so-called ATV spectrum - to its highest and best use.  Auctions
are one of several necessary reforms.  Far more important is the
need to give spectrum users the marketplace freedom and incentives
to deploy spectrum and new digital technologies efficiently. 
Giving existing and new spectrum users more flexibility to use
their spectrum as they see fit (as long as they do not interfere
with their spectrum &quot;neighbors&quot;) will create strong
economic incentives for spectrum users to weigh the relative merits
of possible uses.  Such flexibility and incentives are best achieved
through property rights. 
<P>
Government ownership and micromanagement
of the broadcast spectrum dates to Herbert Hoover's decision in
1927 to expropriate the spectrum on behalf of the Federal government.
 Since that time, the government has meted out  limited duration
&quot;licenses&quot; allowing use of the spectrum only under the
tightest of government controls.  The centrally-planned FCC system
typified by the current approach to ATV lacks the market flexibility,
incentives and information necessary to direct spectrum to its
highest and best use.  Time and again,  the FCC has made overly
rigid spectrum allocations and impeded new technologies.  Indeed,
the administrative process has been used as a weapon against consumers
by existing competitors to disadvantage new entrants and innovative
technologies.
<P>
The solution to the current broadcast spectrum conundrum
is to recognize the error of Herbert Hoover's ways -- or at least
their obsolescence -- and return to a property rights regime for
the broadcast spectrum.
<P>
Specifically, broadcasters' rights to their
current spectrum should be recognized as property, pure and simple.
 They should be given, in effect, fee simple title to the spectrum
they now hold and be allowed to use it for any technology or service
customers want; or, if they prefer, to sell it to new owners.
<P>
As
for the new spectrum, it too should be relieved from government
control and returned to the private sector.  Auctions -- properly
constructed and without the myriad of special interest preferences
that have characterized previous auctions -- should be held as
soon as possible.  Winning bidders should also receive fee simple
title to their property, without restrictions on use.
<P>
Is such a
proposal politically viable?  Only the politicians can decide.
 But it would accomplish three important objectives.
<P>
Broadcasters
would be given something they do not now have -- an asset they
could use, borrow against or sell.  They would be able to use
their current spectrum for new technologies in entrepreneurial
ways currently prohibited by the FCC's licensing restrictions.
 And, if they decided they really do need the new spectrum to
make the transition to some new form of digital television, they
could borrow against the value of their current spectrum to capitalize
their participation in the auctions.
<P>
Deficit hawks would also get
their wish -- the near-term auction of the new spectrum.  And,
since the auction would now offer fee simple title, rather than
the government-limited licenses envisioned by the FCC, there is
every reason to believe it would generate even more money than
currently estimated.
<P>
Finally, and most important, the American
people would get back a small piece of what Herbert Hoover took
away in 1927, and take an important first step toward restoring
ownership of the entire electromagnetic spectrum to America's
entrepreneurial, innovative private sector, where it can contribute
to the prosperity potential of the information revolution.   Such
a step is essential to maintaining America's advantage in the
worldwide digital marketplace -- the fastest growing segment of
the global economy.<P><br>

their individual capacity and do not necessarily represent the
views and/or position of their respective institutions and/or
telecommunications affiliations.  Greg Sidak, who was unable to
review this work, and  Tom Hazlett, both of AEI, are members of
the Working Group but have not approved this commentary.
<li> The transition would involve not only the construction of digital broadcasting facilities but also the purchase by consumers of digital receivers (new TV sets, or converters for their current sets).  Such a transition could easily take a decade or more during which broadcasters would retain licenses to their current spectrum, so long as they continue broadcasting analog television signals.

<h3>WHY RELIGION MATTERS: THE IMPACT OF RELIGIOUS PRACTICE ON SOCIAL STABILITY</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/fagan.htm">Patrick F. Fagan</a><br>
William H.G. FitzGerald Senior Fellow in Family and Cultural Issues<sup>1</sup><br><a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>Backgrounder No. 1064<br>

<hr width=50%></center><p>

<b>INTRODUCTION<sup>2</sup></b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;By extolling freedom of religion in the schools, President Bill Clinton has raised the level of debate on the importance of religion to American life.<sup>3</sup>  The time is ripe for a deeper dialogue on the contribution of religion to the welfare of the nation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;America has always been a religious country. "Its first Christian inhabitants were only too anxious to explain what they were doing and why," explains historian Paul Johnson. "In a way the first American settlers were like the ancient Israelites. They saw themselves as active agents of divine providence."<sup>4</sup>  Today, he adds, "it is generally accepted that more than half the American people still attend a place of worship over a weekend, an index of religious practice unequaled anywhere in the world, certainly in a great and populous nation."<sup>5</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At the heart of religious practice is prayer: Americans pray even more than they go to church. According to a composite of surveys, 94 percent of blacks, 91 percent of women, 87 percent of whites, and 85 percent of men regard themselves as people who pray regularly. Some 78 percent pray at least once per week, and 57 percent pray daily. Even among the 13 percent of the population who call themselves agnostics or atheists, some 20 percent pray daily.<sup>6</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;When policymakers consider America's grave social problems, including violent crime and rising illegitimacy, substance abuse, and welfare dependency, they should heed the findings in the professional literature of the social sciences on the positive consequences that flow from the practice of religion.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For example, there is ample evidence that:<p><ul><li> The strength of the family unit is intertwined with the practice of religion. Churchgoers<sup>8</sup> are more likely to be married, less likely to be divorced or single, and more likely to manifest high levels of satisfaction in marriage.
<p>
<li> Church attendance is the most important predictor of marital stability and happiness.
<p>
<li> The regular practice of religion helps poor persons move out of poverty. Regular church attendance, for example, is particularly instrumental in helping young people to escape the poverty of inner-city life.
<p>
<li>Religious belief and practice contribute substantially to the formation of personal moral criteria and sound moral judgment.
<p>
<li> Regular religious practice generally inoculates individuals against a host of social problems, including suicide, drug abuse, out-of-wedlock births, crime, and divorce.
<p>
<li> The regular practice of religion also encourages such beneficial effects on mental health as less depression (a modern epidemic), more self-esteem, and greater family and marital happiness.
<p>
<li> In repairing damage caused by alcoholism, drug addiction, and marital breakdown, religious belief and practice are a major source of strength and recovery.
<p>
<li> Regular practice of religion is good for personal physical health: It increases longevity, improves one's chances of recovery from illness, and lessens the incidence of many killer diseases.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The overall impact of religious practice is illustrated dramatically in the three most comprehensive systematic reviews of the field.<sup>9</sup>  Some 81 percent of the studies showed the positive benefit of religious practice, 15 percent showed neutral effects, and only 4 percent showed harm.<sup>10</sup>  Each of these systematic reviews indicated more than 80 percent benefit, and none indicated more than 10 percent harm. Even this 10 percent may be explained by more recent social science insights into "healthy religious practice" and "unhealthy religious practice."<sup>11</sup>  This latter notion will be discussed later -- it is seen generally by most Americans of religious faith as a mispractice of religion. Unfortunately, the effects of unhealthy religious practice are used to downplay the generally positive influence of religion.<sup>12</sup>  This both distorts the true nature of religious belief and practice and causes many policymakers to ignore its positive social consequences.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Religious practice appears to have enormous potential for addressing today's social problems. As summarized in 1991 by Allen Bergin, professor of psychology at Brigham Young University, considerable evidence indicates that religious involvement reduces "such problems as sexual permissiveness, teen pregnancy, suicide, drug abuse, alcoholism, and to some extent deviant and delinquent acts, and increases self esteem, family cohesiveness and general well being.... Some religious influences have a modest impact whereas another portion seem like the mental equivalent of nuclear energy.... More generally, social scientists are discovering the continuing power of religion to protect the family from the forces that would tear it down."<sup>13</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Professor Bergin's summary was echoed two years later by nationally syndicated columnist William Raspberry: "Almost every commentator on the current scene bemoans the increase of violence, lowered ethical standards and loss of civility that mark American society. Is the decline of religious influence part of what is happening to us?  Is it not just possible that anti-religious bias masquerading as religious neutrality is costing more than we have been willing to acknowledge?"<sup>14</sup>  Other reviews<sup>15</sup> also list the positive effects of religious belief and practice in reducing such problems as suicide, substance abuse, divorce, and marital dissatisfaction. Such evidence indicates clearly that religious practice contributes significantly to the quality of American life.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Given this evidence, <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Congress should:</b><ul>
<p>
<li> Begin a new national debate to help renew the role of religion in American life;
<p>
<li> Ask the General Accounting Office (GAO) to review the evidence on the beneficial effects of religious practice in the relevant social science literature and report its findings to a national commission formed to promote the consideration of religious practice among U.S. citizens;
<p>
<li> Fund federal experiments with school choice that include religiously affiliated schools;
<p>
<li>Pass a sense-of-the-Congress resolution that data on religious practice are useful for policymakers and researchers as part of the public policy debate; and
<p>
<li> Mandate a census question on religious practice. It violates nobody's freedom of religion for Congress to know the level and intensity of religious practice in America.
<p>
</ul>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The President should:</b>
<p>
<ul>

<li> Appoint judges who are more sensitive to the role of religion in public life, with the Senate ensuring that such is the case by ascertaining the stand of judges on matters of religion and its relationship to the Constitution;
<p>
<li> Direct the Bureau of the Census to record levels of religious practice in the census for the year 2000 (time is running out for preparation of the census questionnaire); and
<p>
<li> Issue a directive to all federal agencies making clear that cooperation between government entities and the social, medical, and educational services of faith-based organizations does not violate separation of church and state.
</ul><p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The U.S. Supreme Court should:</b>

<b>RELIGION AND HAPPINESS</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Ever since Aristotle outlined the goal of a sound civil order in his <i>Politics</i>,<sup>16</sup> social and political scientists and social psychologists have been particularly interested in what makes human beings happy. Happy people tend to be productive and law-abiding. They learn well, make good citizens, and are invariably pleasant company. It turns out that the practice of religion has a significant effect on happiness and an overall sense of personal well-being. Religious affiliation and regular church attendance are near the top of the list for most people in explaining their own happiness<sup>17</sup> and serve as good predictors of who is most likely to have this sense of well-being.<sup>18</sup>  Happiness is greater and psychological stress is lower for those who attend religious services regularly.<sup>19</sup>  Those pursuing a personal relationship with God tend to have improved relationships with themselves and with others.<sup>20</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A large epidemiological study conducted by the University of California at Berkeley in 1971 found that the religiously committed had much less psychological distress than the uncommitted.<sup>21</sup>  Rodney Stark, now of the University of Washington, found the same in a 1970 study: The higher the level of religious attendance, the less stress suffered when adversity had to be endured.<sup>22</sup>  Similarly, in a longitudinal study of 720 adults conducted by David Williams of the University of Michigan, regular religious attendance led to much less psychological distress.<sup>23</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In 1991, David Larson, adjunct professor at the Northwestern and Duke University Schools of Medicine and president of the National Institute of Healthcare Research, completed a systematic review of studies on religious commitment and personal well-being. He found that the relationship is powerful and positive; overall, psychological functioning improved following a resumption of participation in religious worship for those who had stopped.<sup>24</sup><p>
<b>RELIGION AND FAMILY STABILITY</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There is a growing consensus that America needs to pursue policies aimed at re-strengthening the family. The beneficial effects of religious worship on family stability clearly indicate one way to help accomplish this. Professors Darwin L. Thomas and Gwendolyn C. Henry of Brigham Young University's Department of Sociology sum up earlier research<sup>25</sup> on the quest by young people for meaning and love: "Research on love clearly indicates that for many, love in the social realm cannot clearly be separated from love that contains a vertical or a divine element.... Young people see love as the central aspect of the meaning of life; they believe that religion is still important in helping form judgments and attitudes."<sup>26</sup>  Their conclusion: "Family and religious institutions need to be studied simultaneously in our efforts to understand the human condition better."<sup>27</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"Middletown," one of the century's classic sociological research projects, studied the lives of inhabitants of a typical American town, first in the 1920s and for the third time in the 1980s. Based on the latest round of follow-up research, Howard Bahr and Bruce Chadwick, professors of sociology at Brigham Young University, concluded in 1985 that "There is a relationship between family solidarity -- family health if you will -- and church affiliation and activity. Middletown [churchgoing] members were more likely to be married, remain married and to be highly satisfied with their marriages and to have more children.... The great divide between marriage status, marriage satisfaction and family size is... between those who identify with a church or denomination and those who do not."<sup>28</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Four years later, Professor Arland Thornton of the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan likewise concluded from a Detroit study of the same relationship that "These data indicate strong intergenerational transmission of religious involvement. Attendance at religious services is also very stable within generations across time."<sup>29</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"With striking consistency, the most religious among us [as Americans] place a greater importance on the full range of family and friendship activities," concluded a Connecticut Mutual Life report in 1982.<sup>30</sup>  A group of Kansas State University professors reached the same conclusion: "Family commitment is indeed a high priority in many American families and it is frequently accompanied by a concomitant factor of religious commitment."<sup>31</sup>  In yet another study conducted during the 1970s and 1980s, professors Nick Stinnet of the University of Alabama and John DeFrain of the University of Nebraska sought to identify family strengths. From their nationwide surveys of strong families, they found that 84 percent identified religion as an important contributor to the strength of their families.<sup>32</sup>  It should be noted that the same pattern appears to hold for African-American families: Parents who attended church frequently cited the significance of religion in rearing their children and in providing moral guidelines.<sup>33</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Marital Satisfaction.</b> Couples with long-lasting marriages indicate that the practice of religion is an important factor in marital happiness. Indeed, David Larson's systematic reviews indicate that church attendance is the most important predictor of marital stability.<sup>34</sup>  Others have found the same result.<sup>35</sup>  Twenty years ago it was first noted that very religious women achieve greater satisfaction in sexual intercourse with their husbands than do moderately religious or non-religious women.<sup>36</sup>  The <i>Sex in America</i> study published in 1995, and conducted by sociologists from the University of Chicago and the State University of New York at Stonybrook, also showed very high sexual satisfaction among "conservative" religious women.<sup>37</sup>  From the standpoint of contemporary American media culture, this may appear strange or counter-intuitive, but the empirical evidence is consistent.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Divorce and Cohabitation.</b> Regular church attendance is the critical factor in marital stability across denominations and overrides effects of doctrinal teaching on divorce. For instance, black Protestants and white Catholics, who share similarly high church attendance rates, have been shown to have similarly low divorce rates.<sup>38</sup>  Furthermore, when marital separation occurs, reconciliation rates are higher among regular church attendees, and highest when both spouses have the same high level of church attendance.<sup>39</sup>  Findings on the other end of the marital spectrum reinforce the point: A 1993 national survey of 3,300 men aged 20-39 found that those who switch partners most are those with no religious convictions.<sup>40</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Significantly, cohabitation before marriage poses a high risk to later marital stability,<sup>41</sup> and premarital cohabitation is much less common among religious Americans. "The cohabitation rate is seven times higher among persons who seldom or never attend religious services compared to persons who frequently attend," writes David Larson of the National Institute of Healthcare Research. "Women who attended religious services once a week were only one-third as likely to cohabit as those who attended church services less than once a month."  Furthermore, "If the mother frequently attended religious services, both sons and daughters were only 50 percent as likely to cohabit as adult children whose mothers were not actively religious."<sup>42</sup>  Rockford Institute President Allan Carlson summarizes the pattern: "Social scientists are discovering the continuing power of religion to protect the family from the forces that would tear it down."<sup>43</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The fact is that too many social scientists have failed to appreciate the significance of research on the relationship between family and religion. As another researcher of the same period concludes, "We may have underestimated this 'silent majority' and it is only fair to give them equal time."<sup>44</sup>  The centrality of stable married family life in avoiding such problems as crime,<sup>45</sup> illegitimacy,<sup>46</sup> and welfare<sup>47</sup> has become indisputable. If such a stable family life is linked closely to a lively religious life, as these studies indicate, then the peace and happiness of the nation depend significantly on a renewal of religious practice and belief.

<b>RELIGION AND PHYSICAL HEALTH</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In public health circles, the level of educational attainment is held to be the key demographic predictor of physical health. For over two decades, however, the level of religious practice has been shown convincingly to be equally important.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As early as 1972, researchers from the Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health found that cardiovascular diseases, the leading killers of older people, were reduced significantly in early old age by a lifetime of regular church attendance. By contrast, non-attendees had higher mortality rates for such other diseases as cirrhosis of the liver, emphysema, and arteriosclerosis, in addition to other cardiovascular diseases and even suicide.<sup>48</sup>  Research on mortality patterns among the poor confirmed a decade later that those who went to church regularly lived longer.<sup>49</sup>  Since then, other studies have reinforced this general finding.<sup>50</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Blood pressure, a key factor in cardiovascular health, is reduced significantly by regular church attendance, on average by 5mm of pressure.<sup>51</sup>  Given that reducing blood pressure by 2 to 4 mm also reduces the mortality rate by 10 to 20 percent for any given population,<sup>52</sup> a reduction of 5 mm is a very significant public health achievement by any standard. For those over 55 years of age, the average decrease was 6 mm. Among those who smoked -- a practice that increases blood pressure -- regular church attendance decreased the risk of early stroke by 700 percent.<sup>53</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Nor are the health benefits of religious commitment confined to the cardiovascular system. In 1987, a major review of 250 epidemiological health research studies -- studies which examined the relationship between health and religion and measured such additional outcomes as colitis, cancers of many different types, and longevity measures -- concluded that, in general, religious commitment improves health.<sup>54</sup>  A 1991 study of two national samples<sup>55</sup> also concluded that the degree to which people prayed and participated in religious services significantly affected their health status, regardless of age.<sup>56</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In what must be one of the most unusual experiments in medical history, Dr. Robert B. Byrd, a cardiologist then at the University of California at San Francisco Medical School, conducted a random-sample, double-blind study of the effects of prayer -- not <i>by</i> the patients but <i>for</i> the patients -- on the outcome of cardiac surgery. The study was published in 1982. None of the patients knew they were being prayed for, none of the attending doctors and nurses knew who was being prayed for and who was not, and those praying had no personal contact with the patients before or during the experiment. Outcomes for the two sets of patients differed significantly: Those prayed for ha
d noticeably fewer post-operative congestive heart failures, fewer cardiopulmonary arrests, less pneumonia, and less need for antibiotics.<sup>57</sup>  To date, this study has not been replicated, though the intriguing results challenge the academic and medical community to verify or disprove them.<p><b>RELIGION AND SOCIAL BREAKDOWN</b><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The practice of religion has beneficial effects on behavior and social relations: on illegitimacy, crime and delinquency, welfare dependency, alcohol and drug abuse, suicide, depression, and general self-esteem.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Illegitimacy.</b> One of the most powerful of all factors in preventing out-of-wedlock births is the regular practice of religious belief. Given the growing crisis in out-of-wedlock births, their effects,<sup>58</sup> and the huge social and economic costs to national and state budgets, this should be of major interest to policymakers.<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It has long been known that intensity of religious practice is closely related to adolescent virginity and sexual restraint and control. This general finding, replicated again and again,<sup>59</sup> also holds true specifically for black teenage girls,<sup>60</sup> the group with the highest teen pregnancy rates among all demographic subgroups.<sup>61</sup>  Reviews of the literature demonstrate that, nearly without exception, religious practice sharply reduces the incidence of premarital intercourse.<sup>62</sup>  The reverse is also true: The absence of religious practice accompanies sexual permissiveness and premarital sex. This is confirmed in numerous studies,<sup>63</sup> including a 1991 analysis of the federal government's National Longitudinal Survey of Youth.<sup>64</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The impact of religious practice on teenage sexual behavior also can be seen at the state level: States with higher levels of aggregate religiousness have lower rates of teenage pregnancy.<sup>65</sup><p
>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In an important study published in 1987, a group of professors from the Universities of Georgia, Utah, and Wyoming found that the main cause of problematic adolescent sexual behaviors and attitudes is not only family dynamics and processes, as previously thought, but the absence of religious behavior and affiliation. They further concluded that healthy family dynamics and practices are themselves caused to a powerful degree by the presence or absence of religious beliefs and practices.<sup>66</sup>  The same results also hold true in international comparisons.<sup>67</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As with drugs, alcohol, and crime, the religious behavior of the mother is one of the strongest predictors of the daughter's sexual attitudes.<sup>68</sup>  It also has long been known in the social sciences that daughters of single mothers are more likely to engage in premarital sexual behavior during adolescence.<sup>69</sup>  These mothers are more frequently permissive in their sexual attitudes, and religion for them has less importance than it has for mothers in two-parent families.<sup>70</sup>  These findings also have been replicated.<sup>71</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The religious practices of parents, particularly their unity on religious issues, powerfully influence the behavior of children. Thus, for policymakers interested in reducing teenage (and older) out-of-wedlock births, the lesson is clear: Religious belief and regular worship reduce the likelihood of this form of family breakdown. One faith-based sex education course that included both mothers and daughters, for example, was aimed specifically at reducing the teenage pregnancy rate. The results were notably successful: Out-of-wedlock births among the at-risk population were almost eliminated.<sup>72</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Crime and Delinquency.</b> A review of the small amount of research done on the relationship between crime and religion shows that states w
ith more religious populations tend to have fewer homicides and fewer suicides.<sup>73</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A four-year longitudinal, stratified, random-sample study of high school students in the Rocky Mountain region, published in 1975, demonstrated that religious involvement significantly decreased drug use, delinquency, and premarital sex, and also increased self-control.<sup>74</sup>  A 1989 study of midwestern high school students replicated these findings.<sup>75</sup>  Similarly, young religious adults in Canada were found in a 1979 study to be less likely to use or sell narcotics, to gamble, or to destroy property.<sup>76</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;What is true for youth is also true for adults.<sup>77</sup>  Religious behavior, as opposed to mere attitude or affiliation, is associated with reduced crime.<sup>78</sup>  This has been known in the social science literature for over 20 years.<sup>79</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In research conducted in the late 1980s -- controlling for family, economic, and religious backgrounds -- a research team from the University of Nevada found that black men who eventually ended up in prison and those who did not came respectively from two different groups: those who did not go to church, or stopped going around ten years of age, and those who went regularly.<sup>80</sup>  This failure of faith at the onset of adolescence parallels the pattern found among those who become alcoholics or drug addicts. Clearly, the family's inability to inspire regular religious worship among emerging young adults is a sign of internal weakness.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Welfare Dependency.</b> In his classic study <i>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</i>, Max Weber, the preeminent German sociologist of the first half of the 20th century, demonstrated the connection between religious practice and financial well-being among Protestants. Other work on the same theme shows that this is not confined to Protestants, but that it applies across a longer period of history and across denominational lines.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This link between religion and prosperity has important implications for the poor. In 1985, for instance, Richard B. Freeman of the National Bureau of Economic Research reported that:
<p><blockquote>
	[Church attendance] is associated with substantial differences in the behavior of [black male youths from poverty-stricken inner-city neighborhoods] and thus in their chances to "escape" from inner city poverty. It affects allocation of time, school-going, work activity and the frequency of socially deviant activity.... It is important to recognize that our analysis has identified an important set of variables that separate successful from unsuccessful young persons in the inner city. There is a significant number of inner city youth, readily identifiable, who succeed in escaping that pathology of inner-city slum life.<sup>81</sup></blockquote><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Ongoing studies by Professor Ranald Jarrell of the Department of Education at Arizona State University West show the power of religious belief and practice in encouraging a spirit of optimism among socially at-risk but advancing children. The subjects are students at the De La Salle Academy, an independent school in the upper west side of Manhattan serving primarily poor inner-city black and Hispanic middle school children who show substantial academic promise. Within this group, the highest concentration of pessimists is found among students with the lowest attendance at church. Those who attend church weekly or more frequently, on the other hand, exhibit the following profiles:
<P><ul>
<li> They are more optimistic about their futures;
<p>
<li> They have better relationships with their parents;
<p>
<li> They are more likely to dismiss racism as an obstacle to reaching their goals;
<p>
<li> They are more likely to have serious and realistic goals for their futures;
<p>
<li> They are more likely to see the world as a friendly place in which they can achieve, rather than as a hostile world with powerful forces arrayed against them; and
<p>
<li> They are more likely to see themselves as in control of their own futures, whereas those who do not attend church are more likely to see themselves as victims of oppression.<sup>82</sup></ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), the best national sample for tracking the development of America's youth from the late 1970s, clearly indicate the difference regular religious practice makes for those who grew up in poverty in the 1970s and 1980s. Among those who attended church weekly in both 1979 and 1982, average family income in 1993 was $37,021; among those who never attended church in 1979 or 1982, however, average family income in 1993 was $24,361 --  a difference of $12,660.<sup>83</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Other studies also show that growing up in an intact family correlates significantly and positively with future earnings.<sup>84</sup>  However, the NLSY data show that regular religious practice benefits both those who grow up in intact families <i>and</i> those who grow up in broken families. The other differences remain, but the positive impact of religion on both groups is evident.<sup>85</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Alcohol and Drug Abuse.</b> The relationship between religious practice and the moderate use or avoidance of alcohol is well documented,<sup>86</sup> regardless of whether denominational beliefs prohibit the use of alcohol.<sup>87</sup>  According to general studies, the higher the level of religious involvement, the less likely the use or abuse of alcohol.<sup>88</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Persons who abuse alcohol rarely have a strong religious commitment.<sup>89</sup>  In their study of the development of alcohol abuse, David Larson and William P. Wilson, professors of psychiatry at Northwestern University School of Medicine, found that nine out of ten alcoholics had lost interest in religion in their teenage years, in sharp contrast to teenagers generally, among whom interest in religion increased by almost 50 percent and declined by only 14 percent.<sup>90</sup>  Robert Coombs and his colleagues at the University of California at Los Angeles School of Medicine found that alcohol abuse is 300 percent higher among those who do not attend church.<sup>91</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Drug and alcohol use is lowest in the most conservative religious denominations and highest in non-religious groups, while liberal church groups have use rates just slightly lower than those for non-religious groups. But for all groups, religious commitment correlates with absence of drug abuse.<sup>92</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Significantly, involvement in any religious denomination or group generally decreases the level of drug use regardless of whether the denomination teaches against the use of alcohol, although denominations that teach against any use of drugs or alcohol exhibit the highest rates of drug avoidance. Among traditional American religions, Mormons have the highest denominational association between religious doctrine and drug avoidance; they also have the most restrictive proscriptions against drug use. On the other hand, Roman Catholics have the highest alcohol use rate; their religion condemns the abuse of alcohol but does not proscribe its use.<sup>93</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Attendance at church and related religious activities has special significance for drug use among teenagers. In a 1985 study of young girls aged between 9 and 17, less than 10 percent of those who reported attending religious services weekl
y or more often indicated any drug or alcohol use, compared with 38 percent of all those studied.<sup>94</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The parental attitude to religion also is important in dealing with alcohol use. A 1985 study indicated that if the mother and father have deep, competing differences toward religious belief and practice, their children are more likely to use or abuse alcohol than are children whose parents do not differ on matters of religion. Conversely, if their parents' religious beliefs and practices are similar, children are far more likely to abstain from alcohol or to drink with moderation.<sup>95</sup>  Almost three decades before these findings, Orville Walters, then a research fellow at the Menninger School of Psychiatry in Topeka, Kansas, found that alcoholics who came from religious backgrounds tended to have mothers who were highly religious but fathers who were more non-religious.<sup>96</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For over four decades it has been known,<sup>97</sup> and replicated,<sup>98</sup> that alcoholics with a religious background or strong religious beliefs are much more likely to seek help and treatment. Indeed, Alcoholics Anonymous, the major organization combating alcoholism in America, has known for over half a century that the most effective element in its program is its religious or spiritual component.<sup>99</sup>  David Larson of the National Institute for Healthcare Research notes: "Even after alcoholism has been established, religion is often a powerful force in achieving abstinence. Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) uses religion, invoking a Higher Power to help alcoholics recover from addiction."<sup>100</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Paralleling the research on alcohol addiction, an early review of studies of drug addiction found a lack of religious commitment to be a predictor of who abuses drugs.<sup>101</sup>  Many more recent studies replicate this finding.<sup>102</sup>  As in so many other research studies, the best 
measurement of religious commitment is frequency of church attendance: "Overall church attendance was more strongly related to [less] drug use than was intensity of religious feelings."<sup>103</sup>  This is true for both males and females. According to Jerald G. Bachman of the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan, "Factors we found to be most important in predicting use of marijuana and other drugs during the late 1970's remained most important during the early 1980's. Drug use is below average among those with strong religious commitments."<sup>104</sup>  The more powerfully addictive the drug being considered, the more powerful is the impact of church attendance in preventing its use.<sup>105</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In results almost identical to those for alcoholics, researchers at the National Institute of Drug Abuse, a section of the National Institutes of Health and the nation's premier drug abuse research facility, found in their interviews of narcotic addicts that "the addict had neither current religious preference nor a history of attending religious services.... In addition... the addicts' fathers were much less involved in regular or frequent religious practices, than were a parallel group of control fathers.... Religiously, the mother was far more involved than her husband, the difference in regular religious participation between the addict's parents being twice that for the control's parents.... Religiously, the addicts were significantly less involved in reading the Bible, and praying."  They also had far more frequent loss of interest in religion during adolescence.<sup>106</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Louis A. Cancellaro of the Department of Psychiatry at the Veterans Administration in Johnson City, Tennessee, writes that, "Like their fathers, addicts are less religiously involved than their normal peers, and during adolescence, less frequently make decisions either to become more interested in religion or to commit themselves to a re
ligious philosophy to live by."<sup>107</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In reviewing the religious treatment of addicts, research psychiatrists at the Duke University Department of Psychiatry concluded in 1992: "[The] role of religious commitment and religiously oriented treatment programs can be significant factors which ought to be considered and included when planning a mix of appropriate treatment alternatives.... Perhaps the greatest advantage of religious programs is their recourse to churches as a support system.... Religious treatment programs are not suitable for everyone. For those men and women who can accept the creeds, rituals, and commitments required of such programs there seem to be certain advantages."<sup>108</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Suicide.</b> The practice of religion reduces the rate of suicide, both in the United States and abroad.<sup>109</sup>  In fact, the rate of church attendance predicts the suicide rate better than any other factor (including unemployment, traditionally regarded as the most powerful variable). Those who attend church frequently are four times less likely to commit suicide than those who never attend. Conversely, the national decline in church attendance is associated with a heightened suicide rate; fluctuations in church attendance rates in the 1970s paralleled the suicide rates for different subgroups: whites, blacks, men, and women.<sup>110</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Steven Stack, professor of sociology at Pennsylvania State University, in a landmark 1985 study on the demography of suicide has found that "Families and religion change together over time.... As the importance of the domestic-religious institutional complex declines, the study finds a rise in the rate of suicide, both for the general population and for the age cohort at the center of the decline, the youth cohort."<sup>111</sup>  In another, earlier study, Stack broke new ground in finding that the effect of unemployment in causing suicide is greatl
y diminished when religious behavior is factored into the equation.<sup>112</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In inter-state comparisons, higher levels of church attendance are associated with lower rates of suicide.<sup>113</sup>  The same holds true in international comparisons.<sup>114</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Depression.</b> Religion appears to reduce the incidence of depression among those with medical problems. For instance, University of Michigan Professor of Sociology David Williams conducted a randomized survey of 720 adults suffering from leg and hip injuries in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1990. Those who attended religious services regularly were less depressed and less distressed by life events than those who did not. This finding held across age, race, socioeconomic status, educational attainment, and religious affiliation. Religious affiliation alone did not have these effects, but religious behavior did.<sup>115</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Younger people also tend to experience fewer of the anxieties of growing up if they are religious. For instance, both male and female Texas high-schoolers found that religious beliefs gave meaning to their lives and reduced the incidence of depression among them.<sup>116</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Self-esteem.</b> The absence of self-esteem weakens the personality and puts the person at greater risk for crime, addictions, and other social maladies.<sup>117</sup>  In all religious denominations, psychological weaknesses decrease as religious orthodoxy increases.<sup>118</sup>  Among college students, for instance, the practice of religion was shown in 1969 to have a positive effect on mental health;<sup>119</sup> students involved with campus ministries were much healthier and made much less use of mental health services.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Significantly, self-esteem is linked to a person's image of God. Those with high self-esteem think of God primarily as loving, while those 
with low self-esteem think of God primarily as punitive.<sup>120</sup>  This was observed by Carl Jung, one of the most influential pioneers of modern psychology and psychotherapy: "Among all my patients in the second half of my life... there has not been one whose problem in the last resort was not that of finding a religious outlook on life. It is safe to say that every one of them fell ill because he had lost that which the living religions of every age have given their followers and none of them has been really healed who did not regain his religious outlook."<sup>121</sup>  Other evidence exists that people with a religious commitment, whether young or old, who become emotionally or psychologically distressed are much more likely to seek help.<sup>122</sup><p><b>UNDERSTANDING "INTRINSIC" AND "EXTRINSIC" RELIGIOUS BEHAVIOR</b><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Recent advances in the investigation of religious behavior have led social scientists to distinguish between two distinct categories or orientations: "intrinsic" and "extrinsic."  Intrinsic practice is God-oriented and based on beliefs which transcend the person's own existence. Research shows this form of religious practice to be beneficial. Extrinsic practice is self-oriented and characterized by outward observance, not internalized as a guide to behavior or attitudes. The evidence suggests this form of religious practice is actually more harmful than no religion: Religion directed toward some end other than God, or the transcendent, typically degenerates into a rationalization for the pursuit of other ends such as status, personal security, self justification, or sociability.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The difference between these two forms of religious practice have implications for future research and for the interpretation of all research on religious practice. There is a radical difference between what religious people know to be conversion of the spirit or heart and simply conforming external behavior for its own sake, or for benefits derived from religious behavior.<sup>123</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;William James, professor of psychology at Harvard University in the early 1900s and a pioneer in the psychological study of religious behavior, was the first to make the social science distinction between the two forms of religious practice. Gordon Allport, his successor at Harvard in the late 1960s, concluded: "I feel equally sure that mental health is facilitated by an intrinsic, but not an extrinsic, religious orientation."<sup>124</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The two orientations lead to two very different sets of psychological effects. For instance, "intrinsics" have a greater sense of responsibility and greater internal control, are more self-motivated, and do better in their studies. By contrast, "extrinsics" are more likely to be dogmatic, authoritarian, and less responsible, to have less internal control, to be less self-directed, and to do less well in their studies.<sup>125</sup>  Intrinsics are more concerned with moral standards, conscientiousness, discipline, responsibility, and consistency than are extrinsically religious people.<sup>126</sup>  They also are more sensitive to others and more open to their own emotions. By contrast, extrinsics are more self-indulgent, indolent, and likely to lack dependability. For example, the most racially prejudiced people turn out to be those who go to church occasionally<sup>127</sup> and those who are extrinsic in their practice of religion.<sup>128</sup>  These findings have been replicated<sup>129</sup> in a number of different forms.<sup>130</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;T
he contrasting effects show up in college students. Intrinsically religious students tend to have internal locus of control, intrinsic motives, and a higher grade point average.<sup>131</sup>  By contrast, a 1980 study indicated that extrinsically religious students were more dogmatic and authoritarian, less responsible and less motivated, had less internal locus of control, and had a lower grade point average. Intrinsically religious students were found to have a greater concern for moral standards and to be more conscientious, disciplined, responsible, and consistent, while the extrinsic were more self-indulgent, more indolent, and less dependable.<sup>132</sup><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In general, intrinsics are less anxious about life's ups and downs, while extrinsics are more anxious. Further, the religious beliefs and practices of intrinsics are more integrated; for instance, they are more likely to worship publicly as well as pray privately. By contrast, those who pray privately but do not worship publicly tend to have a higher level of general anxiety -- a characteristic of extrinsics generally.<sup>133</sup>  In an ironic set of findings on anxiety about death, extrinsics fared worst of all: worse than intrinsics and worse than those without religious beliefs.<sup>134</sup>  From a purely social science standpoint, the intrinsic form of religion is thus good and desirable, and the extrinsic form is harmful. Religious teachers, without being utilitarian, would agree.<sup>135</sup>
<p>

<b>RELIGION AND THE SOCIAL SCIENCES</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There is a tension between practitioners of social science and religious belief.<sup>136</sup>  Darwin L. Thomas and Gwendolyn C. Henry, professors of sociology at Brigham Young University, write: "From the work of Freud and others, much of the early history of the social sciences is characterized by the expectation that involvement in and reliance upon the religious institution will be associated with people who have a low sense of personal well-being."<sup>137</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There is repeated evidence that much the same hostility to religion -- a hostility at variance with the attitude of the vast majority of Americans -- persists among members of America's professional elites.<sup>138</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Stephen L. Carter, professor of law at Yale University, points out that "One sees a trend in our political and legal cultures toward treating religious beliefs as arbitrary and unimportant, a trend supported by rhetoric that implies that there is something wrong with religious devotion. More and more, our culture seems to take the position that believing deeply in the tenets of one's faith represents a kind of mystical irrationality, something that thoughtful, public-spirited American citizens would do better to avoid."<sup>139</sup>  However, the available evidence renders such opposition unreasonable.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Professor David Larson of Duke University Medical School draws attention to similar biases in the mental health professions. Consider <i>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual</i>, the standard reference manual for the classification of mental illnesses, which essentially defines the practice of psychiatrists, clinical psychology, and clinical social work and is central to the practice, research, and financing of these professions. In the third edition, religious examples were used only as illustrations in discussions of mental illness, such as delusions, incoherence, and illogical thinking. The latest edition has corrected this bias.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Consider also the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, one of the most widely used of all psychological tests. In the MMPI, all the positive religion-connected traits -- self-discipline, altruism, humility, obedience to authority, conventional morality -- are weighted negatively. Thus, to choose the self-description "I am orthodoxly religious" is to detract from one's mental health standing. Conversely, several traits that religious people would regard as diminishing themselves, at least in some situations -- self-assertion, self-expression, and a high opinion of oneself -- are weighted positively.<sup>140</sup>  The latest editions of the MMPI have removed the biased items.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Despite this general hostility among social science and mental health professionals, the empirical evidence shows religion to be a very powerful and positive part of everyday life. Patrick McNamara, professor of sociology at the University of New Mexico, explains the difference between social scientists and religiously affiliated people generally: "Sociologists tend to see concern for personal challenge -- e.g. to get one's own moral life in order -- as somehow secondary to social challenge or the effort to identify and criticize those socioeconomic structures that inhibit the individual's own group from attaining a fuller human existence."<sup>141</sup>  McNamara continues: "In [the] typical social science analysis, the demands of the inner life are neglected and personal agency and autonomy exercised in the choice to examine one's own life and put it in order according to an internalized ethic of repentance... is not acknowledged."<sup>142</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Despite the attitude of many professionals, Gallup surveys continue to indicate that one-third of the American people regard religious commitment as the most important dimension in their lives. Another third regard religion as a very important, though not the single most dominant, factor in their lives.<sup>143</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Totally secular approaches to many issues -- public policy, psychotherapy, and education -- use an alien framework for this two-thirds of the population. The plain fact is that religion plays a powerful role in the personal and social lives of most Americans. It is a role that should be understood clearly by the professions, by policymakers, and by the media.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;From many other areas of social science research -- family dynamics, group dynamics, marital dynamics -- positive reciprocal relationships with others are known to be powerful across a host of areas similar to those reviewed in this paper: stress, ability to relate with others in general, productivity, and learning, to name just a few. The core of the religious commitment is an intention to have a positive relationship with another Being, a transcendent and therefore all-available Being. Viewed in this fashion, the documented effects of religious commitment are not mysterious, but an extension of the effects which we know arise from positive relations between human beings. Thus, the findings on religion fit with the general corpus of what is known about relationships from the existing body of social science research.
<p>

<b>POLICY IMPLICATIONS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The evidence indicates strongly that it is a good social policy to foster the widespread practice of religion. It is bad social policy to block it. The widespread practice of religious beliefs is one of America's greatest national resources. It strengthens individuals, families, communities, and society as a whole. It significantly affects educational and job attainment and reduces the incidence of such major social problems as out-of-wedlock births, drug and alcohol addiction, crime, and delinquency. No other dimension of the nation's life, other than the health of the family (which the data show also is tied powerfully to religious practice) should be of more concern to those who guide the future course of the United States.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The original intent of the Founding Fathers was to bar the establishment by the federal government of a state-approved religion, not to bar religion from the operations of the state. Thomas Jefferson made this distinction very clear in the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom (January 16, 1786):
<p><blockquote>	
We, the General Assembly of Virginia do enact that no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burthened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer, on account of his religious opinions or belief: but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge or affect their civil capacities.<sup>144</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;George Washington summed up the importance of religion to the new nation with particular eloquence in his farewell address:
<p><blockquote>
	Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism who should labor to subvert these great pillars of human happiness -- these firmest props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not trace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it simply be asked, Where is the security for property, for reputation, for life, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths which are the instruments of investigation in courts of justice?  And let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.
<p>
	&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;'Tis substantially true that virtue or morality is a necessary spring of popular government. The rule indeed extends with more or less force to every species of free government. Who that is a sincere friend to it can look with indifference upon attempts to shake the foundation of the fabric?<sup>145</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A policy can be friendly to the general practice of religion, and to the many different faiths in a pluralistic society, without in any way implying the establishment of a particular religion. Federal policies encourage many other institutions: the marketplace, education, medicine, science, and the arts. Even religion itself is explicitly encouraged by the tax treatment of contributions to religious institutions. It makes no sense, therefore, not to encourage the resource that most powerfully addresses the major social problems confronting the nation. Congress and the President can help to accomplish this by acting decisively in at least six specific areas:
<p><ul>
<li> Congress, and the Senate in particular, should lead a new national debate on the renewed role of religion in American life. With his recent guidance to school administrators on prayer in school, President Clinton has opened the national discussion. The Senate once was the chamber for debate on the great issues of the day. It is time for it to take up that role again on the relationship between the practice of religion and the life of the nation, on the health of America's families and the content of its culture.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;America needs a major national debate on the true role of religion in a free and pluralistic society. For many decades, the once-prominent place of religion in society has been eroded. Religious leaders, who should be in the forefront of moral and spiritual renewal, have been cowed into a strange timidity. Americans of religious belief should not be bullied into believing that in all things related to the public good, religion is to remain off limits. The constitutional freedom of religion does not mean the constitutional barring of religion from the public square.
<p>
<li> Congress should pass a resolution affirming that data on religious practice are important to the nation, to policymakers, and to the research needed to inform the public debate. The gathering of data that touch on religious practice often is blocked in research on social issues funded by the federal government.<sup>146</sup>  Because government funds a huge proportion of the nation's funded social research, this has a chilling effect. But the relationship between religious practice and the social issues under investigation by government, such as out-of-wedlock births, crime and delinquency, addiction, economic dependency, medical and psychiatric problems, and learning capacity, should be explored. A sense-of-the-Congress resolution would remove the excuse that it is not permissible for federally funded research to touch on this aspect of life.
<p>
<li> Congress should mandate a census question on religious practice. The census for the year 2000 ought to ask about frequency of attendance at church or synagogue. It violates nobody's freedom of religion for Congress to know the level and intensity of religious worship in the United States. Also, many of the annual sample surveys conducted by the Bureau of the Census would be significantly better informed if similar information were gathered in those surveys.
<p>
<li> Congress should commission research on the relationship between regular church attendance and social issues. This research should focus on the social issues which continue to increase the burden borne by the American taxpayer, including crime, drug use, health of the elderly, out-of-wedlock births, and poverty.
<p>
<li> Congress should fund federal experiments with school choice that include choice of religiously affiliated schools. To deny financial support to parents who cannot afford to send their children to religiously oriented schools is to deny such education to those children who may need it most and confine it to those rich enough to afford it. The United States of America and the now-defunct Union of Soviet Socialist Republics are the only major modern states to deny funding to faith-based schools.
<p>
<li> The President should appoint, and the Senate should confirm, judges who are sensitive to the role of religion in public life. Religion should not be crowded out of every activity in which government is involved. And yet, this is precisely what has been happening for the last 30 years as government has encroached more and more on virtually every area of American life: family, school, and marketplace. This does not make sense for any society -- and it has weakened ours.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Columnist William Raspberry has put his finger on the problem. In his historic majority opinion in the 1947 <i>Everson v. Board of Education</i> case (330 U.S. 1), notes Raspberry, Justice Hugo Black wrote that government is forbidden to "pass laws which aid any religion, aid all religion, or prefer one religion over another." 
<p><blockquote>
	The first and third elements in the Black proscription seem to me to jibe with the "establishment" clause of the Constitution. The middle one suggests that the only proper position of government is hostility to religion -- which seems to be the prevailing view among civil libertarians and a majority of the Supreme Court.<sup>147</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This calls to mind the words of the late William O. Douglas, one of the most liberal of Supreme Court Justices, who wrote in the 1950s:
<p><blockquote>
	We are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being. We guarantee the freedom to worship as one chooses. [When] the state encourages religious instruction or cooperates with religious authorities by adjusting the schedule of public events to sectarian needs, [it] respects the religious nature of our people and accommodates the public service to their spiritual needs. To hold that it may not would be to find in the Constitution a requirement that the government show a callous indifference to religious groups. That would be preferring those who believe in no religion over those who do believe.<sup>148</sup>
</blockquote><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Senate should ask all future candidates for federal court appointments to clarify their opinions regarding both the role of religion in the life of the body politic and their understanding of the Founding Fathers' intent on this issue.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But this problem is far too important to be left to government. America's religious leaders and individual citizens also must act:
<p><ul>
<li> They must draw attention to the enormous and beneficial effects on society of the true practice of religion. As leaders of the nation's religious communities, they should assert their right to be regarded as critical in the nurturing of stable marriages and healthy families. Religion performs the foundational work that ensures the success of secular society's other four basic institutions: family, school, marketplace, and government.
<p>
<li> They must emphasize the need for religious formation. While the social works of mercy carried out by religious congregations will be needed more and more to repair the damage from the breakdown of the family, only a religious institution can give a religious orientation to those who are searching for answers to the mysteries of human life: love and suffering in birth, marriage, family life, and death. Religious beliefs help the individual acquire central organizing principles for life and an understanding of God. Aided by this sense and these principles, an individual can avoid the unnecessary suffering that stems from bad choices and attain the benefits that flow from good choices followed steadily through life. Today, schools are forbidden to participate in this critical work. Only religious leaders can provide this all-important service to society.
<p>
<li> They must take special care of the religious formation of children at risk of losing their faith in God, especially during the transition period from childhood to adolescence. The empirical research indicates that there is a critical stage in the development of young adults, from around ten years of age through later adolescence, during which they decide whether they will engage in the religious dialogue of searching for ultimate truths and meaning. The young adolescent who turns away from religion at this stage may well lose his anchoring in the community and is at greater risk for a host of problems that can subvert his personal happiness for a lifetime. Increased attention to this aspect of religious ministry will yield great benefits to the nation. Of particular concern to public policy leaders are the problems that plague America's inner cities: out-of-wedlock births, addiction, and crime. These neighborhoods need the benefits of religious belief and practice. They are "mission" territories that beckon loudly.
<p>
<li> They must use the ability of inner-city churches, especially black churches, to help low-income African-Americans escape from the degrading culture of inner-city poverty. Many religious leaders, with the best of intentions, have concentrated on the material aspects of their work, forgetting that the most powerful help they can give is in the spiritual dimension, and that this has a significant effect on material well-being. Regular church attendance will do more to help a child get out of poverty than anything else the religious leader can provide. And it will transform the community if most people can be persuaded to become church members.
</ul>
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The available evidence clearly demonstrates that regular religious practice is both an individual and social good. It is a powerful answer to many of our most significant social problems, some of which, including out-of-wedlock births, have reached catastrophic proportions. Furthermore, it is available to all, and at no cost.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;America is at a crossroads. Political leaders as diverse as President Clinton, Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole, and House Speaker Newt Gingrich all have articulated popular concerns and fears about the level of the breakdown of American society.<sup>149</sup>  Almost simultaneously, Americans are becoming aware of the fundamental contribution that married family life and regular religious practice can make to preserving that society.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For the sake of the nation's future health, it is time to redirect public policy so that these two vast resources, instead of being weakened further, can be rejuvenated and encouraged. Many of the goals of social policy and social work can be attained, indirectly and powerfully, through the practice of religion. None of this invalidates education or social work, which operate at a different level of the human condition. However, as demands for social work outstrip (and give every indication of far outstripping) social work resources, it is good to know that the practice of religion is a powerful ally.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The practice of religion is good for individuals, families, states, and the nation. It improves health, learning, economic well-being, self-control, self-esteem, and empathy. It reduces the incidence of social pathologies, such as out-of-wedlock births, crime, delinquency, drug and alcohol addiction, health problems, anxieties, and prejudices.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Founding Fathers, in their passionate love of freedom, promoted the freedom of all Americans to practice their religious beliefs, but Congress and the courts have crowded religion out of the public square. It is time to bring it back. Religious practice can and should be factored into the planning and debate on the nation's urgent social problems. Americans cannot build their future without drawing on the strengths that come to them from the practice of their religious beliefs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The widespread practice of religious beliefs can only benefit the nation, and the task of reintegrating religious practice into American life while protecting and respecting the rights of non-practice -- rights that, despite persistent demagoguery on the subject, remain totally unthreatened -- is one of the nation's most important tasks. Academics of good will can do much in this area, and history will look kindly on those who help America achieve this wonderful balance.

<li>The benefit of the intrinsic practice of religion certainly be obvious to most ordinary Americans. But in research results, many of the deleterious effects of the extrinsic practice of religion wipe out many of the benefits of intrinsic practice when adherents of both are mixed together in the same piece of research. Most religious research to date does not measure or differentiate between intrinsic and extrinsic practice of religion. Despite this shortcoming, the studies cited up to now do not distinguish between these types of religious practice, yet show a very positive outcome. This poses a number of important research issues, chief among them whether this is because there are only a few extrinsics among those who go to church most frequently. For researchers and those who commission research, there is an obvious need to measure whether the person's practice of religion, when it is present, is more intrinsic or extrinsic. Fortunately, a simple validated scale has been developed to measure the person's religious motivation. See Dean R. Hoge, "A Validated Intrinsic Religious Motivation Scale," <i>Journal for Scientific Study of Religion</i>, Vol. 11 (1972), pp. 369-376.
<li>    In the view of this author, that tension arises from the effort of the social sciences to contain religion within the canons of the social sciences. However the canons of religion transcend these canons, and therefore cannot be reduced to the dimensions of any of the social sciences, though every social science can describe some facets of religious behavior.

<P><H2>Forbes and term limits' enduring appeal</H2>
<HR WIDTH=50%>
 </CENTER>

<P>To hear the reports about Steve Forbes' prospects in the Republican presidential race in Iowa and New Hampshire, he's a Johnny-One-Note: the flat tax. In fact, Mr. Forbes is a Johnny-Two-Note: He has also been crusading for term limits for the U.S. Congress.

<P>While the media are generally known to be disdainful of term limits, the public has consistently expressed overwhelming approval for virtually every single one of the various proposals to limit the amount of time elected representatives may serve. Whether in the form of state laws that unilaterally limit their own representatives' terms in Congress or a constitutional amendment that would limit the federal terms of all elected officials, public support for term limits is extraordinarily consistent and extensive. One poll last year found 76 percent declaring that they would favor term limits even &quot;if limiting the terms of Congress meant that you would never be able to vote for your current member of Congress or for your senator.&quot;

<P>Before the U.S. Supreme Court last May declared unconstitutional all term-limit laws applying to the U.S. Congress, virtually every state where the issue came to a vote had passed term-limits referenda. By then, 23 states had term-limit laws, including 14 of the 17 contiguous states west of the Mississippi. The historic 5-4 Supreme Court decision, in which both of President Clinton's appointees voted with the majority, means only a constitutional amendment will suffice to impose restrictions on Congress.

<P>Not since the tax revolt issue erupted in 1978 in California with the passage of Proposition 13, which reduced and then limited property taxes, has a political issue gained such resonance among voters. Mr. Forbes' appeal undoubtedly arises from the popularity of both his major issues: tax reform and term limits.

<P>Less than two months before the Supreme Court's decision, the House failed to achieve the necessary two-thirds approval to pass a term-limits constitutional amendment. Many Democratic opponents had hoped - indeed, some of them may have even prayed (in private, of course) - that the court's subsequent decision would make the issue moot for 1996. Well, they had better pray a little harder. The issue is certain to come to the fore in the fall campaign.

<P>At the time the amendment went down in the House last March, a Gallup poll revealed that more of the public held Republicans responsible for the failure than Democrats. No doubt this was a result of the media's spin, gloating about Newt Gingrich's failure to pass a term-limits amendment. In fact, although the idea is not universally endorsed by Republicans, 82 percent of them did vote for the constitutional amendment in the House. Had a mere 50 percent of Democrats supported the amendment, instead of only 19 percent, it would have passed. By the time November rolls around, it is extremely unlikely that the public will be as misinformed about apportioning blame as it was in the immediate aftermath of the March House vote.

<P>In terms of effectiveness of independent efforts, this issue has great potential. Already, term-limit proponents, such as the U.S. Term Limits organization, have said they will exert pressure on 1996 congressional candidates to pledge themselves to vote for a constitutional amendment. These same organizations no doubt will again actively intervene in various races, as Americans for Term Limits did in 1994, helping to defeat then-Speaker Tom Foley, Democrat of Washington, and then-House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jack Brooks of Texas. And they will be joined by Ross Perot's United We Stand America.

<P>In fact, a Newsweek poll recently found that 68 percent of respondents said Mr. Perot's new Independence Party should work toward passing term limits as either its most important goal (17 percent) or one of several important goals (51 percent). Last April, 40 percent of adults questioned by Gallup said they would be &quot;very likely&quot; and another 29 percent said they would be &quot;moderately likely&quot; to vote for an independent presidential candidate if they believed that only he or she would support term limits for members of Congress. Talk about single-issue dominance. On the margin, these kinds of numbers have landslide potential.

<P>So, how prominently do you think Republicans will feature term limits in their platform? And how vulnerable will the 81 percent of Democrats who voted against a term-limits constitutional amendment be? With numbers like this, it might just be enough to get Bill Clinton to try to steal the issue.

<h1>Cultural winds blow back to the future</h1>
<P> <HR WIDTH=50%>By Suzanne Fields<BR>
The Washington Times
<HR width = 30%>
 </CENTER>
 
<P>If Bob Dylan were to wet his finger and wave it above his head to measure which way the wind is blowing, he'd change the lyrics: &quot;The times, they are a'changin' - and changin' back.&quot;

<P>Cultural conservatives are finally feeling their influence at work in the mainstream culture. Cultural indicators for the boomers, now turning gray and 50, are changing, too.

<P>Not so long ago, a liberal was said to turn conservative when his daughter reached junior high. And why not? She enters a public junior high through a metal detector, and her boyfriend gets free condoms from the school nurse.

<P>Grade school has lesser but still troublesome risks. The younger kids might spend half the day learning their lessons in English and half of the day learning the lessons again in Spanish. The alternative, for those who can scrape up the money, is a private school at $12,000 a year, but even they have to be careful not to choose a private school where equally goofy ideas thrive.

<P>Neo-liberals often turn reactionary when their sons and daughters arrive at the elite campuses, such as Yale or Stanford, where &quot;gender&quot; and &quot;gay&quot; studies push out the great books. Chaucer, Milton and Shakespeare are too white, too male, and too dead. Columbus is demoted as a cultural hero because he set out for the New World without having filed an environmental-impact statement.

<P>Cultural conservatives still must climb several steep mountains, but they're on firmer footing than ever.

<P>Sponsors of several trashy daytime shows have cancelled their sponsorship, or are planning to, of the worst offenders. Crusaders William (&quot;Virtues&quot;) Bennett and Sens. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Sam Nunn of Georgia, both Democrats, cite Procter &amp; Gamble, Unilever, Sears and Mars as examples of sponsors taught to have a public conscience. The objects of their ire are shows &quot;that harm our country and our kids.&quot;

<P>The Lieberman/Bennett/Nunn coalition is taking out after the 16,000 buyers of local programming, who met last week in Las Vegas for the annual convention of the National Association of Television Programming Executives. They're especially targeting talk trash produced for broadcast during the after-school daytime hours.

<P>Although such cultural polluters are among the most damaging to our children, adults are getting a respite from some of the soft, gauzy &quot;gender&quot; liberalism spawned in the media. The New York Times Sunday magazine has cancelled its &quot;About Men&quot; and &quot;Hers&quot; columns which described emotions such as a mother's frustration in getting her son to play with teacups and her daughter to play with trucks (not guns, of course), or the embarrassment two lesbians felt at the raised eyebrows they provoked when they checked into a motel room for a night together.

<P>When feminists complained of a macho sensibility creeping into the &quot;About Men&quot; confessional columns, the editors moved into &quot;a tender phase,&quot; and published pieces in which men proclaimed: &quot;I do the dishes and love it.&quot; No equal time at the Times.

<P>We've come a long way from Alan Alda's oh-so-sensitive man now. (Alan who?) Even Phil Donahue, who once wore a skirt on his television talk show to show gender solidarity and introduced such sexually titillating topics as male strippers who performed live before his audience and mother-daughter strippers who didn't, is retiring from his show at the end of its 29th season in May.

<P>Even the first lady, a card-carrying liberal, looking for ways to express her tougher inner child, sounds like a cultural conservative - at least some of the time - in her book, &quot;It Takes a Village.&quot;

<P>She prescribes &quot;character education&quot; in the public schools, rejects &quot;permissiveness&quot; in raising children, rails against the lyrics of &quot;gangsta rap.&quot; She wants girls to remain chaste until 21, and celebrates the two-parent family over the &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; model.

<P>Whether the first lady is being disingenuous or hypocritical, she nevertheless senses what the maturing public wants to hear. You might say she knows which way the wind is blowing.

<H1>The brutal assault on a good reputation</H1></CENTER>

<P>There's an axiom of Arkansas politics that it takes two generations for a family to get back its reputation after someone in the family gets himself elected governor.

<P>Poor Arkansas. The state may never regain its reputation for square dealing and straight shooting - which is actually how most of its sons and daughters, among the most honorable and decent people on earth, deal with one another.

<P>The stereotype of the barefoot hillbilly, with his jug of corn whiskey slung over one shoulder and his long rifle (with which he could put out the eye of a panther at a hundred yards) over the other, has been succeeded by the stereotype of the country lawyer/banker/chickenplucker who could and would pick his neighbor's pocket at a hundred feet.

<P>Many Arkansawyers will tell you, almost tearfully, that if Bill Clinton's reckless personal behavior and irresponsible abuse of the facts has embarrassed the nation, he has humiliated his home state. Hillary has done her part, too, though she gets an asterisk beside her name because she's from Illinois, not Arkansas.

<P>Only last week, Beverly Bassett Schaffer, the one-time Arkansas securities commissioner who Mrs. Clinton didn't remember talking to about the troubles Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan was having with the state, testified that well, yes, they did have a conversation and it lasted fully five minutes.

<P>Naturally nobody did anything wrong or said anything inappropriate. But we know enough now about how the first lady operates - &quot;there's hell to pay when she doesn't get her way&quot; - that we can guess how that conversation went. Mrs. Schaffer, who was then Miss Bassett, understood that Hillary was the wife of the governor - or &quot;Bill,&quot; as she referred to him in the correspondence telling an assistant to warn the governor that the feds were closing in on Madison S&amp;L -and she was in no position to do anything more than salute the wife. Madison, of course, was the reliable Clinton family piggy bank.

<P>If the rest of the country is getting a little weary of it all, we saw the strain begin to show on the Clintons and their entourage, and their paid pleaders, last week.

<P>Some of the dwindling band of Clinton acolytes among the reporters and commentators, yearning for one more invitation to sup at the White House, naturally went gaga over the president's tribute to the first lady before his State of the Union address at the Capitol. But not all. One of the exceptions, Mark Shields, the PBS commentator, observed that the salute to Hillary was a tribute that the president owed the first lady because she had swallowed hard and stuck by him at the first insinuations that his character was not all that it should be. Now that insinuations have been made against Mrs. Clinton's moral and ethical reputation, payback is only fair.

<P>You didn't have to be Sigmund Freud to detect and understand that icy stare that Mrs. Clinton shot back at her husband after he paid tribute to her as &quot;a wonderful wife, a magnificent mother and a great first lady.&quot;

<P>But unless Mrs. Clinton is unique as an American wife, a woman merely amused by the tales of her husband's heroic sexual adventuring, cutting a swath a mile wide through their friends and employees, she is particularly annoyed now when the tsunami of ethical and moral questions rolls toward the White House and it is she, and not he, who may be asked to drown and to be cheerful about it. She's entitled to wake up at 3 o'clock in the morning to wonder why the faithful wife must sacrifice herself to protect the pact made 25 years ago at Yale Law School to experiment on a guinea pig called Arkansas en route to important things in Washington.

<P>How galling now that she, who has taken such pride over the years in her part in the destruction of Richard Nixon, punishing him for covering up a third-rate political burglary, should now see similar punishment looming for covering up a third-rate bank robbery in a place no longer of any consequence to the Clintons.

<P>The White House, and Democrats generally, get red in the face at comparisons of Whitewater (or &quot;Wifewater,&quot; as the Economist calls it) to the Watergate scandals of nearly a quarter of a century ago. Such comparisons sting because they are so exquisitely apt. Al Hunt of the Wall Street Journal, perhaps the most faithful of all the Clinton liege men, sneers that comparing Whitewater to Watergate, the Clintons to Nixon, is &quot;like comparing a jaywalker to the Boston Strangler.&quot;

<P>Then Mr. Hunt reaches for the analogy himself: Susan Thomases, he writes, has dispensed &quot;more bad advice to a White House than anyone since Chuck Colson.&quot; Mr. Colson, of course, was convicted of Watergate cover-up crimes. He repented and found forgiveness in the blood of Christ. Any Methodist in Arkansas could explain the difference.

<title>How the Telecom Bill Gives Away $70 Billion in Family Tax Relief to the Broadcast

<h3><i>HOW THE TELECOM BILL GIVES AWAY $70 BILLION IN FAMILY TAX 
RELIEF TO THE BROADCAST INDUSTRY</i></h3>

F.Y.I. No. 84<br>
January 23, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;During the past year, House and Senate Republicans have been working tirelessly to enact a balanced budget plan that gives America's families much-needed tax relief.<sup>1</sup>  Simultaneously, they have devised a plan to deregulate the U.S. telecommunications industry, freeing it from over six decades of regulatory red tape.<sup>2</sup>  Unfortunately, these efforts 
have come into conflict because the telecom bill potentially would cheat American families and 
taxpayers out of tens of billions of dollars of tax relief merely to appease special interests within the 
multibillion-dollar broadcast industry.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Buried deep in the almost 300-page telecom bill, which stalled after a tentative conference  agreement was reached, is a clause requiring that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) carry out an ill-conceived plan giving America's broadcast industry additional licenses to use part of  the electromagnetic spectrum to broadcast digital television services. Broadcasters already possess licenses which allow them to provide the traditional analog television programming with which 
most Americans are familiar; now they have convinced Congress and the FCC to give them 
additional licenses to make the transition to superior resolution digital television free-of-charge 
until they can give back their old spectrum licenses for auctioning some time in the future. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS) has intervened at the last minute and raised serious questions about the fairness of such an enormous giveaway of federal spectrum property without taxpayer compensation. As he told <i>The New York Times</i> recently, "This is a big, big corporate welfare project. Here we're cutting Medicaid and doing all the painful things while we lend [broadcasters] the spectrum for 12 years. Why shouldn't they pay for it?"<sup>3</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Indeed, at a time when Congress is working to balance the federal budget while providing families 
and investors with tax relief, it is ironic that it should give away such a valuable asset to some of the 
wealthiest companies in the country. Experts at the FCC have estimated that auctioning the 
spectrum that broadcasters are demanding could raise as much as $70 billion. To put this into 
perspective, $70 billion would pay for:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Three years of the congressionally approved $500-per-child tax credit that benefits 28 million 
families raising 51 million children.
<p>
<li> The entire economic growth tax package proposed by Congress, including the capital gains tax 
cut.
<p>
<li> $70 billion in debt reduction that would save taxpayers nearly $3 billion each year in interest 
payments on the national debt.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;With agreement almost reached on the House and Senate telecommunications bills (H.R. 1555 and 
S. 652), this represents what may be the last chance to alter a disastrous policy which combines the 
worst elements of corporate welfare and industrial policy at the expense of American taxpayers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>A Misguided and Costly Plan.</b> Many things are wrong with this plan. First, it represents 
arrogant industrial planning on the part of the federal government. Legislators and FCC bureaucrats 
are arguing in essence that a single digital broadcast television channel should emerge to replace the 
current analog channel Americans are used to receiving from major networks. This is the equivalent 
of industrial planning, since federal policymakers in effect are attempting to determine a specific 
outcome within the highly innovative telecommunications industry. No one knows what type of 
video services will be demanded or even viable in the future. But, instead of letting the market 
decide, policymakers are trying to pre-determine the shape of competition within the broadcast 
video marketplace.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Second, broadcasters have justified this giveaway by appealing to false fears and technological 
misperceptions. The truth is, broadcasting can survive without a handout. Someone always will find 
a way to deliver television video programming to consumers at affordable rates. If incumbent 
broadcasters feel they really need additional spectrum to compete with their many new rivals 
(cable, satellite television, on-line computer services, for example), they can purchase it on the open 
market in an auction like everyone else. It is difficult to sympathize with firms like the Walt Disney 
Co. (which just spent $19 billion to acquire ABC) and Westinghouse Electric Corp. (which spent 
$5 billion for CBS) when they plead impoverishment as a defense.<sup> 4</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Third, broadcasters also argue that failure to give them a handout will mean the death of "free over 
the air television."  They apparently want legislators to believe that Americans would rather shell 
out billions more in taxes for deficit reduction than spend the small amount that may be required to 
purchase certain video services from competing providers. The idea that television service will be 
too expensive for Americans to afford without a giveaway is a straw man; competition, not 
corporate handouts, will provide more and better quality television programming at extremely 
affordable rates.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This leads to the fourth and most outrageous broadcast industry justification for the spectrum 
giveaway: that without it, they will not be able to continue to deliver a host of quality "public 
interest" services to the consumer. In other words, they can continue to air quality children's 
programming and other educational fare only if the government gives them additional free licenses. 
This is a questionable justification for free additional spectrum licenses, however, given that 
broadcasters have been criticized so severely in the past precisely for the mediocre quality of their 
television broadcasts. Apparently, they now expect Congress and the American people to ignore 
just how poorly they have lived up to their "public interest" obligations and instead give them just 
one more chance to prove themselves, albeit at substantial cost to the taxpayer.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Finally, other spectrum users are justifiably angry at being forced to spend billions in recent 
auctions of other spectrum licenses for non-broadcast services. Cellular firms, telephone 
companies, the cable industry, and other communications companies are asking why broadcasters 
are receiving free spectrum properties from the government when they have been forced to pay on 
the open market in recent auctions for additional spectrum. To date, these auctions have raised 
almost $10 billion for the U.S. Treasury. This is $10 billion less that American taxpayers and 
families will have to pay to help reduce the deficit. Yet the broadcasters, using specious arguments 
and blatant political influence, have convinced Congress to forgo an additional $10 billion to $70 
billion in spectrum revenues and just give this spectrum away to their industry without taxpayer 
compensation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Overwhelming Opposition to Multibillion Dollar "Rip-Off."</b>  Although this giveaway 
has gone largely unnoticed by the public, many critics on both the left and right have voiced their 
opposition. <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> labeled it "a multi-billion dollar handout for wealthy 
TV-station owners," and warned that Republican capitulation on the issue would be "wildly at odds 
with their anti-entitlement ideology."<sup>5</sup>   The <i>Journal</i> also remarks that this giveaway is all the more remarkable since this is a Congress "desperately scrambling to balance the budget, making 
its job harder by voluntarily forgoing billions in spectrum auction revenues."<sup>6</sup>  Karen 
Kerrigan, president of the <a href="/sbsc">Small Business Survival Committee</a>, also refers to 
the plan as "one of the greatest government giveaways in history," and notes that it "reflects 
wasteful stewardship of a valuable asset."<sup>7 </sup>  Liberal public-interest groups such as the 
Consumer Federation of America, People for the American Way, and the Media Access Project 
also have expressed opposition.<sup> 8</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;According to <i>Time</i> magazine, "The spectrum handout is a classic example of how 
government subsidies live on after their rationales have expired."<sup>9 </sup>  The editorial page 
of <i>The New York Times</i> also sides with Senator Dole in his effort to stop the "big 
giveaway," arguing that "Mr. Dole is taking the right action to protect taxpayers."<sup>10</sup>  
And <i>Times</i> columnist William Safire calls the giveaway "an outrageous taxpayer rip-
off."<sup>11</sup>  "This rip-off is on a scale vaster than dreamed of by yesteryear's robber barons. 
It's as if each American family is to be taxed $1,000 to enrich the stockholders of Disney, G.E. and 
Westinghouse."<sup>12 </sup>  That is exactly what is about to take place.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Families and Investors Will Pay the Price.</b> As mentioned above, it is unlikely that 
broadcasters will be put out of business if forced to bid on spectrum rights through competitive 
auction. However, if taxpayers are cheated out of a significant portion of the tax cuts promised 
them as an element of the balanced budget, they will be hurt significantly. <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi83.html">Economic analysis</a> 
conducted by Heritage Foundation economists shows that the tax cut element of the Balanced 
Budget Act of 1995 would add some $1,500 per household in higher GDP than the same plan 
without tax cuts. Also, household income would be increased on average by nearly 
$2,000.<sup>13</sup>  There is no justification for forcing individual families and the economy in 
general to lose these benefits while a few well-connected companies benefit from free spectrum.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The Answer is to Auction.</b> Even if the auctions did not pull in the full $70 billion, 
anything raised to offset the deficit and lower the burden on American taxpayers and families 
would be worth the effort. But it is very likely an auction of this taxpayer property would generate 
such revenues. The spectrum being given away is among the most valuable in the government's 
possession, since it can be used for multiple applications, not just television broadcasting. William 
Safire has even noted that these numbers may be too low, arguing that the sale of additional 
spectrum eventually could raise a staggering half-trillion dollars for the U.S. 
Treasury.<sup>14</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Equally as important will be the effect of an auction on competition within the entire 
telecommunications industry. Selling off the spectrum will ensure it is put to its most highly valued 
use and mean more competition throughout the industry. As Peter C. Cramton of the University of 
Maryland notes: "Nearly every constituent benefits from auctioning the airwaves. Taxpayers, 
consumers, and firms are all better off with auctions. The only losers are inefficient firms, which 
are unsuccessful in the auctions, but have a chance in lotteries or comparative 
hearings."<sup>15</sup>  Like lotteries and comparative hearings, which have been used by the 
FCC to distribute TV licenses in the past, this current giveaway would sacrifice market efficiency 
to special-interest influence. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Clearly, however, the most important aspect of such an auction would be what it would do for 
American taxpayers and families -- lower the burden the federal deficit places upon them. Again, as 
Cramton argues, "The auction outcome is compelling to taxpayers. So long as budget deficits 
remain a problem, it is hard to imagine that Congress would be able to reverse the auction decision 
without setting off a grass-roots rebellion among taxpayers."<sup>16</sup>  Yet this is exactly 
what is about to occur. If policymakers want to do what is in the best interests of American 
taxpayers and families, they must look beyond the self-interested motivations and misperceptions 
being put forward by the multibillion-dollar broadcast industry, which has nothing to lose and 
everything to gain by taking valuable taxpayer property without compensation.

<h3><i>Revolution Makers</i></h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
December 22, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<P>
Washington's big-government establishment was stunned in November 1994 when 
conservatives took over Congress. Their surprise, I think, is testimony not 
only to their arrogance -- but to their ignorance as well.
<p>
For years, liberals have dismissed conservatives as kooks, cranks and crazies. 
Rather than debate our ideas -- and defend their own -- they have preferred to 
rest on their (rapidly decaying) laurels. And while they were busy calling us 
names and ramming their costly utopian schemes down our throats -- schemes that 
didn't work, of course -- we were organizing, networking, writing, thinking, 
debating and refining our ideas and institutions.
<p>
A good example of the conservative movement's commitment to grassroots 
mobilization is the nation's oldest conservative lobbying organization, the <a 
href="/conservative/">American Conservative Union</a> (ACU) -- which recently 
celebrated its 30th anniversary.
<p>
The ACU started when Sen. Barry Goldwater lost to Lyndon Johnson in the 1964 
presidential race. Instead of knuckling under to what looked like a liberal 
tidal wave, a small group of concerned conservatives met to rally and 
re-energize. That core group formed the ACU, which now boasts a membership 
topping 1 million. The ACU was one of the first groups to encourage Ronald 
Reagan to seek the presidency in 1976. After Reagan announced he would run, the 
ACU began one of the first independent, non-party-affiliated campaigns on 
behalf of a presidential candidate. Since then, other grassroots organizations 
like the Christian Coalition and the Traditional Values Coalition have launched 
similar campaigns that have established indispensable networks of support for 
conservative ideas and candidates.
<p>
The ACU has kept busy, year in and year out, drumming up support for 
conservative causes such as a balanced budget, the creation of a national 
missile-defense system, curbing the growth of the federal bureaucracy, a 
free-market economy, a belief in limited government, a confidence in 
traditional moral values and a commitment to a strong national defense.
<p>
Today, the ACU is best known for its annual ranking of congressmen based on how 
they vote on a representative sample of key political issues. A good 
conservative ranking with the ACU is often touted in campaigns and worn as a 
badge of merit among members of Congress. Of course, a negative ACU ranking 
also has its uses ...
<p>
Groups like the ACU and <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a> have 
always stood up for the ideals that led the way to victory in 1994 and are 
still transforming Washington -- ideals the liberal left  still treats as "new" 
and unpalatable. And we are not alone in the struggle against the liberal 
establishment.
<p>
In 1995, a number of conservative organizations celebrated significant 
anniversaries, providing further evidence that the 1994 elections were no 
accident. <a href="/nationalreview/">National Review</a>, that lively "bible" 
of conservative opinion, reached a milestone: its 40th anniversary. With 
profound insight and humor, National Review and its founder and editor-at-large 
William F. Buckley Jr. have introduced several generations to an intellectual 
tradition based upon prudence, respect for the past, religious belief and 
common sense.
<p>
Commentary magazine, the important "neoconservative" monthly edited for 35 
years by Norman Podhoretz, observed its 50th anniversary just recenly. It 
remains an intellectual joy, hosting on its pages the incisive observations of 
America's best minds under Podhoretz's hand-chosen successor, Neal Kozodoy. 
Looking slightly ahead, Heritage will celebrate its 25th anniversary in 1998 -- 
just a neophyte in comparison to our colleagues. 
<p>
Prior to the 1994 elections, the left underestimated the intellectual vigor and 
tenacity of the conservative movement, and its ability to mobilize support. Not 
anymore. Liberals now realize we can win Washington back; or, if we have to, 
dig in for the long war and fight in the trenches until we get our next chance. 
Groups like the ACU have built this legacy.

<title>Virtuous Reality: Character Building in the Information Age -- Policy 
Review --Jan/Feb 96 -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>
<h2>Virtuous Reality:</h2><br>
<h3>Character-Building in the Information Age</h3>
by <b>Jeb Bush</b> & <b>Brian Yablonski</b>
<p><b><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</b><br>
January-February 1996, Number 75</i>
<hr width=50%>
</center><p>

	The Founding Fathers of this country understood that the survival of our democracy depends 
on the good character and virtue of the American people. George Washington declared in his 
Farewell Address that "virtue or morality is a necessary spring of popular government."
<p>
	Today our political system is threatened by a cultural decline unprecedented in our nation's 
history. The growth of crime, the collapse of the family, the failure of education, and the loss of 
hope for the future are all symptoms of a broader moral crisis. Americans have relinquished 
responsibility for governing ourselves, expecting government to solve our problems. The 
betterment of society starts from the bottom up, through virtuous individuals and families and 
communities, not from the top down through more government. 
<p>
	Over the past 30 years, government has assumed more and more responsibility for the welfare 
of our children and families. Despite the best of intentions, the governmental response has been 
more laws, more regulations, and more programs to protect children from the parents and adults 
who have let them down. Social legislation in this area now includes welfare, no-fault divorce, 
child protective services, the juvenile justice system, centralized education, and government 
programs for child support, foster care, and adoption.

<p>
	Yet the institutions that have evolved from this social legislation have presided over an 
increasing number of divorces and out-of-wedlock births. They have watched as AFDC benefits 
have become an attractive alternative to marriage. State regulations have made it more difficult 
for adoptions to occur. The foster-care system often does more harm to the child than good. 
Child-support enforcement has been a disaster. Parents have less and less say in the education of 
their children. On top of all this, the average family now pays 40 percent of its income to 
government at all levels. 
<P>
	We have abdicated to government our responsibilities in increments not discernible to the 
naked eye, but so consistently that it has become the greatest threat to our freedom in modern 
times.
<p>
	We often forget that the original purpose of democratic government was to <i>protect the 
rights of individuals and to provide for things which we could not possibly provide for on our 
own</i>. Abraham Lincoln said it best when he wrote that the legitimate object of government is 
"to do for a community of people, whatever they need to have done, but cannot do at all, or 
cannot do so well for themselves. In all that the people can individually do as well for 
themselves, government ought not to interfere." As examples of legitimate government 
functions, Lincoln listed maintenance of roads and bridges, disposal of deceased men's property, 
and support of the helpless young. Lincoln knew that government is no substitute for a virtuous 
citizenry that takes care of families and communities.
<p>
	James Q. Wilson, one of the foremost modern scholars on the subject of cultivating virtues, 
has written that having good character means at least two things: empathy and self-control. 
Empathy is the ability to take into account the rights, needs, and feelings of others. Self-control is 
the practice of deferred gratification or being more concerned with the long-term impact of 
conduct than with the "here and now."
<p>
	Thus, character is of primary importance in that it determines whether individuals will be 
selfish or selfless. When we act, do we only take into account our own personal good or do we 
have in mind the common good and the effects our conduct will have on the welfare of others? 
Many of our cultural pathologies are a simple reflection of character, of placing the self at the 
center of one's life. How we ensure a healthy supply of citizens committed to the common good? 
How do we cultivate virtue and persons of strong character into the next generation?
<p>
	The moral education of our children has traditionally been left in the hands of parents, 
extended family, the neighborhood, the school, the church or synagogue, and to some extent 
other civic associations. But look at the condition of each of these institutions. Our children are a 
reflection of our ailing social institutions, families, and communities. The indicators show that 
those character-forming institutions traditionally charged with a youngster's moral development 
have suffered their own disintegration.
<p>
<b>Virtues, Not Values</b>
<p>
	Some of the difficulty can be traced to an overreliance on government and a willingness to 
step back from our own character-building responsibilities. But this is only part of problem -- 
and, hence, only part of the solution. The trouble goes deeper than a simple surrender to 
government. Unfortunately, these character-building institutions have lost the language of virtue.
<p>
	Our complex and diverse society now functions not under a universal set of moral principles 
but rather under competing personal and group value systems. Values -- embodied in personal 
beliefs, opinions, and preferences -- have replaced virtues as our moral beacons, and there are 
many different value systems present in our culture. Our character-building institutions have 
bought into the idea that we have to recognize any and all value systems. Instead of providing us 
guidance, they now provide us with the tools to justify a wide variety of deviant behaviors. In 
other words, they do not teach our children right from wrong, but rather how to make informed 
choices. As one prison chaplain recently observed, our young children need direction, not 
choices.
<p>
	The distinction is critical. Virtues, grounded in universal moral absolutes, represent standards 
of behavior that are fixed and firm in any civilized society. Who would argue that fortitude, 
prudence, justice, temperance, discipline, responsibility, honesty, honor, and compassion are not 
good things? Listen to William Bennett: "Teaching virtue to our children need not be a 
controversial undertaking. Forming good character in young people does not mean having to 
instruct them on thorny issues like abortion, creationism, homosexuality, or euthanasia. . . . 
People of good character are not all going to come down on the same side of difficult political 
and social issues."
<p>
	Values, on the other hand, refer to a system of individualized beliefs and preferences. 
Everyone has values -- even Nazis and street gangs. Overemphasizing values accentuates our 
differences, so that the values of self-expression and individualism now trump the virtues of 
deferred gratification, responsibility, and commitment to family.
<p>
	While public policy over the last three decades focused more on recognizing the differences 
between groups of people and their competing value systems, it did little in the way of 
reinforcing the common bonds between all peoples -- the moral absolutes that transcend politics, 
race, and gender. Virtues, and the moral imperatives implied by them, were either lost in the 
debate or they were mischaracterized as values -- subjective and relative, personal, and specific 
to a particular person or group.
<p>
	Recently, we conducted a simple, highly unscientific experiment designed to see how often 
we use the word "virtuous" in our popular culture. In Florida's major newspapers, we found only 
a few random uses of the word "virtuous," frequently out of context. For example, since 1989, 
the Orlando Sentinel has used the word "virtuous" to describe somebody or something on 92 
occasions, or slightly more than once a month. The <i>St. Petersburg Times</i> has used the 
word 140 times since 1987, or fewer than once a month. In most cases, "virtuous" was merely a 
term used to describe a character in a movie, theater, or book or, sometimes, a person in an 
obituary -- in other words, nonpeople and dead people. This is certainly not to say that the 
newspapers are not reporting on the good deeds of virtuous people. We just aren't calling them 
virtuous anymore.
<p>
<b>Quiet Acts of Compassion</b>
<p>
	Correcting our social pathologies will take time. It will require a renewal of virtue and 
character and a rejuvenation of those institutions that teach virtue and character. This means we 
must regain confidence in passing moral judgments, using the language of virtue, and teaching 
virtue to our children.
<p>
	We must also learn from everyday heroes. Our own state of Florida is blessed by an 
extraordinary number of men and women of character. It is important that we begin to discuss 
character in the context of those who exhibit it routinely. We must elevate the people who are 
redefining our culture for the good, for they are the profiles in character from whom we must 
learn.
<p>
	In Florida, you will find some of our greatest profiles in character in the places where you 
might least expect to find them. Take Delwyn Collins, a kitchen worker in Tampa General 
Hospital. On most days, you will find Delwyn mopping floors or washing dishes in a corner of 
the hospital's kitchen. But each year, Delwyn Collins devotes a large portion of his earnings 
from his $6-per-hour job to support the Angel Tree program, which provides toys for orphans 
and foster children in the Tampa area.

<p>	For years, Delwyn has pulled dozens of paper angels from the hospital's Angel Tree: 
Each angel bears the name of a orphan or foster child who does not experience a Christmas with 
family members, or the joys -- and toys -- that attend the holiday. They become Delwyn's 
children.
<p>
	Last year, Delwyn pulled 35 of the paper ornaments from the Angel Tree. Delwyn does not 
drive a car, so he brings toys to the hospital by pulling them on a flatbed wagon or loading them 
in his bicycle basket. His quiet acts of compassion caught the attention of many in his 
community. In 1995, Hillsborough County passed over several local politicians who were 
nominated to present its Moral Courage of the Year Award to the soft-spoken kitchen worker.
<p>
	Talk to some of the children who inhabit the Miami home of Dorothy Perry, dubbed "the 
Mother Teresa of public housing." For 20 years, Perry has been a surrogate mother to children 
whose parents were strung out on crack or alcohol, or worked three jobs and had no energy left 
for parenting. Her "Youths Progressing" program offers meals, clothes, and safe haven for more 
than 35 abused or displaced kids, ranging in ages from one to 21.
<P>
	"I think this program saved my life," says James Holley, 20. "My mother was having 
problems with drugs, and the state was talking about taking me from her. I didn't have anywhere 
to go." James is now working toward his General Equivalency Diploma. Eighteen-year-old 
Quintin Varnedoe came to live with Perry when she was seven, after her mother died. "My 
brothers were in gangs, telling me to sell drugs and rob to get money," says Varnedoe, who 
enlisted in the Marine Corps last fall.

<p>	Another of Florida's virtuous citizens can be found sitting at his desk in an eighth-grade 
classroom at Osceola Middle School, in Seminole. While most children his age are busy playing 
sports or electronic video games, 14-year old David Levitt has been busy caring for the needy. 
Two years ago, David figured out that school cafeterias have a lot of leftover lunch food_and he 
devised a way for local public schools to donate their unused food to the hungry. On his 12th 
birthday, he made his case before the Pinellas County School Board and won approval for his 
idea. For months, David fought a Goliath of bureaucratic red tape and government regulations. 
His slingshot prevailed: Today, more than 80 of the 92 schools in Pinellas County donate their 
food to the needy. 
<p>
	 To change the course of our culture, we do not each have to run out and start a social program 
or adopt an orphaned child. Rather, we need to do a little in each of our lives to revitalize what 
Edmund Burke called "the little platoons," the family and those local and civic associations that 
facilitate good character. Building character starts at kitchen tables and in front yards of 
neighbors.

<h2>Reflections on the Revolution</h2>

<P>
<I>&quot;One has a feeling of going it blindly because we are
in a tremendous stream and none of us knows where we are going
to land.&quot;</I>
<br><I>       --Eleanor Roosevelt</I>
<P>
 As Americans prepare to vote in the forthcoming Presidential
election, our national politics is in turmoil.  The 1990s has
witnessed the greatest challenge to the legitimacy of the two
major parties in modern times.  George Bush went from stratospheric
approval ratings to losing the Presidency in a three-way race
in which Ross Perot received the largest percent of the popular
vote of any third party candidate since Teddy Roosevelt.  Yet
just two years later, the Clinton Presidency lay in shambles as
the Republicans took control of Congress for the first time in
40 years. The American electorate increasingly identifies not
with Republicans, nor with Democrats, but with a party that does
not (for all intents and purposes) exist -- the &quot;independents.&quot;
<P>
 As elected officials daily flee their membership in the Democratic
party, Americans are increasingly confused over whether the parties
stand for anything.  Is there such a creature as a &quot;New Democrat,&quot;
or is Bill Clinton's party still a high tax and spend coalition
of liberal interest groups?  Where are the Republicans heading,
toward the reactionary Buchanan or the futuristic Gingrich?  When
asked what percentage of promises they thought politicians typically
broke, Americans recently responded with the staggering total
of 78 percent.  During Ross Perot's mercurial Presidential challenge,
70 percent of the American people declared no confidence in either
political party.
<P>
 National politics during the 1990s is driven by the simple fact
that Americans believe, as Ross Perot so succinctly put it, &quot;the
government is broken and we need to fix it.&quot; Whether it is
the national debt, decaying inner cities or regulatory burdens,
 citizens feel that the Federal government is less an ally than
a threat to their making the good life.  Fewer than a third of
the American people believe that the government does the right
thing -- down from about 80 percent a couple of decades ago. 
The voters place the blame for this squarely on the seeming inability
of elected officials' from both parties to produce the necessary
changes.
<P>
Yet through all this confusion a new vision for the proper role
of government in society is emerging to replace the legacy of
the New Deal (the idea that centralization, bureaucracy and government
could solve every problem).  It is around the principles of the
information age that the vision of a New Majority coalition will
form and define a new era in American politics.
<P>
It is difficult to describe the new era because our political
discourse is still dominated by the language of the New Deal/Great
Society era.   Many political analysts still talk in terms of
stitching together a coalition of interest-based demographic groups.
 When Eleanor Roosevelt spoke the words above in 1932, the people
coming together to form the New Deal did not yet know where they
were going.  It took them a generation to develop the language
with which we today are so familiar.  Today's emerging New Majority
finds itself in much the same position as the First Lady --  they
know they are leaving the past behind and creating a new political
order, but they do not yet know where they will end up.
<P>
 Replacing an old political order is messy and confusing.  It
often seems as if the public is not sure exactly what it wants.
 On the one hand -- if you believe the results of the 1992 Presidential
election - the voters say they want an activist government.  Yet,
when they tried to create an  &quot;activist&quot; health care
system, President Clinton and the Democrats were rejected.  The
public then embraced a Contract with America that called for drastically
delimiting the power of the Federal government.  Taken as a whole,
these conflicting demands signal an era of change.
<P>
 American politics is no longer a fight over the size of New Deal
programs.  Since FDR, voters may have argued over how much should
be spent, but the majority of Americans never questioned the fundamental
principle of the New Deal:  that Federal government programs were
the appropriate way to solve America's problems, whether old-age
pensions through Social Security, the poor through welfare, or
pollution through the Environmental Protection Agency.  And the
truth be told, there was little reason for Americans to question
this principle because, by and large, the New Deal and its programs
<I>did </I>make the United States a better place to live.
<P>
 But today that is no longer so.  Social Security and Medicare
are near bankruptcy and will not be able to support the Baby Boomers
as they begin to retire early next century (now less than four
years away).  No longer is welfare helping widows and infants,
but instead facilitating an urban underclass that threatens to
tear apart America's social fabric.  And Federal regulations have
gone from the sensible to the absurd. The reason these programs
suddenly seem to be the problem rather than the solution is that
the world in which they were created no longer exists.
<P>
 American society is transforming itself away from the industrial
age that has dominated the past century just as surely as it moved
away from the agrarian age during the time of our nation's founding.
 &quot;Our age&quot; is yet to be determined.  We know that it
will be overwhelmingly influenced by the information technology
that is now upon us -- every day we hear something new about the
Internet, Cyberspace and virtuality.  This is already manifesting
itself in our politics.
<P>
The so-called Republican Revolution of 1994 occurred not on election
day but the moment President Clinton's bureaucratic and centralized
health care plan died in a Democratic Congress.  Americans rejected
an industrial age design being imposed upon them in the information
age.  Nothing demonstrated the death of the New Deal paradigm
more than President Clinton's recent balanced budget proposal.
 It was not the balanced budget per se that was important. It
was that the man who campaigned as a &quot;New Democrat&quot;
capitulated to the philosophical direction of the New Majority.
It was no longer a debate about increasing government spending,
taxation or centralization of programs (like health care) but
about a totally new political direction - smaller, less centralized
government.
<P>
Just as the election of Eisenhower did not mean the end of the
New Deal's philosophical hegemony, neither would Bill Clinton
or any other candidate's election in 1996 mean the end of the
emerging principles of the New Majority. As all successful revolutionaries
know:  There comes a time to stop the revolt, know you have destroyed
the old order, and begin building a new one.
<P>
<B>The Role of Government: Devolve, Diffuse and Connect Through Competition &amp; Community</B>
<P>
 The outlines of the principles on which to build the new political
age are becoming clear.  The bureaucratic, centralized government
design will be replaced because the information age demands a
new organization. As General Motors, IBM and AT&amp;T have learned,
decentralization and human capital are the hallmarks of the new
age.  While the private sector has been learning this lesson for
more than a decade, government and academia have been the last
to understand the new era.
<P>
The three major trends that will enable this to occur in the new
era will be devolution, diffusion and connection. Devolution is
sending power and responsibility to the lowest level possible
for effective decision-making.  Shifting from federal to state
or local control is just a trickle today. Within a few years it
will be a flood. The pioneering efforts of such states as Wisconsin
and Michigan will be recognized as the beginning. If Medicaid
and Welfare are returned to the states, this trend will have been
firmly established.
<P>
 Diffusion is relying on non-governmental organizations or individuals
to perform many of the functions government usurped during the
industrial era.  The use of vouchers, privatization, voluntary
organizations, charities and churches are among the tools of diffusion.
Cities such as Indianapolis and Jersey City are building models
of diffusion.
<P>
I need to make one cautionary point about diffusion. Ronald Reagan
used to talk about how the &quot;dead hand of government&quot;
would stifle and cripple mediating institutions, and he was right:
Voluntary organizations' and charities' original social purposes
withered because of government's absorption of their functions
into the welfare state.  It is obvious that government cannot
immediately withdraw from these functions and expect churches
and charities to automatically fill the void. These &quot;charitable
muscles&quot; have not been exercised in a long time, and there
must be a transition period during which government gives over
these responsibilities while charitable institutions regain the
skills and knowledge to reclaim their original purposes.
<P>
 The final trend is connection. This has less to do with government
than with individuals. We must return to the sense of community
we once had.  The most important people are those closest to you.
You must want to help -- and feel a responsibility for --  yourself,
your family, your friends and your neighbors. In this respect
I agree with Hillary Rodham Clinton's diagnosis of the problem:
It takes a village! I disagree totally with her prescribed cure:
 more intrusive government. Government cannot build villages;
it is more likely to raze them.
<P>
 To be able to devolve, diffuse and connect, America needs a serious
discussion about the role of government. As the disagreement with
Mrs. Clinton shows, this may be the definitive difference between
the evolving left and right in politics. It may take a Presidential
election as definitive as 1932 to cement the principles of the
New Majority as the reigning paradigm.
<P>
<B>The Ties that Bind: Our 21st Century Opportunity</B>
<P>
 The industrial era brought havoc to an unknowing and bewildered
populace.  Social norms and cultural promises were broken, the
economy shifted from one dependent on artisans and entrepreneurs
to one built by large-scale factories.  Workers moved from being
independent operators to cogs in assembly-line machines.  Individuals
lost control of their lives as it increasingly passed into the
hands of the experts, engineers and managers who determined the
rules of work.  These changes undermined people's  traditional
sense of order.  They scrambled for a new political paradigm that,
like the new factories, would emphasize mass programs, bureaucratic
control and order.
<P>
This order did not come to pass immediately. From the Progressives
at the turn of the century onward, an increasing number of Americans
began to coalesce around a conception of government and governance
that viewed centralized, bureaucratic programs as the appropriate
provider of solutions.  Yet it was not until the New Deal that
a majority of the electorate believed in this view of the role
of government, a conception that would dominate American politics
for the next 40 years.
<P>
The emerging majority realizes that the principles behind the
New Deal are dead, and voted for Republican control of Congress
in 1994 to bury its programs as well.  Yet this begs a question:
 What next?  If the animating spirit of the New Deal will not
work for this new information age, what will?  Is there a new
view about the role of the government in American life around
which a new political majority will form?
<P>
 The answers are still vague, but broad outlines seem to be coming
into focus.  Government, especially government in Washington,
will have a diminished, supportive role rather than the supreme
role it has enjoyed.  With the national government no longer seen
as the solution to all our problems, national politics will no
longer be a zero-sum game of who gets the next Federal program
enacted for their cause and who gets to impose their views on
whom.  Government will instead focus on empowering citizens and
the communities they form to solve their own problems.  Through
the use of vouchers and other tools, people will choose the best
means to achieve their goals, rather than be subject to the one-size-fits
all approach of today's government programs.  The vision of the
New Majority recognizes communities (mediating institutions) are
the strength and backbone of a healthy American civilization,
and pluralism the answer to competing values.

<title>Jacobs: Judge ideas by results, not intentions -- PFF</title>

<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>
<h2>Judge Ideas by Results, Not Intentions</h2>
By <a href="/pff/jacob-io.html">Dr. Joseph J. Jacobs</a></center>
<P>
 My friend Sidney Hook, in his transition from a Marxist to its
most vociferous and effective critic, articulated the double-standard
applied by the left when evaluating socialism and capitalism.
<P>
&quot;I was guilty of judging capitalism by its operations and
socialism by its hopes and aspirations; capitalism by its works
and socialism by its literature,&quot; he explained.
<P>
I was most fortunate to know Sidney Hook, the renowned philosopher,
well enough to have a number of discussions and arguments with
him. I rarely prevailed in any arguments. The only time I came
close was when I asked him define his, then, current politics.
He said, &quot;Suppose I would call myself a democratic socialist,&quot;
reflecting, I thought, his reluctance to go all the way to &quot;conservative.&quot;
The word oxymoron had not been invented then, so I said, &quot;But,
Sidney, that's inherently self-contradictory.&quot; His terse
reply, &quot;You may be right,&quot; was as close as I ever came
to winning a point with him.
<P>
The socialist theoreticians are so used to comparing their theory
to other theories that they cannot bring themselves to evaluate
their theories in light of reality. In its 75 years, the great
Russian empire dominated a large part of the world and its reduction
of socialist theory to practice failed miserably.
<P>
Ask the convinced socialist or the passionate advocate of central
planning why he persists in promoting a system which has been
a demonstrated failure and the likely answer will be: &quot;If
only the right people had been involved, it could have worked.&quot;
<P>
They insist that there is nothing fundamentally wrong with the
system. It's just that the people in charge failed to implement
it properly. If only the right people (implied, &quot;such as
me&quot;) had been at the helm, things might have been different.
But that is the precisely the point. Men are imperfect - even
those that construct the most exquisite theories. Inevitably they
produce imperfect results.
<P>
The final test is always, in engineering terminology, reduction
to practice. Many wonderful things have resulted from well-intentioned
actions, but many harmful things have, too.  Equally, many great
things may not have been accomplished because of excessive caution.
<P>
It's tempting to describe these contracting impulses as mature
and immature, but that may be too judgmental.  We need the untrammeled
emotions to integrate ourselves from childhood to adulthood. 
But Having reached adulthood, must we lose our wonderment and
surrender to cynicism?
<P>
&quot;Maturity&quot; is the best balance btween the restrictive
obligations of the real world and the lack of restrain of our
youthful yearnings.  In phiosophic jargon, we have the classic
conflict between &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;order.&quot;
<P>
That segment of society which nourishes the childhood yearning
in us, I choose to call the art world.  Those I inlude are, of
course, the artists, the composers, the craftsmen, but also those
who write -- newspapers, books, poetry, plays.  Inlude as well
the performers, screen and television actors, the sportsmen, the
musicians, the magicians, the jugglers and the comedians -- in
short, those who successfully stimulate our emotions.
<P>
These people all appeal primarily to our childlike instincts --
those of us that are uninhibited by the restrictions of civilized
society.  They are constructive and important parts of our adult
life when filtering out the dark, destructive sides of our instinctual
youthful behavior -- the &quot;childishness,&quot; if you will.
 Along with our maturity and sense of responsibility we accept
with joy and gratitude what these wonderful people have to offer
us.  For they nourish our emotions without any boudaries of inhibition.
<P>
An important segment of the conservative world also possesses
this childlike quality to some degree.  Inventors, scientific
leaders and entrepreneurs all have a childlike longing for daring
innovation.  But scientists are, at the same time, conservative
in their willingness to test their intuitive leaps in the laboratory.
<P>
Of necessity, those who appeal to our hearts so effectively, must
themselves have a connection or a sensitivity to the child in
all of us.  How else can they be effective?  How can they know
what our hearts yearn for?  Yet even they must be bound by the
dimensions of the real world.
<P>
Most thoughtful people reject the mechanistic concept of &quot;maturity&quot;
and recognize that the full life demands both it and the childlike
impulses of which dreams are made.  Liberal thought is less inhibited.
 Conservative thought is more constrained.  But neither liberals
nor conservatives have a monopoly on wishing things were better.

<TITLE>Whose Values Mr. President? -- PFF</TITLE>

<META NAME="GENERATOR" CONTENT="Internet Assistant for Word 1.0Z">

<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>

<h2>Whose Values Mr. President?</h2>
By <a href="/pff/people/staff.html#O_Donnell">Richard F. O'Donnell</a>
</center><P>
<P>
 Bill Clinton has left the Republicans speechless.  For months
now, every time the President said he wanted a budget reflecting
and upholding American values, Republicans responded they wanted
a budget balanced in seven years with real numbers.  Clinton finally
met their demand, producing a plan that he says balances the budget
<I>and</I> reflects American values.
<P>
 Calling his plan too &quot;liberal&quot; every time the President
tells Americans he is protecting Medicare, education and the environment
is not going to win the GOP many points in the court of public
opinion.  As part of a winning public relations strategy, Republicans
must answer head on each of the President's claims.
<P>
 Bill Clinton needs to be asked whose values he is claiming to
uphold in his Medicare proposals.  Are they the values of elderly
Americans relying on a healthcare program that even Clinton's
own advisers told him last spring faces bankruptcy without major
changes?  Are they the values of working Americans who will see
their payroll taxes continue to rise to unbearable heights to
fund an out-of-control cost spiral of a program? Or is Bill Clinton
still promoting the values of Ira Magaziner, who believes a one-size-fits-all
bureaucratic health care system directed from Washington is the
best way for millions of Americans' healthcare decisions to be
made?
<P>
 Bill Clinton needs to be asked whose values he is claiming to
uphold in his education proposals.  Are they the values of parents
desperately seeking empowerment to choose the finest schools for
the education of their children? Or is Bill Clinton promoting
the values of the educational guild of tenured-teachers and politically
correct professors who want to nationalize education - taking
decisions away from communities - and force on children a skewed
view of history that denigrates heroes and celebrates supposed
victims?
<P>
 Bill Clinton needs to be asked whose values he is upholding in
his environmental proposals.  Are they the values of farmers,
ranchers, hikers and nature lovers across America who daily interact
with, are a part of and intimately understand their ecosystem
and want their children to enjoy its benefits also?  Or is Bill
Clinton promoting the values of EPA bureaucrats who, from cement
towers in Washington, D.C., call humans unnatural and purport
to know more about the forests of Oregon or the shores of Cape
Cod or the wetlands of Missouri than people whose families have
lived there for generations?
<P>
 Bill Clinton needs to be asked why he only wants tax relief for
working families.  Why not for job creators? Why not for investors
who take risks in creating new business ventures and growing the
American economy?
<P>
 In the lists of items the President says he wants to protect
is a significant omission:  welfare.  Although Clinton may hate
the GOP version of welfare reform, he knows the middle class wants
reform and the GOP has captured the moral high ground. Republicans
are protecting American values by replacing a system that discourages
work, forces people to live in housing fit only for rats and denies
generation after generation of our fellow citizens those rights
endowed to them by our Creator.
<P>
 Bill Clinton has been winning public sentiment because he is
claiming to protect and uphold the values of the middle class.
 Republicans should have reminded the President the past few months
that they want a budget balanced with real numbers because <I>they
too</I> are protecting American values:  those of thrift that
hold the government should balance its books, live within its
means and not mortgage our children's and grandchildren's future.
<P>
 It is time for the Republicans to ask Bill Clinton:  &quot;Whose
values are you protecting?  Those of normal Americans or those
of a politically correct, imperial elite with whom you communed
at Renaissance Weekend?&quot;  Such language will inflame liberal
journalists across the land, but the majority of Americans who
were <I>not</I> at Hilton Head will understand.
<P>
 The values Bill Clinton is claiming to protect are not those
of the middle class.  Americans are demanding the freedom to think
and choose for themselves how to live their lives without a bloated,
remote, debt-ridden government taxing and regulating them to death.
 This is what the '94 Revolution was all about.  These are Republican
values; they are nothing to be ashamed of and Republicans should
start defending them.
<P>
Republicans should not let Bill Clinton get away with claiming
he is protecting American values and they are not; it is time
for the President to be challenged and made to defend his values.
 This will assist in turning the debate away from the supposedly
&quot;mean spirited&quot; GOP efforts to reduce the size and scope
of government to why Bill Clinton is trying to preserve big, bureaucratic
government that does not represent the American people.

<title>Jacobs:  The Trap of "Entitlement" Thinking -- PFF</title>
<META NAME="GENERATOR" CONTENT="Internet Assistant for Word 1.0Z">
</HEAD>

<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>
<h2>The Trap of 'Entitlement' Thinking</h2>
 By <a href="/pff/jacob-io.html">Dr. Joseph J. Jacobs</a></center><P>
If we are serious about tackling a problem that is leading our
country into ruinous debt, perhaps the best way to begin is by
redefining our terms.
<P>
Every responsible person in Washington - from President Clinton
to Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and on down - now recognizes
that reining in the high costs of government means dealing with
the escalating costs of so-called &quot;entitlement&quot; programs.
<P>
Do Americans have a &quot;right&quot; to a certain standard of
living? Are they &quot;entitled&quot; to money earned by other
people? Does our society owe people happiness? Certainly we should
not let people starve. We should be charitable. But the difference
between charity and entitlement is vast.
<P>
For a generation, entitlements have been the &quot;untouchable&quot;
part of the federal budget - never subject to elimination, cuts
or even critical performance review, but automatically scheduled
for cost-of-living increases and authorized for &quot;such sums
as may be necessary&quot; to respond to changing economic conditions.
Entitlements have been funded by the federal government with something
of a blank check.
<P>
Spending on these &quot;mandatory&quot; programs comprise 47 percent
of the federal budget. Another 14 percent of the budget is earmarked
for interest payments -- another &quot;mandatory&quot; program.
Thus, the president and Congress have control over 39 percent
of the budget.
<P>
Social Security, which has been described as &quot;middle class
welfare&quot; is the most expensive entitlement program. Since
1965, annual expenditures have grown from $17.1 billion to $241
billion. Social Security costs have increased annually at a rate
of 8 percent since 1980. Medicare has grown even faster - at a
rate of 12 percent. And Medicaid costs have risen yearly at an
11 percent pace. With runaway spending like that, how long before
we no longer can bear the cost -- unless you believe in the myth
that we have unlimited resources.
<P>
If no changes are made in the Social Security and Medicare systems,
the government projects that Americans will be paying 30 percent
of their income in
<P>
 federal taxes just to support these two programs by the year
2030. Today, every American man, woman- and child owes $10,000
as their share of the national debt. By 2030, that share would
increase to $64,000.
<P>
Surely, something must be done - and soon. But is tinkering with
the current system the answer? I think not.
<P>
Entitlements by their very nature -- by definition - create new
rights for Americans never dreamed of by our founding fathers
and never held up for the scrutiny of a full and open public debate.
<P>
Think about it. What is the derivation of that word &quot;entitlement&quot;?
The dictionary suggests that it is a legal right to something
- it is something that has been earned.
<P>
Those in search of such services need only be a resident of the
country perhaps not even a citizen. Then the politicians, bureaucrats
or activists must discover that a need exists that has a strong
compassionate component.
<P>
Once these compassionately impelled needs are met by passing laws
and appropriating money, they become entitlements. The recipients
very rarely have done anything that should &quot;entitle&quot;
them to receive these benefits. Thus, compassionately motivated
help is converted by word manipulation to an &quot;Entitlement.&quot;
<P>
Most such entitlement programs start out modestly with the goal
of creating a &quot;safety net&quot; for the truly needy. But
they are quickly turned into &quot;rights&quot; and expanded almost
geometrically as the bureaucratic self-interest in growth takes
over.
<P>
The curious transition to the use of the word &quot;Entitlement&quot;
reflects the inherent power of words to affect emotions and frame
the terms of our national debate. To be &quot;entitled&quot; to
something, the government implies one has a right to it. In private
industry, however, these kinds of added payments are characterized
more accurately as &quot;benefits.&quot; Contrast &quot;Benefits&quot;
with &quot;entitlements&quot; and the emotional content is revealed.
Benefits are given, but entitlements are a collection of obligations.
<P>
The Declaration of Independence defined our rights as &quot;life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.&quot; Happiness is not a
right, only the pursuit of it is. Our founders understood that
when government offers any more, it creates dependency rather
than freedom. Thus, we will never solve our &quot;Entitlement&quot;
problem until we understand that none of us is owed anything just
because we are here.

<center><h3>ATR'S Congressional Leadership Daily Update</h3></center>
<b>MEMO</b><br>
DATE:  November 24, 1995<br>
TO:  Taxpayer Activists and Radio Talk Show Hosts<br>
FROM:  Grover G. Norquist<br>
RE:  Balanced Budget and Lower Taxes or Status Quo<p>
<hr>
<P>
The present debate in Washington will decide whether America moves to a balanced budget with lower taxes, or continues the status quo of high debt, increasing deficits and government spending.
<P>
So that every taxpayer activist can be fully informed about the daily shifting tactical issues of debt ceiling limits, continuing resolutions and the budget reconcialiation budget, ATR is hosting a daily conference call at 5 PM Eastern Standard Time.  We will be joined by Newt Gingrich, John Boehner, Dick Armey, Tom DeLay, or a key staffer for a daily briefing.
<P>
Please join us by calling <b>1-703-736-7238</b> and tell the operator that you are calling in for the Americans for Tax Reform's Congressional Leadership Daily Update.
<P><center><b>Daily Conference Call<br>
<h1><center>House Speaker Newt Gingrich</center></h1>
<b>Live at 5pm Eastern Time</b>, - Replayed at 6pm & 7pm<br>
The call will last about 15 minutes.<br></b>
</h3></center>
Share this notice and the phone number with other activists in your state.  The better informed our side is, the more effectively we can promote the fight for lower taxes and a balanced budget.
<P>
Our goal over the next two months will not change:  a balanced budget by 2002 with tax cuts, but the tactics of the White House and the advocates of the status quo necessitate our being up to date in the back and forth of the daily tactical fights.
<P>
Onward.  We're winning.

<blockquote>	     
	     <B>THE PRESIDENT:</B>  Thank you very much.  <P>
	     
	     Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of the 104th 
Congress, distinguished guests, my fellow Americans all across our 
land:  Let me begin tonight by saying to our men and women in uniform 
around the world, and especially those helping peace take root in 
Bosnia and to their families, I thank you.  America is very, very 
proud of you.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     My duty tonight is to report on the state of the Union 
-- not the state of our government, but of our American community; 
and to set forth our responsibilities, in the words of our Founders, 
to form a more perfect union.  <P>
	     
	     The state of the Union is strong.  (Applause.)  Our 
economy is the healthiest it has been in three decades.  We have the 
lowest combined rates of unemployment and inflation in 27 years.  We 
have completed -- created nearly 8 million new jobs, over a million 
of them in basic industries, like construction and automobiles.  
America is selling more cars than Japan for the first time since the 
1970s.  And for three years in a row, we have had a record number of 
new businesses started in our country.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     Our leadership in the world is also strong, bringing 
hope for new peace.  And perhaps most important, we are gaining 
ground in restoring our fundamental values.  The crime rate, the 
welfare and food stamp rolls, the poverty rate and the teen pregnancy 
rate are all down.  And as they go down, prospects for America's 
future go up.  (Applause.)<P>

	     We live in an age of possibility.  A hundred years ago 
we moved from farm to factory.  Now we move to an age of technology, 
information, and global competition.  These changes have opened vast 
new opportunities for our people, but they have also presented them 
with stiff challenges.  While more Americans are living better, too 
many of our fellow citizens are working harder just to keep up, and 
they are rightly concerned about the security of their families.<P>

	     We must answer here three fundamental questions:  First,  
how do we make the American Dream of opportunity for all a reality 
for all Americans who are willing to work for it?  Second, how do we 
preserve our old and enduring values as we move into the future?  
And, third, how do we meet these challenges together, as one America?  <P>
	     
	     We know big government does not have all the answers.  
We know there's not a program for every problem.  (Applause.)  We 
know, and we have worked to give the American people a smaller, less 
bureaucratic government in Washington.  And we have to give the 
American people one that lives within its means.  (Applause.)  The 
era of big government is over.  (Applause.)  But we cannot go back to 
the time when our citizens were left to fend for themselves.  
(Applause.)  	  <P>

	     Instead, we must go forward as one America, one nation 
working together to meet the challenges we face together.  
Self-reliance and teamwork are not opposing virtues; we must have 
both.  (Applause.)  I believe our new, smaller government must work 
in an old-fashioned American way, together with all of our citizens 
through state and local governments, in the workplace, in religious, 
charitable and civic associations.  Our goal must be to enable all 
our people to make the most of their own lives -- with stronger 
families, more educational opportunity, economic security, safer 
streets, a cleaner environment in a safer world.  <P>
	     
	     To improve the state of our Union, we must ask more of 
ourselves, we must expect more of each other, and we must face our 
challenges together.  (Applause.)<P>

	     Here, in this place, our responsibility begins with 
balancing the budget in a way that is fair to all Americans.  
(Applause.)  There is now broad bipartisan agreement that permanent 
deficit spending must come to an end.  (Applause.)<P>

	     I compliment the Republican leadership and the 
membership for the energy and determination you have brought to this 
task of balancing the budget.  (Applause.)  And I thank the Democrats 
for passing the largest deficit reduction plan in history in 1993, 
which has already cut the deficit nearly in half in three years.  
(Applause.)<P>
	     
	     Since 1993, we have all begun to see the benefits of 
deficit reduction.  Lower interest rates have made it easier for 
businesses to borrow and to invest and to create new jobs.  Lower 
interest rates have brought down the cost of home mortgages, car 
payments and credit card rates to ordinary citizens.  Now, it is time 
to finish the job and balance the budget.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     Though differences remain among us which are 
significant, the combined total of the proposed savings that are 
common to both plans is more than enough, using the numbers from your 
Congressional Budget Office to balance the budget in seven years and 
to provide a modest tax cut.  <P>
	     
	     These cuts are real.  They will require sacrifice from 
everyone.  But these cuts do not undermine are fundamental 
obligations to our parents, our children, and our future, by 
endangering Medicare, or Medicaid, or education, or the environment, 
or by raising taxes on working families.  (Applause.)  <P>
	     
	     I have said before, and let me say again, many good 
ideas have come out of our negotiations.  I have learned a lot about 
the way both Republicans and Democrats view the debate before us.  I 
have learned a lot about the good ideas have that we could all 
embrace.  
	     <P>
	     We ought to resolve our remaining differences.  I am 
willing to work to resolve them.  I am ready to meet tomorrow.  But I 
ask you to consider that we should at least enact these savings that 
both plans have in common and give the American people their balanced 
budget, a tax cut, lower interest rates, and a brighter future.  We 
should do that now and make permanent deficits yesterday's legacy.  
(Applause.)<P>

	     Now it is time for us to look also to the challenges of 
today and tomorrow, beyond the burdens of yesterday.  The challenges 
are significant.  But our nation was built on challenges.  America 
was built on challenges, not promises.  And when we work together to 
meet them, we never fail.  That is the key to a more perfect Union.  
Our individual dreams must be realized by our common efforts.<P>
	     
	     Tonight I want to speak to you about the challenges we 
all face as a people.  Our first challenge is to cherish our children 
and strengthen America's families.  Family is the foundation of 
American life.  If we have stronger families, we will have a stronger 
America.  <P>
	     
	     Before I go on, I'd like to take just a moment to thank 
my own family, and to thank the person who has taught me more than 
anyone else over 25 years about the importance of families and 
children -- a wonderful wife, a magnificent mother and a great First 
Lady.  Thank you, Hillary.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     All strong families begin with taking more 
responsibility for our children.  I've heard Mrs. Gore say that it's 
hard to be a parent today, but it's even harder to be a child.  So 
all of us, not just as parents, but all of us in our other roles -- 
our media, our schools, our teachers, our communities, our churches 
and synagogues, our businesses, our governments -- all of us have a 
responsibility to help our children to make it and to make the most 
of their lives and their God-given capacities.<P>
	     
	     To the media, I say you should create movies and CDs and 
television shows you'd want your own children and grandchildren to 
enjoy.  (Applause.)  <P>
	     
	     I call on Congress to pass the requirement for a V chip 
in TV sets so that parents can screen out programs they believe are 
inappropriate for their children.  (Applause.)  When parents control 
what their young children see, that is not censorship; that is 
enabling parents to assume more personal responsibility for their 
children's upbringing.  And I urge them to do it.  The V chip 
requirement is part of the important telecommunications bill now 
pending in this Congress.  It has bipartisan support, and I urge you 
to pass it now.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     To make the V chip work, I challenge the broadcast 
industry to do what movies have done -- to identify your program in 
ways that help parents to protect their children.  And I invite the 
leaders of major media corporations in the entertainment industry to 
come to the White House next month to work with us in a positive way 
on concrete ways to improve what our children see on television.  I 
am ready to work with you.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     I say to those who make and market cigarettes, every 
year a million children take up smoking, even though it's against the 
law.  Three hundred thousand of them will have their lives shortened 
as a result.  Our administration has taken steps to stop the massive 
marketing campaigns that appeal to our children.  We are simply 
saying:  Market your products to adults, if you wish, but draw the 
line on children.  (Applause.)<P>

	     I say to those who are on welfare, and especially to 
those who have been trapped on welfare for a long time:  For too long 
our welfare system has undermined the values of family and work, 
instead of supporting them.  The Congress and I are near agreement on 
sweeping welfare reform.  We agree on time limits, tough work 
requirements, and the toughest possible child support enforcement.  
But I believe we must also provide child care so that mothers who are 
required to go to work can do so without worrying about what is 
happening to their children.  (Applause.)<P>

	     I challenge this Congress to send me a bipartisan 
welfare reform bill that will really move people from welfare to work 
and do the right thing by our children.  I will sign it immediately.  
(Applause.)  <P>
	     
	     Let us be candid about this difficult problem.  Passing 
a law, even the best possible law, is only a first step.  The next 
step is to make it work.  I challenge people on welfare to make the 
most of this opportunity for independence.  I challenge American 
businesses to give people on welfare the chance to move into the work 
force.  I applaud the work of religious groups and other who care for 
the poor.  More than anyone else in our society, they know the true 
difficulty of the task before us, and they are in a position to help.<P>

	     Everyone of us should join them.  That is the only way 
we can make real welfare reform a reality in the lives of the 
American people.  <P>
	     
	     To strengthen the family we must do everything we can to 
keep the teen pregnancy rate going down.  I am gratified, as I'm sure 
all Americans are, that it has dropped for two years in a row.  But 
we all know it is still far too high.<P>
	     
	     Tonight I am pleased to announce that a group of 
prominent Americans is responding to that challenge by forming an 
organization that will support grass-roots community efforts all 
across our country in a national campaign against teen pregnancy.  
And I challenge all of us and every American to join their efforts. <P>
	     
	     I call on American men and women in families to give 
greater respect to one another.  We must end the deadly scourge of 
domestic violence in our country.  (Applause.)  And I challenge 
America's families to work harder to stay together.  For families who 
stay together not only do better economically, their children do 
better as well.     <P>
	     
	     In particular, I challenge the fathers of this country 
to love and care for their children.  If your family has separated, 
you must pay your child support.  We're doing more than ever to make 
sure you do, and we're going to do more, but let's all admit 
something about that, too:  A check will substitute for a parent's 
love and guidance.  And only you -- only you can make the decision to 
help raise your children.  No matter who you are, how low or high 
your station in life, it is the most basic human duty of every 
American to do that job to the best of his or her ability.  
(Applause.)  <P>
	     
	     Our second challenge is to provide Americans with the 
educational opportunities we'll all need for this new century.  In 
our schools, every classroom in America must be connected to the 
information superhighway, with computers and good software, and 
well-trained teachers.  We are working with the telecommunications 
industry, educators and parents to connect 20 percent of California's 
classrooms by this spring, and every classroom and every library in 
the entire United States by the year 2000.  (Applause.)  I ask 
Congress to support this education technology initiative so that we 
can make sure this national partnership succeeds.<P>
	     
	     Every diploma ought to mean something.  I challenge 
every community, every school and every state to adopt national 
standards of excellence; to measure whether schools are meeting those 
standards; to cut bureaucratic red tape so that schools and teachers 
have more flexibility for grass-roots reform; and to hold them 
accountable for results.  That's what our Goals 2000 initiative is 
all about.<P>
	     
	     I challenge every state to give all parents the right to 
choose which public school their children will attend; and to let 
teachers form new schools with a charter they can keep only if they 
do a good job.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     I challenge all our schools to teach character 
education, to teach good values and good citizenship.  And if it 
means that teenagers will stop killing each other over designer 
jackets, then our public schools should be able to require their 
students to wear school uniforms.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     I challenge our parents to become their children's first 
teachers.  Turn off the TV.  See that the homework is done.  And 
visit your children's classroom.  No program, no teacher, no one else 
can do that for you.<P>

	     My fellow Americans, higher education is more important 
today than ever before.  We've created a new student loan program 
that's made it easier to borrow and repay those loans, and we have 
dramatically cut the student loan default rate.  That's something we 
should all be proud of because it was unconscionably high just a few 
years ago.<P>

	     Through AmeriCorps, our national service program, this 
year 25,000 young people will earn college money by serving their 
local communities to improve the lives of their friends and 
neighbors.  (Applause.)<P>

	     These initiatives are right for America and we should 
keep them going.  And we should also work hard to open the doors of 
college even wider.  I challenge Congress to expand work-study and 
help one million young Americans work their way through college by 
the year 2000; to provide a $1000 merit scholarship for the top five 
percent of graduates in every high school in the United States; -- 
(applause) -- to expand Pell Grant scholarships for deserving and 
needy students; and to make up to $10,000 a year of college tuition 
tax deductible.  It's a good idea for America.  (Applause.)<P>

	     Our third challenge is to help every American who is 
willing to work for it, achieve economic security in this new age.  
People who work hard still need support to get ahead in the new 
economy.  They need education and training for a lifetime.  They need 
more support for families raising children.  They need retirement 
security.  They need access to health care.  More and more Americans 
are finding that the education of their childhood simply doesn't last 
a lifetime.  <P>
	     
	     So I challenge Congress to consolidate 70 overlapping, 
antiquated job-training programs into a simple voucher worth $2,600 
for unemployed or underemployed workers to use as they please for 
community college tuition or other training.  This is a G.I. Bill for 
America's workers we should all be able to agree on.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     More and more Americans are working hard without a 
raise.  Congress sets the minimum wage.  Within a year, the minimum 
wage will fall to a 40-year low in purchasing power.  Four dollars 
and 25 cents an hour is no longer a minimum wage, but millions of 
Americans and their children are trying to live on it.  I challenge 
you to raise their minimum wage.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     In 1993, Congress cut the taxes of 15 million 
hard-pressed working families to make sure that no parents who work 
full-time would have to raise their children in poverty, and to 
encourage people to move from welfare to work.  This expanded earned 
income tax credit is now worth about $1,800 a year to a family of 
four living on $20,000.  The budget bill I vetoed would have reversed 
this achievement and raised taxes on nearly 8 million of these 
people.  We should not do that.  We should not do that.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     I also agree that the people who are helped under this 
initiative are not all those in our country who are working hard to 
do a good job raising their children and at work.  I agree that we 
need a tax credit for working families with children.  That's one of 
the things most of us in this Chamber, I hope, can agree on.  I know 
it is strongly supported by the Republican majority.  And it should 
be part of any final budget agreement.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     I want to challenge every business that can possibly 
afford it to provide pensions for your employees.  And I challenge 
Congress to pass a proposal recommended by the White House Conference 
on Small Business that would make it easier for small businesses and 
farmers to establish their own pension plans.  That is something we 
should all agree on.  (Applause.)  <P>

	     We should also protect existing pension plans.  Two 
years ago, with bipartisan support that was almost unanimous on both 
sides of the aisle, we moved to protect the pensions of 8 million 
working people and to stabilize the pensions of 32 million more.  
Congress should not now let companies endanger those workers's 
pension funds.  (Applause.)<P>

	     I know the proposal to liberalize the ability of 
employers to take money out of pension funds for other purposes would 
raise money for the treasury.  But I believe it is false economy.  I 
vetoed that proposal last year, and I would have to do so again.  
(Applause.)<P>

	     Finally, if our working families are going to succeed in 
the new economy, they must be able to buy health insurance policies 
that they do not lose when they change jobs or when someone in their 
family gets sick.  Over the past two years, over one million 
Americans in working families have lost their health insurance.  We 
have to do more to make health care available to every American.  And 
Congress should start by passing the bipartisan bill sponsored by 
Senator Kennedy and Senator Kassebaum that would require insurance 
companies to stop dropping people when they switch jobs, and stop 
denying coverage for preexisting conditions.  Let's all do that.  
(Applause.)<P>

	     And even as we enact savings in these programs, we must 
have a common commitment to preserve the basic protections of 
Medicare and Medicaid -- not just to the poor, but to people in 
working families, including children, people with disabilities, 
people with AIDS, senior citizens in nursing homes.  <P>
	     
	     In the past three years, we've saved $15 billion just by 
fighting health care fraud and abuse.  We have all agreed to save 
much more.  We have all agreed to stabilize the Medicare Trust Fund.  
But we must not abandon our fundamental obligations to the people who 
need Medicare and Medicaid.  America cannot become stronger if they
become weaker.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     The G.I. Bill for workers, tax relief for education and 
child rearing, pension availability and protection, access to health 
care, preservation of Medicare and Medicaid -- these things, along 
with the Family and Medical Leave Act passed in 1993 -- these things 
will help responsible, hard-working American families to make the 
most of their own lives.  <P>
	     
	     But employers and employees must do their part, as well, 
as they are doing in so many of our finest companies -- working 
together, putting the long-term prosperity ahead of the short-term 
gain.  As workers increase their hours and their productivity, 
employers should make sure they get the skills they need and share 
the benefits of the good years, as well as the burdens of the bad 
ones.  When companies and workers work as a team they do better, and 
so does America.<P>
	     
	     Our fourth great challenge is to take our streets back 
from crime and gangs and drugs.  At last we have begun to find a way 
to reduce crime, forming community partnerships with local police 
forces to catch criminals and prevent crime.  This strategy, called 
community policing, is clearly working.  Violent crime is coming down 
all across America.  In New York City murders are down 25 percent; in 
St. Louis, 18 percent; in Seattle, 32 percent.		      But we 
still have a long way to go before our streets are safe and our 
people are free from fear. <P>
	     
	     The Crime Bill of 1994 is critical to the success of 
community policing.  It provides funds for 100,000 new police in 
communities of all sizes.  We're already a third of the way there.  
And I challenge the Congress to finish the job.  Let us stick with a 
strategy that's working and keep the crime rate coming down.  
(Applause.)
	     <P>
	     Community policing also requires bonds of trust between 
citizens and police.  I ask all Americans to respect and support our 
law enforcement officers.  And to our police, I say, our children 
need you as role models and heroes.  Don't let them down.<P>
	     
	     The Brady Bill has already stopped 44,000 people with 
criminal records from buying guns.  The assault weapons ban is 
keeping 19 kinds of assault weapons out of the hands of violent 
gangs.  I challenge the Congress to keep those laws on the books.  
(Applause.)<P>
	     
	     Our next step in the fight against crime is to take on 
gangs the way we once took on the mob.  I'm directing the FBI and 
other investigative agencies to target gangs that involve juveniles 
and violent crime, and to seek authority to prosecute as adults 
teenagers who maim and kill like adults.  <P>
	     
	     And I challenge local housing authorities and tenant 
associations:  Criminal gang members and drug dealers are destroying 
the lives of decent tenants.  From now on, the rule for residents who 
commit crime and pedal drugs should be one strike and you're out.  
(Applause.)<P>
	     
	     I challenge every state to match federal policy to 
assure that serious violent criminals serve at least 85 percent of 
their sentence.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     More police and punishment are important, but they're 
not enough.  We have got to keep more of our young people out of 
trouble, with prevention strategies not dictated by Washington, but 
developed in communities.  I challenge all of our communities, all of 
our adults, to give our children futures to say yes to.  And I 
challenge Congress not to abandon the Crime Bill's support of these 
grass-roots prevention efforts.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     Finally, to reduce crime and violence we have to reduce 
the drug problem.  The challenge begins in our homes, with parents 
talking to their children openly and firmly.  It embraces our 
churches and synagogues, our youth groups and our schools.  <P>
	     
	     I challenge Congress not to cut our support for 
drug-free schools.  People like the DARE officers are making a real 
impression on grade schoolchildren that will give them the strength 
to say no when the time comes.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     Meanwhile, we continue our efforts to cut the flow of 
drugs into America.  For the last two years, one man in particular 
has been on the front lines of that effort.  Tonight I am nominating 
him -- a hero of the Persian Gulf War and the Commander in Chief of 
the United States Military Southern Command -- General Barry 
McCaffrey, as America's new Drug Czar.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     General McCaffrey has earned three Purple Hearts and two 
Silver Stars fighting for this country.  Tonight I ask that he lead 
our nation's battle against drugs at home and abroad.  To succeed, he 
needs a force far larger than he has ever commanded before.  He needs 
all of us.  Every one of us has a role to play on this team.  <P>
	     
	     Thank you, General McCaffrey, for agreeing to serve your 
country one more time.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     Our fifth challenge:  to leave our environment safe and 
clean for the next generation.  Because of a generation of bipartisan 
effort we do have cleaner water and air, lead levels in children's 
blood has been cut by 70 percent, toxic emissions from factories cut 
in half.  Lake Erie was dead, and now it's a thriving resource.  But 
10 million children under 12 still live within four miles of a toxic 
waste dump.  A third of us breathe air that endangers our health.  
And in too many communities the water is not safe to drink.  We still 
have much to do.  
	     <P>
	     Yet Congress has voted to cut environmental enforcement 
by 25 percent.  That means more toxic chemicals in our water, more 
smog in our air, more pesticides in our food.  Lobbyists for 
polluters have been allowed to write their own loopholes into bills 
to weaken laws that protect the health and safety of our children.  
Some say that the taxpayer should pick up the tab for toxic waste and 
let polluters who can afford to fix it off the hook.  I challenge 
Congress to reexamine those policies and to reverse them.  
(Applause.)  <P>
	     
	     This issue has not been a partisan issue.  The most 
significant environmental gains in the last 30 years were made under 
a Democratic Congress and President Richard Nixon.  We can work 
together.  We have to believe some basic things.  Do you believe we 
can expand the economy without hurting the environment?  I do.  Do 
you believe we can create more jobs over the long run by cleaning the 
environment up?  I know we can.  That should be our commitment.  
(Applause.)<P>

	     We must challenge businesses and communities to take 
more initiative in protecting the environment, and we have to make it 
easier for them to do it.  To businesses this administration is 
saying:  If you can find a cheaper, more efficient way than 
government regulations require to meet tough pollution standards, do 
it -- as long as you do it right.  To communities we say:  We must 
strengthen community right-to-know laws requiring polluters to 
disclose their emissions, but you have to use the information to work 
with business to cut pollution.  People do have a right to know that 
their air and their water are safe.  (Applause.)<P>

	     Our sixth challenge is to maintain America's leadership 
in the fight for freedom and peace throughout the world.  Because of 
American leadership, more people than ever before live free and at 
peace.  And Americans have known 50 years of prosperity and security. <P>

	     We owe thanks especially to our veterans of World War 
II.  (Applause.)  I would like to say to Senator Bob Dole and to all 
others in this Chamber who fought in World War II, and to all others 
on both sides of the aisle who have fought bravely in all our 
conflicts since:  I salute your service and so do the American 
people.  (Applause.)<P>

	     All over the world, even after the Cold War, people 
still look to us and trust us to help them seek the blessings of 
peace and freedom.  But as the Cold War fades into memory, voices of 
isolation say America should retreat from its responsibilities.  I 
say they are wrong.<P>
	     
	     The threats we face today as Americans respect no 
nation's borders.  Think of them:  terrorism, the spread of weapons 
of mass destruction, organized crime, drug trafficking, ethnic and 
religious hatred, aggression by rogue states, environmental 
degradation.  If we fail to address these threats today, we will 
suffer the consequences in all our tomorrows.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     Of course, we can't be everywhere.  Of course, we can't 
do everything.  But where our interests and our values are at stake, 
and where we can make a difference, America must lead.  We must not 
be isolationist.  We must not be the world's policeman.  But we can 
and should be the world's very best peacemaker.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     By keeping our military strong, by using diplomacy where 
we can and force where we must, by working with others to share the 
risk and the cost of our efforts, America is making a difference for 
people here and around the world.  For the first time since the dawn 
of the nuclear age -- for the first time since the dawn of the 
nuclear age -- there is not a single Russian missile pointed at 
America's children.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     North Korea has now frozen its dangerous nuclear weapons 
program.  In Haiti, the dictators are gone, democracy has a new day, 
the flow of desperate refugees to our shores has subsided.  Through 
tougher trade deals for America -- over 80 of them -- we have opened 
markets abroad, and now exports are at an all-time high, growing 
faster than imports and creating good American jobs.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     We stood with those taking risks for peace:  In Northern 
Ireland, where Catholic and Protestant children now tell their 
parents, violence must never return.  In the Middle East, where Arabs 
and Jews who once seemed destined to fight forever now share 
knowledge and resources, and even dreams.  <P>
	     
	     And we stood up for peace in Bosnia.  Remember the 
skeletal prisoners, the mass graves, the campaign to rape and 
torture, the endless lines of refugees, the threat of a spreading 
war.  All these threats, all these horrors have now begun to give way 
to the promise of peace.  Now, our troops and a strong NATO, together 
with our new partners from Central Europe and elsewhere, are helping 
that peace to take hold.  <P>
	     
	     As all of you know, I was just there with a bipartisan 
congressional group, and I was so proud not only of what our troops 
were doing, but of the pride they evidenced in what they were doing.  
They knew what America's mission in this world is, and they were 
proud to be carrying it out.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     Through these efforts, we have enhanced the security of 
the American people.  But make no mistake about it:  important 
challenges remain.  <P>
	     
	     The START II Treaty with Russia will cut our nuclear 
stockpiles by another 25 percent.  I urge the Senate to ratify it 
now.  (Applause.)  We must end the race to create new nuclear weapons 
by signing a truly comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty this year.  
(Applause.)  <P>
	     
	     As we remember what happened in the Japanese subway, we 
can outlaw poison gas forever if the Senate ratifies the Chemical 
Weapons Convention this year.  (Applause.)  We can intensify the 
fight against terrorists and organized criminals at home and abroad 
if Congress passes the anti-terrorism legislation I proposed after 
the Oklahoma City bombing now.  (Applause.)  We can help more people 
move from hatred to hope all across the world in our own interest if 
Congress gives us the means to remain the world's leader for peace.  
(Applause.)<P>
	     
	     My fellow Americans, the six challenges I have just 
discussed are for all of us.  Our seventh challenge is really 
America's challenge to those of us in this hallowed hall tonight:  to 
reinvent our government and make our democracy work for them.  <P>
	     
	     Last year this Congress applied to itself the laws it 
applies to everyone else.  (Applause.)  This Congress banned gifts 
and meals from lobbyists.  This Congress forced lobbyists to disclose 
who pays them and what legislation they are trying to pass or kill.  
This Congress did that, and I applaud you for it.  (Applause.)<P>

	     Now I challenge Congress to go further -- to curb 
special interest influence in politics by passing the first truly 
bipartisan campaign reform bill in a generation.  (Applause.)  You, 
Republicans and Democrats alike, can show the American people that we 
can limit spending and we can open the airwaves to all candidates.  
(Applause.)  <P>
	     
	     I also appeal to Congress to pass the line-item veto you 
promised the American people.  (Applause.)<P>

	     Our administration is working hard to give the American 
people a government that works better and costs less.  Thanks to the 
work of Vice President Gore, we are eliminating 16,000 pages of 
unnecessary rules and regulations, shifting more decision-making out 
of Washington, back to states and local communities.<P>

	     As we move into the era of balanced budgets and smaller 
government, we must work in new ways to enable people to make the 
most of their own lives.  We are helping America's communities, not 
with more bureaucracy, but with more opportunities.  Through our 
successful empowerment zones and community development banks, we're 
helping people to find jobs, to start businesses.  And with tax 
incentives for companies that clean up abandoned industrial property, 
we can bring jobs back to places that desperately, desperately need 
them.<P>

	     But there are some areas that the federal government 
should not leave and should address and address strongly.  One of 
these areas is the problem of illegal immigration.  After years of 
neglect, this administration has taken a strong stand to stiffen the 
protection of our borders.  We are increasing border controls by 50 
percent.  We are increasing inspections to prevent the hiring of 
illegal immigrants.  And tonight, I announce I will sign an executive 
order to deny federal contracts to businesses that hire illegal 
immigrants.  (Applause.)<P>

	     Let me be very clear about this:  We are still a nation 
of immigrants; we should be proud of it.  We should honor every legal 
immigrant here, working hard to be a good citizen, working hard to 
become a new citizen.  But we are also a nation of laws.<P>

	     I want to say a special word now to those who work for 
our federal government.  Today our federal is 200,000 employees 
smaller than it was the day I took office as President.  (Applause.)
Our federal government today is the smallest it has been in 30 years, 
and it's getting smaller every day.  Most of our fellow Americans 
probably don't know that.  And there's a good reason -- a good 
reason:  The remaining federal work force is composed of hard-working 
Americans who are now working harder and working smarter than ever 
before to make sure the quality of our services does not decline.  
(Applause.)  <P>
	     
	     I'd like to give you one example.  His name is Richard 
Dean.  He's a 49 year-old Vietnam veteran who's worked for the Social 
Security Administration for 22 years now.  Last year he was hard at 
work in the Federal Building in Oklahoma City when the blast killed 
169 people and brought the rubble down all around him.  He reentered 
that building four times.  He saved the lives of three women.  He's 
here with us this evening, and I want to recognize Richard and 
applaud both his public service and his extraordinary personal 
heroism.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     But Richard Dean's story doesn't end there.  This last 
November, he was forced out of his office when the government shut 
down.  And the second time the government shut down he continued 
helping Social Security recipients, but he was working without pay. <P>
	     
	     On behalf of Richard Dean and his family, and all the 
other people who are out there working every day doing a good job for 
the American people, I challenge all of you in this Chamber:  Never, 
ever shut the federal government down again.  (Applause.)<P>
	     
	     On behalf of all Americans, especially those who need 
their Social Security payments at the beginning of March, I also 
challenge the Congress to preserve the full faith and credit of the 
United States -- to honor the obligations of this great nation as we 
have for 220 years; to rise above partisanship and pass a 
straightforward extension of the debt limit and show people America 
keeps its word.  (Applause.)  <P>
	     
	     I know that this evening I have asked a lot of Congress, 
and even more from America.  But I am confident:  When Americans work 
together in their homes, their schools, their churches, their 
synagogues, their civic groups, their workplace, they can meet any 
challenge.  <P>
	     
	     I say again, the era of big government is over.  But we 
can't go back to the era of fending for yourself.  We have to go 
forward to the era of working together as a community, as a team, as 
one America, with all of us reaching across these lines that divide 
us -- the division, the discrimination, the rancor -- we have to 
reach across it to find common ground.  We have got to work together 
if we want America to work.  (Applause.)<P>

	     I want you to meet two more people tonight who do just 
that.  Lucius Wright is a teacher in the Jackson, Mississippi, public 
school system.  A Vietnam veteran, he has created groups to help 
inner-city children turn away from gangs and build futures they can 
believe in.  Sergeant Jennifer Rodgers is a police officer in 
Oklahoma City.  Like Richard Dean, she helped to pull her fellow 
citizens out of the rubble and deal with that awful tragedy.  She 
reminds us that in their response to that atrocity the people of 
Oklahoma City lifted all of us with their basic sense of decency and 
community.  <P>

	     Lucius Wright and Jennifer Rodgers are special 
Americans.  And I have the honor to announce tonight that they are 
the very first of several thousand Americans who will be chosen to 
carry the Olympic torch on its long journey from Los Angeles to the 
centennial of the modern Olympics in Atlanta this summer -- not 
because they are star athletes, but because they are star citizens, 
community heroes meeting America's challenges.  They are our real 
champions.  <P>
	     
	     Please stand up.  (Applause.)<P>

	     Now, each of us must hold high the torch of citizenship 
in our own lives.  None of us can finish the race alone.  We can only 
achieve our destiny together -- one hand, one generation, one 
American connecting to another.<P>
	     
	     There have always been things we could to together, 
dreams we could make real which we could never have done on our own.  
We Americans have forged our identity, our very union, from the very 
point of view that we can accommodate every point on the planet, 
every different opinion.  But we must be bound together by a faith 
more powerful than any doctrine that divides us -- by our believe in 
progress, our love of liberty, and our relentless search for common 
ground.  <P>
	     
	     America has always sought and always risen to every 
challenge.  Who would say that having come so far together, we will 
not go forward from here?  Who would say that this age of possibility 
is not for all Americans?  <P>
	     
	     Our country is and always has been a great and good 
nation.  But the best is yet to come if we all do our parts. <P>
	     
	     Thank you, God bless you and God bless the United States 
of America.  Thank you.  (Applause.)<P>

<H2>Transcript of Bob Dole's response to the President's address</H2>

<P>January 23, 1996<BR></center>

<P>From the Associated Press
<blockquote>
<P>Text of the Republican response by Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole to President Clinton's State of the Union address. 

<P>Good evening. I'm Bob Dole, and I'm here to briefly reply to the president's message on the state of the union. But a reply need not be an argument. Instead, I want to present another view. Another way of thinking about the problems we face. 

<P>A few years back I met with a group of 100 high school seniors -- one young man and a woman from every state. During the meeting one young man stood up and said "Senator, everybody has somebody who speaks for them. But who speaks for us?" he asked me. "Who speaks for the future?" 

<P>That's what I want to talk with you about tonight -- the future and the values that will shape it. Those values are at the heart of our disagreements with the president. President Clinton says our differences are few, the budget numbers are close and that we should try to find common ground. We have tried and tried, again and again. But such a place appears to be elusive. 

<P>For while we share an abiding love of country, we have been unable to agree. Why? Because we have starkly different philosophies of government and profoundly different visions of America. So all the talk and fighting in Washington can seem very remote. And we political figures can seem detached and petty and far removed from the every day struggle of American citizens and families. 
<P>But the truth is we can not ignore the future. The point of our lives, after all, is to raise children who are smarter and healthier and nobler than we are; to contribute to a country that is better than today's America; to make a world that is better and finer for all of God's creation. 

<P>America's greatness -- all that we take such justified pride in today -- America's greatness was built by men and women who sacrificed ease and comfort and the joys of today, to build a better future for those who came after. How many pioneers faced a hostile and threatening frontier? How many immigrants gave their bodies to the mines? And how many soldiers lost their lives on the distant battlefields to secure a better future for their children and their children's children? 

<P>In every generation, Americans have made these sacrifices, and found in their making a purpose and a direction to life. Now we have to do that in this generation. And thanks to God and fortune and those who went before, we don't have to conquer a dangerous frontier. We don't have to fight another great war. What we do have to do is face the fact that we cannot give in to all of our own desires. As we have just heard, President Clinton and those who share his vision of America have chosen their ground. 

<P>The president chose to defend, with his veto, a welfare system that no one can defend -- for it is a daily assault on the values of self-reliance and family. He has chosen to defend an education establishment run by liberals whose goal is to operate every school in America by remote control from Washington. He has chosen to veto a defense bill because it provided for defending America against weapons of mass destruction. 

<P>He has chosen to defend the status quo in Medicare -- a system on which lives depend and a program in urgent need of rescue. President Clinton has chosen to defend and increase a tax burden that has pushed countless families into their own personal recessions. And unfortunately, he has chosen to veto the first balanced budget in a generation, offering only a fantasy in its place. 

<P>Now if you have a child asleep in your home tonight, you will probably check on him or her before you go to bed. As you bend over to tuck your child in, think about this: If we continue down this path we will place a tremendous burden of debt on every child in America. How can we betray them and their parents and grandparents? How can we fail to act? We cannot, and we will not. 

<P>Every political movement, and every public official must locate a place in his heart where compromise ends -- a core of conviction where we keep our conscience. There comes a time when even practical leaders must refuse to bend or to yield. For Republicans and countless Democrats and independents, we have arrived at that time. 

<P>America's troubles are real, but our choices are clear and our will is strong. We must rein in our runaway government, return power to the people, reduce the tax burden. Put parents back in charge of our schools. Untie the hands of our police. Restore justice to our courts and put our faith once again in the basic goodness, wisdom and self-reliance of our people. 

<P>Well, the president spoke with great eloquence about a future with unlimited possibilities. It is a vision we all share, for it is the story of America. 

<P>But while the president's words speak of change, his deeds are a contradiction. The president claims to embrace the future while clinging to the policies of the past. 

<P>For three years this administration has valued dependence on government over self-reliance. Federal power over community, federal planning over individual enterprise. It has tried to place government experts in charge of our economy and our health and our lives. 

<P>It has put liberal judges on the bench to war with our values and it questions the participation of religious people in public life, treating them as fanatics out of step with America. 

<P>President Clinton shares a view of America held by our country's elites. 

<P>A nation of special interest groups united only by a dependence on government, competing with each other for handouts and held back by outdated values. For those who hold this view, there is only one answer for our problems: 

<P>More government. 

<P>Bigger government. 

<P>More meddlesome government. 

<P>If you listened closely tonight, that's what President Clinton talked about. President Clinton may well be the rear guard of the welfare state. He is the chief obstacle to a balanced budget and the balanced budget amendment. He is almost the last public defender of a discredited status quo. We Republicans will not give up the struggle because America will round the corner to a brighter future if we prevail. 

<P>I come from Russell, Kansas -- there's not much money there, but the people are rich in many other ways. Life isn't always easy, but the values are durable -- love of God and country and family, commitment to honesty, decency and personal responsibility, and self-reliance tempered by a sense of community. 

<P>Those values made America the greatest nation on earth, and there is no doubt in my mind that we can get our country back on track if we reassert them again as a people, and if our government returns to them as a matter of national policy. 

<P>Now just like the debate over the budget this wither, our arguments this spring will seem a maze of conflicting numbers, assertions and high-sounding words. But what we're really arguing about are the values that will shape our nation, our government, and the future of that child sleeping down the hall. 

<P>Now some people try to make these matters complicated, but they're simple in my home town -- and probably where you are, as well. Americans know that handouts without responsibility destroy human dignity. 

<P>We know that the help of a neighbor is preferable to that of a bureaucrat. And we know that wealth is created by free individuals with their smarts and their sweat. Government programs can only spend it. 

<P>I'm a very practical man, but I believe in the miracle of America and I've never gone in for dramatics, but I do believe we have reached a defining moment. It is as if we went to sleep in one America and woke up in another. 

<P>It is as though our government and our institutions and our culture have been attacked by liberals and are careening dangerously off course. But we know the way back, but we must act now and my promise tonight is that we can, and we will. 

<P>If there is no agreement, we will send President Clinton another balanced budget with tax relief for American families, regulatory relief for small businesses, farmers and ranchers and real welfare reform. 

<P>We will always be mindful of the poor and disadvantaged, education and the environment. But we will begin the defunding of Big Brother by unfunding wasteful programs and meddlesome departments. We will send the president bill after bill, returning power and programs to the states and to the people. 

<P>We will challenge President Clinton again and again to walk the talk he talks so well. As we do, remember this: Our battles will not be about numbers. They'll be about the character of our nation. Yes, our country has problems. But we can handle them. 

<P>Whether it's deficit spending or the welfare bureaucracy or our liberal courts or the trouble in our schools, what's wrong is that the elites in charge don't believe in what the people believe in. That we can fix. We know what made America great. All we need now is the resolve to lead our country back to her place in the sun and the courage to speak for the future. 

<P>So when you close the door to your child's room tonight, remember, it's not too late. This is a great country. Our strength has always come from the truth, and from sacrifice and honor, and from the bottomless reservoir of hope and work and courage that is the American people. Always, we have built for the future with a half-silent consciousness that we were doing the work of the Lord. 

<P>Today, we feel ourselves beset by many difficulties: by violence and resentment, by racial and partisan divisions, by economic storms, by dizzying changes of every kind. 

<P>Yet, the blood of greatness, of noble forebears, of men and women of incredible achievement still runs through us all. That birthright is what it means to bear the name "American." 

<P>In this time, in this generation, in this year, we -- like they -- can and will overcome. We need only to rededicate ourselves to earning the name we have inherited. 

<P>Thank you very much. God bless America and good night.

<h2>Are We Reliving the 1850s?</h2>
<P>
by <a href="/pff/people/sfellow.htm#Vlahos">Michael Vlahos</a>
</center><P>
 <ul><blockquote>
The Big Election fanned The Talk.  Now everyone in town was asking,
is the realignment that comes every two or three generations really
upon us?  Is this the next Big Change in American politics?
<P>
And the next question was always:  Which realignment?  Is this
one more like 1932 or 1896?  Long wave theories trotted out. 
Names like Hanna and Bryan were heard again.
<P>
But with Oklahoma City and Waco, murmurs of the 1850s began to
lace The Talk.  On the evening of the Million Man March, the Speaker
of the House came right out and said it:  today is like the 1850s.
<P>
The 1850s were scary times.  People killed for ideology, called
the government corrupt and tyrannical, and dreamed draconian national
solutions.  
<P>
But it still looks like a pretty superficial stretch ... that
is, until I read Bill Gienapp's <I>Origins of the Republican Party,
1852-56.  </I>He tells a riveting story, a remarkable feat for
600-odd pages in micronic font, broken only by maps of county-by-county
voting.  Why is it so compelling?
<P>
Because even when you get down to details, the talk and feel of
another time:  it reads like today.
<P>
I wanted to put this historical deja vu to the test, so I sought
out Professor Gienapp.  I wanted to lay out all the leaping associations
and harmonic resonances, and see what the sober historian would
have to say.
<P>
Here, in thumbnail, is how it went.  I started by laying out the
case:
<ul><P>
<B>The Dem's in 1852.</B>
<P>
We like to talk about how Democrats have dominated politics since
the New Deal.  But the Democracy of the 1850's [as they liked
to call themselves] had run the show since America began.  In
1860, we could look back on slave-owning presidents for 50 our
our first 71 years.  The majority of Speakers of the House, of
Presidents <I>Pro Tem</I>;  and <I>always</I>, a majority of the
Supreme Court, was Southern.  The Southern Democrat vision of
American politics <I>was</I> American politics.
<P>
<B>The Economic Revolution.</B>
<P>
We are abuzz with an Information Revolution.  But Americans then
were laboring to adjust to something even more elemental:  an
Industrial Revolution.  The Big Change that would transform American
life was just starting its sweep in the 1850's, as the great urban
migration hit railroad stride.  City populations doubled and tripled:
 New York went from 20% urban in 1850 to 40% in 1860.  And the
yeoman farmer was being displaced by the factory worker.  In 1860,
wage laborers for the first time equaled the self-employed.  And
the new world was being built in the North.  The South was being
left behind ... along with its grip on political power.
<P>
<B>The Death of the Whigs.</B>
<P>
For decades the Whigs had been the second party:  the party of
economic growth.  But they had lived under the shadow of the Democrats,
and having made their compact with The Democracy, they dared not
challenge the arrangements that gave Democrats political sway.
 But the narrow fiscal issues around which they had crafted their
platform had all dried up.  Whigs had nothing to say to people
in the new world being made by railroad and mill.  Does this remind
us just a bit of our own Country Club Republicans?  Having nothing
to say, the Whigs crashed and burned in the election of 1992;
 I mean, 1852.
<P>
<B>The <I>Know Nothings</I>.</B>
<P>
From the wreckage of the Whigs came two new parties.  By far the
biggest, representing regular people in both North and South,
was the North American Party, who also styled themselves <I>Know
Nothings</I>.  These were people who saw their way of life eroding,
their hope for the future slipping away.  Economic revolution
was creating a new world of wage labor, of industrial slums, and
of job competition with the millions of immigrants pouring into
American life.  <I>Know Nothings</I> were anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic,
much the way workers today are anti-immigrant and anti-UN/NAFTA/WTO,
where the immigrant is the embodiment of large change threatening
their job, and where the foreign institution poking into American
life threatens liberty itself.  Their ranks are filled with Protestant
evangelicals, and their vision is full of nostalgia for a better,
truer, American Dream from a world gone by.
<P>
<B>The New Republicans.</B>
<P>
The Republicans, in contrast, come as the party of revolution.
 They looked to the future, and to a renewed American Dream. 
Their ranks were flush with old abolitionists, once marginal to
the political scene, who now saw their chance to bring sacred
principles to the center of politics [they acted a little like
some Libertarians we know].  And they have the support of new
money, the new entrepeneurs of the industrial age.  Money flows
in from the high technologies, the <I>parvenu</I> corporations
built on iron rails.  But Republicans have a problem: the <I>Know
Nothings</I> are a majority in the North.  How to woo them, how
to make a new national party - not like the old Whigs, built on
fiscal probity, nor like the <I>Know Nothings</I>, on nativism
- but on a new vision of American life?
<P>
<B>The Issue.</B>
<P>
We still think the issue was slavery ... getting rid of it, that
is.  The truth is  Republicans did something very different. 
They ditched whining, moralistic cries for abolition.  They said
instead:  <I>The ruling Old Order of Democrats and comprador Whigs
is a monster, slowly robbing Americans </I>[white male voters]<I>
of their liberty.  And because it is on the defensive, it has
turned aggressive, so it must be stopped now</I>.  And Republicans
called this Old Order, <I>The Slave Power</I>, the vested interest
of the past, European in its concept of hierarchy and rule, and
so inimical to American virtue and the American idea.  What this
meant is that Republicans took people's fears of change and uncertainty
about their future, which had fastened on a mix of neighborhood
scapegoats [immigrants] and ethereal tyrannies [the Catholic Church],
and turned them on the reigning political elite and its paradigm
of rule.  It took the Christian right of 1854 and said:  to get
to a better America, to renew the American Dream, we must first
destroy <I>The Slave Power</I>. 
<P>
Looking back, what will people say about us?  Can we frame the
battle as well as those first Republicans?
<P>
<B>The Talk.</B>
<P>
Paranoid politics?  Why, yes.  As Gienapp points out through his
narrative, it is the heart of American political tradition.  Our
first revolution made it so.  In the nineteenth century the big
conflicts in American politics were all conspiracies directed
against Liberty.  For the Jacksonians, it was the Banks.  For
the Whigs, it was the power of the Executive Branch.  For the
<I>Know Nothings</I>, it was the Catholic Church.  And for Republicans,
it was the Southern-dominated political system.  Conspiracies
against Liberty hearken back to our founding, and before our founding,
as the earliest Americans sought to escape European tyrants. 
It was inevitable that the main threat to Liberty would eventually
arise at home, from among our own.  People believed this ... <I>and
still do</I>:  it is an existential theme in America's Pilgrim's
Progress.  And set against a general backdrop of uncertainty and
upheaval in national life, the retro-look and feel of the Southern
political paradigm (and its manifest failure to lead nationally)
cried out for definition.  And define it the Republicans did.
   
<P>
The Democracy entered yet another administration in 1856, owning,
again, both houses of Congress and the Presidency.  But theirs
was a weak, pusillanimous Commander-in-Chief, whose venality and
corruption was exposed to all in 1860.  Republican success in
defining Democrats as an Old Order elite standing in the way of
progress, liberty, and America's future was there for everyone
to see in the mid-term election of 1858, when they swept Congress.
<P>
Here are some swatches from Gienapp on early Republican ideology:
<P>
At the heart of free labor ideology was the idea that every man,
as Abraham Lincoln phrased it, had a right to rise economically
and socially to the limit of his ability  ...  Upholding the reality
of the American dream, the free labor ideal represented the optimistic
side of the Republican appeal.
<P>
or,
<P>
As a heritage of the American Revolution ... the ideology of republicanism
... included the fear of concentrated power ... and the belief
that such power was the natural enemy of liberty and if unchecked
would eventually destroy it.
<P></ul>
Still<I> deja vu?</I>
<P><ul>
<I><B>What doesn't work.</B></I>
<P>
Well, not quite.  Uncompromising as historian, Gienapp restrained
this writer's rush to neatly tie things up.  He sees three dissonances
especially that should keep us from claiming immediate kinship
with Seward, Greeley, Chase, Sumner, and Lincoln. 
<P>
      
<P>
<B>The Voter and Voting.</B>
<P>
Who voted in the 1850's.  That's easy:  white men.  But there's
more.  These were very young white men, and they were deeply engaged
in politics.  They may not have had as much formal schooling,
but they knew the issues better than most of us today.  They lived
politics, chewed politics;  rallies and parades were their theater,
their TV.  It was cool to be hot and partisan, and these were
aggressive young men.  Look at their sacrifice in war just ahead.
<P>
Contrast that voter profile to today's.  The age pyramid is geting
stood on its head, and people who actually vote are much, much
older.  Hardly a revolutionary cadre.  And how we vote is different
too.  Government did not control voting:  in the 1850's, anyone
could print up a ballot and vote.  So it was easy for new parties
to emerge.  After 1900, the two parties have worked together to
control, to keep others out.  Gienapp puts it this way:  imagine
if Colin Powell, rather than slogging through the primaries, could
just hand out ballots!
<P>
<B>Party decomposition.</B>
<P>
And though the Whigs of 1852 could have stood in nicely for George
Bush, the debacle of 1992 did not lead to the party's fall.  It's
all still there,  Old Whigs, <I>Know Nothings</I>, and radical
Republicans, all under the same umbrella.  But keeping a lid on
means that instead of rollicking chaos, forcing creativity, and
then creating a new vision, Republicans shoulder on as the Grand
<I>Old</I> Party with three visions:  one Democrat-comprador,
one a nostalgia-mongering return to The Golden Age, and one of
revolution.  The old order Democrats, flat on their backs, thus
still survive.  In weak niches, like the presidency, they may
even flourish.
<P>
  
<P>
<B>The Issue as Talk.</B>
<P>
And where is slavery?  So many other features seem to be in place:
 the economic revolution, the fears of regular people, the obdurate,
grasping control of a dying elite.  But two things that make one
are missing.
<P>
The first is a driving vision of America's future.  True, the
first Republicans didn't have that at first.  They were all negative,
their issues all about stopping the power of government gone wrong,
dismantling the structures of that power itself.  But after 1856,
they became more positive.  Their slogan, <I>Free Men, Free Labor,
Free Soil</I>, had a message:  that economic change, however unsettling,
would offer more opportunity, more wealth, and more freedom to
all Americans.  They promised a renewal of the American Dream.
<P>
But that renewal would never happen as long as <I>The Slave Power</I>
stood in the way.  Its entire energy was intent on stopping change,
on cementing its control over American life and liberty.  <I><B>Progress</B></I>
and <I><B>Anti-Progress</B></I> were thus symbolically intertwined
as political message.
<P>
Some resonances to this message leaked out of the Great Health
Care Debate of 1994.  The Old Order was clearly painted as attempting
to aggressively extend its social-bureaucratic vision in order
to entrench its power.  People came close to politically visualizing
a contemporary counterpart to the old Slave Power in the form
of a national ruling class centered in Washington <I>[in one national
poll from November, 1994, Americans 2-1 said that Washington was
an imperial city ruled by an imperial class].</I> 
<P>
But since that election, the lines have blurred again.  The Democracy
was visited by, and made, huge mistakes in the 1850s, from Bloody
Kansas to the caning of Sumner.  Southern Democrats let the new
Republicans define them.  Today's old order is much more sly.
<P>
Perhaps it is too soon to talk loosely about the 1850s.  We may
be knee-deep in economic revolution, but it's not flood stage
yet.  But just wait until it threatens the brittle dikes of the
old politics, and its <I>ancien regime</I>. 
<P>
Then, on the [next] net, maybe we'll be printing our own ballots
again.

<HEAD><title>Headway - From the Publisher - January 96</title>
<META NAME="GENERATOR" CONTENT="Internet Assistant for Word 1.0Z">
</HEAD>

<BODY>
<h2>From the Publisher</h2><p>
<h3>January 1996</h3>
<p><img src="red-line.gif"><p>      
<P>

<P>
This edition of <I>Headway</I> launches a new beginning for our
publication. As our readers know, since its inception in 1988
as a newsletter, our publication has been titled <I>National Minority
Politics</I>. Several months ago, our corporate board of directors,
including the publisher and editor, decided that, as a move toward
expanding the magazine's base and ensuring future growth, we would
change the Publication's name.
<P>
Why a name change and why now, some might ask. The reasons are
varied and numerous. First our name was simply too long for a
magazine title. One-word or two-word titles in the magazine industry
are the general rule, and we wanted to bring our publication in
line with industry standards.
<P>
Second, our name became too much of an issue for some potential
subscribers and advertisers. The term &quot;minority&quot; has
many connotations, most of which, for our purposes, carried more
cons than pros. For example, &quot;minority&quot; usually means
a member of a racial minority, but in today's era of micro-classification,
now almost everyone qualifies as a minority. From a political
standpoint, the term &quot;minority&quot; also implies a liberal,
big government ideology. Because of this, many potential readers
also mistakenly presumed that our publication has a liberal slant,
which it clearly does not.
<P>
Others thought we were a political organization, rather than a
magazine. Still others thought that the magazine was only for
minorities, which is certainly not the case. Our readership is
racially and ethnically diverse, and we have made an effort to
see that it remains so. Without discourse across racial and ethnic
lines, we have no hope of ever solving any of the problems our
nation faces.
<P>
Third, our name was too narrow and confining. Yes, we do primarily
discuss political issues, but not exclusively. Yes, the majority
of our writers are black or Hispanic, but, more importantly, they
are excellent, deliberative thinkers. Labeling them as merely
&quot;minority&quot; writers somehow seemed to diminish their
credentials.
<P>
Finally, we wanted a name which implied that we were looking toward
the future, that we were winning the philosophical battle, that
we were ahead of the curve in presenting ideas on the nation's
most vital issues, that ours is not a racial magazine, but an
ideas magazine. We believe the name <I>Headway</I> does just that.
<P>
But for those who have expressed their preference for our current
format and content, not to worry. There will be no substantial
changes in the format or content. We will be adding a few new
writers and sections, but our approach to the issues--and our
promotion of the ideals of strong families, individual responsibility,
free enterprise and limited government--will remain constant.
<P>
We would like to express our thanks to our staff and writers,
many of whom have been with us since our expansion to a magazine
format. We would also like to thank our committed readers for
their support and for spreading the word about <I>National Minority
Politics</I>. We hope you will continue to be ambassadors for
<I>Headway</I> as well.
<P>
We're looking forward to a successful 1996, and extend the same
wishes to all our readers.
<P>

<title>How Washington Subverts Your Local Sheriff -- Policy Review -- 
Jan/Feb 96 -- Heritage</title>

<h2>How Washington Subverts Your Local Sheriff</h2>

by <a href="/heritage/staff/meese.htm">Edwin Meese III</a> & <b>Rhett DeHart</b>
<p><b><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</b><br>

                                  January-February 1996, Number 75</I>
<hr width=50%>
</center><p>
<P>
	In recent years, two tragic events have fundamentally changed the way many Americans view 
federal law-enforcement agencies and jeopardized public confidence in the federal government 
itself. In August 1992, U.S. marshals sought to arrest white separatist Randy Weaver at his 
remote mountain cabin in Ruby Ridge, Idaho. A confrontation resulted in the death of a federal 
marshal and Weaver's 14-year-old son. Special FBI teams were called in, and during the siege 
that followed, Weaver's wife was killed by an FBI sniper's bullet. At his subsequent trial, 
Weaver was acquitted of all but the most minor offenses.
<p>
	Since Ruby Ridge, federal law enforcement as a whole has come under intense congressional 
and media scrutiny. Even those normally supportive of the police ask: Should the federal 
government have risked this loss of life and expended $10 million to capture a hermit whose 
only alleged crime was selling two sawed-off shotguns to an undercover federal agent?
<p>
	In February 1993, a 51-day standoff first erupted when agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF) tried to apprehend the leaders of the Branch Davidian cult at 
their compound in Waco, Texas, for the violation of federal gun laws. Four BATF agents lost 
their lives in the initial foray, and the subsequent siege ended in the deaths of 85 cult members, 
killed either by gunfire or by a suicidal fire that was ignited when FBI agents stormed the 
compound. Again, conflicting versions of events led to congressional hearings as well as public 
and media criticism. 
<p>
	Both these tragedies are the direct result of federal jurisdiction in crimes once considered 
wholly within the province of state and local police agencies. In neither incident did the 
underlying crime involve interstate activity or pose a threat to the federal government. Without 
the federalization of laws regulating firearms, a matter left to the states during most of our 
country's history, neither the BATF or FBI would have had jurisdiction at Ruby Ridge and 
Waco, and any law-enforcement actions would have been handled locally, if at all.
<p>
<b>3,000 Federal Crimes</b>
<p>
	"We federalize everything that walks, talks, and moves," said Senator Joe Biden, Democratic 
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1986 to 1994. 
<p>
	Unfortunately, this is not much of an exaggeration: Today there are more than 3,000 federal 
crimes on the books. Hardly any crime, no matter how local in nature, is beyond the reach of 
federal criminal jurisdiction. Federal crimes now range from serious but purely local crimes like 
carjacking and drug dealing to trivial crimes like disrupting a rodeo. President Clinton's 1994 
crime bill alone created two dozen new federal crimes. The bill federalized such crimes as drive-
by shootings, possession of a handgun near a school, possession of a handgun by a juvenile, 
embezzlement from an insurance company, theft of "major artwork," and murder of a state 
official assisting a federal law-enforcement agent. Although many of these crimes pose a real 
threat to public safety, they are already outlawed by the states and need not be duplicated in the 
federal criminal code.
<p>
	The federal judiciary, for its part, has imposed national standards on all state criminal 
proceedings. In cases like <i>Mapp v. Ohio</i> and <i>Miranda v. Arizona</i>, the Supreme 
Court overruled state law and forced every state to exclude evidence under certain conditions. 
This massive federalization of the rules of evidence greatly increased the rights of criminal 
defendants and further burdened law-enforcement agencies throughout the nation. In addition, 
the federal courts have virtually taken over such vital state functions as the operation of prisons 
and mental hospitals. By 1993, the federal courts operated 80 percent of all state prison systems 
in America. Amazingly, federal judges determine virtually every detail of these prisons, 
including standards for food and clothing, grievance procedures, and cell space per convict.

<P>
	The nationalization of criminal law has included the criminalization of environmental and 
regulatory laws. Historically, these statutes contained only civil penalties and were often handled 
in an administrative rather than judicial forum. Environmental statutes like the Clean Air Act and 
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, however, created an array of new federal crimes. 
Most of these federalized environmental offenses occur entirely within a state and bear no 
connection to the federal government. Worse yet, these statutes are often so vague and 
complicated that some "defendants" did not even realize that they had violated the law. Consider 
this: From our nation's founding until 1982, the federal government criminally prosecuted only 
25 environmental cases. Due to the recent trend toward federalization, the national government 
since 1982 has prosecuted and won more than 1,000 environmental cases. In 1993 alone, 135 
defendants were convicted and sentenced to prison for federal environmental crimes.
<P>
	The responsibility for the federalization of crime falls upon both political parties and all three 
branches of government. Although Democrats like Representative Charles Schumer and Senator 
Biden are among the most zealous advocates of the federalization of crime, Republicans must 
also share the blame. Two of the largest increases in federal criminal jurisdiction, the Controlled 
Substances Act of 1970 and the Clean Water Act of 1972, were products of the Nixon 
administration. In one fell swoop, Nixon's Controlled Substances Act gave the federal 
government jurisdiction over every drug crime in America, no matter how small or intrastate in 
scope. More recently, Republican senator Alfonse D'Amato proposed legislation that would have 
federalized virtually any crime committed in America if a gun was involved. To justify such a 
sweeping expansion of federal authority, D'Amato stated, "The national epidemic of gun-related 
homicides requires increased federal attention, expanded federal jurisdiction, and increased use 
of federal law-enforcement resources."
<P>
	Some of the usual defenders of constitutional limitations on the federal government seem to 
lose perspective when crime is the issue. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, one of the Senate's most 
influential conservatives, has also expressed support for the federalization of crime: "I sincerely 
believe that all of us in the federal government must do more to fight violent crime. The security 
of persons and property must be a priority of every level of government, including the federal 
government." Senator Phil Gramm, an articulate proponent of limited government, once 
proclaimed: "When you have violent predators, the public doesn't care whether the local police 
or the FBI apprehends them. They want something done." Such statements superficially address 
the public's concern over crime, but they ignore the profound constitutional and practical 
implications of this dangerous course, as well as the potential threat to individual liberty.	
<p>
	Clearly, a major cause of the federalization of criminal law is the desire of some members of 
Congress to appear tough on crime, though they know well that crime is fought most effectively 
at the local level. Others, however, offer more legitimate reasons for extending federal 
jurisdiction. They note that prosecuting defendants in federal court leads to longer prison terms, 
due to the federal sentencing guidelines enacted during the Reagan administration. Inmates 
convicted in federal court serve on average 85 percent of their sentences, while inmates 
convicted in state courts only serve about 40 percent of their terms.

<p>	Understandably, public officials who are tough on crime choose the most advantageous 
forum to keep criminals off the street. These longer federal sentences are one of the driving 
forces behind the federalization of crime. For example, the new federal "three strikes" law 
recently snared its first defendant. On August 14, 1995, Thomas Farmer was convicted of armed 
robbery and sentenced to life in prison plus five years. "If Farmer had been convicted in state 
court, he would have been eligible for parole in two-and-a-half years and would probably have 
served about eight years in prison," said U.S. Attorney Stephen J. Rapp. "But because of the 
crime bill, we were able to remove him from society for the rest of his life."
<p>
	Another claimed advantage to the federalization of crime is the availability of the death 
penalty. If a criminal is convicted of a federal capital offense, he can be sentenced to death even 
if the crime occurred in a state that does not allow capital punishment. One impetus for 
D'Amato's bill to authorize the federal death penalty for all murders committed with a firearm 
was New York governor Mario Cuomo's annual veto of a capital punishment bill. This federal 
legislation would have enabled proponents of capital punishment in the 13 states without it to 
circumvent the state political process by simply prosecuting the defendant in federal court.
<p>
	These arguments for a greater federal role in law enforcement, while initially attractive, on 
closer inspection fail to justify such a massive federal usurpation of the police power. If longer 
sentences and the availability of the death penalty are needed to preserve public safety, state 
governments are equally capable of enacting such measures to the extent their constituents so 
desire. Indeed, some states had already adopted "three strikes" laws for habitual offenders before 
this policy became federal law. In New York, voters in 1994 elected a new governor who favors 
the death penalty. 
<p>
<b>The Case Against Federalization</b>
<p>
	Perhaps the most compelling reason to oppose nationalizing crime is that it contradicts 
constitutional principles. The drafters of the Constitution clearly intended the states to bear 
responsibility for public safety. The Constitution gave Congress jurisdiction over only three 
crimes: treason, counterfeiting, and piracy on the high seas and offenses against the law of 
nations.
<p>
	As he wrote in <i>The Federalist</i> No. 45, James Madison envisioned little or no role for 
the federal government in law enforcement: 
<p><blockquote>
	"The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and 
defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite. The 
former will be exercised principally on external objects, as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign 
commerce. . . . The powers reserved to the several states will extend to all the objects which, in 
the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties, and property of the people, and the 
internal order, improvement, and prosperity of the state."
</blockquote><p>
	Even Alexander Hamilton, the greatest proponent in his day of a strong federal government, 
saw law enforcement as a state and local concern. If Hamilton were alive today, he would be 
appalled at the use of the police power by federal agencies. To reassure the states that the federal 
government would not usurp state sovereignty, Hamilton wrote in <i>The Federalist</i> No. 17 
that law enforcement would be the responsibility of the states:
<p><blockquote>
	"There is one transcendent advantage belonging to the province of the state governments, 
which alone suffices to place the matter in a clear and satisfactory light. I mean the ordinary 
administration of criminal and civil justice."
</blockquote><p>
	Unfortunately, the damage caused by the federalization of crime is not merely abstract or 
academic. The more crime that is federalized, the greater the potential for an oppressive and 
burdensome federal police state. As early as the 1930s, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover warned of 
the dangers of a "national police force." In fact, Hoover was so fearful of an expansive federal 
role in law enforcement that he resisted efforts by his allies in Congress to make the FBI 
independent of the Justice Department and to expand the bureau's jurisdiction over additional 
crimes. As an alternative to a federal police force, Hoover instead created the National Academy 
as an adjunct to the FBI's own training facilities, where local law-enforcement officers could be 
trained and then return to lead their own forces. This greatly enhanced the quality of law 
enforcement nationwide without creating the federal police force that Hoover so feared. 
<p>
	Modern state authorities share Hoover's fears. Charles Meeks, executive director of the 
National Sheriffs Association, argues that with every additional federal crime, "we're getting 
closer to a federal police state. That's what we fought against 200 years ago -- this massive 
federal government involved in the lives of people on the local level." And far from being 
appreciative of federal prosecutorial support, one of the leading opponents of the federalization 
of crime is the states' National District Attorneys Association. Not surprisingly, many Americans 
are beginning to share this fear of the federal government. In a recent poll, a large sample of 
citizens was asked to respond to the statement, "There may be a time in the near future when the 
government might limit my rights or threaten my beliefs to the point where I would feel the need 
to disobey the law to protect my constitutional rights." An astonishing 51 percent agreed that this 
situation was very likely or somewhat likely to occur.
<p>
	Federal law-enforcement authorities are not as attuned to the priorities and customs of local 
communities as state and local law enforcement. In the Ruby Ridge tragedy, for example, would 
the local Idaho authorities have tried to apprehend Weaver in such an aggressive fashion? Would 
they have spent $10 million on a relatively minor case, as did the federal agencies? More 
fundamentally, would Idaho officials have even cared about two sawed-off shotguns? In the 
Waco situation, would the local sheriff's department have stormed the compound, or instead 
have waited to arrest David Koresh when he ventured into town for supplies, as he did 
frequently?
<p>
	We do not mean to question the character or competency of federal agents, the vast majority 
of whom are honorable and dedicated public servants. But it is important to remember that both 
of these tragedies resulted in part from the federalization of state gun laws. If the regulation of 
firearms had remained with the states, where it was customarily handled, these tragedies might 
never have occurred.
<p>
	Stephen Saland, a New York State senator with a strong interest in law-enforcement issues, 
puts the argument succinctly: "Generally, crime is best fought at the local level, with local police 
who know the community, with local judges who reflect the standards of the community, and 
with local understanding of which crimes most need the focus and resources of the community."
<p>
	<b>Violates double jeopardy.</b> Another unfortunate consequence of the federalization of 
crime is the danger it poses to our constitutional protections against double jeopardy. 
Federalization of penal laws often creates concurrent state and federal jurisdiction over the same 
offenses. This concurrent jurisdiction grants prosecutors at both the state and federal levels the 
opportunity to prosecute the same case. Legally, the rules of double jeopardy generally do not 
apply when both state and federal courts are involved because these courts represent different 
levels of government. Nevertheless, the spirit of double jeopardy is violated when a defendant 
can be acquitted in state court and retried on essentially the same facts in federal court, or vice 
versa. 
<p>
	The best-known recent example of this was the case of the Los Angeles police officers 
accused of beating Rodney King; they were tried on federal charges after having been acquitted 
in state court. Reporters from the American Lawyer, a generally liberal magazine, concluded that 
the state-court verdict was not only reasonable but largely justified. Nevertheless, the federal 
government retried the acquitted officers on federal charges. In the second trial, what juror would 
not have been affected by the fear of additional riots and violence if they acquitted the officers? 
Would anyone argue this second trial was fair?
<p>
	<b>Incurs unnecessary expense.</b> Simply put, it is far more cost-effective to fight crime 
at the state and local level than at the federal level. Federal judges, prosecutors, and investigators 
often cost far more than their state and local counterparts. According to some reports, the annual 
total cost of each federal judgeship exceeds $1 million. Even more amazing, if they remain with 
their judge long enough federal law clerks can earn up to $100,000_more than many states' 
supreme court justices are paid. Similar disparities exist between federal and state prosecutors 
and investigators. So if D'Amato's bill (which attempted to federalize all gun crime) had passed, 
it would have cost the federal government an estimated $8 billion per year_far more than the 
costs of prosecuting these cases at the state level. (Perhaps the most humorous example of costly 
federal law enforcement is "McGruff," the Justice Department's cartoon crime dog. After 
spending $620,000 on the McGruff media campaign in 1993, the Justice Department spent 
another $300,000 for an extensive study that yielded no evidence that McGruff has reduced 
crime.)
<p>
	<b>Undermines state experimentation.</b> One of the worst consequences of the 
federalization of crime is a tendency toward national standardization and a corresponding 
reduction in state and local experimentation. States should be allowed to serve as "laboratories of 
democracy" and experiment with innovative approaches to the prevention and control of crime. 
Even the Great Centralizer Franklin Roosevelt once noted that when a state experiment fails, at 
least it has little effect on the rest of the nation. If one state wants to fight crime by building more 
prisons and another state wants to operate midnight basketball leagues, why not let them? As 
Abner Mikva, Clinton's former White House counsel has observed, some successful prison 
reforms originate with local government. Mikva recalled that in the 1960s, California governor 
Ronald Reagan provided county governments funding for each prisoner they handled locally and 
kept out of the state system. This experiment led to successful alternative programs like work 
release and halfway houses for those prisoners who could be safely controlled in this manner.
<p>
	<b>Shifts accountability.</b> With the possible exception of education, crime is the most 
important issue facing America on the state and local level. It is also the issue over which state 
and local officials exercise the most control. When federal elected officials promise to "crack 
down" on crime, they create the false public perception that crime is the responsibility of the 
federal government. This shifts accountability away from state and local officials who actually 
apprehend, prosecute, and imprison 95 percent of all criminals. The federalization of criminal 
law shields from scrutiny the state and local officials who are most responsible for fighting crime 
and the legislators who draft the laws and appropriate the funds to enforce public safety. 
<p>
	The federal law-enforcement apparatus is quite removed from the individual citizen and from 
local democratic control. Unlike their federal counterparts, who are appointed by the president, 
local sheriffs and district attorneys are directly elected by and must answer to local citizens. 
Similarly, city police are directly responsible to local mayors and city councils. If voters are 
dissatisfied with their sheriff, district attorney, or local police force, they can vote the appropriate 
officials out of office. However, the voters do not have this direct option with federal law-
enforcement officials.
<p>
<b>The Proper Federal Role</b>
<p>
	If any word describes the proper role of the federal government in law enforcement and 
criminal prosecution, it is "limited." There are, of course, certain areas of criminal jurisdiction 
that the federal government should be involved in. Two broad areas come to mind. One is crime 
directed against the sovereignty of the United States, including offenses such as counterfeiting, 
treason, violations of national security, and assaults on federal officers.
<p>
	A second area is crime involving a significant interstate or international enterprise. Obviously, 
these offenses are appropriately subject to federal involvement because they cannot be handled 
effectively by an individual state. However, a word of caution is needed here. The Supreme 
Court often views individual crimes as belonging to a "class of activities." Virtually any crime so 
viewed could be found to have some marginal interstate effect. This category, therefore, must be 
carefully defined to include only crimes that by their very nature are truly interstate in character. 
Nationally organized crime syndicates, cross-state drug cartels, transportation of stolen goods or 
kidnapped victims over state lines, and interstate flight to avoid prosecution are examples of 
appropriate federal jurisdiction. 

<p>
	Lastly, the federal government properly provides technical assistance on a nationwide scale, 
serving all law-enforcement agencies at every level of government. This includes a national 
clearinghouse for information and statistical data as well as a national repository for criminal 
histories and fingerprints.
<p>
	By contrast, crimes that are not directed against the national sovereignty, or do not have an 
interstate or international dimension, are not legitimate concerns of federal authorities, no matter 
how serious they may be. As Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has said: "Murder is not a 
federal crime. Murder of the president is. What has happened in recent years is people have come 
to think if it's a big problem, then it's a federal problem."
<p>	
While crime is a major problem affecting the entire nation, both constitutional tradition and 
practical experience demonstrate that it is most effectively fought at the state and local level. 
Federal law-enforcement officers face an enormous challenge just fulfilling their proper 
constitutional role to fight interstate and international crime and providing technical assistance to 
local police on a nationwide basis. 
<p>
	Ultimately, the responsibility for halting the creeping federalization of crime rests with the 
voters. Although the temptation is great, national politicians must be principled and resist the 
urge to make ordinary crime a federal issue. It is vital for responsible leaders at both the state and 
federal level to recognize the dangers and drawbacks of the federalization of crime and to 
educate the public about the proper roles of the state and federal government in law enforcement. 
Only then will citizens be able to hold the appropriate officials accountable for public safety. In 
short, our nation needs statesmen who will stand up and proclaim, "Let's not make a federal case 
out of this!"
<p>
<b>The List Goes On . . .</b>
<p>
	With the regularity of a timepiece, Washington responds to widespread concern about crime 
with election-year legislation. Undaunted by our constitutional separation of powers and other 
hindrances, Congress keeps adding to the list of federal crimes; the results are often duplicative 
and ineffective, and occasionally comic.
<p>
	The 1994 crime bill pushed by President Clinton was a prime example of this election-year 
syndrome. Here are some highlights:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Blockading an abortion clinic:</b> This law applies to every clinic in America; 
interstate travel or commerce is not required for the application of federal jurisdiction. Penalty: 
up to one year in prison for first offense.
<p>
<li><b>Theft of "major artwork":</b> Penalty: up to 10 years.
<p>
<li><b>Theft of firearms and explosives:</b> Obviously, theft is already outlawed in every 
state. This is another example of the massive federalization of gun laws. Penalty: up to 10 years.
<p>
<li><b>Possession of a handgun by a juvenile:</b> The bill made possession of a handgun by 
a juvenile a federal crime except where authorized by state law. Penalty: up to one year in prison 
or probation, depending on the background of the defendant.	
<p>
<li><b>Drive-by shootings:</b> Already illegal in every state. It applies to any drug-related 
shooting "into a group of two or more persons." No interstate circumstances required. Penalty: 
the death penalty is possible, if the shooting results in death.
<p>
<li><b>Killing a state or local official helping a federal law enforcement official:</b> 
Already illegal in every state. Penalty: up to the death penalty. 
</ul><p>
	Of course, Congress has a long, proud history of regulating minute aspects of our lives in the 
name of public safety. These federal laws are all on the books.
<ul>
<li><b>Mailing of injurious animals, plants, pests, and illegally taken fish and 
wildlife:</b> Penalty: up to one year.
<p>
<li><b>Damaging a livestock facility in excess of $10,000:</b> Penalty: up to one year for 
first offense. 
<p>
<li><b>Making false crop reports:</b> Penalty: up to five years.
<p>
<li><b>Issuing a check for less than $1:</b> Penalty: up to six months.
<p>
<li><b>Making false weather reports:</b> Penalty: up to 90 days.
<p>
<li><b>Interstate transport of unlicensed dentures:</b> Yes, it is a federal crime to transport 
artificial teeth into a state without the approval of a local licensed dentist. Penalty: up to one 
year.

<h2>Charlotte, the Queen of Southern Banking</h2>
<b>by <a href="/heritage/staff/hood.htm">John Hood</a></b>
</CENTER>
<P>
	In the early 1980s, the Texas banking industry seemed like a sure winner. The oil industry 
was booming. The state's population was growing rapidly as workers came in search of Sun-Belt 
prosperity. Major Texas-based manufacturing and retail enterprises burgeoned. Not surprisingly, 
some of the fastest-growing U.S. banks were located in bustling Houston and Dallas.
<p>
	But then the bottom fell out of gas prices -- and the banking industry. By 1990, the state's 
largest banks no longer existed, resulting in billions of dollars in bad loans and leaving bank 
customers confused and angry. Suddenly, the dominant players in the state's banking industry 
were those that hailed from faraway places like North Carolina and Ohio.
<p>
	It was not pleasant to be a bank customer in Texas back then. If you were a depositor in a 
bank that collapsed, you may have gotten all or part of your money back from the FDIC -- but 
you lost other things, such as convenience and a sense of security. If you owned a small business 
and badly needed a loan to expand, the picture looked even bleaker. Failing banks aren't likely to 
lend you money or cut you slack when you need it most.
<p>
	Other states have seen downturns in their dominant industries without suffering the double-
whammy of bank failures. The difference is government regulation. Until recently, Texas 
imposed strict geographical and size restrictions on its banks. Statewide branching was 
prohibited. These regulatory barriers kept Texas banks tethered to particular cities or regions, 
protecting them from competition and giving them little incentive to embrace innovation and 
serve consumers better. Lacking the diversification necessary to weather the oil glut of the 1980s, 
the state's banks either went under, saw the value of their equity drop, or were bought by 
stronger banks from more competitive, less regulated markets.
<p>
	One such market was Charlotte, North Carolina, home to NationsBank and First Union, two 
of the nation's 10 largest banks. At first glance, the idea that Charlotte would be one of 
America's leading financial centers seems absurd. With one-fifth the population of Houston, 
Charlotte has no obvious advantages in commercial influence or financial acumen. Yet Charlotte 
has become the banking capital of the Southeast. And NationsBank has become the largest bank 
in Texas.

<P>
	A major reason for the ascension of North Carolina banks to the upper tier of the industry is, 
once again, regulation. The state has some of the least restrictive bank regulations in the country. 
The state legislature authorized statewide branching in 1814; at the beginning of this century, the 
state began to charter banks and allowed them to sell insurance and other financial services. In 
the following decades, banks in the largest cities established branches across the state and began 
selling such products as annuities, commercial insurance, and securities.
<p>
	By the 1980s, a bank customer in North Carolina enjoyed many benefits unavailable to his 
peers in Texas. He could transact business with the same bank virtually anywhere in the state, 
which accelerated routine tasks such as clearing checks, depositing funds, and seeking balance 
information. He could purchase more services at lower cost than in Texas, because statewide 
banks can spread fixed administrative expenses over more branches and customers and can hire 
more experienced bankers. He was much more likely to have access to national ATM networks 
and bank credit cards with low interest rates. Most importantly, he had security. With a 
diversified loan portfolio and depositor base, his bank was less dependent on the economic health 
of dominant local industries.
<p>
	The benefits of competition in banking have become increasingly clear. In 1960, the year that 
NCNB (NationsBank's predecessor) was created from the merger of two small banks, North 
Carolina was one of 16 states with statewide branching. Over the next 20 years, there were only 
17 bank failures in those states, compared with 45 failures in the states that allowed limited 
regional branching and 66 failures in the states that prohibited branching altogether. 
<p>
	During the 1980s, a combination of economic turmoil and bad policy decisions created even 
more banking risk. In the first four years of the decade, more than 500 savings-and-loans and 
almost 200 commercial banks failed. Then things got worse. In 1988 alone, 200 banks and 233 
savings-and-loans closed or were liquidated. Most failures occurred in highly regulated states.
<p>
	By 1990, most states had figured out what North Carolina already knew: Competition is better 
than protection. Only three states continued to prohibit branching, while 33 allowed it statewide. 
Furthermore, Texas and other states dropped their longtime aversion to interstate banking and 
allowed banks in nearby states to acquire failing institutions.
<p>
	For banks in North Carolina (as well as in Ohio, New York, and California) that were bred in 
fiercely competitive statewide markets, even this limited form of interstate banking represented a 
golden opportunity. NCNB went into Florida in 1981, South Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland in 
1986, and Texas in 1988. A subsequent merger with C&S/Sovran in Virginia created 
NationsBank, which continued to enter new markets in the Southeast, most recently 
consolidating its position in Georgia by acquiring Bank South.
<p>	
Charlotte's other big bank, First Union, has also pursued numerous acquisitions in the new era of 
interstate banking. Most recently, it purchased First Fidelity Bancorp, making it the largest bank 
in New Jersey and sixth largest in the U.S.
<p>
	The First Fidelity deal illustrates why competition and interstate banking have much to offer 
consumers. As with statewide branching, interstate banking makes it easier for customers to do 
routine things. Travelers to another state can often bank at their own institution, which is usually 
cheaper and easier. Checks clear faster and are accepted at more businesses. Firms with 
operations in various states can work with a familiar institution rather than learning new rules 
and developing new relationships every time they expand. And according to economist Steven 
Horwitz of St. Lawrence University, both business and residential borrowers find it easier to get 
credit. "Banks in states with more liberal branching laws use a greater proportion of their 
resources for loans than do banks in states that limit branching," he says.
<p>
	For Garden State customers, the differences will be immediately noticeable, say banking 
analysts. "First Union, Nationsbank, and Wachovia [another major N.C. bank] offer customer 
service that is clearly superior" to the New Jersey norm, says Anthony Davis of Dean Witter 
Reynolds. Many New Jersey banks still close at 3 p.m., and few offer customers automated 
systems for checking balances or conducting transactions by telephone. With the arrival of First 
Union, New Jersey's mutual-fund investors can also enjoy one-stop shopping at their local bank.
<p>
	Of course, bigger is not necessarily better. It is competition, not size per se, that has allowed 
banks in less regulated markets to serve their customers better. Although North Carolina has 
fewer separate banking institutions per capita than most states, its competitive climate allows 
plenty of mid-sized and small banks to continue to battle successfully with large banks for 
market share across the state. 
<p>
	"I think community banking will always have a future because a number of people want to be 
known by name," says Bill Graham, the former banking commissioner of North Carolina. By 
identifying niche markets and improving customer service, home-grown banks in such states as 
Texas and Florida have thrived even as out-of-state banks have moved in. Post Oak Bank in 
Houston, for example, specializes in private banking and trust services for middle- and upper-
income professionals. "We felt the five big banks would be very dominant in the mass retail 
market," says chairman Kent Anderson, "but we felt opportunities existed to work the personal-
services business."
<p>
	Actually, the best way to keep community banking healthy may well be to push for even more 
deregulation. Sidney Bostian, former chairman and CEO of Investors Savings Bank, the   
second-largest thrift in Virginia, says that community banks are hurt most  by costly state and 
federal regulatory burdens and by high taxes and fees, because larger competitors can spread 
such costs over a greater number of workers and customers. "While consolidation is a desirable 
outcome in our banking system," Bostian says, "policymakers should take care not to create 
artificial incentives for bank mergers."
<p>
	In 1994, Congress extended interstate banking across the U.S. to speed the development of 
interstate branching, which means even more convenience for consumers. Paul Calem, senior 
economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, argues that interstate branching would 
also "enhance competition in banking, benefiting consumers through more favorable interest 
rates and fees."
<p>
	But some people never learn. Despite the benefits of banking freedom, Texas and a few other 
states may opt out of interstate branching, as the federal law allows. For the most part, though, 
bank customers everywhere are starting to enjoy the benefits of competition that states like North 
Carolina have long produced. And improbable Charlotte, not Dallas or Houston, is likely to 
remain the financial powerhouse of the South.

<h2>Bus-jacking the Revolution</h2><br>
<b>by John Walters</b>
<p>
	Long before "devolution" became a Washington buzzword, Indianapolis mayor Stephen 
Goldsmith turned to private companies to deliver municipal services in Indiana's capital city. He 
started with trash collection and moved on to waste-water treatment; in May 1994, Indiana's 
state legislature passed a bill allowing him to use state funds to improve the city's inefficient 
public-transportation system. The idea was simple: Add independently operated buses to the 
city's recently deregulated taxicab and jitney services to provide more efficient, cleaner, and 
cheaper transportation for the people of Indianapolis.
<p>
	But Goldsmith has been forced to confine his competitive program to state-funded 
transportation systems because of a roadblock thrown up by Congress. Bowing to the 
anticompetitive policies of the ancien
regime, the "revolutionary" 104th Congress approved an 
amendment offered by Texas Democrat Ronald Coleman which severely limits efforts to re-limit 
government. That amendment reaffirmed section 13(c) of the 1964 Federal Transit Act, which 
stipulates that any public-transit worker "negatively impacted" by competition may receive six 
years of salary and benefits. By seconding this mandate, the GOP-controlled Congress 
institutionalized the government monopoly in American mass transit and hurt the poor urban 
residents that the federal subsidies were designed to help.
<p>
	Section 13(c) ties federal mass-transit funds to a bundle of mandates aimed at protecting 
unionized city workers. The estimated cost of these transportation mandates to states and 
localities is two to three times the value of the subsidy. The federal government contributes less 
than 5 percent of all mass-transit operating funds -- about $4 billion a year -- but its mandates 
gobble up 10 to 15 percent of local mass-transit costs. Ron Utt of The Heritage Foundation 
calculates that section 13(c) regulations alone cost local transit authorities approximately $2 
billion to $3 billion each year. 
<p>
	How did this happen? In the 19th century, the mass-transit industry was private, but it turned 
to government to protect it from competition. Regulation protected and hobbled private 
enterprise. Cities imposed price controls, mandated service routes, and gave in to demands by 
labor unions for strict work rules and wage formulas. 

<p>
When private mass-transit companies began to fail in the 1940s and 1950s, they were taken over 
by cities. These municipalities remained wedded, however, to the inefficient management 
techniques that drove private transit firms to bankruptcy. Under pressure from public-employee 
unions, they sought an alternative source of revenue: the federal government. 
<p>
	In 1964, Lyndon Johnson signed the Urban Mass Transit Act, granting localities up to three-
fourths of funds needed for local transit projects -- provided that authorities do business only 
with transit unions approved by the U.S. Department of Labor. In a brazen attempt to fight 
union-busting, Johnson supported section 13(c) of the bill, which offered a federal guarantee of 
the right to collective bargaining.
<p>
	As a result, labor unions could threaten the loss of federal mass-transit subsidies in 
negotiations with local officials. Unable to cut labor costs and improve efficiency, transit 
authorities were forced to scrimp on maintenance and hold off on new equipment. Ridership 
declined as commuters found car travel cleaner, safer, and less expensive. 
<p>
	The 1964 act is just one of many Great Society programs that placed local responsibilities 
under the purview of the federal government -- with disastrous results. Since federal subsidies 
began 30 years ago, government at all levels has showered mass-transit projects with $200 
billion in subsidies. But in that time transit ridership has dropped 15 percent and operating costs 
have increased 105 percent. 
<p>
	The salaries for municipal bus drivers are often three to four times those in the private sector. 
According to Wendell Cox and Jean Love, consultants at the American Legislative Exchange 
Council, competition could save mass transit 20 to 60 percent of its costs each year. With 
expanded routes and better service, ridership would rise by 50 percent. Most importantly, an 
estimated 100,000 new workers, including many poor minorities, would be added to the 
economy.
<p>
	Transportation is a local priority best met by local officials and markets working together. 
When Indianapolis allowed competitive bidding for its "Open Door" service for the disabled, it 
enjoyed dramatic improvements in service and served more than twice the number of daily riders 
for the same amount of money. 
<p>
	By cutting counterproductive federal regulations, urban areas could spend their resources on 
more pressing concerns such as crime and stifling tax rates. Says Mayor Goldsmith, "Our fiercest 
competition for jobs and growth is not Chicago, Cleveland, or Atlanta, it is the 100 miles of 
rural, low-tax communities that surround us." Too bad Congress is ensuring this competition is 
one-sided.

<center><h2>Clinton's AmeriCorps Values<br>
How the President Misunderstands Citizenship</h2>

By <b>John Walters</b>
<p>

      <b><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</b><br>

                                  January-February 1996, Number 75</i>

       <hr width=50%></center><p>

	The greatest achievement of the Clinton presidency has been to incorporate a message of 
personal responsibility and citizenship into the rhetoric of the Democratic Party. On the 
campaign trail in 1992, candidate Bill Clinton stressed "individual responsibility," sounding at 
times truer to conservative principles than George Bush. Clinton spoke eloquently of his efforts 
in Arkansas to preserve "the things we cherish and honor most about our way of life -- solid, 
middle-class values of work, faith, family, individual responsibility, and community." As 
president, he frequently invokes these Reaganesque themes.
<P>
	But his conception of citizenship is deeply flawed. Clinton has used the rhetoric of citizenship 
to justify his efforts to expand the welfare state. He has contradicted his emphasis on personal 
responsibility by working to preserve bureaucratic federal control of social programs. The revival 
of citizenship requires a transfer of power from government to families, voluntary associations, 
and communities. The president has instead sought to reinvigorate civic life by trying to 
relegitimize government.

<P>	At first blush, President Clinton's language of citizenship seems a sharp departure from 
the McGovernite ideology that has dominated American liberalism for the past 25 years. This 
ideology sees crime, drug abuse, family breakdown, and other social crises not primarily as 
deviant individual behavior but as social pathologies caused by underlying inequities. Moreover, 
in the McGovernite view, these pathologies are so complicated that traditional institutions such 
as churches and voluntary associations cannot possibly address them. Only policy specialists 
trained in the delivery of social services -- therapeutic-state elites -- are up to the task. The 
growth of McGovernism was accompanied by a massive transfer of power and resources to 
government. City halls, state capitals, and Washington, D.C., were given greater power to 
administer the programs that, liberals promised, would solve America's social crises. 
<P>
	By the mid-1980s, it had become apparent, even to Democrats, that liberalism's faith in the 
social-welfare state was misplaced. A growing body of research indicated that the expanded 
social-welfare bureaucracy, more often than not, worsened rather than relieved the problems it 
tried to solve. These policy failures also had clear political consequences. The Democratic Party 
began to lose traditional blue-collar voters, its former bedrock of support, who had become ever 
more frustrated by the mounting failures and rising costs of the welfare state. The liberal 
principles that undergirded the McGovernite approach -- especially the effort to blame society for 
failures of personal responsibility -- were at odds with the values of middle-class Americans. 
After Walter Mondale's landslide 1984 loss to Ronald Reagan, Democratic activists such as 
then-Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, then-Governor Charles Robb of Virginia, and Senator 
Sam Nunn of Georgia, banded together through the Democratic Leadership Council to bring 
Democrats back into the mainstream. 
<p>
	They called themselves "New Democrats," and much of their intellectual inspiration came 
from a school of political theory called communitarianism. Communitarians argued that man 
fundamentally is not a rights-bearing, property-seeking individual, but a social being who 
flourishes in stable associations and communities. Communitarians criticized both liberals for 
placing too much faith in bureaucracy and conservatives for stressing the power of the 
marketplace; they claimed that bureaucracy and the marketplace together had displaced the 
community as the locus of American life. 
<p>	
In the communitarians' view, 19th-century America offered the ideal model of community, with 
an active citizenry working locally to address shared concerns. Late 20th-century America, 
however, had witnessed the growth of big government and big business, which served to isolate 
and atomize Americans. The weakening of families and local community institutions, the 
communitarians warned, was beginning to erode fundamental elements of the American way of 
life. 
<p>	
According to the communitarians, the growth of bureaucracy, the instability of marketplace 
relationships, and an explosion of self-interested behavior -- increasing litigiousness is just one 
indicator -- all signaled a decline of the responsibility to community that is the essence of 
citizenship. Communitarians reminded us that it is civil society, not the marketplace or the 
bureaucracy, in which Americans interact and flourish. And it is civil society, they proclaimed, in 
which America's increasingly inaudible moral voice lies, for here is where the institutions that 
shape moral character are to be formed.
<p>
<b>The Clinton Promise</b>
<p>
	New Democrats clearly were on to something. Republicans had only paid lip service to the 
importance of civic involvement and the essential role of local and nongovernmental institutions. 
President Ford's Office of Public Liaison, President Reagan's Private Sector Initiative, and 
President Bush's Points of Light program showed that Republicans were aware of the problem, 
but these programs were severely limited in scope. They fell far short of providing the 
cornerstones of a domestic policy designed to redefine the relationship between citizens and the 
central government. 
<p>	
Eyeing the presidency in the early 1990s, Governor Clinton pushed beyond these Republican 
initiatives by drawing on the ideas of the communitarian movement. He emphasized 
responsibility in his presidential campaign, and the rhetoric of community and citizenship 
resonated with mainstream voters. On election night in 1992, President-elect Clinton called for a 
New Patriotism, in which Americans were "interested not just in getting, but in giving; not just in 
placing blame, but in assuming responsibility; not just in looking out for yourselves, but in 
looking out for others, too." On Inauguration Day, President Clinton declared, "It is time to break 
the bad habit of expecting something for nothing from our government or from each other. Let us 
all take more responsibility, not only for ourselves and our families, but for our communities and 
our country." 
<p>
<b>Big Government Redux</b>
<p>
	Thus the Clinton administration began with an oft-expressed aversion to the mentality of 
entitlement and a keen recognition of the danger to community posed by big government. It soon 
became clear, however, that the policies of his administration bore no relation to the rhetoric of 
his campaign and inauguration. Consider the debacle of health-care reform, the would-be 
centerpiece of the president's domestic-policy legacy. The attempt to place nearly 15 percent of 
the private economy into federal stewardship was clearly at odds with a new ethic of personal 
responsibility.
<p>
	After the conservative victory in the 1994 elections, the president and his advisers realized 
that the health-care debate had unintentionally provoked anger against big government. With his 
familiar pattern of rhetorical retrenchment and redirection, the president tried to coopt this anger 
by returning to the language of citizenship. In his 1995 State of the Union address, the president 
admitted that "we need to get government closer to the people it's meant to serve. . . . Taking 
power away from federal bureaucracies and giving it back to communities and individuals is 
something everyone should be able to   be for."
<p>
	Notwithstanding this conservative tone, the president's new approach did not signal the final 
surrender of big-government liberalism. Rather, Clinton sought to recast big-government 
programs as instruments of individual and community empowerment. If conservatives believe 
that government must be limited in order to revitalize civil society, the president argued that 
government can be expanded or reinvented to serve as a "user-friendly" tool for citizens and 
communities. No Clinton initiative has epitomized this "bureaucratic populist" approach more 
than AmeriCorps, the president's national-service program. And it is no coincidence that in his 
1995 State of the Union, the President declared AmeriCorps to be "citizenship at its best."
<p>
	Touted by the administration as a "Republican idea," AmeriCorps at first struck many as 
precisely the type of program needed to revitalize civil society. The president promised that the 
program would assist nonprofit organizations working in local communities. In addition to 
promoting community service, AmeriCorps would combat the entitlement mindset nourished by 
the federal student-loan program by encouraging students to perform community service in 
return for financial aid. Most significantly, the president claimed that AmeriCorps would prove 
that government could act as a partner with citizens, using its resources to leverage additional 
contributions from the private sector. 
<p>
It quickly became apparent that in the AmeriCorps program, government overshadowed its 
"partners." More than one-fourth of AmeriCorps volunteers were placed in federal, state, or local 
government agencies -- where they would reinforce the bureaucratic state, not rebuild the 
voluntary sector. The program also drew criticism for channeling tax dollars to liberal advocacy 
groups and questionable activities, such as sex-education training and "self-esteem" enhancement 
projects. In retrospect, it is not surprising that such activities arose in a government-subsidized 
program; robust community groups that enjoy genuine grass-roots support do not need to seek 
federal grants. And the organizations that do seek out government support are generally those 
with their own in-house bureaucracies, accustomed to receiving federal social-welfare grants and 
contracts. 
<p>
	Finally, despite the president's statement that government could be used to leverage private 
resources, the General Accounting Office's audit of the first year of AmeriCorps activities found 
that only 12 percent of AmeriCorps's funds came from nongovernmental sources. The program's 
supposed ability to "leverage" private funds did not exist; if anything, AmeriCorps compounded 
the entitlement mentality that it sought to combat. Why would citizens support organizations that 
already received federal aid? In fact, public financing of AmeriCorps often led organizations to 
substitute the "blessing" of a government grant for the hard work of gaining and sustaining local 
support. 
<p>
	AmeriCorps reveals the administration's fundamental misreading of the components of 
healthy citizenship. The program provides government subsidies for voluntary activity at the 
federal, state, and local levels. By so doing, it conflates volunteering -- which nearly 90 million 
Americans regularly do -- with a federal-government jobs program run by a centralized 
bureaucracy. It is, in essence, a Great Society-style program trying to pass as a plan to 
reinvigorate citizenship and heal communities. But its very premise -- using federal resources to 
promote voluntarism -- contradicts the principle of self-government that lies at the heart of 
citizenship. AmeriCorps blurs the line between the problems and needs best addressed by 
individuals, voluntary association and localities and those best addressed by the federal 
government. Instead, it seems to suggest that social problems are the responsibility of the central 
government, and the federal bureaucracy must direct and improve local solutions.
<p>
<b>The School Lunch Debate</b>
<p>
	For all the flaws of AmeriCorps, the administration's shrill opposition to moves to scale back 
the federal bureaucracy is an even clearer example of how the president misunderstood the 
relationship between big government and citizenship. The Democrats' success in slowing the 
passage of the Contract With America through the House of Representatives in early 1995 
reached its apogee during the debate over Republican efforts to convert federal funds for school 
lunches into block grants to the states. The president's rhetoric -- once again contradicting his 
earlier paeans to citizenship -- contributed greatly to his success.
<p>
	During the public debate, the president and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton challenged 
conservative reformers with an unqualified defense of the welfare state, evoking images of 
children starving because of Republican reforms. Rather than attacking the entitlement mentality 
responsible for unsustainable federal social-welfare spending, the administration fought 
desperately to save the status quo. The welfare bureaucracy was portrayed as a selfless agent of 
good. Ignoring successful local and privately run lunch programs, Clinton argued that the 
bureaucratic state -- described almost literally as a national nanny -- was the only entity that 
could be relied on to feed hungry schoolchildren. 
<p>
	They quickly expanded their criticism to include all aspects of the Republican drive to roll 
back the welfare state. In a defense of welfare spending in the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> (March 
14, 1995), Mrs. Clinton called conservative welfare reform a "mean-spirited attack on nearly 
every government program designed to help poor and disadvantaged children," and concluded, 
"There is no such thing as other people's children." Implicit in Mrs. Clinton's defense of big-
government liberalism was the belief that individual responsibility for one's own children is 
fundamentally inadequate_and the only responsible adult is the nanny-state. It followed, then, 
that Americans could not be trusted with the broader, self-governing responsibilities of 
citizenship: to make decisions for themselves, their families, or their communities. The solution, 
the Clintons argued, was government <i>in loco parentis</i>, to save our children, the elderly, 
the poor, and perhaps not coincidentally, to protect the political interests of the welfare state. 
<p>
	The Clinton view of citizenship is thus based on universalized interests and responsibilities, 
not genuine familial and social attachments. By arguing that "there is no such thing as other 
people's children," Mrs. Clinton denigrates the motivating force that flows from obligation to 
family and loyalty to good friends and conscientious neighbors. Self-interest, a heightened 
attachment to our own property and loved ones, is essential to citizenship; through self-interest, 
we learn to be responsible for ourselves and our families, and to work with others to improve our 
communities. A detached altruism that makes everyone's children our own undermines the fixing 
of parental responsibility for nurturing and raising each child. This is communitarianism taken to 
extremes.
<p>
	The president's ill-fated defense of the school-lunch program, moreover, exposed his shallow 
commitment to returning power, responsibility, and resources to local officials. If we are truly to 
revitalize citizenship, Americans must be allowed to take more responsibility for public safety, 
education, and assistance to the poor. And restoring this responsibility to citizens and 
communities will almost certainly produce many different paths to sustaining healthy family and 
community life and to helping the disadvantaged. With such efforts, the bureaucratic state's 
platform of regulatory and entitlement-based equity will be broken. Individual and community 
choices will have much greater responsibility for the lives of citizens. Circumstances will not be 
better everywhere, but they will be better where citizens work to make them better.
<p>
	President Clinton's communitarian-inspired vision lacks a credible model for rebuilding 
America's communities and voluntary associations. These institutions have been weakened by 
overreaching government and the deeply rooted liberal dogmas that created and sustain such 
government. Citizen apathy -- and citizen anger -- are the result, not the cause, of these forces.
<p>
	To revitalize citizenship, Americans should forge a consensus on a new separation of powers -
- getting the federal government and even large state and local bureaucracies out of those areas of 
public life that citizens can and should direct themselves. The Clinton administration has failed 
to distinguish between the problems that Americans are responsible for solving as individuals 
and those, far more limited in scope, that properly involve government. By restoring authority 
and resources to citizens and the institutions they control directly, we will also restore the central 
place of middle-class values in our community and political life.
<p>
	The Clinton administration's use of federal resources to promote voluntarism and its 
unwillingness to trust states, localities, and parents in the fight over school lunches reflect a 
larger problem: the inability of welfare-state liberalism to recognize its proper limits. More than 
150 years ago, Alexis de Tocqueville noted:
<p><blockquote>
	"Local institutions are to liberty what primary schools are to science; they put it within the 
people's reach; they teach people to appreciate its peaceful enjoyment and accustom them to 
make use of it. Without local institutions, a nation may give itself a free government, but it does 
not have the spirit of liberty."
</blockquote><p>
	Liberty, members of the citizenship movement must keep in mind, entails both failure and 
success. The risks are great -- but so is the opportunity to teach the self-reliance and 
independence that is the essence of the American character.

<h3><I>But what about the children?</h3></I>
By <a href="/pff/people/sfellow.html#Olasky">Marvin Olasky</a></center>
<P><p><P>
 But what about the children?
<P>
 That's the question liberal defenders of the status quo throw
at conservatives who have worked this year to change the current
welfare system.  But that question can be dealt with responsibly
only when two other questions are answered first.
<P>
 First, will the changes lead to children being deprived of food,
shelter, clothing or medicine?   Answer:  Only if welfare administrators
refuse to tighten their belts and rethink their missions.  Most
welfare dollars never get to the poor people they are designed
to help.   Most go to support federal and state bureaucracies
and their political allies in the nonprofit sector.  If the welfare
system were a private corporation, its middle management already
would have been substantially downsized.  As it is, the change
needs to be imposed.  
<P>
 Second, will the changes lead to an improved war against the
real enemy, fatalism?  Answer:  Yes.  If poverty itself led to
illegitimacy, crime, laziness and illiteracy, the United States
could never have become a rich country, because it was poor people
-- worse off materially than poor individuals today -- who built
 America.  But poor children in the past generally had parents
who showed by word and deed the virtue of striving to meet challenges.
 Today, many poor children see all around them the apathy of life
on welfare -- and it's the fatalism that hurts.  If welfare reforms
help to develop more hard-working, family-honoring parents, their
children will be immensely helped.
<P>
 Welfare hurts children:  That's more than a theory.  One recent
study looked at the earnings of adult men who had grown up poor.
 The study compared adults of the same race who as children had
the same family income, family structure and parental educational
background; the only difference was whether families derived the
bulk of income from welfare or work.   The study showed that the
more welfare income a boy's family had received as he was growing
up, the lower his earnings as an adult; but more non-welfare income
led to higher adult earning.   The bottom line was that hard-working
parents, even (and sometimes especially) if poor, generally produce
hard-working children. 
<P>
 Sound charitable programs help children: That's also more than
a theory.  Groups provide assistance at every age from conception
through young adulthood: 
<UL>
<LI>Some 3000 crisis pregnancy centers throughout the United States
offer material, psychological,and spiritual help to young women
who are pregnant and do not want to be, and thus help their children
to avoid death before birth and gain a better life after they
are born.   The largest single network of independent local programs,
CareNet, has headquarters in Sterling, Virginia.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Bethany Christian Services cuts through the adoption bureaucracy
as well as anyone, and also is willing to do transracial adoptions
at a time when some organizations still look at skin color rather
than character. About half of the states have Bethany organizations;
national headquarters are in Grand Rapids.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>KidsHope, based in Spring Lake, Michigan but now expanding
nationwide, leads members of congregations to become tutors and
mentors of children in poor communities.  Children receive significant
help and church members learn to reach out successfully.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Boys Town, based in Omaha but now expanded to several states,
has a series of programs for children and families in crisis;
family-style homes for abandoned and abused children are the most
intensive.  Boys Town's proven system gives people with ordinary
parenting skills the ability to handle troubled kids.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Teen Challenge, headquartered in Springfield, Missouri, has
more than 140 local chapters around the country devoted to helping
young people escape addiction or alcoholism. Teen Challenge leaders,
generally ex-addicts themselves, understand that people do drugs
or get drunk daily because they have holes in their souls that
only God can fill.
</UL>

<P>
  
<P>
 But what about the children?  That is a good question to ask
throughout the year and especially at Christmas, when we celebrate
the birth of a child who came into the world to suffer with us
(that is the literal meaning of compassion) and die for us.  It
is wonderful to see volunteers throughout the country who give
of themselves sacrificially.  And it is a great mistake to be
panicked into supporting bureaucratic programs that present &quot;buy
one, get one&quot; offers:  Here's bread, but along with it you
have to swallow a stone.

Exploring the Evolving Transformations in American life</b>

<P>
At the dawn of this century that is soon to conclude, one of man's
great discoveries was just beginning to blossom.  Albert Einstein's
explanation of the photoelectric effect led to an entirely new
body of knowledge that we now call &quot;quantum mechanics.&quot;
 It allows us to to understand, and therefore to manipulate, the
intricate workings of matter itself.  One of the more pervasive
examples of what quantum mechanics made possible is the phenomenon
we know as quantum tunnelling--the basis for semiconductor electronics.
 And I say &quot;pervasive&quot; because it is man's harnessing
of that microscopic phenomenon of tunnelling that is causing the
widespread change we are here to discuss.  Tunelling enables microelectronics
which, in turn, permits the cost of digital computing to decline
so rapidly that it is becoming pervasive--like the grains of sand
from which its semiconductors are made.
<P>
When all those computers are connected so that they can communicate,
the result is cyberspace.  The technological evolution from quantum
mechanics to cyberspace has been gradual and even orderly.  What
is more abrupt, however, is the transformation which our cultures,
economies and even our societies are undergoing as a result.
<P>
One reason our cultures are changing is that young people, whose
learning experience has occurred in the midst of pervasive computing--that
is, with the personal computer,  are somehow different than preceding
generations.  One of my colleagues, a recent college graduate,
has a sign on the door to her office which states &quot;Only the
Digital Shall Enter!&quot;  When I asked her to explain its significance,
she described a &quot;digital&quot; person as one who is quick
to accept change, generally optimistic but resistant of central
authority.  The digital, she said, sense intuitively that small
is preferable to large.  Moreover, I was informed that digital
people tend to be young, although she allowed that I was an exception.
 Clearly, her digital generation has accumulated a different set
of experiences, has somewhat different values, and possesses a
more positive outlook about the future than do the previous, &quot;analog&quot;
generations.  It is, in fact, a different culture.
<P>
 So too is today's economy somehow different.  For more than two
hundred years, industrial economies were characterized by one
overarching feature--the accumulation of barriers to new entrants.
 Whether through economies-of-scale, proximity to resources, regulation,
or simply by establishing a strong brand-name, industrial economies
built barriers to new entrants.  Those barriers were present in
all markets, whether local, regional or national, and for virtually
all goods and services, from Coca Cola to clothing to airlines.
<P>
New entrants could, of course, emerge but the barriers were high.
 In the new economy, those barriers are much lower and, in some
cases, nearly absent.  As recently as ten years ago, few would
have predicted that IBM's market capitalization on the New York
Stock Exchange would be surpassed by a software company.  But,
two years ago, that happened, when the value of Microsoft's shares
exceeded IBM's.  In fact, the value of Microsoft today is nearly
as large as the combined worth of General Motors and Ford.  One
expression of the new economics that is often heard in Silicon
Valley is referred to as &quot;The Law of the Installed Base.&quot;
 It says that, when technological change occurs, which is becoming
more and more often, whoever has an installed base of customers
is at greater risk than a new entrant.  And few companies are
more aware of that law than Microsoft and Intel.
<P>
With so many of our citizens, especially younger people, becoming
digital, and with barriers to new enterprises falling rapidly,
it is hardly surprising that the very nature of our society is
also changing.  What is remarkable, however, is the similarity
between <I>HOW</I> both our societies and computer architectures
are changing, and the speed with which it is taking place.  In
each instance, the overarching trend is toward becoming more distributed.
 Mainframes, those symbols of centralized power, are being replaced,
steb by step, by distributed computing.  In fact, one of the main
debates in computing circles today is whether the asymptote of
this trend will be the computer merging into the digital network.
 While I very much doubt that conclusion, it is not impossible.
 What is startling, however, is that so much of this change occurred
in little more than a decade.
<P>
So far, I have stressed two points. The first is that it is the
plummeting cost of digital computing that is driving the change
to new cultures, economies and societies, what Alvin and Heidi
Toffler have described as the transition from the &quot;second
wave&quot; industrial age to the &quot;third wave&quot; knowledge
age.  My second point is that the defining feature of that transition,
and what most distinguishes third wave behavior from second wave,
is diminshed barriers to new entrants.  Nowhere is the divergent
nature of those two behaviors manifested more clearly than in
the two terms most often used in the discussion over digital connection--Information
Superhighway and Cyberspace.
<P>
The second-wave term information superhighway connotes rigid physical
limits connecting concentrated, centralized elements.  Cyberspace,
in contrast, is characterized by its lack of limits and by its
distributed, decentralized nature.  The information superhighway
presupposes immutable laws of conservation--what goes north on
the highway must return south, whereas in cyberspace we assume
that, since the cost of replication is negligible, the amount
of information consumed vastly exceeds production.  As one of
my distinguished colleagues, Peter Huber, has expressed it, &quot;we
all run information deficits in cyberspace.&quot;
<P>
Superhighways tend to be government owned, operated by bureaucracies,
and with limited access.  Cyberspace, with the Internet as its
initial manifestation, has a vast array of ownerships, is operated
by empowered individuals, and with virtually unlimited access.
<P>
Having said what cyberspace is not, let me be clear about what
it is.  Expressed in the barest of terms, <I>cyberspace is the
culture and society of  people who are individually empowered
by digital connection.  The digital connection that enables cyberspace
is ubiquitous and non-hierarchal, peer-to-peer in architecture.</I>
 The result is an abundance of information, readily available,
with an economy characterized by its low barriers to new entrants.
<P>
One of, if not the, fundamental dilemmas of cyberspace resides
in the nature and ownership of property.  Our experience tells
us that clear and enforceable property rights are necessary for
markets to work.  Moreover, defining those property rights is
a central role of government.  Law, as we know it, was developed
to protect those rights.  In the Toffler's first wave, which was
agriculturally based, law was required to establish ownership,
and thereby ensure order, of the principal source of production,
land.  In the second wave, manufacturing became the economic driver,
and the structure of modern law grew around the centralized institutions
that needed protection for their reserves of capital, manpower,
and hardware.  In each of those earlier economic systems, maintaining
stability was the important factor in defining property rights.
<P>
Their laws were designed to preserve the predictability necessary
to either land stewardship or capital formation.  In the third
wave we have now entered, information to a large extent replaces
land, capital, and machines.  And, since digital technology is
separating information from the physical world where first and
second wave property law found definition, it should come as no
surprise that the third wave is bringing a fundamental shift in
the purposes and methods of law.  In fact, that fundamental shift
is likely to extend beyond those statutes that govern just intellectual
property.
<P>
The dilemma is this:  if digital property can be reproduced and
distributed instantaneously, everywhere and without cost, without
our knowledge, without its even leaving our possession, how can
we protect it?  How are we going to get paid for the work we do
with our minds?  And, if we can't get paid, what will assure the
continued creation and distribution of such work?
<P>
Today's copyright and patent law is based upon the <I>physical
expression</I> of ideas or knowledge.  Books, newsprint, tapes
and CDs are tangible means to preserve property rights under present
law.  They simply don't exist in cyberspace.  Instead, value is
obtained more by the way the information is presented than by
its content.
<P>
New software is often introduced at no cost to the user, but with
the expectation that he or she, having invested time and effort
in learning to use it, will pay for next-generation upgrades.
 Providers of information that is timely can extract a fee for
property that will, tomorrow, be free.  Such intangible features
as ease and efficiency of use, quality of presentation, timeliness
and format--those are the kinds of things that represent value
in a cyberspace economy.  As another of my distinguished colleagues,
John Perry Barlow, has so aptly pointed out, &quot;whether you
think of yourself as a service provider or a performer, the future
protection of your intellectual property will depend on your ability
to control your relationship to the market--a relationship that
will most likely live and grow over time.  The value of that relationship
will reside in the quality of performance, the uniqueness of your
point of view, the validity of your expertise, its relevance to
your market, and, underlying everything, the ability of that market
to access your creative services swiftly, conveniently, and interactively.&quot;
 
<P>
In spite of our experience to the contrary, how ideas are presentated
in cyberspace will be more important than the ideas themselves.
 I think of providing value in cyberspace as constructing elements
of the ultimate digital-to-analog interface--matching the overabundance
of available, digital information to the inherent, analog limitations
of we human beings.
<P>
And that diverts me, for a moment, to a subject that perturbs
me.  That is the obsessive fascination with bandwidth that contributes
so much confusion to the all-important matter of converting our
existing communications systems from outmoded analog, designed
largely for voice service, to the kind of digital infrastructure
required for cyberspace.
<P>
My concern derives from what I will call the &quot;30-30 rule&quot;--that
we humans can take in information at only about 30 megahertz through
our eyes or, even slower, at 30 kilohertz through our ears.  This,
ultimately, is the requirement that will shape the communications
infrastructure of cyberspace.  Much higher bandwidth is, of course,
required for machine-to-machine communications, between elements
of the network, but it is at the man-machine interface where the
maximum value is added.  The focus upon bandwidth is, I fear,
a result of our second wave experience, where it is the movement
of information that is valued, not its presentation.  Regulators
and deregulators would better focus on making it easier to convert
our analog telecommunications systems to digital infrastructures,
rather than on maximizing bandwidth.
<P>
Bandwidth is important, because it will make connected computing
richer, but the fact remains that we humans lack a broadband input
channel to access all that bandwidth directly.  And, in the meantime,
it is digital connection, to link together those ever more pervasive
computers, that we need, even more than bandwidth.
<P>
I have spoken of the importance of re-examining the appropriateness
of current copyright and patent law, because the central premises
of cyberspace differ so markedly from our first and second wave
experience.  And I have stressed that the value received for how
information is presentated is outweighing its content.  Let me
go further, and suggest that copyright and patent laws will, gradually
but inexorably, prove to be outmoded in cyberspace.  Based on
largely irrelevant, physical premises, and unable to adapt to
the pace of technological progress in cyberspace, they simply
will be abandoned.
<P>
Peter Huber has proposed something that, to me, makes much more
sense.  That is that the body of common law, developed from judicial
decisions based on custom and precedent, is more adaptable to
change and better able to provide the essential protections that
are needed in cyberspace.  Although, at first that may seem a
radical proposal, it in fact returns to a well-established mechanism
of resolving disputes--the courts.  It allows accomodation to
change, within ethical bounds and, in contrast to copyright and
patent law, common law is not tied to a rigid requirement that
property be physical in nature.
<P>
Among the already-digital, there is another, more technical, feature
of cyberspace that allows the individual providers of information
to protect their digital property.  That is encryption, but not
in the usual sense of government controlled encryption.  It is
encryption in the sense that the creators of digital property
can use technology, in the form of software tools, to contain,
restrict, or meter the use of their ideas.  This, of course, encompasses
much more than enciphering and deciphering information.  For example,
in the language of object orientation, it means creating &quot;agents&quot;
to build and maintain the relationship between the creator and
customer.
<P>
Drawing liberally from John Perry Barlow, let me summarize his
thoughts on property in cyberspace:
<P>
 The protections that we will develop will rely far more on ethics
and technology than on law.
<P>
 Encryption will be the technical basis for most intellectual
property protection. (And should, for this and other reasons,
be made more widely available.)
<P>
 The economy of the future will be based on relationship rather
than possession. It will be continuous rather than sequential.
<P>
Along with the diminished barriers to new entrants that define
the cyberspace economy go diminished economies-of-scale.  Taken
together, they mark the decline of the concept of a monopoly or,
at least, of an enduring monopoly.  This is but another way of
restating what I referred to earlier as &quot;the law of the installed
base.&quot;  With technological progress opening new ways to serve
yesterday's markets, one-time monopolies are being replaced by
competitive battlegrounds.  Even where monopolies do emerge, the
pace of technological change is threatening to make them short-lived.
 This is true not only for digital technology, but for all the
goods and services in cyberspace.  The reason, as George Gilder
has pointed out, is because the very nature of competition in
cyberspace is different.
<P>
Second wave static competition, whereby many providers compete
to sell similar products at the lowest price is, of course, good
because it brings more value to the customer.  But the dynamic
competition of cyberspace, where different industries with different
technologies compete to meet customer's needs, is even better.
 It is better because it allows competing technologies and new
products to challenge the old ones and, if they really are better,
to replace them.  Static competition will lead to faster and stronger
horses, but dynamic competion gives us the automobile.  One need
only look at what is happening in such entrenched areas as the
market for mail, where fax machines and overnight delivery challenge
the public monopoly, or in television, where cable and satellite-TV
have broken the monopoly of broadcast, or the change that is underway
in voice telephony.
<P>
Such dynamic competition--the essence of what the Austrian economist
Joseph Schumpeter called &quot;creative destruction,&quot; is
the nature of the cyberspace economy.  Nowhere are the results
more dramatic than in our own computer industry and, in particular,
in Silicon Valley, California.  A negative view might be that
there has been so much destruction, so many companies were born,
flourished, and died.  But that can only be viewed as a modest
price to pay for the wholescale economic rejuvenation of the United
States that it catalyzed.  And, not surprisingly, that renewed
competitiveness is concentrated in the more important areas of
high growth, such as computing, telecommunications, pharmaceuticals,
and the broad array of service segments.  In many ways, I look
at Silicon Valley as the first colony of cyberspace.
<P>
There are many things one can already observe about the cyberspace
economy.  Although many features are still obscured, good data
abound.  But we know much less about how people adapt to cyberspace.
 We do, however, have strong indications that that adaptation
is not easy.  And I point to the simple fact that, in my own country,
although we have experienced a generally healthy economy and low
unemployment for more than a decade, there is a widespread sense
of uncertainty, even anxiety, about the future.  Yet we are progressing,
inexorably, toward a cyberspace society.  To gain some insight
into how that is occurring, it is informative to look at the changing
natures of individual freedom, the community and of government.
<P>
Perhaps the first manifestation of the new nature of individual
freedom is what we call the &quot;hacker,&quot; that completely
digital young person who ignored most of our social pressures
and rules to develop a set of computer skills through an early
and intense exposure to the Personal Computer--the PC.  Those
skills eventually made the hacker highly marketable.  He or she
became a technician, an inventor and, in many cases, a creator
of new wealth.  None is better known than Bill Gates, who chose
founding Microsoft over social pressure to continue his Harvard
education.
<P>
The hacker is neither a rare nor an unimportant feature in America
today.  Where parents once presumed the hacker would learn the
ways of conventional America, it is conventional America that
is learning the ways of the hacker.  By choosing individuality
over conformity, performance over concensus, the hacker became
our frontiersmen in cyberspace.
<P>
The nature of freedom was redefined in the transition to the industrial
age.  The second wave relied on standardization, and its institutions,
corporate and government bureaucracies, reflected conformity.
 It might even have made sense that, in some cases, a government
would prohibit entrepreneurs from entering new markets.  It might
even have made sense that, in a world of one-way broadcast communications,
a government would assume ownership over the spectrum and limit
the viewpoints expressed there.  Those kinds of infringements
on individual freedom were made in order for the system to &quot;work.&quot;
 They make little sense in cyberspace.  The sheer complexity of
the third wave is simply too great for any centrally planned bureaucracy
to manage.  Demassification, customization, individuality and
freedom--these are the natural features of cyberspace.
<P>
If the hacker is the pioneer, the frontiersman in cyberspace,
then his early communities may be on the internet.  The internet
is, in itself, a paradox.  As the first step toward the kind of
digital connection that enables cyberspace, ubiquitous and non-hierarchal,
it is also a step toward conforming--at least to a common connection
standard.  But there is little conformity in the way the internet
is used.  Copyright laws are, generally, ignored; propriety is
eschewed for the explicit; and privacy is more a challenge than
a right.
<P>
But, in spite of this seeming paradox, there is both order and
an emerging sense of community on the internet.  There is order
because software is being introduced, rapidly, both to make the
internet easier to access, use and explore, and to make it more
palatable, whether through encryption for privacy or censoring
software.  And there is community because &quot;electronic neighbourhoods&quot;
are proliferating, bound together not by geography but by common
interests.
<P>
My own son, studying for his doctorate in Buddhist history, is
part of a global internet community of like-minded scholars. 
On a more mundane level, my own love of Bassett Hound dogs is
shared with a community of people with similar friendships.  What
matters is that these relationships are the kind of glue that
hold communities together, and they are new.
<P>
Looking beyond this first phase of experience with the digital
connection, we can see the broader effects of reduced pressure
on highways, less air pollution, and diminished concentration
of population in urban areas.  This is more than a mere optimist's
speculation; more and more companies are accepting the home office
as a legimitate part of the modern institution.  The SOHO, a new
acronym for &quot;small office, home office,&quot; is the fastest
growing segment of the American PC market.
<P>
Whereas we have much to learn about the nature of society in cyberspace,
we can be sure it will be more distributed, and decentralized
than in the past.  And all indications are that it will be composed
of less heterogeneous communities, linked more by common interests
than by common location.  One could envision this trend as, in
fact, a renewed sense of community, sort of a return to the first
wave agrarian community.  What is different, of course, is the
lack of common physical location<I>.</I>
<P>
However one perceives the cyberspace community, whether as a return
to the past or as something utterly new, the connection between
them is far more likely to be a weaker one than the kind of governments
we have now.  Taking the early internet communities as examples,
the very sameness of interests that binds them will create an
expanded diversity among them.  Or, conversely, communities in
cyberspace will simply be affected less by what happens in other
communities.
<P>
And that brings me to my final point, which pertains to the nature
of national government in cyberspace.  I remain a skeptic when
I hear talk, generally more hypothetical than factual, that nations
are becoming less well-defined, with borders succumbing to international
commerce.  If anything, the common bonds of language, culture
and religion that tie nations together are becoming even stronger,
it seems.  I see no evidence that it will be different in cyberspace.
 What I do see as different is the nature of government in cyberspace.
 Just as surely as economies of scale and barriers to entry, those
twin bastions of the second wave industrial era, are diminishing,
so too will the concept of today's centralized, bureaucratic state.
 And it is already happening.  The question is no longer whether
second wave governments are in remission, but rather what will
the governments of cyberspace look like?
<P>
First, and in order to not be irrelevant, it must be &quot;digital.&quot;
 That means it must recognize that change--the greatest fear of
all bureaucracies--can be beneficial, and that enabling the citizens
of cyberspace is the only acceptable path to success.   To be
sure, this sounds so utopian as to be suspect.  On the proactive
side, ask yourselves what IBM is having to learn to survive and
why Microsoft and Intel thrive; or why Washington is so enthusiastic
to return authority to the fifty states.  On the more reactive
side, ask why France is experiencing so much turmoil, or why the
highly regulated telecommunications industry is so slow to change
compared to the computer industry.
<P>
Massive, widespread decentralization is already, irreversably
underway.  Sometimes welcomed, sometimes resisted, the trend is
hardly disputable.  New dimensions of individual freedom, manifested
by the renewed dominance of the consumer, are already underway,
in virtually all markets.  In this broad sense, defined by my
young colleague with the sign over her door prohibiting all but
the &quot;digital&quot; to enter, the world is becoming &quot;digital.&quot;
<P>
Second, governments in cyberspace will learn to follow their citizens,
adapting to changes in their societies.  The concept of who best
represents the &quot;elite&quot; will change, as I think it already
is in America.  I recently had the priviledge of sharing a few
hours over dinner with Newt Gingrich, certainly the most powerful
politician in America, and Bill Gates.  Let me assure you there
was no doubt as to whom was the role model for young Americans.
 Bill Gates may have been too modest to see himself in that role,
but Newt made him aware.
<P>
Let me summarize my main points.  Cyberspace is not a surrealistic
future that we confront, it is already upon us.  The global economy
is being shaped by it, and Microsoft's surpassing IBM's value
is tangible proof.  Moreover, cyberspace is not an abstraction--simply
expressed, it is the culture and society of  people who are individually
empowered by digital connection.  The digital connection that
enables cyberspace is ubiquitous and non-hierarchal.  The result
is an abundance of information, readily available, with an economy
characterized by its low barriers to new entrants, and diminished
economies-of-scale.  What is important about the requisite infrastructural
change is the conversion from analog to digital, far more than
the inevitable increase in bandwidth.  Property in cyberspace,
no longer a physical entity, cannot be protected by copyright
and patent laws, but instead needs to rely for protection on ethics
and technolgy.  The body of common law may be a practical means
to achieve that.  Dynamic competition, among new and different
industries and technologies, will replace the static competition
of the industrial age.
<P>
The culture and society of cyberspace may be best understood by
viewing &quot;hackers&quot; as the first inhabitants of cyberspace.
 Rejecting the social pressures and rules of the second wave,
they represent the digital mindset that is rejuvenating the American
economy.  With highly marketable skills in distributed computing
and networking, obtained in nonconforming ways, hackers have become
an essential means for institutions to reject second wave habits.
 Via the internet, they are creating the first third-wave society,
comprised of electronic communities.
<P>
Taken together, these are the observable elements in the transition
from the second wave, industrial age to cyberspace.  To complete
this transition, governments must become more decentralized and
more progressive, adapting to cyberspace, along with their citizens.

<P>
<I> G.A. Keyworth, II, is chairman and senior fellow at The Progress
and Freedom Foundation.  This is the first in a new series of
occasional papers, &quot;The Shape of Things...&quot;, which explore
the transformation currently underway in American life.</I>

<h2>Our Foundering Fathers</h2>
<P>
<B>by Elizabeth Schoenfeld</B> 
<P>
<B>Are You a Sperm Dad?</B> 
<P>
Perhaps the most important book written this decade on our greatest
social crisis is <I>Fatherless America: Confronting Our Most Urgent
Social Problem</I>, by New York intellectual David Blankenhorn.
The president of the Institute of American Values, Blankenhorn
dissects the insidious and prevalent bias against the value of
fatherhood in both elite and popular culture. In this impassioned
yet carefully reasoned and researched book, he argues that being
a father is &quot;society's most important role for men.&quot;
<P>
While mothers typically concentrate on meeting children's immediate
physical and emotional needs, Blankenhorn writes, fathers tend
to &quot;focus on preparation for the future and on children's
success in the larger society. Fathers are likely to devote special
attention to character traits necessary for the future, especially
qualities such as independence, self-reliance, and the willingness
to test limits and take risks.&quot;
<P>
Moreover, Blankenhorn writes, a proper view of fatherhood is essential
to the concept of masculinity. &quot;Fatherhood cannot destroy
or oppose masculinity, but fatherhood must domesticate masculinity.
In a good society, men prove their manhood by being good fathers.&quot;
But many journalists, academics, and purveyors of popular culture
are writing a new &quot;cultural script&quot;-new definitions
of what it means to be a man-that fails to serve the needs of
children, families, or society. Here are some of the inadequate
roles available to today's dads:
<P>
The Unnecessary Father. &quot;He may be useful in some ways. He
may be a nice guy, perhaps even a force for good. But he is nonessential,
peripheral, 'not that important.' His presence may be appreciated,
but it is not required.&quot;
<P>
The Visiting Father. This poor chump writes the checks and strives
valiantly to stay in touch with his children after a divorce.
Although often romanticized, as in the popular <I>movie Mrs. Doubtfire</I>,
&quot;the great majority of visiting fathers are not-indeed, cannot
be-good-enough fathers to their children,&quot; Blankenhorn writes.
<P>
The Sperm Father. He accounts for nearly 30 percent of all fathers
of young children. &quot;His is the fatherhood of the one-night
stand, the favor for a friend, the donation or sale of sperm.
His child is the unintended consequence, the result of the affair
that did not work out, the reason for the paternity suit, the
baby he never learned about.&quot;
<P>
The Stepfather and the Nearby Guy. Rosy assumptions to the contrary,
&quot;children who live with stepfathers experience outcomes that
are no better, and frequently worse, than children in mother-only
homes.&quot; The Nearby Guy (a coach, a teacher, the mother's
boyfriend) provides not fathering but often &quot;ambiguity, complexity,
and frequent change.&quot;
<P>
The New Father. &quot;He expresses his emotions. He is a healer,
a companion, a colleague, He is a deeply involved parent. He changes
diapers, gets up at 2 a.m. to feed the baby, goes beyond 'helping
out' in order to share equally in the work, joys, and responsibilities
of domestic life.&quot; How can you hate this guy? Blankenhorn
doesn't fault dads who change diapers, but he insists that this
is not their most important contribution.
<P>
In contrast to this cast of losers, Blankenhorn holds up the Good
Family Man. He &quot;puts his family first. He is responsible
for them. He sacrifices for them&quot; to help prepare them for
life in the real world. Sure, this guy also helps his wife care
for the children and pitches in with household duties, but he
views his role as complementary, not identical, to that of his
spouse. This distinction is vital to the masculinity of men and
to the future of fatherhood.
<P>
That's why, Blankenhorn says, it is crucial that society provide
men with the right cultural script, because successful fathering
depends more on societal codes of conduct than on biology. If
we get those codes wrong, we'll see &quot;the continuing decline
of fatherhood and a deepening ambivalence and skepticism toward
masculinity.&quot; We must get them right, because &quot;fatherhood,
more than any other male activity, helps men to become good men.&quot;
<P>
<B>Your Man-Frog or Prince?</B> 
<P>
If you want to be a good father, the single most important thing
you can do is to be a good husband. In a landmark study of marriage
and parenting styles, Jay Belsky, professor in the Department
of Human Development and Family Studies at Pennsylvania State
University, has found that men whose marriages were in decline
tended to exhibit parenting traits that undermine child development.
<P>
&quot;Men appear much less likely than women to distinguish between
their feelings about their child and their feelings about the
marriage,&quot; writes Belsky in <I>The Transition to Parenthood:
How a First Child Changes a Marriage; Why Some Couples Grow Closer
and Others Apart</I>. (The book, by Belsky and John Kelly, is
available in paperback from Dell.) &quot;If a man is dissatisfied
with the latter, he will usually stay away from his family, even
if it means sacrificing the opportunity to get to know and form
a close bond with his youngster.&quot;
<P>
Sadly, it seems marriages tend to be most vulnerable just when
they need to be strongest-when children are very young. Belsky
found that when children entered the picture, a little over half
of all marriages declined. Only 20 percent of couples thought
their marriages improved, and the remaining 30 percent of couples
found their level of marital satisfaction to be about the same.
Research by the National Center for Fathering also shows a &quot;U-pattern&quot;
of marital satisfaction. It is high before the birth of the first
child, declines when children are young, and tends to rise again
as the children grow older and leave home.
<P>
Belsky writes that a major area of marital discord is the division
of responsibility for child care and housekeeping. Babies are
a lot of work, and the mother generally finds she bears most of
the burden-by choice or by default. Because a woman will tend
to measure her husband's share in domestic duties against her
own (she typically does three times more than he does), that perception
of unfairness breeds resentment. But men measure their contribution
(which averages 15 or 16 hours a week) against what their fathers
did. By this yardstick, husbands today are doing 40 percent more
household work than men did a generation before. Also, she tends
to downplay his contributions as a breadwinner; he regards them
more highly. By his calculations, he's a prince; by hers, he's
a frog.
<P>
The arrival of children provokes spousal conflict in other areas
as well, Belsky writes, including money, work, social life, and
commitment to the relationship. Obviously, those who would counsel
couples in their transition to parenthood must urge them to address
unrealistic expectations and conflict over gender roles. Discouraging
divorce is not enough; we must foster strong and loving marriages
that nurture the healthy development of children.

<h2>Leading the Fatherhood Brigade</h2>
<P>
Thousands of men gather in football stadiums around the country
to recommit themselves to their wives and children. Vice President
Albert Gore attends a national summit on fatherhood, with major
news media in tow, and chastises men for walking away from &quot;the
most important role that any of us will ever play in life.&quot;
Hundreds of thousands of African-American men convene in Washington,
D.C., to pledge responsibility to their families. Is fatherhood
making a comeback in the nation with the world's highest rate
of father absence? &quot;There's not a movement,&quot; says The
Reverend Donald Burwell of Fathers' Education Network in Detroit.
&quot;But I do think there is a fatherhood revival or Renaissance.&quot;
Whatever we call it, something is going on. In recent years, several
new groups dedicated to promoting fatherhood have sprouted, and
older organizations have reoriented their efforts to this cause.
Here are some of the leaders in the fatherhood field-a mix of
liberal and conservative, religious and secular-all united in
a belief that fathers are vital to their children's well-being.

<P>
 &quot;What reduces crime, child poverty, and teen pregnancy,
and requires no new taxes?&quot; asks the National Fatherhood
Initiative. The group's answer, of course, is good fathers. The
nonprofit organization was founded in 1993 to spread the &quot;news&quot;
that fathers are indispensable to their children's development.
<P>
Its goal is ambitious: broad cultural and social change. But it
has widespread support, savvy, creative and committed leadership,
and a national advisory board that includes William J. Bennett,
James Earl Jones, congressman Steve Largent, Willard Scott, Louis
Sullivan, and George Gallup. NFI's aggressive media outreach has
garnered more than 650 mentions in publications nationwide. With
backing from the Advertising Council, NFI will launch a blitz
public-service announcements this year to reintroduce fatherhood
as a vital concept.
<P>
NFI has become a nerve center for various fatherhood groups, sponsoring
national and local meetings. Last summer and fall, NFI chairman
David Blankenhorn led a &quot;National Fatherhood Tour&quot; to
30 cities to meet with community activists and promote the NFI
&quot;fatherhood pledge.&quot;
<P>
The organization plans an interfaith summit in Washington, D.C.,
in May, to convene various religious leaders-a more modest version
of its 1994 National Summit on Fatherhood in Dallas, which brought
together national and local religious, civic, business, and entertainment
leaders. Also in the works is a summit addressing the needs of
the African-American community, to be chaired by Louis Sullivan,
the secratary of health and human services under President George
Bush.
<P>
NFI president Don Eberly, a former top aide to Jack Kemp, is based
in the national office in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, while director
Wade Horn, a former U.S. Commissioner of Children, Youth, and
Families, works out of Gaithersburg, Maryland. Originally conceived
as a public-education campaign, NFI has also become a membership
organization in response to popular demand. Membership benefits
include a quarterly newsletter, a media kit, a guide for community
activists, and a catalog of fatherhood-related books and videos.
With three full-time and three part-time staff members and a budget
of about $600,000, the institute's challenge now is to find the
funding to carry out its many ambitious initiatives.

Considered one of the leaders in the field, the National Center
for Fathering is a Kansas-based nonprofit organization that trains
individuals in the fundamentals of fatherhood. Founded in 1990
by scholar Ken Canfield, the center holds seminars based on Canfield's
<I>The Seven Secrets of Effective Fathers</I> (available from
NCF in paperback and as an audiocassette or a video seminar).&quot;Where
National Fatherhood Initiative is the strategic bomber of the
fatherhood movement, we are the infantrymen in the trenches,&quot;
says NCF spokesman David Warnick. With a budget of $560,000 and
10 full-time staff members, NCF runs programs for fathers from
all backgrounds, including corporate personnel, prisoners, military
dads, and inner-city fathers, and is actively involved in minority
outreach. More than 15,000 fathers around the country have participated
in its two-day training sessions.
<P>
Its national training program, &quot;Operation Domestic Shield,&quot;
is often disseminated through church networks, and Canfield works
as a trainer for the evangelical Christian group Promise Keepers.
But NCF prides itself on being a nonpartisan, nonsectarian organization,
working with everyone from California governor Pete Wilson to
Vice-President Al Gore.
<P>
The National Center for Fathering publishes a quarterly magazine,
<I>Today's Father: For Men Who Want To Be Better Dads</I>, which
contains parenting advice and lists of books and other resources,
and also produces a three-minute radio program carried on more
than 300 stations nationwide.

Although technically not a &quot;father&quot; group, this Christian
evangelical organization, founded by former University of Colorado
head football coach Bill McCartney, keeps popping up on the lists
of leaders in the fatherhood-renewal movement because it promotes
the building of strong marriages and families. It has been drawing
tens of thousands of men, for $55 a ticket, into sports arenas
from Seattle, Washington, to Washington, D.C., for two-day conferences
featuring Christian music and inspirational speakers. Men make
a series of promises to God, wife, family, friendships, church,
and community.
<P>
Headed by president Randy Phillips, Promise Keepers now has a
staff of 250 and a budget of $64 million, and its 1-800 number
averages 20,000 calls a day during its summer registration season.
Such success has alarmed some women's groups. In October 1995,
for instance, a <I>Glamour</I> magazine editorial referred to
Promise Keepers as &quot;among those who still think men can't
keep up unless women are kept down.&quot; In response, the group
contends that being a leader means being a servant to one's family,
not a tyrant.

On Father's Day last year, Vice President Al Gore announced a
new nongovernmental initiative to promote paternal involvement
through community-based mentoring programs. The goals and structure
of Father to Father are so ill-defined that it is difficult to
tell where this initiative is going, but Gore's high-profile support
will bring welcome attention to the issue. This loose federation,
under the direction of Martha Farrell Erickson of the Children,
Youth and Family Consortium at the University of Minnesota, offers
kits to communities and organizations that want to reach out to
fathers, providing lists of resources and strategies for starting
their own mentoring group.
<P>
An electronic version of this effort is called FatherNet, a free
24-hour-a-day electronic meeting place that provides the latest
information and resources about and for fathers.

Under the mantle of the liberal Families and Work Institute since
1989, the Fatherhood Project was founded in 1981 by director James
A. Levine as a national research and education program to increase
male involvement in childrearing.
<P>
Programs include the Male Involvement Project, directed by Edward
W. Pitt, which works with Head Start and other early childhood
and family support programs. The MIP sponsors community-based
social programs in Baltimore, Minneapolis, and the San Francisco
Bay area, and a national training program for early-childhood
administrators such as pre-school directors. Publications include
<I>Getting Men Involved: Strategies for Early Childhood Programs</I>
and <I>New Expectations: Community Strategies for Responsible
Fatherhood</I>. The Fatherhood Project also oversees a program
called Fathers and Work, which promotes family-friendly workplaces
and presents seminars on how to deal with &quot;daddy stress.&quot;
<P>
A caveat: Critics argue that the project's emphasis on separating
men from the role of breadwinner could inadvertently erode paternal
involvement and provision. Some claim that directors Levine and
Pitt have bought into a feminist agenda that aims to turn fathers
into substitute moms.

Hailed as a &quot;modern-day prophet&quot; and a &quot;visionary&quot;
by others in fatherhood circles, Charles Augustus Ballard began
the institute 13 years ago to help young, directionless black
men in Cleveland, Ohio, become involved in their children's lives.
(See his article, &quot;Prodigal Dad: How We Bring Fathers Home
to Their Children,&quot; in the Winter 1995 <I>Policy Review</I>.)
Most fathers who have gone through Ballard's program finish high
school, get jobs, and legally establish their paternity.
<P>
Ballard's emphasis on reuniting fathers with their children--grounded
in thoroughly biblical themes of family and responsibility-has
appeal across the political spectrum. The institute's national
office is housed in the Joint Center for Political and Economic
Studies, a nonpartisan liberal think tank. His urban program got
a tremendous boost in early 1995 when the Ford Foundation gave
the group $2 million to reproduce its efforts nationally. The
institute has opened five new centers: in Milwaukee, Washington,
D.C., San Diego, Atlanta, and Yonkers, N.Y., each to be headed
by a married couple. The institute's strategy is to saturate one
blighted neighborhood at a time.
<P>
Some question whether a group headed by a single charismatic leader
can replicate and institutionalize its programs. We'll see: Each
new location will be headed by men and women who have been trained
by Ballard in Cleveland.

Six years ago, 18 African-American men in Omaha, Nebraska, decided
they would no longer tolerate gang violence and drug-dealing in
their neighborhoods. So they created M.A.D. D.A.D.S. (Men Against
Destruction-Defending Against Drugs and Social Disorder), a community-based
group that organizes street patrols, paints over gang graffiti,
confronts drug-dealers and gang members, sponsors activities for
youth such as block parties and car shows, and to counsels young
people in local jails.
<P>
&quot;We started out of pain-the pain of our children dying in
the streets of their own communities,&quot; says a recent M.A.D.
D.A.D.S. publication. &quot;We realized that we could hold no
one responsible but ourselves. . . . So we united as a handful
of community fathers who now know that we must be the force behind
change.&quot;
<P>
From this handful grew an organization of more than 25,000 volunteers,
with 41 chapters in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan,
Mississippi, Nebraska, New York, Ohio, Tennessee, and Texas.
<P>
The group has logged more than 87,000 volunteer hours on the streets-more
than half after midnight. For its work on the front lines of impoverished
minority communities, M.A.D. D.A.D.S. has won national recognition
from Presidents Bush and Clinton, the National Education Association,
and <I>Essence</I> magazine. Fathers who want to open a chapter
of M.A.D. D.A.D.S. in their community can contact the national
office in Omaha and ask for John Foster, Bishop Robert Tyler,
or Eddie Staton.

Can ex-cons be good dads? The Reverend Donald Burwell, whose organization
works with fathers newly returned from prison or first-time offenders
hoping to avoid jail time, has answered that question at least
5,000 times. Since 1990, that's how many men his Detroit-based
group has trained in the interpersonal skills they need to reconnect
with their families. In the process, the organization has cut
recidivism rates in half for its participants. FEN also offers
instruction to women to help them reinforce at home what their
husbands or boyfriends have learned in class.
<P>
A tax-exempt nonprofit funded solely by donations, FEN will soon
be taking Burwell's innovative curriculum to four new locations
in Michigan, and opening branches in Chicago, Brownsville, Texas,
and near Memphis, Tennessee.

<h2>Hundred-Gallon Heroes</h2>
<P>
<B>by <a href="/heritage/staff/meyerson.htm">Adam Meyerson</a></B>
</center><P>
 Eight million Americans donate blood each year, with the typical
donor giving a pint every seven months. But Mike Hitt, an electrician
from Katy, Texas, visits the Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center
two times a week to donate plasma and platelets (blood components
that reduce internal bleeding among leukemia and other patients).
Hitt first gave blood in 1969 while serving with the Army Artillery
in Vietnam. Since then, he has donated more than 100 gallons of
blood and blood components-67 times his total blood volume. Nearly
a thousand patients have been aided by his gifts of life.
<P>
 Hitt is one of 62 winners of the 1995 Jefferson Awards, given
by the American Institute for Public Service. These prizes honor
ordinary people who, through their volunteer work, are making
extraordinary contributions to their communities. The annual awards
ceremony, held in the chambers of the U.S. Supreme Court, is a
reminder of the greatness of America-a country where liberty and
generosity go hand in hand, and compassionate citizens are free
to solve community problems in their own imaginative ways.
<P>
 The 1995 Jefferson Award winners range in age from 14-year-old
Gustavo Renteria of San Jose, California, who teaches English
to newly arrived Latino immigrant children so they don't have
to suffer in bilingual-education classes, to 106-year-old Billy
Earley of Florence, Arizona, who has volunteered more than 128,000
hours (equal to 64 years of a 40-hour work week) since she started
with the American Red Cross making bandages for wounded soldiers
in World War I. Mrs. Earley doesn't plan to retire from her volunteer
work for at least 10 more years. 
<P>
  Other 1995 winners include DWe Williams of Oklahoma City, a
foster mother who has adopted five children with special needs,
including one boy born without limbs; Mattie Hill Brown of Wilson,
North Carolina, who feeds 200 hungry people every week in the
soup kitchen she set up in the town's Masonic lodge; Ken and Twilla
Eden, who dress up as clowns in Boise, Idaho, to entertain kids
with cancer; 17-year-old Joshua Mele of Fayetteville, New York,
who designed habitat for and stocked 4,400 trout in a nearby fishery.
Charles Fortney of Tunnelton, West Virginia, who has served as
a scout master (for 46 years), Rotary Club president, school-board
president, and a trustee of his local United Methodist church,
is a walking definition of the term &quot;pillar of the community.&quot;
<P>
 One of the awards this year is shared by two brothers, Leslie
Colston and Bill Colston Jr. Both are paramedics certified in
advanced training with the Riviera Volunteer Fire Department outside
Corpus Christi, Texas. These brothers arrange their schedules
so that at every hour of the day one of them is always on call
and prepared to respond to a medical emergency. The Colstons are
among the 1.5 million Americans who provide fire protection and
ambulance service without pay.
<P>
 The brainchild of Sam Beard, a developer of low-income communities
and a former aide to Robert Kennedy who lives in Wilmington, Delaware,
the Jefferson Awards is one of those rare ventures that draw support
from across the political spectrum. Liberals on the board include
Hollywood lobbyist Jack Valenti and Senate Minority Leader Thomas
Daschle; conservatives include William E. Simon, the former treasury
secretary, and R. Emmett Tyrrell Jr., the editor of the <I>American
Spectator</I>. Liberals like to honor nonprofit helpers of the
needy; conservatives like voluntary, nongovernmental ways to address
community problems.
<P>
 The awards also mix public service with business self-interest,
an old American tradition. Nominations come from local newspapers
and TV stations, which see marketing advantages in celebrating
hometown heroes. WGAL-TV in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, sells corporate
sponsorships for its nominations. The <I>Indianapolis Star</I>
received 150 suggestions from its readers, and more than 200 Hoosiers,
including Governor Evan Bayh and Mayor Stephen Goldsmith, attended
the paper's lunch honoring its nominees.
<P>
 Mike Hyland, the executive director of the Jefferson Awards,
has been a TV reporter and a press secretary on Capitol Hill.
&quot;The media and Congress are cynical institutions obsessed
with finding corruption,&quot; he says. &quot;What a difference
it is to work for an organization that looks for heroes.&quot;

<P>
 &quot;I don't deserve this award,&quot; said Mike Hitt, the blood
donor <I>non pareil</I>, as he surveyed the other winners. Other
Jefferson Awardees said the same as they learned about him. Thomas
Jefferson would disagree. The awards are a fitting tribute to
Jefferson's vision of a democracy sustained by independent citizens
of energy and character. &quot;I agree with you,&quot; wrote Jefferson
to John Adams, &quot;that there is a natural aristocracy among
men. The grounds of this are virtue and talents.&quot;

<title> Can Congress Revive Civil Society? - Policy Review -Jan/Feb96 - Heritage</title>

<center><h2>Can Congress Revive Civil Society?</h2>

By <a href="#coats">Senator Dan Coats</a>,<br>
With responses from <a href="#him">Gertrude Himmelfarb</a>, <a href="#eberly">Don Eberly</a> & <a href="#boaz">David Boaz</a>

<p>

      <b><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</b><br>

                                  January-February 1996, Number 75</i>
    
       <hr width=50%></center><p>
	In their 1975 book <i>To Empower People</i>, Richard John Neuhaus and Peter Berger challenged policymakers to protect and foster the "mediating structures" --  neighborhood, family, church, and voluntary associations -- that stand between the private individual and large government institutions. "Wherever possible," they wrote, "public policy should utilize mediating structures for the realization of social purposes."
<P>	Twenty years later, Washington is heeding the call. In October 1995, Senator Dan Coats introduced a package of legislative proposals to help empower local, community-based institutions that are addressing social problems. Crafted with the help of William J. Bennett, a codirector of Empower America, the <a href="#project">"Project for American Renewal"</a> comprises 19 separate bills designed to use public policy -- and public resources -- to energize mainly private efforts to meet human needs. Coats defended his legislation at a recent symposium at <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>; what follows are his remarks and critiques by some of the symposium's participants.
<p>

<b><a name="coats">Senator Dan Coats</b><br>
<i>Re-funding Our "Little Platoons"</i>
<p>
	An intellectual revolution is underway concerning the nature of our social crisis. It is no longer credible to argue that rising illegitimacy, random violence, and declining values are rooted in the lack either of economic equality or of economic opportunity. These positions are still current in our political debate, but they have lost their plausibility.
<p>	America's cultural decay can be traced directly to the breakdown of certain institutions -- families, churches, neighborhoods, voluntary associations -- that act as an immune system against cultural disease. In nearly every community, these institutions once created an atmosphere in which most problems -- a teenage girl "in trouble," the rowdy neighborhood kids, the start of a drug problem at the local high school -- could be confronted before their repetition threatened the existence of the community itself.

<p>
	When civil society is strong, it infuses a community with its warmth, trains its people to be good citizens, and transmits values between generations. When it is weak, no amount of police or politics can provide a substitute. There is a growing consensus that a declining civil society undermines both civility and society.
<p>	In this discussion, the importance of civil society is something I want to assume, not argue. But it leads to another question: Does this intellectual revolution have political consequences? Should it influence the agenda of Congress, or is it irrelevant to our work?
<p>	Let me begin by saying what is <i>not</i> at issue. I do not argue that government is sufficient to the need. Nothing short of a Great Awakening, as Gertrude Himmelfarb has noted, is sufficient to the need. But I <i>do</i> argue that conservatives have duties beyond waiting for another Charles Wesley. Realism about government's limits is not a substitute for effective public policy. I am convinced that political reflection on these themes is important not only for its own sake; it provides the next, necessary stage of the conservative revolution.
<p>	Government clearly has had a role in undermining civil society. Families, churches, and community groups were forced to surrender their authority and function to bureaucratic experts. Fathers were replaced by welfare checks, private charities were displaced by government spending, religious volunteers were dismissed as "amateurs", whole communities were demolished in slum-clearance projects. The power to replace an institution is the power to destroy it. 
<p>	So the first item on the political agenda is a re-limited government, leaving enough social space for civil society to resume its role. 
<p>	But this brings us to a problem. The retreat of government does not automatically result in the rebirth of civil society. It is a necessary condition, but not a sufficient one. As Professor John DiIulio has observed, when a victim is stabbed, you need to remove the knife. But removing the knife will not heal the wound. 
<p>	In Russia, the retreat of government has resulted in what one expert calls "anarcho-capitalism" --  closer to the Mafia than the invisible hand. Even if this result had been known beforehand, it would not have been an argument to retain the communist system. But it is an argument for respecting the potential for social dislocation when civil society is weak. Robert Woodson of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise has said, "[T]he moral centers of black life were decimated by liberal policies." We should not ignore the potential for suffering, especially in our cities, when government retreats.
<p>	The decline of civil society threatens the future of our political order. It requires us to ask certain questions out of a reasonable, justified desperation. How do we creatively, but not intrusively, strengthen the safety net of civil society? How do we encourage the transfer of resources and authority, not just to state governments, but to those private and religious institutions that shape, direct, and reclaim individual lives? 
<p>	There is not -- and could never be -- a government plan to rebuild civil society. But there must be ways to actively take the side of people and institutions who are rebuilding their own communities, and who often feel isolated and poorly equipped.
<p>	This is the theory that Bill Bennett and I have adopted in the <a href="#project">"Project for American Renewal."</a> Government cannot directly restore what it has crippled. But we believe that deferring to and depending on these institutions in public policy would have a positive effect. As Robert Putnam of Harvard University has argued, the resources of community, unlike physical resources, become depleted when they are not used. They must be exercised or they atrophy. 
<p>	Our goal is to exercise civil society by turning over federal roles to private institutions. In practice, we hope to tilt public policies in favor of intact families. We want to strengthen grass-roots community organizations. And we propose to shift welfare responsibilities to private and religious charities. Every dollar spent by families, community groups, and faith-based charities is more efficient and compassionate than any dollar spent by the federal government.
<p>	The centerpiece and symbol of the package is the "Comprehensive Charity Reform Act." It would allow individuals to donate $500 of their tax liability to private, antipoverty organizations. This measure would take about 8 percent of federal welfare spending and provide it directly to institutions actually winning their war on poverty, armed with spiritual vitality, tough love, and true compassion. 
<p>	My objective is to promote a new ethic of giving in America. When individuals make these contributions to effective charities, it is a form of involvement beyond writing a check to the federal government. It encourages a new definition of citizenship -- one in which men and women examine and support the programs in their own communities that serve the poor.
<p>	This is exactly how I came to be involved in these issues. My initial interest was not academic. I had the experience of seeing how religious charities not only feed the body but touch the soul. They are dramatically effective, while the programs I reauthorized year after year in Congress did not even bother to keep track of their dismal results. 
<p>	One of my favorite examples is the Gospel Mission in Washington, D.C. It provides one of the most vivid contrasts to government failure I have ever seen. It has a 12-month drug rehabilitation rate of 66 percent, while a once-heralded government program just three blocks away rehabilitates less than 10 percent of those it serves. Yet the government program spends many times more per person.
<p>	To explain the difference you need to talk to those the Gospel Mission has served. One addict who came to the shelter after failing in several government programs says, "Those programs generally take addictions from you, but don't place anything within you. I needed a spiritual lifting. People like those at the mission are like God walking into your life. Not only am I drug-free, but more than that, I can be a person again."
<p>	Marvin Olasky has talked about the need to "defund" government and "refund" those faith-based institutions that actually work. Bill Bennett and I have taken this not merely as an interesting observation but as a challenge. The Project for American Renewal is not the definitive answer, but it is the beginning of a debate we can no longer avoid.
<p>	Naturally, we've encountered criticism, which has centered around three questions. First, is the project a violation of the letter and spirit of devolution? Nothing could be further from the truth. What we advocate is a particularly radical form of devolution. Some conservatives only seem comfortable transferring federal resources and authority to state bureaucracies. Our package would redistribute power directly to families, grass-roots community organizations, and private and religious charities. It is hardly a conservative position to argue that, of all the institutions of American society, only state governments merit our trust. Our goal should not only be to redistribute power <i>within</i> government, but to spread power <i>beyond</i> government.
<p>

	Second, should there be <i>any</i> role for the federal government in these matters?
<p>

	My response is that conservatives need to pick their fights. States are better positioned to do many things -- but not to do everything.
<p>

	Federalism is useful, but we need to avoid a 10th Amendment utopianism. Bill Bennett tells the story of a governor who sought a series of federal waivers from him when he was President Reagan's education secretary. Bennett responded that they would be granted, but only if the governor also sent of list of state obstacles to reform. The state regulations far outnumbered the federal ones. 


<p>	State officials can repeat the same mistakes as their federal counterparts. State welfare bureaucracies can be just as strong and wrong as federal programs. We need the wisdom to concentrate on those areas where we can be most effective, even if it means a federal role in jump-starting reform. It is a paradox that it takes an active federal government to divest itself of its own power. Federal inertia serves the cause of bureaucratic centralization. 	
<p>

	Third, does the project -- with its tax credits -- contradict the Republican economic agenda, particularly the flat tax? 

<p>
	I support a flatter, fairer, simpler tax code. But I am convinced that eliminating the charitable deduction would be social engineering on massive scale. The level of charitable giving is closely correlated with the treatment of charitable contributions in tax law. Abandoning this commitment would invoke the law of unintended consequences with a vengeance.


<p>	There are many in the Congress who could not and would not support such a reform. And many of the most serious flat-tax proposals now recognize this fact, carving out an exception for charitable giving. Those are the only initiatives with a political future. 
<p>	I believe we are led by policy to creatively surrender federal authority to civil society. But there is a political point to be made as well. 
<p>	There is only one thing more important than what Republicans do in the budget debate. It is what they say the day after it has ended. If our only appeal to Americans is a balanced budget and devolution to state bureaucracies, the Republican revolution is likely to falter. 
<p>	No lasting political realignment can occur without an element of vision and hope -- a message that our worst social problems, while persistent, are not permanent. Hope is what turns a sociological debate into a compelling political theme. If we do not develop such a theme, Republicans will become social Darwinists by default -- accepting the survival of the fittest. But we know where that hope is kindled -- among individuals and groups engaged in the hard, noble work of restoration. Their victories are among America's great, untold stories. No alternative approach to our cultural crisis holds as much promise as the success of these "little platoons," precisely because they have qualities not found in government at any level -- spiritual renewal and authentic compassion. As a matter of public policy, and as a matter of prudent politics, it is time to aggressively take their side in the battle to recivilize American society.
<p>
<i><b>Dan Coats</b> is a Republican Senator from Indiana and the creator, with William Bennett, of the Project for American Renewal.</i>
<p>

<a name="him><b>Gertrude Himmelfarb</b></a><br>
<i>Remoralizing Civil Society</i>
<p>
	 I have never been beguiled by the idea of devolution. Like Senator Coats, I believe that devolution -- the transfer of power from the federal government to local and state governments -- is a necessary but not a sufficient step in the reform of our society. I also believe that the next stage of devolution -- the transfer of power from government at all levels to civil society -- is necessary -- but again not sufficient.
<p>

	In recent times, civil society has had many of its functions usurped by an overweening government. Welfare has displaced a good deal of charity. Families have been relieved of the obligation to care for their aged and incapacitated members. Communities can no longer stigmatize behavior such as illegitimacy that the government subsidizes and, in effect, legitimizes -- rhetorically as well as practically. (While researching my last book, I wrote a federal agency to inquire about the latest statistics on illegitimacy. I received a letter firmly rebuking me for using that term; the proper term, I was told, is either "nontraditional child bearing" or "alternative modes of parenting" -- hence, legitimizing illegitimacy).
<p>

Civil society has thus been severely weakened by government. But it also has been weakened by the culture in general. More important, it has been corrupted by the culture. In fact, some of the institutions in civil society are thriving as never before. There are powerful philanthropies and foundations, more than we've ever had before, and some have unprecedented wealth; there are private schools and colleges, social agencies, civic institutions, cultural organizations, and churches of all kinds. And all are flourishing in civil society.
<p>

	But not always to good effect. Senator Coats describes civil society as an "immune system" against social disease. But civil society has been infected by the same virus that has afflicted the culture in general. The theories and practices that have been so detrimental to our educational system -- affirmative action, multiculturalism, outcome-based education -- have been initiated and promoted by private foundations and universities. Some of the most egregious projects funded by the National Endowment for the Arts have been proudly exhibited in local museums supported by the cultural elites of those communities. Even the churches, both mainstream and New Age churches, have contributed to what I would call the "de-moralization" of society, the kind of permissiveness and self-indulgence that is so conspicuous in our culture at large. The family is the bedrock of civil society. But it, too, is in a bad state -- witness the prevalence of illegitimacy, divorce, transient "relationships," neglected children, households where the main cultural vehicle is television, with its incessant messages of promiscuity and violence.

<p>
	It is not enough, then, to revitalize civil society. We have to start thinking about "remoralizing" civil society. And that is a far, far more difficult task. And here -- paradoxically -- is where the government can be helpful. Unlike some of my conservative friends, I've never been a libertarian in economic affairs; nor am I much of a libertarian in social and cultural affairs. In our present situation, it seems to me, the remoralization of society requires that we avail ourselves of all of the resources that we can command -- public and private, religious and secular, governmental as well as civil.

<p>
	This may be the most important lesson I learned from the Victorians: They did not bifurcate their lives. They did not distinguish between private virtue and public virtue. Nor did they try to keep religion out of the public square. The Dissenters, for example, had no objection to the established Church of England (there was no serious movement for the disestablishment of the Church throughout the entire Victorian period). Secularists habitually joined with religious groups -- utilitarians with Evangelicals -- in promoting various measures of social reform. Government officials responsible for the distribution of public relief cooperated with private charities, their common purpose being to prevent the "de-moralization of the poor" --  what we more politely call the "culture of dependency." They used, in short, whatever resources were available, in civil society and in the polity, to help stabilize and remoralize society.

<p>
	It's often said that you can't legislate morality. But we have, in fact, done just that. The civil-rights legislation in the 1960s had the effect not only of legally proscribing racial discrimination but also of proscribing it morally. The fact is that individuals, communities, families, neighborhoods, and churches do not function in isolation. They cannot sustain traditional values that are at odds with those being promoted by the government, by the courts, and by the culture. All values, even traditional values, have to be legitimized. And in a secular society, the main organs of legitimization are government, law, and the culture.
<p>

	Conservatives, then, must not only eliminate laws and social policies that have illegitimatized traditional values. They also must devise laws and social policies that will legitimize traditional values. One might say that our legislators and policymakers are as much our moral instructors as are our teachers and preachers. This is why the Project for American Renewal is an important document -- not only for the specific measures it proposes, but also for the principle it conveys: that government -- responsible, modest, self-critical government -- may be a useful ally of civil society in the remoralization of society.

<i>The New Demands of Citizenship</i>
<p>
	Dan Coats has issued a challenge for us to join in a new intellectual revolution, and join it we must. The most promising aspect of this revolution is that its recovery of the term "civil society" suggests that this concept may once again take deep root in our policy debates and in the public imagination. Civil society may very well supply the framework for a promising new social policy for the 21st century. 
<p>

	In his book <i>The Quest for Community</i>, Robert Nisbet suggested that the great challenge of modern society is "protecting, reinforcing, nurturing where necessary, the varied groups and associations which form the true building blocks of the social order." Nisbet's concern at the time (the 1950s) was that the human yearning for community, which is rooted in our social nature, would likely feed the hunger for a pervasive centralized government if not properly directed toward the restoration of real, functioning local communities. Our failure to heed his warning has left us with precisely the dangerous combination he feared -- a powerful central state combined with radically weakened social institutions. 

<p>
	In considering solutions to America's cultural decline, we would do well to keep in mind an ancient Chinese proverb: The possibility of progress begins when you call a problem by its right name. The present crisis in America is a crisis not merely of political and governmental dysfunction, but of societal disintegration.
<p>	We are witnessing today a dangerous depletion of the spiritual and psychological qualities upon which democracy and limited government depend. Our character-shaping institutions are collapsing in the face of a hedonistic mass culture increasingly characterized by violence, incivility, and a flagrant disregard for human dignity. We Americans are in rapid retreat from the very idea of society.
<p>	If we are to reverse this trend, we must change our conversation, and quickly, from the deterministic logic of the social sciences, which shift responsibility for antisocial behavior from the individual to the larger society. And we must move beyond our preoccupation with governmentalism -- that is, what government does, how it does it, or what it stops doing. 
<p>	Can Congress restore civil society? No one here believes that Congress can do more than help to set the conditions for such a recovery. But we should question whether Congress is prepared to do this much. Politicians must recognize that their ultimate success in policy reform depends precisely upon a deeper social renewal that can only originate in our hearts, homes, and local communities. The real question, then, is how do we, as a political community, respond to Nisbet's challenge to nurture the varied groups and associations of civil society.
<p>	There are many positive contributions that social policy reforms can make toward this end. Peter Berger and Richard John Neuhaus, in their classic work <i>To Empower People</i>, urged that the intermediary institutions and associations of civil society be recognized in policy reforms. They offered two primary principles to guide public policy formulation: first, that public policy should protect and foster mediating structures; and second, that wherever possible, public policy should encourage mediating structures to address social concerns. This is essentially what the Coats bill is attempting to do. Finally, there is much the individual politician can contribute to the recovery of foundational solutions: Elected officials can lead in rebuilding civic community and recovering effective charity in their districts.

<p>
	The most important thing is that we get the intellectual revolution right. That requires understanding what civil society is, why it matters, and what we Americans can do to recover it. The debate that lies ahead may indeed spark one of the most consequential shifts in social policy we have ever witnessed. The bill signals a departure from our current obsession with either the state or the market as instruments for social progress. Civil society is a different sphere. It is an intermediary sector, where private individuals join voluntarily in associations that operate neither on the principle of coercion, nor entirely on the principle of rational self-interest. In fact, the modus operandi of life in civil society gives expression to the pursuit of the common good, where actions are animated by a spirit of trust and collaboration. 
<p> I have a caution here, it is that civil society not simply be embraced mostly for its utilitarian value in replacing the central welfare state. The stakes in recovering civil society go far beyond the replacement of the welfare state, as important as that is. 
<p>The mediating associations of civil society, as Alexis de Tocqueville tells us, are essential to both our democratic and economic systems. He noted that "feelings and opinions are recruited, the heart is enlarged, and the human mind is developed only by the reciprocal influence of men upon one another" operating in civil society. This sector generates the social capital -- responsible citizens capable of self-governance and trust toward others -- upon which our economic and democratic life depend. Lose this third sector, and you end up not with two sectors but eventually with only one: the bureaucratic state. The reason for this is that a society of isolated, atomized individuals is simply no match for the power and expansive ambition of the omnicompetent state. In fact, individuals who are cut off from the problem-solving, order-creating realm of civil society will almost certainly turn to government for order and safety, and yes, even for a sense of belonging and purpose. The result is a politically organized society which is held together mainly by force of state authority. Anyone who thinks that the monster of statism has been slain by the mere adoption of the policies of political devolution should think again. 
<p>	Civil society, by definition, embraces institutions, groups, and associations, not individuals. It frustrates our dominant cultural impulse, which is to assert that the autonomous self is the only sovereign, and it grates against our dominant political reflex, which celebrates boundless individual choice as the highest good. The realm of civil society is free and largely autonomous, but it nevertheless imposes constraints and obligations on the individual and limits his choices. In other words, talk of civil society implies a return to authority and order. Many Western liberals -- whether in political or economic terms -- have embraced a notion of absolute freedom that is simply not self-sustaining. 
<p>	So as we evaluate this legislation, we must remember what has happened in our political culture even as we discuss the need for mentoring, fathering, character-shaping charity, community empowerment, and curbing divorce. Public policy has shifted away from our decades-long impulse to empower isolated individuals. Policies are now being directed at asserting institutional authority, social obligations, and moral requirements over the individual. We must be clear: We are talking about restoring authority in the noncoercive realm of civil society, not the coercive realm of the state.
<p>

	Freedom from the suffocating clutches of the social-service state is not simply a freedom to be left alone, as the latest conservative mantra has it. It is a freedom to become Americans again -- compassionate, civic minded, and committed to rebuilding the good society.
<p>

	The risk of the present revolution in Washington is that it simply replaces a sterile statism with an equally sterile antistatism, which does little to give life to a dying society. Dismantling ineffective and costly government is important work, but it does not constitute by itself a social or political philosophy. Freeing up the market is a splendid idea, but it does not constitute by itself a vision for a well-ordered society, and the market contributes little by itself to the recovery of community. (Some would argue that its effects are precisely the opposite.)
<p>	If civil society reappears, it will have been due to two events. First, we will have taken seriously the coherent moral vision reflected in this bill and worked to lodge it deeply within our public imagination, using it as the framework for rebuilding institutions, renewing human dignity, and restoring a functional society. Second, we will have directed our politics to the task of mobilizing Americans to do what politicians cannot.
<p>	We must applaud the Coats initiative without raising a new round of false expectations. The legislation should be accompanied by the issuing of greater demands -- yes, <i>demands</i> -- on American citizens. We're reminded daily that they apparently want power back. Well, this means helping them recover an awareness of their own social duties. With its emphasis on localism, citizenship, and networks of civic engagement, this bill issues a bold moral challenge to every American, one that should not be dismissed.
<p>

	The great question of our time is, 'How do we renew, regenerate, re-energize civil society?' " There is no compulsory program for civil society; it must be summoned forth. It will happen as we tap into the currents that have always renewed human society: religious revival, the quest for transcendence, moral order, and membership in community. This is important work, and work that every American citizen must embrace.

<i>Conservative Social Engineering</i>

	Senator Coats is to be commended for recognizing that devolution of power from the federal government to state governments is not a sufficient answer to America's problems. He correctly notes that many of our problems require "the recovery of families, neighborhoods, churches, schools, and voluntary associations . . . an influence that is literally 'civilizing.'" He rightly points out that "even if government directly undermined civil society, it cannot directly reconstruct it."
<p>

	It is important, as Senator Coats argues, to demonstrate that faith in limited government is not just a negative attitude toward government; rather, it is rooted in an appreciation of the complicated network of institutions and associations that bind us together and provide us with much of what makes life worthwhile. Unfortunately, while the senator has correctly identified the problem -- the decline of civil society -- he doesn't seem to understand the reasons for that decline. Despite his rhetorical skepticism about the efficacy of government, his 19-bill legislative package, dubbed the Project for American Renewal, shows a faith in government almost as breathtaking as that of the architects of the Great Society.
<p>

	First the good news: The centerpiece of Coats's plan is the Comprehensive Charity Reform Act, which would provide a $500-per-person tax credit for charitable contributions to groups helping the poor. That approach -- also found in legislation introduced by Senator John Ashcroft and Representatives Jim Kolbe and Joseph Knollenberg -- would shift charitable spending from government to millions of individuals and private organizations, and we can expect entirely exemplary results. Private charitable groups have a far better record than government agencies at getting people back on their feet, off welfare, and into stable work and family lives.
<p>

	Now for the rest of the story. Coats says that the Project for American Renewal "is not a government plan to rebuild civil society" and that he favors "a radical form of devolution [that] would redistribute power directly to families, grass-roots community organizations, and private and religious charities." But in practice he apparently believes that the federal government should tax American citizens, bring their money to Washington, and then dole it out to sensible state and local programs and responsible private institutions. Surely we have learned that government grants do not create strong, creative, vibrant private organizations. Rather, organizations that depend on government funding will have to follow government rules, will be unable to respond effectively to changing needs, and will get caught up in  games of grantsmanship and bureaucratic empire-building.


<p>	Moreover, nearly every one of his bills would further entangle the federal government in the institutions of civil society. Under the Role Model Academy Act, the federal government would "establish an innovative residential academy for at-risk youth." Under the Mentor Schools Act, the feds would provide grants to school districts wanting to develop and operate "same gender" schools. The Character Development Act would give school districts demonstration grants to work with community groups to develop mentoring programs. The Family Reconciliation Act would "provide additional federal funding . . . to implement a waiting period and pre-divorce counseling" for couples with children.
<p>

	Many of these bills are intended to address real problems, such as the effects of divorce on children and the terrible plight of children trapped in fatherless, crime-ridden, inner-city neighborhoods. But why is it appropriate or effective for the federal government to intrude into these problems? Surely local school districts should decide whether to build same-sex schools or residential academies for at-risk youth; and if the people of, say, Detroit decide that such options would make sense, any theory of responsible, accountable government would suggest that the local city council or school board both make that decision and raise the funds to carry it out.
<p>	Many of Coats's bills deal with symptoms -- they try to reform public housing by setting aside units for married couples or to provide mentors for children without fathers -- rather than dealing with the real problem, a welfare system that guarantees every teenager her choice of an abortion or an apartment if she gets pregnant. Some of the bills accept the federal Leviathan as a given and tinker with it -- for instance, by requiring that every federal dollar spent on family planning be matched by another dollar spent on abstinence education and adoption services. Others just follow the failed liberal policy of handing out federal dollars for whatever Congress thinks is a good idea -- school choice, restitution to crime victims, maternity homes, community crime-watch programs.

<p>
	Over the past 60 years, we've watched the federal government intrude more and more deeply into our lives. We've seen well-intentioned government programs become corrupted by the ideologues and bureaucrats placed in charge. We've seen schools and charities get hooked on federal dollars. The nature of government doesn't change when it is charged with carrying out conservative social engineering rather than liberal social engineering.
<p>	Let's not forget that if, say, Coats's Maternity Shelter Act were implemented next year, Donna Shalala, the secretary of health and human services, would be charged with implementing it. She might appoint HUD assistant secretary Andrew Cuomo to run it, or maybe unemployed ex-congressman Mel Reynolds, or maybe just some Harvard professor who thinks single motherhood is a viable lifestyle option for poor young women. One reason conservatives shouldn't set up well-intentioned government programs is that they won't always be in power to run them.
<p>	In <i>Democracy in America</i>, Alexis de Tocqueville noted that "Americans of all ages, all conditions, and all dispositions constantly form associations . . . to give entertainments, to found seminaries, to build inns, to construct churches, to diffuse books, to send missionaries to the antipodes; in this manner they found hospitals, prisons, and schools."
<p>	So why have families, churches, and neighborhood associations atrophied? Government, especially federal government, is a big part of the reason. Programs from Social Security to school breakfasts make family members less dependent on each other. Bureaucratic welfare programs not only encourage unwed motherhood and fatherlessness, they usurp a traditional role of churches. Governments promise to feed babies, teach children about sex, build playgrounds, run museums, provide job training, rehabilitate drug and alcohol abusers, and care for the elderly. Little is left for mediating institutions.
<p>	How do we get back to the healthy civil society that Tocqueville observed? Here's a program: First, reaffirm the constitutional mandate of the Tenth Amendment. That means the federal government should withdraw from areas in which it has no powers under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution.
<p>	Second, cut federal taxes -- not by $500, but by a lot -- so that people have more money to spend, both on their own families and on charitable efforts. An important side effect of a large tax cut might be that more families discover they can live on one income and choose to have one parent stay home to care for children.

<p>
	Third, under the principle of subsidiarity, return all the functions of civil society to the lowest level at which they can be adequately performed -- the individual, the family, the church, the neighborhood, the school, the community, if necessary the state government. Advocates of limited government need to emphasize that the absence of government is not nothing: it's individual initiative and creativity and the vast array of associations that make up civil society.
<p>	Despite all we've learned about the failure of government, Coats just doesn't seem to get it. His proposals reflect the Washington that Roosevelt built, the Washington where, if you think of a good idea, you create a government program.
<p>	But ultimately, you either believe in individual liberty, limited government, and free markets, or you end up inviting the coercive state into every nook and cranny of civil society.
