<center><h3><i> WILL AMERICA REMAIN A NUCLEAR POWER?  
IMPLICATIONS OF CLINTON'S NUCLEAR TEST BAN</h3></i>
<p>

Executive Memorandum #427<br>
August 27, 1995<br>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<p>
	" . .. ..  I can foresee a time early in the next century when America will no longer be a nuclear power."
<p>
	
	 -- Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, June 21, 1994</center>
<P>
	On August 11, President Bill Clinton announced a ban on all U.S.  nuclear tests.  This decision is a major step toward making Senator Thurmond's prediction come true.  It effectively reverses the policy the Clinton Administration adopted less than a year ago.  The September 1994 Nuclear Posture Review found that the U.S.  must maintain a stockpile of reliable, safe, and effective nuclear weapons to deter any potential adversaries and fulfill its security commitments.  Because such a stockpile cannot be maintained without testing, President Clinton effectively has committed the nation to unilateral nuclear disarmament.
<p>
	President Clinton's case for a comprehensive nuclear test ban is based on a number of misperceptions about nuclear testing.
<ul>
<li><b>The Administration asserts that nuclear tests are not needed to maintain a stockpile of reliable, safe, and effective nuclear weapons. </b>  Tests are needed.  This was the conclusion of a non-partisan panel of scientists, chaired by Stanford University scientist Sidney Drell, in a report submitted to the House Armed Services Committee in 1990.  Dr.  Drell stood behind this assessment as recently as 1992, in testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
<p>
	Drell now chairs another study group which has reached the opposite conclusion.  The JASON group, in a report released on August 4, concludes that tests no longer are required to maintain a stockpile of safe, reliable, and effective nuclear weapons.  What accounts for Drell's change of opinion is unclear.  However, even the JASON study hedges on the question of adopting an outright ban on testing.  Its authors conclude that continuing tests of nuclear weapons below the kiloton level can add to long-term stockpile confidence and that unforeseen problems might require the U.S.  to withdraw from a comprehensive test ban treaty. 
<p>
	<li><b>A comprehensive test ban rests on the assumption that America need not develop any new nuclear weapons.</b>  This assumption is false.  The <i>Minuteman III</i> intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), which is the only ICBM the U.S.  will retain after implementation of the Strategic Arms Reduction (START) II Treaty, was first deployed in 1970.  If there is no further testing, the <i>Minuteman III</i> will never be replaced with a new missile.  The more modern MX missile will be dismantled under START II.
<p>
	A new missile will be required simply to replace the aging <i>Minuteman III</i>.  But it also will be needed for another reason.  New missile designs will be more accurate, and this will make them more lethal against hardened military targets.
<p>
	<li><b>The President asserts that the nuclear test ban will expedite the adoption of a comprehensive test ban (CTB) treaty.</b>  Even if a CTB treaty is negotiated, the evidence indicates the Senate will not consent to its ratification.  In fact, on August 4, the Senate voted by a margin of 56 to 44 to fund the sort of tests the Clinton policy and a CTB treaty would ban.  Senate consent to ratification of a CTB treaty will require 67 votes, assuming all 100 Senators are voting.  This means that President Clinton will have to find 23 more votes in the Senate to support his desire for a CTB treaty. 
<p>
	Even if a CTB treaty were ratified, it would not impose a global ban on testing.  No country would be compelled to sign the treaty, and even those that do could circumvent it by conducting very-low-yield tests that could not be verified.  Thus, the Clinton policy will not achieve a comprehensive global ban on testing.  However, it will impose a unilateral ban on the U.S.
<p>
	<li><b>The Administration assumes that a CTB can be verified.</b>  The truth is that it will be impossible to verify whether very small nuclear explosions have taken place.  Most nuclear tests can be detected through seismic sensors.  But these sensors are not likely to be sensitive enough to detect a secret test of a very-low-yield device.  Even the JASON group study concludes that monitoring compliance with a treaty barring such tests would require cooperative, on-site monitoring. 
<p>
	<li><b>The Administration asserts that barring nuclear tests in the United States will prevent the proliferation of nuclear arms around the globe.</b>  In fact, a test ban will spur proliferation.  The U.S.  nuclear arsenal serves as a barrier to proliferation, not as an incentive.  U.S.  allies like Germany and Japan are less likely to desire nuclear weapons as long as they view the U.S.  nuclear guarantee as viable.  One of the measures of this viability is the safety and reliability of the U.S.  nuclear force, and this requires testing. 
</ul><p>
	America's nuclear deterrent is a force for good in the world.  Nothing will invite the acquisition and possible use of nuclear weapons by rogue states more than U.S.  nuclear disarmament.


<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
	President Clinton's decision to bar future tests of U.S.  nuclear weapons is short-sighted.  It will not help eliminate the world's arsenal of nuclear weapons.  However, it could result in unilateral disarmament for the U.S.
<p>
	The U.S.  already has been down a similar road.  In the late 1960s, the U.S.  unilaterally banned the development and stockpiling of biological weapons.  But other countries, including Iraq and the Soviet Union, continued to develop and stockpile such weapons, regardless of the 1972 treaty banning them.  The result was that the U.S.  ceased to possess a weapon that other countries continued to build.  President Clinton has adopted a policy that will lead inevitably to the same sort of inequitable outcome with respect to nuclear weapons.  This is a course fraught with risk for U.S.  national security.

<title>Needed at the U.N.: More Secretary, Less General -- Heritage</title>

<h3> NEEDED AT THE U.N.: MORE SECRETARY, LESS GENERAL</h3>

Executive Memorandum No. 455<br>
June 24, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Boutros Boutros-Ghali on June 19 proclaimed his intention to seek a second five-year term as Secretary General of the United Nations, shrugging off the Clinton Administration's indecisive behind-the-scenes efforts to induce him to step down after his term expires on December 31, 1996. A second term for Boutros-Ghali would be a disastrous setback for the cause of U.N. reform. The Secretary General not only has dragged his feet on long-overdue organizational and managerial reforms, but also has sought aggressively to expand both his own power and that of the already overextended U.N. bureaucracy. Now that the Clinton Administration's efforts to dissuade Boutros-Ghali from clinging to power have failed, the Administration should mount a relentless diplomatic campaign to block his plans for a second term and work to find a more suitable successor.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The next Secretary General should be someone who will systematically reform the U.N.'s bloated bureaucracy, root out the U.N.'s long-standing bias against free market economic policies, and consolidate U.N. operations to focus on the tasks that the organization was designed to accomplish and is best-equipped to fulfill.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Boutros-Ghali already has squandered his opportunity to put the U.N. on the right footing. In 1993, the Secretary General sought to suppress a report by Under-Secretary General for Administration and Management Richard Thornburgh which concluded that "The United Nations presently is almost totally lacking in effective means to deal with fraud, waste, and abuse by staff members."  Boutros-Ghali subsequently established an Inspector General's office, as recommended by the report, but refused to give it the independence it must have to do its job effectively.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Under Boutros-Ghali's leadership, the U.N. has accelerated its slide toward bankruptcy. The U.N. budget has increased 20 percent since 1991. Expanded peacekeeping missions have pushed up peacekeeping costs from $700 million in 1990 to $3.5 billion in 1994. But instead of slashing spending, Boutros-Ghali has sought to boost funding. Last January, he proposed that the U.N. acquire the power to levy taxes on fossil fuels, international travel, and currency transactions. Instead of forcing the U.N. to live within its means, he wants to empower the organization to acquire new functions, such as a standing army under his command that could lead to even more costly and dangerous peace-enforcement missions. These power grabs by the empire-building Secretary General are troubling because they set back reform efforts and dilute the U.N.'s accountability to member states. Moreover, they represent an infringement on and usurpation of the sovereignty of those member states. Boutros-Ghali's long-term agenda appears to be to acquire the trappings of sovereignty for the U.N., transforming it from an international organization composed of 185 member governments into a supranational government directed by an increasingly independent and powerful Secretary General.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The U.N. Secretary General is chosen in two steps: The Security Council nominates a candidate to the U.N. General Assembly, and the General Assembly then must approve the selection by majority vote. In practice, the power to select a new Secretary General rests with the Security Council, since the General Assembly has never rejected its nominee. A successful candidate must have the backing of nine of the Security Council's 15 member states, including all five permanent members (Britain, China, France, Russia, and the U.S.). This gives Washington veto power over the selection of the U.N.'s highest official.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Yet, despite Boutros-Ghali's poor record, the Clinton Administration has been dragging its feet on exercising its veto over a second term. Administration officials until recently held off on taking a public position to avoid a confrontation with the Secretary General and the countries that support his plans for a second term. In the absence of a clear signal from Washington, alternative candidates remained reluctant to challenge the incumbent Secretary General openly. He enjoys the strong backing of China, France, and Russia, while Britain has signaled that it will not stand in his way. Only the U.S. can deny Boutros-Ghali another term, given his assiduous cultivation of African and Asian support in the General Assembly, but the Clinton Administration until recently remained asleep at the switch.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Now the Administration must veto another term for Boutros-Ghali and find a suitable successor who will:<ul>

<p><li><b>Advocate aggressive organizational, personnel, and managerial reform of the U.N.</b> A dynamic reformer is needed to shake the entrenched U.N. bureaucracy from its lethargy, overcome decades of mismanagement, and end hiring practices based on political criteria and patronage. The top-heavy organizational structure of the U.N. secretariat needs to be streamlined; modern management techniques should be imposed; and a powerful Inspector General independent of the Secretary General should be established to root out waste, fraud, and abuse. The U.S.-backed "unitary U.N."  concept should be adopted to enhance coordination among disparate U.N. agencies and eliminate wasteful duplication of effort. The U.N.'s budget process needs to be revamped to make the relationship between cost and functions "transparent."

<p><LI><b>Support free-market economic reforms.</b> The U.N. long has been permeated by advocates of discredited statist economic policies that have been tried and discarded by many of its member states. The time has come to lift the dead hand of socialism from the U.N.'s rudder. The next Secretary General should seek to eradicate the U.N.'s hostility to free-market economic policies and forcefully lead U.N. organs to promote entrepreneurial liberty and legal safeguards for property rights as a way to stoke economic growth by unleashing the private sector.

<p><li><b>Focus the U.N. on what it was designed to do and is best able to do.</b> The U.N.'s most important mandate is to help maintain international peace and security through collective measures. But the organization's reach has exceeded its ability to accomplish this task as peacekeeping increasingly has become peace-enforcement, as in Bosnia and Somalia. The U.N. needs to step back from the overly ambitious peacekeeping schemes and the standing army proposed by Boutros-Ghali and focus its efforts on more limited goals. The new Secretary General also must recognize that the U.N. has limited capabilities and move to redirect U.N. efforts toward realistic goals in other areas as well. The U.N. should abandon unreachable utopian goals such as "eradicating poverty" or "health care for all by the year 2000."  Instead, its economic and social programs should concentrate on attainable goals and useful activities such as providing disaster relief and assisting refugees in the world's poorest regions. The U.N. should get out of the foreign aid business altogether. Its efforts to promote economic development and nation-building have produced meager results at exorbitant cost.

<p><li><b>Stake a claim to leadership by virtue of administrative ability and accomplishments, regardless of national origin.</b> The Secretary General's primary responsibility is as chief administrator of the U.N. secretariat, which has roughly 10,000 employees. This requires considerable managerial skill, particularly if a radical overhaul of U.N. operations is to be accomplished. The new Secretary General should be chosen without regard to national origin. The current practice of limiting candidates to nonaligned countries is a relic of the Cold War. 
The U.N. desperately needs to recruit an energetic reformer as Secretary General to consolidate its operations, overhaul its bureaucracy, resolve its financial crisis, and lead it into the next century. Boutros-Ghali squandered the opportunity to carry out these tasks and would be even less likely to accomplish them in a second term. The U.S. must insist that the next Secretary General be mindful that the U.N. is an international organization, not a supranational government. The U.N. needs more of a secretary and less of a general.

<title>The Russian Elections: A Glimmer of Hope for Reform -- Heritage</title>

<h3> THE RUSSIAN ELECTIONS: A GLIMMER OF HOPE FOR REFORM</h3>

Executive Memorandum No. 454<br>
June 24, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The first round of the Russian presidential elections, held on Sunday June 16, 1996, confirms a trend that began with the parliamentary elections in December 1995: Russia is now holding regular national elections that are relatively free and fair. This is no small achievement for a country that has known such leaders as Ivan the Terrible and Josef Stalin. These elections strengthen Russian democracy, and credit should go to the Russian people. But credit should go also to Boris Yeltsin and even presidential candidate Mikhail Gorbachev, who received only 0.5 percent of the vote. They shepherded their country toward a participatory political system after decades of totalitarian communism.
<p>


<b>Communist and nationalist messages rejected.</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Communist Gennady Zyuganov and ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky seem to be failing to obtain a democratic majority. Zyuganov received 31.96 percent of the vote, while Zhirinovsky got only 5.78 percent, down from the 11 percent his party received in the last election. Most Russians are unhappy with the Yeltsin administration, but they prefer the continuation of market reforms and individual freedoms, even under Yeltsin's faltering leadership, to a return to the communist past. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Boris Yeltsin shrewdly turned the elections into a referendum on communism, polarizing the electorate and saturating the airwaves and print media with anti-communist messages. The Russian President masterfully played on the fear that a communist victory would lead to a new civil war. The communists played into his hands by refusing to adapt their ideology to the new times and new generation. Unlike their Central European colleagues, who by and large have transformed themselves into Western-style social democrats, Russian communists have preserved the spirit, the name, and the trappings of Lenin's party and teachings, adding to them a particularly virulent brand of Russian chauvinism. This not only makes Russian communists appear to be throwbacks to the past. It also limits their voter appeal, especially among the young and the business class.
<p>


<b>The Messengers and the Messages.</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; There was also a tremendous difference in style between Yeltsin and Zyuganov. Yeltsin ran a modern, Western-style campaign, complete with "Rock the Vote" concerts, "Choose or You Lose" slogans, widespread television advertising, and media advisers imported from the U.S. By contrast, the communists relied on door-to-door canvassing and tedious party meetings. Yeltsin's new style of campaigning paid off. His popularity surged from single digits in January to an impressive 35 percent, while the communists failed to expand their electoral base, which hovers around 30 percent. Yeltsin made great strides in spite of the dire economic crisis.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

During his campaign, Yeltsin took advantage of his incumbency, promising everything from pension increases to wage and stipend hikes and even tax breaks for entire regions. He leaned on the media to ensure favorable coverage for himself. The liberal media were only too glad to deliver the anti-communist message. They did not want to see their freedoms dashed by a return to communist repression.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The impressive vote for retired Lieutenant General Alexander Lebed, who received 14.8 percent of the vote, demonstrated public nostalgia for great power prestige and a thirst for law and order. But the General Lebed of today is not the unabashed hard-liner he was two years ago. He is a professed convert to the gospel of the free market, small state, and democratic principles and procedures. He also seems to recognize the limits of Russian imperialism. The general knows that over 80 percent of the Russian public does not support using military power in the New Independent States (NIS) of the former Soviet Union, not even to assist ethnic Russians residing there. The majority of Russians favor an immediate end to the war in Chechnya, and a plurality even favor Chechen independence as the price for bringing troops home. Lebed has been a bitter critic of Yeltsin's war in Chechnya. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

 Market economist Grigory Yavlinsky, a Western-style liberal who garnered only 7.42 percent of the vote, finished fourth. He failed to establish himself as the viable alternative to Boris Yeltsin and ran a mediocre campaign that was low on cash and weak on organization. Yavlinsky reportedly does not enjoy stump speeches and campaign travel-- a handicap in a country of eleven time zones. He now has four years to build his Yabloko party into the sort of political machine he must have to win the presidency in the year 2000. He has a long road before him. His intellectual style and politics seem to be out of favor with many Russian voters. 
<p>


<b>The New Russian Electorate.</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The first round of the presidential elections demonstrated that the majority of the Russian people eschew the message of the cradle-to-grave welfare state, restoration of the Soviet Union, and militant Russian chauvinism. Moreover, the voters seem to be afraid that the communists would take away the freedoms they are learning to enjoy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The electorate was divided in more ways than one. How these divisions develop in the future will have a huge impact on whether democracy takes root in Russia. The agricultural South and the economically depressed areas of European Russia went for Zyuganov, while most of the resource-rich Far East, Siberia and the North, and the relatively more prosperous large cities voted for Yeltsin and Yavlinsky. The electorate under 35 years of age, large city dwellers, and voters with higher education rejected the communist message. By contrast, rural dwellers, voters over 55 years old, and people with only a secondary education cast their votes for Zyuganov. As older voters pass away, the younger generation that tends to be more democratic will gain more influence in Russian politics. Pro-reform regions in the Far East and Siberia also may continue to grow in political influence, which is good news not only for reform, but for the national unity of Russia's far-flung regions. 
<p>


<b>Second Round Crucial.</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; All of this is good news, but it should not be exaggerated. The degree of popular discontent in Russia should not be underestimated. A Yeltsin victory in the upcoming runoff elections, now scheduled for July 3, is not guaranteed. Zyuganov will do his best to play on voter frustrations to win. However, Boris Yeltsin is a master politician. The nomination of Alexander Lebed to serve as Russia's Head of the Security Council and Yeltsin's national security aide, and the firing of Lebed's unpopular rival, Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, make the Yeltsin ticket particularly strong. An even greater boost to Yeltsin's popularity is his firing of the unpopular chief of the Kremlin Guards, General Alexander Korzhakov, as well as Internal Security chief Mikhail Barsukov and Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets. Moreover, if Yeltsin brings Grigory Yavlinsky into the government as the economic policy czar, or otherwise secures his endorsement, he will improve his chances for re-election significantly.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Voter turnout will be an extremely important factor in the runoff. The communist electorate is disciplined, and Yeltsin will need to pay close attention to getting out the vote in order to achieve victory. Otherwise, many voters may decide that Yeltsin's victory is a foregone conclusion and stay away from the voting booths, attending their garden plots and summer homes.
<p>

<b>Conclusion.</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; From under the rubble of the former communist economy, a new Russia is emerging, complete with a consumer society and concerns about businesses and jobs. This is a new Russia whose face is much more familiar to Westerners than its previous communist one. The many problems between Russia and the West will not disappear -- problems such as differences over NATO expansion, suppling nuclear reactors to Iran, and Moscow's assertiveness outside its borders in the countries of the former Soviet Union. But at least there is hope that these problems can be worked out with Boris Yeltsin. The new Russia is making its choice for freedom, and it savors the occasion. While comprehensive economic and political reforms are painful and may take at least a generation, the current elections bring a glimmer of hope.

<TITLE>HOW BUSH CAN PREVENT CREATION OF AN ASIAN ANTI-U.S. TRADE BLOC
 -- Heritage </TITLE>

<CENTER><H3><I>HOW BUSH CAN PREVENT CREATION OF AN ASIAN ANTI-U.S. TRADE BLOC</I></H3>
<P>
By Richard D. Fisher<br>
Backgrounder Update #169<BR>
10/31/91  <BR>
(published at 2 pages)<BR>
(Updating Asian Studies Center Backgrounder No. 100, "America's Role
in Promoting Pacific Economic Cooperation," March 15, 1990.) <P>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>

      Among the most serious challenges now confronting the United
States in Asia is a growing debate among Asian states over whether to
form their own trade bloc to rival the European Community (EC) and the
emerging North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA). Such an Asian trade
zone is likely to reduce America's growing trade with Asia and fuel
greater protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Because of this, George
Bush should enunciate an American free trade vision for Asia. He can
do so at the next meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) group, which convenes in Seoul from
November 12 to 14.
<P>
      APEC was formed in 1989, at Australia's initiation, to lower
trade barriers in Asia. Seen as a complement to the broad-membership
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (known as GATT), APEC includes
the U.S., Australia, Brunei, Canada, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea,
Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. Hong
Kong, the People's Republic of China, and the Republic of China on
Taiwan will be admitted at the Seoul meeting; Mexico and the Russian
Republic are eager to join. 
<P>
      To date APEC has been long on ideals but short on substance. It
will not even have a permanent secretariat until after the Seoul
gathering. APEC thus has done little to foster free trade. APEC's
efforts mainly have been absorbed by its ten committees studying
cooperation in such fields as energy, investment, technology transfer,
and telecommunications. APEC's members, including the U.S., prefer to
allow the GATT to be the principal forum for reduction of trade
barriers. The problem with this approach was exposed by the breakdown
of the GATT's Uruguay Round over agricultural issues last November.
Since then some Asian states have been proposing trade arrangements
limited exclusively to Asian states. The most controversial is
Malaysia's proposal for an East Asian Economic Group (EAEG) that would
be led by Japan and keep out America. Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir bin Mohamad, the promoter of this idea, apparently wants to
reduce U.S. influence in Asia. Last September 30, during Japanese
Emperor Akihito's visit to Malaysia, Malaysian King Sultan Azlan Shah
suggested to Akihito that Japan lead the EAEG. 
<P>
      Public Coolness, Private Interest. So far EAEG has not received
much support; South Korea and the U.S., in fact, oppose it. Japanese
Prime Minister-designate Kiichi Miyazawa recently said he prefers
building closer economic ties with the U.S. to creating an EAEG. Tokyo
has been careful publicly to oppose the EAEG proposal in part to avoid
the impression it is seeking to revive its World War II goal of
imposing a Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere. Some Asian
countries that were once dominated by Japan, like Korea, see troubling
parallels between EAEG and the former Japanese empire. Despite Tokyo's
professed coolness to the EAEG, however, Japanese officials privately
have told The Heritage Foundation that there is unofficial Japanese
bureaucratic and business sector interest in the EAEG. These same
officials warn that interest in an EAEG-like group might increase if
the U.S.-Mexico-Canada NAFTA becomes a barrier to Japanese exports.
<P>
      Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and
Thailand, which are members of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations -- or ASEAN -- do not agree fully with Malaysia's EAEG trade
bloc proposal. The ASEAN states trade extensively with countries
outside what would be an EAEG bloc. Last year, for instance, ASEAN
members exported over $27 billion in goods to the U.S. During a
meeting of its trade ministers this October 7, ASEAN endorsed only the
formation of an EAEG "caucus." More important, they endorsed a Thai
proposal to form an ASEAN free trade area (FTA) to be phased in over
the next 15 years. This wisely aims to increase trade among ASEAN
members and may lead to free trade arrangements with other countries. 
<P>
      Anti-U.S. Barriers. Washington should try to prevent the
formation of an EAEG-like trade zone that would exclude America and
other non-Asian states. Such a zone could erect barriers to U.S.
exports and divert imports away from the U.S. This could hurt the U.S.
economy; with $339 billion in two-way trade last year, Asia was
America's largest trading partner, outstripping the $220 billion two-
way trade volume with Europe. Formation of an EAEG-like zone,
moreover, would give ammunition to opponents of free trade in the U.S.
Congress and would fan the American public's understandable fears that
Japan has begun seeking political muscle to match its economic
strength. 
<P>
      To head off an EAEG, the Bush Administration should formulate a
strategy to promote an Asian-American free trade regime. Such a
strategy should seek to spread the benefits of the NAFTA to Asia. This
would be a positive alternative to Malaysia's anti-American
initiative. Secretary of State James Baker will represent the U.S. at
the November APEC meeting. His strategy should include: 
<P>
      <UL>A clear statement directed at Asians that NAFTA will not mimic
      the European Community in erecting trade barriers. Instead,
      under NAFTA, Asians who invest in Mexico can take advantage of
      that country's lower labor costs and gain access to the U.S.
      market. The U.S. should offer to consider allowing Asian states
      to join NAFTA, as it now encourages Central and South American
      states to join. Asian membership in NAFTA would create the
      world's largest free trade zone, building greater momentum
      toward accomplishing the hobbled GATT's original purpose:
      complete freedom in international trade. 
<P>
      An unequivocal preference for APEC, over an EAEG-like forum, as
      the principal arena for encouraging trade in Asia. Washington,
      however, should make its support for a permanent APEC
      secretariat contingent upon APEC's stated willingness to work
      toward greater free trade. The U.S. should direct its funding
      for the secretariat only to programs that promote free trade,
      and should be ready to criticize APEC if it becomes another
      ponderous GATT-like bureaucracy.  
<P>
      Praise for the 1983 Closer Economic Relations agreement, a free
      trade area between Australia and New Zealand. This agreement has
      promoted such economic reforms as government deregulation and
      lower trade barriers, which, in turn, have increased trade and
      foreign investment opportunities in both countries. The U.S.
      also should praise ASEAN's recent agreement to form a free trade
      area. As a precursor to an APEC-NAFTA free trade area,
      Washington should consider an ASEAN-NAFTA free trade area.

</UL>
<P>
      Positive Suggestion. The U.S. should respond positively to New
Zealand Prime Minister Jim Bolger's suggestion this October 4 that New
Zealand consider joining with the U.S., Canada, and Mexico in NAFTA.
As a first step, the U.S. should propose to start negotiating with New
Zealand for a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement, similar to
that the U.S. this October 11 signed with Singapore. This agreement
sets common principles to govern trade and investment and settle trade
disputes. It may well lead to a U.S.-Singapore FTA, and be a model for
the process of arranging free accords with Manila, Seoul, and Taipei.
And, the U.S. should back Mexico's request to join APEC, to bring
another free trade ally into that body.
<P>
      The Bush Administration now must formulate a free trade strategy
for Asia. Such a strategy is needed to preempt moves by some Asian
states to form a trade bloc that would exclude the U.S. By promoting a
free trade alternative that seeks to spread the benefits of the U.S.-
Mexico-Canada NAFTA, Bush can help ensure that Asia continues to play
a greater role in America's economic growth.

<title>THE U.S. STILL NEEDS MILITARY BASES IN PANAMA -- Heritage </title>

<center><h3><I> THE U.S. STILL NEEDS MILITARY BASES IN PANAMA</h3></I>
<P>
By John J. Tierney, Jr.<br>
Visiting Fellow<br>
Executive Memorandum #426<br>
August 21, 1995<br> 
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%><p> </center>

	On March 29, 1995, the Clinton Administration announced the transfer of America's military headquarters in Latin America, Southern Command, from Panama to Miami, Florida. This decision fulfills the 1977 Panama Canal Treaty's commitment that all U.S. troops be evacuated by December 31, 1999. It also reflects the Clinton Administration's view that the Canal can be defended without the presence of U.S. forces in Panama.
<p>
This viewpoint is mistaken. President Clinton's decision could lead to the permanent loss of valuable military assets and seriously weaken America's ability to defend the Panama Canal. The treaties with Panama give the U.S. the option of continuing a military presence in Panama after 2000. This option should be exercised.
<p>
	The 104th Congress could force a reconsideration of President Clinton's decision by passing a sense of the Congress resolution that the U.S. needs to retain a military presence in Panama after 2000. Such a resolution, while non-binding, would urge the Administration to negotiate an extension of base rights in at least some of the 14 U.S. military installations in Panama, helping to ensure a measure of power projection capability in an area of vital national interest to the United States.
<p>
<b>U.S. Treaty Rights</b>
<p>	Under the terms of the 1977 Panama Canal Treaty, the United States must evacuate its troops from Panama by December 31, 1999. Under the companion Treaty of Permanent Neutrality, which becomes effective when the Canal Treaty expires, the U.S. retains the right to protect and defend the Canal after 2000. The U.S. instrument of ratification accompanying the Neutrality Treaty allows both sides to negotiate an extension of the agreement giving the U.S. the right to station troops in Panama and enjoy basing rights there. The government of Panama agreed to these terms. Thus, both countries agreed explicitly to the right of U.S. forces to remain in the Canal Zone after 2000.
<p>
	The extension of U.S. base rights also is consistent with the intent of Congress. The 1979 Panama Canal Act, which incorporated the treaty into U.S. law, included a sense of the Congress resolution that the "best interests of the United States require that the President enter into negotiations with the Republic of Panama for the purpose of arranging for the stationing of United States military forces after the termination of the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977."
<p>

<b>The Need for a U.S. Presence</b>
<p>
	Southern Command, with a current strength of 8,800 troops, has been based in Panama since World War II. It coordinates all military and anti-drug operations in Latin America and is responsible for protecting the Panama Canal. Although the traditional threat of a foreign naval attack on the Canal Zone has virtually disappeared, the United States still needs to be able to project military power in the Southern Hemisphere. The worldwide upsurge in political instability and state-supported terrorism that has followed the end of the Cold War makes it necessary to provide rapid troop and logistical transit between the oceans. The need to conduct surveillance or to pursue actual and potential adversaries also requires immediate access to both oceans. Such possibilities make it essential that the U.S. retain a measure of conventional military power in the Isthmus of Panama.
<p>
	There are other reasons for the U.S. to retain a military presence in Panama:
<p>
*<b>	Efficiency and low cost.</b> The U.S. conducts a number of important non-military missions, including humanitarian and civil-military programs, throughout Latin America. These missions would benefit materially from the lower transport costs and greater efficiency afforded by centralized logistics bases inside Panama, especially Fort Kobbe, where the Theater Equipment and Maintenance Site (TEAMS) is located. This facility supports disaster relief missions and other civic and humanitarian services.
<p>
*	<b>Intelligence and counter-drug operations.</b> Panama is located in the center of a major drug transit area. U.S. facilities there are well-situated for collecting intelligence on drug trafficking and for supporting interdiction efforts. Anti-drug operations will remain a critical feature of U.S. policy in Latin America. The secure airport at Howard Air Force Base is available for logistical infrastructure and support for airborne operations. Other facilities in Panama, especially the electronic capabilities at Galeta Island, give the U.S. a unique capability to conduct surveillance of maritime traffic, drug smuggling, and potential terrorist activities in the region.
<p>
*	<b>Unique training facilities.</b> The Jungle Operations Training Center at Fort Sherman provides unrivaled facilities for training in low-intensity warfare, and the adjacent naval base provides training for small craft navigation. Assistant Secretary of Defense Frederick C. Smith has stated that these sites "will be difficult to replicate elsewhere."
<p>
*	<b>Panamanian public opinion.</b> Polls taken in Panama over a period of years indicate strong and consistent pluralities in favor of a continued U.S. presence after 2000. As the staff of the House Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere reported on March 9, 1995, "Recent public opinion polls in Panama suggest that 82% to 83% of Panamanians would like the United States to keep some sort of military presence in Panama."
<p>

<b>Time Is Running Out</b>
<p>	While the expiration date for the Panama Canal Treaty is over four years away, there is not much time to plan and negotiate for a continued U.S. military presence. 
<p>
	A sense of the Congress resolution urging the President to negotiate a new base rights agreement with Panama has been introduced in the Senate by Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms (R-NC). Such a new agreement would take effect immediately after the Panama Canal Treaty expires on December 31, 1999.
<p>
	In any such resolution, however, Congress must bear in mind three principles:
<ol>
<li> The U.S., not Panama, should initiate negotiations.
<p>
<li> An agreement should have the status of a business arrangement between equals. Panama would be the owner-landlord, the U.S. a tenant-operator. <p>

<li> Not all 14 U.S. military installations in Panama need be retained. Most of these bases can be turned over to Panama. Among the most important to retain would be Howard Air Force Base, Fort Sherman, Fort Kobbe, Galeta Island, and Rodman Naval Station.<p>
</ol><p>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>	The end of the Cold War has led to a U.S. withdrawal from many foreign bases, particularly those that are no longer needed. Certain bases in the Isthmus of Panama, however, continue to serve America's interests. The decision to move the headquarters of Southern Command to Miami is irrevocable, but the decision on whether to withdraw all military facilities from Panama is still open. Retaining these bases would be a statement that the United States remains determined to safeguard its interests in the region. Congress should press the Administration to maintain a U.S. military presence in Panama.

<title>Who's Who in the 1995 Russian Elections -- Heritage</title>

F.YI. No. 74<br>

December 4, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
On December 17, 1995, over 100,000,000 Russians are expected to go to the polls and vote for 450 members of the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, or Federal Assembly. Half the members will be elected from winner-take-all single-mandate electoral districts.<sup>1</sup>  The other half will be elected from party lists in proportion to their total national vote, with 5 percent the minimum threshold for party representation. <p>Under the Russian constitution, the State Duma's power is limited in favor of the presidency. The Duma, therefore, has little say in formulating government policy. However, the upcoming election will reveal the balance of political forces in Russia, and its results will be difficult for President Boris Yeltsin and his administration to ignore. Moreover, some Russian experts view the parliamentary elections as a primary that will indicate popular support for candidates in the presidential election planned for June 1996. The Duma elections undoubtedly will have a significant impact on Russian policy, both foreign and domestic. 
<p>
According to the Russian Justice Ministry, 262 political parties have been registered, and by the end of September 1995, 63 electoral blocs and alliances had been recorded by the Central Electoral Commission. A large majority of the parties running for the State Duma are tiny, with no solid base of national support. By October 22, 1995, only 42 had managed to submit the 200,000 supporter signatures required in order to begin their electoral campaigns. Approximately 5,500 candidates are on the party lists, and 2,691 are running in the single-mandate constituencies.
<p>
Despite the number of parties in this race, the Russian public is largely indifferent. Feeling deceived by the politicians, people are disillusioned and openly skeptical about the value of the elections. Few voters study and compare party platforms, much less attend political rallies. Polls show that people would rather vote for well-known personalities, such as movie actors, military figures, and cultural icons. Almost all parties have such luminaries among the top three names on the party lists. In the top twelve electoral blocs alone, there are three actors and four generals.
<p>
Opinion polls also show that less than 39 percent of young people (ages 18-24) are going to vote, versus 71 percent in the 67-89 age group. The great strength of the communists is that their voters (primarily age 55 and older) have a high turnout rate. The Communist Party is highly motivated to return to power now, before its electoral base vanishes. With economic issues and populist and nationalist slogans dominating the rhetoric, and only a 25 percent turnout required, it is little wonder that the election results may favor the nationalist and leftist parties. 
<p>
Based on the latest public opinion polls, the expected results for those on the party lists are as follows:<P>
<ul>
<li> Communists, 10-15 percent;
<p>
<li> <i>Yabloko</i>, 10 percent;
<p>
<li> Women of Russia, 10 percent;
<p>
<li> Agrarian Party, 7-10 percent;
<p>
<li> Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (Zhirinovsky), 7 percent;
<p>
<li> Russia's Democratic Choice, 5-7 percent;
<p>
<li> Congress of Russian Communities--KRO (Lebed, Skokov), 5-7 percent.
</ul><p>

<b>PARTIES, PERSONALITIES, AND PROGRAMS</b>
<p>
What follows is a sketch of the main contenders in the coming electoral race. As the field is crowded, only those parties which currently appear most likely to exceed the 5 percent threshold of the national vote, or which have platforms of particular interest, are discussed.
<p>

<b>Russia's Democratic Choice-United Democrats</b>
<P>
Forecasts predict that Russia's Democratic Choice could get from 5 to 7 percent of the votes in December. This bloc strongly advocates freedom and democracy, private property, free-market economics, the rule of law, anti-inflationary and stabilization measures, and democratic military reform. Although it opposes Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's view that "the stage of liberal reforms is over," Russia's Democratic Choice generally supports the economic policies of the government.
<p>
Former First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar, who heads the party in the Duma, is this bloc's leader. Internationally known human rights advocate Sergei Kovalev is in second place on the party's electoral list. Lydia Fedoseyeva-Shukshina, widow of writer and actor Vassily Shukshin, is in third place. The bloc includes a number of different parties:  Gaidar's Russia's Choice, with its nearly 60 regional chapters throughout Russia; the Social Democracy Party headed by Mikhail Gorbachev's chief ideologist, Alexander N. Yakovlev; and the Peasants' Party led by Federation Council (upper chamber of parliament) member Yuri Chernichenko. 
<p>
Russia's Democratic Choice finds itself in a difficult situation. The left-wing and nationalist opposition, as well as some government officials, attributes all failures of the reforms to Gaidar and his party. Gaidar has never openly distanced himself from the errors made by his government or by his successor, current Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin. Now his unwillingness to attack the government could cost him votes. His supporters are mainly young and middle-aged intellectuals and businessmen who have become unhappy with the government's overregulation and inability to protect them from crime and corruption. 
<p>

<b>Forward, Russia</b>
<p>
Duma member and former Finance Minister Boris Fedorov is first on the party list of Forward, Russia. Second comes Bella Denisenko, formerly a Russia's Choice activist and Deputy Health Minister, followed by Alexander Vladislavlev, a technocrat and former vice president of the centrist Civic Union under Arkady Volsky in 1993. Until he was removed recently by stockholders, Vladislavlev was the CEO of Moscow's failing ZIL automotive plant.
<P>
Fedorov is a constant critic of the government. He opposes new International Monetary Fund loans and credits to Russia, fearing that they will only increase Russia's already very high foreign debt. He favors tax reform, including a reduction in the tax burden, deep cuts in government spending, and downsizing of the federal bureaucracy. Private land ownership is one of Forward, Russia's top priorities.
<p>
Fedorov's stand on expanding NATO to include Eastern European countries such as Poland and Hungary is unique. He insists that Russia should announce its intention to join NATO because the West's response would indicate its true attitude. He also feels that NATO membership is needed to strengthen Russian democracy. Nevertheless, he is strongly opposed to the expansion of NATO without Russia.
<p>
Fedorov's movement is an "inside-the-Beltway" phenomenon, with little support in the Russian regions (<i>oblasts</i>). Some members have left and joined Chernomyrdin's pro-government Our Home Is Russia party. Fedorov lacks a team of prominent politicians and public personalities to ensure name recognition for his movement. The expectation is that he will find it difficult to attain the 5 percent of national votes required to attain seats in the Duma, although he is campaigning aggressively. 
<p>

<b><i>Yabloko</i> (Apple) </b>
<p>
The <i>Yabloko</i> bloc is named for its three founders:  Grigory Yavlinsky, Yuri Boldyrev, and Vladimir Lukin. In the fall of 1995 Boldyrev dropped out because of political differences with Yavlinsky and other members of the bloc. The <i>Yabloko</i> list today includes Duma Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Vladimir Lukin2 in second place, with Duma member Tatiana Yarygina in the number three slot. <p>The <i>Yabloko</i> bloc is headed by Grigory Yavlinsky. A relatively young, energetic, and extremely ambitious political contender, Yavlinsky is the most popular politician in Russia. His sole rival is General Alexander Lebed of the Congress of Russian Communities (KRO) movement. Unlike Gaidar and Fedorov, Yavlinsky was never a member of the reformist government which imposed so many unpopular measures on the population, and he never fails to criticize the government and its errors. His name is associated with the famous "500 Days" program of radical reform which was shelved by Gorbachev in 1990 under pressure from the orthodox communists. Because of this, Yavlinsky enjoys the image of a prophet shunned by his country. 
<p>
Yavlinsky claims that his party represents the interests of the middle class -- engineers, scientists, teachers, and qualified workers. These social strata have been losers under the reforms. His political platform is a combination of center-right and social-democratic slogans. On the one hand, he calls for private property and the protection of individuals against bureaucratic rule. On the other hand, he insists on increased government involvement in education and health. 
<p>
<i>Yabloko</i> committed some minor violations of the complicated regulations when submitting the party list to the Central Electoral Commission (as did many other electoral blocs) and was denied registration in November 1995. The case went to the Supreme Court, and the Commission's decision was reversed one week later, but not before the uproar had generated a great deal of publicity in <i>Yabloko</i>'s favor. Partly because of this publicity, the party's chances for success are high:  It could be the only democratic party to draw support in low double-digit figures. The question is how disciplined its voters will be on election day. In some single-mandate constituencies, other democratic parties have withdrawn their candidates in favor of <i>Yabloko</i> nominees.
<p>

<b>Democratic Russia-Free Trade Unions</b>
<p>
The Democratic Russia bloc was formed on the basis of Russia's oldest democratic organization, which emerged as an anti-Soviet and anti-communist entity in 1990. Its co-chairmen are Galina Starovoitova, former advisor to President Yeltsin, and Duma members Lev Ponomarev and Father Gleb Yakunin. Democratic Russia used to be part of Russia's Choice but left because of Gaidar's loyalty to the government. The party remains a stronghold of anti-communist and anti-totalitarian politicians, most of whom suffered during the Soviet regime as dissidents or prisoners of conscience.
<P>
Having failed to reach an electoral agreement with Yavlinsky or Gaidar, Democratic Russia is united in the campaign with the Russian Labor Confederation, which includes a dozen free trade unions and the Shield Military Union. The latter opposes the Defense Ministry's failing policies. The main objective of the bloc is "to awaken the electorate disillusioned by bureaucracy."  Its electoral campaign will focus on criticizing the neo-communist <i>nomenklatura</i> and its anti-popular economic policies and corruption. 
<p>
Democratic Russia ran into difficulties registering with the Central Electoral Commission and withdrew in the fall of 1995. On the national lists, the party has chosen to support <i>Yabloko</i>, but its leaders intend to run independently in the single-mandate constituencies.
<p>

<b>Economic Freedom Party</b>
<p>
Led by Konstantin Borovoy, one of the best-known entrepreneurs in Russia, this party's platform is based on the slogan "protecting investors' rights."  The party consistently champions free-market economics and deregulation and is openly anti-government. The Moscow regional list is headed by libertarian dissident Valeria Novodvorskaya, who was involved in anti-government activities in the former Soviet Union and was the only dissident detained during the "liberal" Gorbachev era. Borovoy's and Novodvorskaya's behavior and declarations, such as calling the current Russian government "fascist," often shock the public. Because it is primarily Moscow-based and has little support nationally, the Economic Freedom Party is unlikely to surpass the 5 percent threshold.
<p>

<b>CENTRIST PARTIES AND BLOCS</b>
<p>
<b>Our Home Is Russia (<i>Nash Dom Rossiya</i> -- NDR)</b>
<p> 
This bloc, headed by Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin, was created on Yeltsin's initiative to provide an alternative to extremist forces on the left and right. It represents the interests of the post-Soviet <i>nomenklatura</i>, which is working to retain its political power and acquire wealth through privatization. Our Home Is Russia essentially represents Russia's current status quo and has much to lose if defeated. Virtually all government resources are at its disposal, and most ministers and local governors are members. 
<p>
This bloc favors further reforms but fails to follow a truly democratic pattern. Chernomyrdin openly advocates "strengthening the role of the government in the regulation of all spheres of Russian life."  He also suggests that the government tackle social problems. The NDR is determined to "fight the forces striving to undermine the constitutional basis of the state, abolish the presidency and redistribute property."
<p>
Chernomyrdin has chosen Nikita Mikhalkov, a popular movie actor, as number two on the NDR list. Number three is General Lev Rokhlin, commander of the Russian forces that captured Grozny, the capital of Chechnya, in February 1995. NDR lists are being formed in all of Russia's 89 regions. The government-run media are singing its praises, and the massive campaign is yielding results. Though formed only recently, the NDR is fourth in the polls at 12-15 percent, following the communists, <i>Yabloko</i>, and Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democrats.
<p>
The government is already taking costly populist steps, including wage hikes, subsidy increases, and unrestrained lending, to solidify the NDR's position for the upcoming elections. The party is gambling that the inevitable inflation caused by these measures will set in only after the elections.
<p>

<b>Ivan Rybkin's Electoral Bloc</b>
<p>
This bloc is headed by and named for Ivan Rybkin, Speaker of the State Duma and former head of the pro-Communist Agrarian Party (profiled below). Currently led by Ivan Lapshin, the Agrarians favor a strong state role in agriculture. Rybkin's bloc emerged as part of Yeltsin's attempt to create two broad, centrist parties within the existing establishment, one of which (the NDR) would be pro-government and the other of which would play the part of "loyal opposition."  However, it did not take long for federal and local officials and bureaucrats to grasp the advantages of Chernomyrdin's NDR. Therefore, most of them joined the NDR instead of Rybkin's bloc. Moreover, Rybkin's failure to be sufficiently critical of government policy cost him the support of his own Agrarian Party. 
<p>
Two small parties that had joined the bloc initially -- the United Industrial Party and the Federation of Independent Trade Unions -- left to run an independent campaign. Three top figures on Rybkin's initial party list -- Afghan War hero and former Deputy Defense Minister General Boris Gromov, well-known economist Stanislav Shatalin, and a popular singer named Yosif Kobzon -- also defected because of Rybkin's failure to oppose the government. 
<p>
Rybkin's platform is not captivating the electorate. It calls for social justice, law, order, creativity, and realism, mirroring the slogans of the NDR. However, Rybkin's charisma and perceived common sense could still attract the electorate to vote for him personally. His standing has been improving, partly because of mistakes by his opponents and partly because of his increased criticism of the government. However, despite recent gains, the question of whether Rybkin can make the 5 percent threshold remains open.
<p>

<b>THE LEFT</b>
<p>
<b>Communist Party of the Russian Federation</b>
<p>
The Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF), headed by longtime Soviet Communist Party <i>apparatchik</i> Gennady Zyuganov, is one of the major anti-reformist forces in Russia. Its constituency is largely seniors who have suffered moral, political, and economic loss during the reform period. Their strong nostalgic sentiment and the lack of apparent prospects for a better future make them an active and well-organized force in contrast to the comparatively passive and irresolute democrats.
<p>
True to form, the communists are experts in manipulating public discontent with reform. They exaggerate the hardships, focus on the "humiliation of the nation," and predict "the extinction of the population."  The party platform calls for the de-nationalization of private property, direct government regulation of the economy, and restoration of the Soviet political system. It also advocates restoration of the Soviet Union and confrontation with the capitalist West. This movement undoubtedly represents an open threat to the nascent democracy in Russia, and even partial implementation of its goals could unleash social conflict. Few believe that the communists will fully re-nationalize the already privatized industries, but their effort to redistribute wealth could destabilize the political and economic situation.
<p>
Zyuganov's main partners in the CPRF are Svetlana Goryacheva, Yeltsin's bellicose opponent in the former Russian Supreme Soviet, and Aman Tuleyev, a regional boss from Kemerovo and Yeltsin's opponent in the 1991 presidential election. Among other well-known figures on the list are August 1991 coup leaders Anatoly Lukyanov, the former USSR Supreme Soviet Speaker, and Victor Ilyukhin, Chairman of the Duma Security Committee and a former prosecutor who once charged Mikhail Gorbachev with "high treason" for dismantling the Soviet state.
<p>

<b>Other Communist Groups</b>
<p>
The CPRF is not the only communist organization running for the Duma. Others have coalesced into a radical communist bloc called Communists-Working Russia-for the Soviet Union, which expects to attract voters positioned to the left of Zyuganov and pledges an even stronger commitment to restoring the communist system. Zyuganov is not expected to carry large cities like Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Ekaterinburg because of strong support for reformers in these cities. However, the CPRF should enjoy greater support in smaller cities and towns in the so-called red belt south and east of Moscow. The nationwide network of local party chapters which remained virtually intact after the collapse of the CPSU constitutes an unsurpassed political machine. This represents a significant electoral advantage for the communists, who are expected to get up to 15 percent of the vote.
<p>

<b>Agrarian Party</b>
<p>
The Agrarian Party is headed by Ivan Lapshin, Chairman of its Duma faction and director of the Lenin's Legacy state farm (<i>sovkhoz</i>) on the outskirts of Moscow. The party's political slogans and electoral base are much the same as those of the communists:  pensioners, state farm managers and workers, and members of collective farms. Since agricultural reform has been slow and timid, the system remains essentially as it was under the totalitarian regime:  dominated by all-powerful collective farm chairmen at the expense of poor peasants. Most collective farms supposedly have been reshaped into "joint-stock companies," but these companies are a fiction. In fact, there is virtually no private farmland, and the few private farmers that exist are harassed and persecuted by the rural communist networks.
<p>
The Agrarians criticize the present regime as "anti-popular, anti-national and anti-peasant."  Granting people private ownership of land is, in Lapshin's words, "a diabolic enterprise which will ruin the social and economic stability of the country."  Regarding the communists as their closest allies, the Agrarians also call for restoring the power of the Soviets and restoring the USSR. In addition, they demand that the agrarian sector be made a top priority in national economic policy. 
<p>
The party's electoral list is one of the largest in Russia:  437 names, of which 270 are on the federal list and 167 intend to run in single-mandate constituencies. The Agrarians have a stable electorate in the countryside which is easily controlled. A local Agrarian boss can make life unbearable for those who dare challenge the party in the elections. Thus, a 5 percent vote is virtually guaranteed. However, the party has a much slimmer chance in the cities, where nearly 70 percent of the Russian population lives. All in all, the Agrarians could gather up to 10 percent of the votes in the Duma elections.

<p>
<b>THE NATIONALISTS</b>
<p>
Russian nationalist parties that favor a strong state and a return to an imperialist system occupy a broad space in the political spectrum.
<p>
<b>Liberal Democratic Party of Russia</b>
<p>
The Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) is headed by Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the party's Duma faction and a lawyer with strong intelligence community connections. The LDPR's platform is based largely on the ideas of Russian chauvinism, which have become widespread in the wake of the Soviet breakup. Zhirinovsky manipulates the Russian people by evoking xenophobic sentiment, anti-Semitism, and racial hatred for non-Russians such as Azerbaijanis, Chechens, and Uzbeks. His electorate is comprised of those unable to advance either in the old Soviet Union or under the current system:  the unemployed, unqualified workers, and retired and acting military officers. Zhirinovsky also attracts the rank and file in the armed forces, members of the military-industrial complex, and elements of the Russian "mafiya" who applaud his anti-Western declarations and defiance.
<p>
Though Zhirinovsky is not opposed to private property in principle, some redistribution in favor of his supporters undoubtedly would take place if he came to power. Therefore, some influential economic forces in the country, anxious to capitalize on this redistribution, covertly support the LDPR while openly supporting other parties. Fearing expropriation, many Russian businessmen wish to "diversify the risk" of doing business in Russia.
<p>
Zhirinovsky's popularity, however, is faltering. Some of his slogans and rhetoric have been taken up by the present government and by his nationalist competitors. His electorate is unpredictable, although he could still do well among soldiers who vote under the tight control of the many officers who share Zhirinovsky's views. Since the nationalist leader supports increases in the defense budget, the Army continuously flirts with him; Defense Minister Pavel Grachev even promoted him to Lieutenant-Colonel in the reserves -- two ranks higher than the rank of captain he used to hold.
<p>
The LDPR will easily make the 5 percent level, but it will not get the 30 percent which Zhirinovsky has predicted. A more likely figure is 7 percent. If he gets over 15 percent, Zhirinovsky will likely throw his hat into the ring in next June's presidential election.
<p>

<b>Congress of Russian Communities (KRO)</b>
<p>
The Congress of Russian Communities is headed by Yuri Skokov, former Yeltsin ally, former National Security Council Secretary, and a military-industrial chieftain. However, Skokov is not the most popular and charismatic figure in the KRO. Much more popular is retired General Alexander Lebed, former commanding officer of the 14th Army and number two on the party list. Lebed was the most popular Russian politician during the summer months.<sup>3</sup>  The third spot, behind Lebed and Skokov, is occupied by Sergei Glaziev, an archopponent of the current regime and protectionist foe of free-market reforms who advocates stronger government involvement in the economy.<p>The Congress of Russian Communities calls for countering centrifugal and separatist trends in Russia and for protecting the Russian minorities in the so-called Near Abroad. However, its support base seems to be more concentrated abroad than in Russia proper. Skokov, an uncharismatic Soviet-era technocrat, is not very popular. His support comes mainly from the ranks of the military. Lebed presents himself as an honest man with a "law and order" message, but many intellectuals abhor his rude manners. Both Skokov and Lebed, however, could rally the support of rank-and-file officers and the military-industrial complex. It is expected that the Congress of Russian Communities will make 5 percent in the elections.
<p>
<b><i>Derzhava</i> (Great Power) Movement</b>
<p>
The Congress of Russian Communities is being challenged by the <i>Derzhava</i> (Great Power) Movement headed by Alexander Rutskoy, former deputy to Yeltsin and one of the October 1993 mutiny leaders. Rutskoy can expect some support from the officer corps since he is a veteran and an Afghan War hero. Evoking memories of Russia's imperial and religious past, he calls for "a restoration of Holy Russia as a Unitarian state in its natural borders," implying the pre-World War I borders of czarist Russia. 
<p>
Rutskoy accepted two defectors from Zhirinovsky's party and found them places on his own list. His number two man, chief campaign organizer Victor Kobelev, is one of these. Third on the list is Konstantin Dushenov, former spokesman for the famous ultra-nationalist Bishop Ioann (John) of Kronstadt and the Ladoga, in the St. Petersburg region. To boost fund-raising, Rutskoy also has put some "New Russian" businessmen on his party list. This policy evoked a wave of protests from veterans of the nationalist movement, who accused Rutskoy of staging an "anti-patriotic coup" and of turning the party into a "social-criminal movement."  Their subsequent withdrawal from the party left Rutskoy weakened. 
<p>
Like <i>Yabloko, Derzhava</i> was denied registration by the Central Electoral Commission, but the Supreme Court has overturned that ruling. Rutskoy's group is among those that are unlikely to clear the 5 percent hurdle.
<p>

<b>Union of Patriots</b>
<p>
Another nationalist bloc with the slogan of "protecting the Russian man" is the Union of Patriots. Formed on the basis of the Russian National <i>Sobor</i> (Union) organization and headed by ex-KGB General Alexander Sterligov, this bloc also includes two of the August 1991 coup instigators, industrial manager Alexander Tizyakov and Army General Valentin Varennikov. Russian National <i>Sobor</i> supporters include devout Russian Orthodox believers and paramilitary Cossacks, as well as the military-industrial complex. The bloc probably will not achieve the 5 percent threshold.
<p>

<b>For the Motherland</b>
<p>
Nationalist-oriented Afghan War veterans and some trade unions are backing yet another nationalist opposition bloc, For the Motherland, headed by Vladimir Polevanov. Vice-premier and Privatization Minister for Yeltsin for six months in 1994-1995, Polevanov was dismissed for opposing the government's privatization policy. Second in the party ranks is Commander in Chief of Airborne Troops Evgueni Podkolzin, who enjoys the respect of the military and has criticized the Defense Ministry for its poor handling of the Chechen campaign. Famous ice-hockey goal-keeper Vladislav Tretyak is also high on the party list, but his presence is unlikely to give For the Motherland the capacity to surmount the 5 percent hurdle.

<p>
<b>SPECIAL-INTEREST ELECTORAL BLOCS</b>
<p>

<b>Women of Russia</b>
<p>
The Women of Russia movement is headed by Alevtina Fedulova, Deputy Speaker of the current Duma, longtime communist, and <i>Komsomol</i> (Young Communist League) <i>apparatchik</i>; Yekaterina Lakhova, leader of the party's faction in the Duma and advisor to the president on family issues; and Galina Klimantova, chairman of the Duma Women, Family and Youth Issues Committee. The movement claims to represent specific women's interests, focusing on welfare issues, improving women's social status, and anti-discriminatory employment measures. Such slogans are likely to attract some of the female electorate and may give the movement the 5 percent of votes it needs to get into the Duma. 
<P>
On many economic and political issues, Women of Russia is close to the communists and Agrarians. However, its voting record in the Duma has not been as close to that of the communists as many had expected. The movement has about 80 candidates on the federal list and over 20 in the single-mandate districts.
<p>

<b>Environmental Protection Party of Russia</b>
<p>
The Environmental Protection Party of Russia (KEDR/Cedar) is an ecological movement. Popular TV anchorman Leonid Yakubovich, prominent businessman Artem Tarasov, writer and <i>Novy Mir</i> literary journal chief editor Sergei Zalygin, and cosmonaut Musa Manarov top the party's list. KEDR/Cedar unites 40 environmental movements and has 224 candidates on its federal list and 115 in the single-mandate districts. However, its chances to make the 5 percent threshold are slim.
<p>

<b>Trade Unions and Industrialists of Russia-Union of Labor</b>
<p>
Trade Unions and Industrialists of Russia-Union of Labor was formed by former components of the Rybkin bloc -- the Russian United Industrial Party of Vladimir Shcherbakov, Mikhail Shmakov's Federation of Independent Trade Unions, and Arkady Volsky's Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. This group pledges to "revive domestic industries, insure high employment, obey the law, ease ethnic tensions and revitalize the Russian state."  Similar to Volsky's Civic Union back in the 1993 elections, however, it is not likely to make the 5 percent threshold.
<p>
<b>Others</b>
<p>
Electoral blocs based on specific interests include such associations as the Beer Lovers' Party, Christian-Democratic Union-Russian Christians, the Protection of the Disabled Party, the Lawyers' Association, the Pensioner Protection Party and its bloc, and the "Nur" Moslem Movement. Although each of these parties succeeded in obtaining the 200,000 signatures needed to begin a campaign, the 5 percent threshold may be an insurmountable barrier. Their expectations probably can be realized only in single-mandate constituencies where some of their famous leaders are candidates.
<p>
The role of the military in the upcoming election deserves special attention. Although the armed forces cannot submit a party list, there are over 100 active duty officers on various party lists and running in single-mandate constituencies. Defense Minister Grachev has openly encouraged the political involvement of the officer corps, including running for office in uniform, in the hope they will lobby for military interests in the new Duma. Grachev put his Deputy Chief of the General Staff, three-star Colonel-General Anatoly Bogdanov, in charge of this operation. Some military units reportedly have deployed their own TV studios to advertise their commanders' campaigns.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
With the exception of the communists, no electoral bloc will win more than 10-12 percent of the Duma seats. Presidential analyst Marc Urnov forecasts that only the Communist Party, the Agrarians, Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democrats, <I>Yabloko</i>, Our Home Is Russia, and the Congress of Russian Communities will be able to clear the 5 percent hurdle. The Duma will be split into a multitude of minor factions cooperating or confronting each other on each individual issue.
<p>
<b>Ascendancy of the Nationalists and Leftists.</b>  A shift toward the leftist and nationalist parties is widely predicted. A pronounced nationalist-leftist orientation in the Duma could trigger attempts to revise the existing constitution. The Duma may wish to curtail the powers of the president and enhance its own. Under these circumstances, the president would likely veto almost all laws passed by the Duma. (So far, only 20 percent of passed legislation has been rejected.) The upshot would be a return to the confrontation and crisis that resulted in the storming of the old Russian Parliament in 1993.
<p>
<b>Unpleasant Surprises.</b> Particularly dangerous is the possibility of increased criminal power in the Duma. According to some estimates by the Interior Ministry, 25 to 30 percent of the newly elected members will be influenced by criminal organizations, either openly or covertly. If true, these delegates would use their power to entrench criminal groups even further in Russian society. These corrupt deputies could become a ruling majority in the Duma regardless of party affiliation.
<P>
The possibility of postponement or annulment of the election by the president cannot be excluded. A violent extremist action could serve as the pretext for such action. Certain forces in Yeltsin's inner circle are determined to preserve their own position by preventing a new Duma from coming to power. A low turnout at the elections (less than 25 percent of eligible voters) also might provide a legal basis for declaring the December elections invalid and governing without the Duma. 
<p>
As the elections draw near, attempts on the part of potential losers to delay them or change the rules of the game are becoming more pronounced. Loopholes in the electoral legislation are the main pretext for such disruptions. For example, a large group of Duma deputies has requested the Constitutional Court to examine the 5 percent threshold rule and other issues, but were rebuffed by the Court. All major parties oppose any last-minute revision of the electoral legislation and are very much against postponing the elections. 
<p>
Technical issues, such as where a party is placed on the ballot, are also important. The drawing of lots which took place November 10, 1995, for example, gave first place to Women of Russia and second to Rutskoy's <i>Derzhava</i>. This puts them at an advantage, as most people tend to vote for familiar candidates whose name first meets the eye.
<p>
The United States has little ability to influence the outcome of this election. Nevertheless, the American government, including Congress, should continue sending a clear message to the Russian political elite and public that it supports Russia's advance to democracy and a free-market economy. The U.S. also should make it clear that a significant communist or nationalist gain could undermine the progress of reform in Russia and imperil international stability and security. To assuage some Russian fears, the U.S. should emphasize once again that potential NATO expansion is targeted not against Russia or its people, but against extremist forces that could usurp power. 
<P>
Observers should watch for fraud and doctoring of election results. American and other Western observers might contribute by helping to ensure fair play. However, some Russian experts believe that Western observers could be duped into endorsing a "stolen" election. Observers will be concentrated mainly in the big cities, where public opinion tends to be democratically oriented and fraud would be opposed. Meanwhile, villages and small towns, where it is easier to tamper with ballots, will not be watched closely by outsiders. It is no accident that the communists, the Agrarians, and Zhirinovsky's faction blocked the Duma's adoption of a bill on public supervision of the elections. Major fraud also could be committed not at polling stations, but later, when the votes are being counted.
<P>
Whatever occurs at the polls in Russia in December, one thing is certain:  These elections are a critical test for Russian democracy. They also are a dress rehearsal for the even more important presidential elections which will take place in Russia in June.

<h3><I><center>CARTER CENTER REPORT DISAVOWS HAITI'S "RESTORATION" OF DEMOCRACY
</h3></i>
By John J. Tierney, Jr.<br>
Visiting Fellow, The Heritage Foundation<br>
F.Y.I.#60<br>
August 15, 1995<br>
</center><p>
<hr size=3 width=50%>
<p>
	Opposition to the Clinton Administration's boldest foreign policy initiative, the intervention in Haiti, has come full circle with the defection of former President Jimmy Carter as an uncritical supporter of Clinton's effort to "restore" democracy to Haiti. It was Carter himself who led the diplomatic team last September that prepared the way for the return of ousted president Jean-Bertrand Aristide and the removal of the military junta which had replaced him in 1991. Without Carter's participation, it is doubtful that the operation would have succeeded without bloodshed or that the intervention would have been supported by the American people.
<p>
	Now Carter and his staff at the Atlanta-based Carter Center have issued a devastating critique of the political process Aristide has produced in Haiti, particularly the June 25 elections which resulted in a pro-Aristide sweep of local and parliamentary seats. The report, written by Carter confidant and former National Security Council advisor Robert Pastor, amounts to a complete denial of the electoral process's legitimacy. By exposing the true nature of Aristide's one-party ("Lavalas") rule in Haiti, including its widespread corruption, mismanagement, and manipulation of the balloting, the Carter Center (albeit belatedly) has joined other critics of the Clinton Administration's endorsement of Aristide's left-wing dictatorship.
<p>

<b>CARTER'S TURNAROUND</b>
<P>
	Carter's critique of Haiti's democratic progress under Aristide is even more startling when one considers the long political association between the two. When Aristide won Haiti's 1990 presidential election, the Carter Center was at the forefront of groups supporting the results. But relations began to sour within months after Carter paved the way for Aristide's triumphant return in October 1994. By year's end it was becoming apparent to all but the most ideologically driven that Haiti was turning into another one-man dictatorship.
<p>
	Previous Heritage Foundation studies have outlined the authoritarian character of Aristide's political personality, his Marxist beliefs, and the follies of U.S. intervention on his behalf.1 A critical part of Aristide's plan for total power was his illegal and authoritarian command of the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), the body responsible for conducting the June elections.2 Sensing trouble, former President Carter revisited Haiti in March 1995 but was formally rebuffed by Aristide and unofficially greeted by hostile crowds and vicious graffiti, all engineered by Lavalas street gangs intent on embarrassing him.
<p>
Thus, the stage was set for the June elections. While the Lavalas victory was expected, not even the most influential of Aristide's private backers, including Jimmy Carter, were prepared for the disgraceful conduct of the government and the Lavalas party. "Of the 13 elections that I have observed," notes Pastor, "the June 25 Haitian elections were the most disastrous technically, with the most insecure count."3  Pastor implicitly indicts Aristide, concluding that "instead of building confidence in an electoral process, the government and the CEP -- by their words, actions and inactions -- eroded confidence. Instead of building bonds with the political parties by listening to their concerns and complaints and responding in an expeditious and helpful manner, the CEP stiff-armed the parties and never responded to their complaints."4
<p>
<b>CLINTON'S DEBACLE</b><p>

	After the intervention of 21,000 U.S. troops, at a cost of $3 billion and in conjunction with 6,000 United Nations forces, the Clinton Administration finds itself forced to defend the Haiti operation as its biggest foreign policy "success."  But the sham elections in Haiti were riddled with graft, fraud, and chaos. They represent a complete denial of democratic rule. The balloting was marked by widespread irregularities:  ballots burned, hundreds of voting stations never opened, and tens of thousands of people never able to vote. "I personally witnessed," writes Pastor, "the compromise of one-third of the ballot boxes in Port-au-Prince."5  Conceding the legitimacy of opposition complaints, he argues that "the international community will not help Haiti's democratic process by being silent or dishonest. It has a responsibility to insist that the parties' concerns be effectively addressed."6
<P>
<b>DEMOCRACY AND HAITI'S FUTURE</b>
<p>
The Carter Center report includes a number of constructive recommendations, both near-term and long-term. Among these are:
<p>
<ul><li>Improved criteria for determining complete reruns of the June 1995 elections;
<p><li>Changes in the composition of the Provisional Electoral Council, to include replacing members chosen by Aristide with candidates chosen by Parliament;

<p><li>A multi-party National Dialogue and companion Task Force to begin the process of political reconciliation;

<p><li>Improved electoral training (including practice runs for future elections) and counting procedures, and strict voting hours;

<p><li>Long-term legal and constitutional reform of Haiti's electoral process.
<p></ul>
	Such measures, if adopted, would improve the performance of Haiti's electoral system, but recent experience and the long history of Haitian politics both indicate that the problems encountered by Clinton's intervention are embedded deeply in Haiti's political culture. If anything, the Aristide elections have magnified these problems for the rest of the world to see. Thus, the Carter Center's dissent from these elections, while fair and constructive, may have missed the central point. As expressed over a century ago by then Princeton professor Woodrow Wilson:  "Democracy... is not created by aspirations or by new faith; it is built up by slow habit...." 7
<P>
The time has not yet arrived to call Haiti a democracy.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	The 104th Congress has a rare opportunity to reform American agricultural policy and provide a huge boost to the U.S. economy. The current system of centrally planned commodity support programs, export subsidies, supply controls, acreage allotments, production quotas, and restrictions on trade imports holds back American farmers. This makes it impossible for them to benefit from the growing world market and denies farming-related industries the economic boost of higher farm production.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Freeing the U.S. farm economy -- farmers and related businesses -- to take full advantage of the growing global market would mean huge economic benefits for Americans. An analysis by Heritage Senior Fellow David Winston and Research Analysts Rea Hederman and Christine L. Olson indicates that such reform would generate as much as $135 billion in new economic activity over ten years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In <I>Freeing America's Farmers:  The Heritage Plan for Rural Prosperity</I>, The Heritage Foundation has proposed that Congress immediately end all supply control programs.<sup>1</sup> The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), which is more a supply control than conservation program, harms the rural economy more than all other supply control programs combined because it keeps about 36 million acres out of production. The Heritage plan would reform the CRP immediately by neither renewing expiring contracts nor entering into any new ones. Farmers with existing contracts would be given the option to withdraw from the program before their contract expiration date. In return, they would receive 33 percent of the payment to which they otherwise would have been entitled for the duration of their contract.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Two legislative proposals before Congress:  the Farm Freedom Act (H.R. 2010), sponsored by Representatives Richard Zimmer (R-NJ) and Charles Schumer (D-NY), and the Freedom to Farm Act (H.R. 2195), sponsored by House Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts (R-KS), would end the use of annual supply controls for the wheat, feed grain, cotton, and rice programs. However, neither addresses the fundamental CRP problem. Only proposals that remove the federal government from the business of managing supply and demand can increase farm income from the marketplace while stimulating overall economic growth.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	If farmers were free of the controls that now restrict output, they would enjoy a surge in new income even when modest declines in prices are taken into account. The comprehensive model of the agriculture economy developed by The Heritage Foundation indicates that additional net farm income from the marketplace in 1996 would exceed $2 billion. By the year 2001, it would be nearly $4 billion, and between 1996 and 2001, it would exceed $18 billion. The state-by-state impact on farm income of the Heritage Foundation's agriculture reform proposal can be found in <I>Freeing America's Farmers</I>.

	Although some states would not immediately make dramatic farm income gains or would take longer to become net farm income winners, farmers in most states would gain significantly under the Heritage plan.<sup>2</sup> But an increase in farm production also has an economic impact on farm-related business. Freeing U.S. farmers would bring millions of previously idle acres back into productive use. This would require increased use of agricultural inputs, such as seed, fertilizer, and equipment, in addition to expansion of the food processing industry and greater demand for packaging, transportation, and shipping.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The appendix presents state-level data for 1996-2005 to show the value of the additional economic activity that would be generated by changes in farm income under the Heritage agriculture reform proposal. In this ten-year period, the overall economy would expand by $134.9 billion, with every state sharing in the economic expansion. Even some states that are not major agricultural producers would enjoy a boost because they supply farmers elsewhere or handle farm products. In fact, the national economy would grow by $10.9 billion in just the first year. And states benefit because they have business activity related to the farm economy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Example:  Kansas and Texas each would enjoy a $1 billion boost to the economy in the first year, and Iowa would benefit by almost $800 million. States with significant agricultural production, such as Kansas (a large wheat producer), Iowa (a leading corn producer), or Texas (a large state producing many crops), reap the greatest economic benefits because most of the increased economic activity would remain in the state in which the additional farm income is generated.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Example:  Even non-agriculture states reap sizable economic benefits. Because the Heritage analysis assumes that as much as 75 percent of the new production would go to the export market, a number of states with significant export facilities but minimal agricultural production would receive large economic benefits. For instance, although a state like Rhode Island does not produce a great quantity of agricultural product, its economy would benefit from increased shipping and transportation activities, especially those related to exports. In fact, any state with significant export activities or port facilities, such as Louisiana and a number of other coastal and Great Lakes states, would derive more in benefits than they have contributed through increased agricultural production.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Also, a major share of the increased agricultural production would mean new business for firms engaged in processing, converting raw agricultural commodities into value-added products for both export and domestic use, and livestock production. Therefore, any state with a significant livestock industry or food processing facilities also would gain more than it generates simply through increased agricultural production. 

<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In the next few weeks, Congress will consider the 1995 farm bill, probably as a part of budget reconciliation. Congress must take advantage of this compelling opportunity to effect fundamental reforms in U.S. agricultural policy. If the 1995 farm bill eliminates supply controls such as acreage reduction programs, ends the government's role in manipulating supply and demand through subsidies, and phases out the CRP, not only will farm income increase significantly, but the national economy will expand by over $135 billion over the next ten years. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	 Some Members of Congress have advocated proposals that would do nothing more than protect the status quo and thus would fail to capture any of these potential gains. On the other hand, two proposals, H.R. 2010 and H.R. 2195, do eliminate some of the supply control programs, which would benefit farmers and related businesses. However, unless Congress enacts complete reform, including termination of the CRP, the U.S. economy will be denied the growth that can be achieved only with an end to central planning in agriculture. 

<p>
<b>APPENDIX:  THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION MODEL</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Heritage Foundation Farm Income Projection Model, described in detail in <I>Freeing America's Farmers</I>, projects what would happen to future farm income (1996-2005) should just over three-quarters of all idled land come back into production, based on a historical analysis of the farm sector from 1990-1993. In our model we assumed that overall, about 80 percent of government-idled land would come back into production. These additional acres would yield only 95 percent as much as land currently being farmed, and costs of production would be 5 percent higher. For all cropland in our analysis, yields would increase 0.5 percent each through 2005 due to productivity gains. Finally, we assumed that because of growing overseas demand, the increase in supply would have a minimal impact on prices. The greatest effect would be in 1996, when prices would drop 4 percent. By 2005 this loss would be more than recouped.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In keeping with estimates of the gain in farm income contained in <I>Freeing America's Farmers</I>, the Heritage Foundation's more comprehensive estimates of increased economic activity are conservative in their assumptions. In the model to estimate farm income gains, we assumed that future productivity gains would be only one half of one percent annually and estimated relatively higher costs of production for new acreage relative to existing acreage. Thus, the model significantly understated potential income gains, and our conclusions about changes in farm income presented the worst case scenario, suggesting that some states would take much longer to become net farm income winners.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Some states would take longer because the model assumed that farmers would continue to grow whatever crop they previously produced or currently were producing and that production on new acreage would simply reflect their historical growing patterns, even when this would cause a loss of income. However, if allowed to produce for the marketplace rather than for the government, farmers would not use their available acreage to produce any crop that resulted in a negative income. If there is no alternative crop available to generate a net profit from production on the new acreage, the farmer's rational decision would be to leave that land idle rather than produce a crop at a loss. Therefore, our model showed income losses for farmers when, at worst, there would have been no gain.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	By comparison, a study by Abel, Daft and Early estimated an expansion of $28.9 billion dollars for one year, based on ending supply controls.<sup>3</sup> However, their estimate also assumed that there was no reduction in deficiency payments, which then were credited with contributing to the overall economy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In estimating the additional economic activity generated by increases in farm income, we assumed that most, though not all, of the new product will be sold overseas to meet the growing demand for food in Africa and the Pacific Rim. While it is true that increased production could trigger faster development of new consumer products and new uses for the domestic market as well as for the international market, we estimate only the increase in economic activity that would be derived from increases in exports.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Heritage analysis is based on the gross business multiplier of all agricultural exports developed by Gerald Schluter and William Edmondson of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service. Their multiplier factor is based on a recognition that "in a highly interrelated economy like that of the United States, many more people benefit from agricultural exports than just farmers and exporters and their employees."  Schluter and Edmondson specifically point to firms that provide materials and services used by farmers and others to provide the export goods as beneficiaries of increased economic activity that leads to business growth, in addition to businesses which sell consumer goods and find that their customers spend more income when trade expands.<sup>4</sup>

INTRODUCTION

<P>     Reacting to America's alleged excessive dependence on Middle
East oil and to last fall's gasoline price increases, Congress is
considering raising the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE)
standards, which mandate average minimum miles per gallon (mpg) for
the fleet of automobiles sold in America by each manufacturer. The
"Motor Vehicle Fuel Efficiency Act" (S. 279), introduced by Senator
Richard Bryan, the Nevada Democrat, would increase the current 27.5
mpg standard to approximately 34 mpg by 1996 and approximately 40 mpg
by 2001. (See News from the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science
and Transportation, 102nd Cong., 1st Sess., March 19, 1991, p. 2. The
bill would require each manufacturer to raise its own fleets' mpg
averages to 20 percent by 1996, and then 40 percent by 1996, over the
levels actually achieved in the 1988 model year. Since different
manufacturers had different fleet averages in 1988, the law no longer
would apply the same standards to all manufacturers after 1996; some
would have to increase their fleet averages more than others.)

<P>     Supporters maintain that this increase is necessary to reduce
America's fuel consumption. The recent fall in oil prices, however,
removes a major reason given for higher CAFE standards. In any case,
to meet higher CAFE standards American manufacturers will be forced to
produce more smaller, lighter and therefore less safe cars. As it is,
the current CAFE standards result in as many as 3,900 additional
highway deaths per model-year fleet. The higher CAFE standards sought
by the Bryan bill would force Americans truly to pay in blood,
increasing the number of highway deaths attributable to CAFE by as
much as 8,600 per model-year fleet.

 <P>    Thousands Out of Jobs. Nearly as bad is what the Bryan bill will
do to American auto workers. To meet the Bryan CAFE standards and
compete with foreign automakers, American manufacturers will have to
transfer operations from the United States to overseas plants. This
will throw tens of thousands of American automakers out of their jobs.
Next will come American workers supplying steel and auto parts who too
would find themselves on the unemployment line.

<P>     Consumer Choice. Because the CAFE law looks only at average fuel
economy, with the averages based on the number of cars sold, American
automobile manufacturers actually can be penalized for producing more
fuel-efficient cars. As American firms have produced more fuel-
efficient mid-sized and large cars, many consumers have switched to
these vehicles from smaller models. But given the peculiar way in
which CAFE compliance is measured, such consumer choices can lower the
fleet average for American manufacturers, even if the mpg for every
individual model goes up.

<P>     The Bryan bill would not greatly reduce American fuel
consumption or America's alleged dependence on foreign oil. It would
not be effective at reducing pollution or at inducing Americans to
drive less.

<P>     If energy prices rise and stay high, this itself will give
consumers an incentive to purchase more fuel-efficient cars and give
auto manufacturers an incentive to produce such vehicles. If fuel
prices remain low, however, it does not make sense to force American
manufacturers to produce cars that consumers do not need or want. If
consumers decide they would rather have larger and hence safer cars,
even if these cars get fewer miles per gallon of gasoline,
manufacturers should not be prevented from selling these cars. The
tradeoff between the safety of a vehicle and its fuel efficiency
properly is the choice of each individual American, not the choice of
Congress.
<P>
ORIGINS OF CAFE
<P>
     The 1973 Arab oil embargo and the ensuing quadrupling of oil
prices by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
prompted Congress to enact the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE)
program in 1975 as part of America's Energy Policy and Conservation
Act. The aim of this program was to reduce the consumption of gasoline
and thus the need for oil imports. Beginning with the 1978 auto model
year, the program required all auto manufacturers to maintain certain
minimum fuel economy averages for their fleets of vehicles sold in the
U.S. The standard for passenger cars was set initially at 18 miles per
gallon in 1978, but since has risen to the current 27.5 mpg.

 <P>    The CAFE standards apply to any manufacturer, domestic or
foreign, that sells over 10,000 cars per year in America. These
manufacturers must satisfy CAFE requirements for each of several
vehicle categories. For instance, vehicles manufactured abroad are
considered separately from those manufactured in the U.S. Thus, a
manufacturer with a 30 mpg average for its combined output of foreign
and domestically produced passenger automobiles nonetheless would fall
short of CAFE requirements if its domestically built passenger cars
taken separately averaged only 25 mpg. The standards are the same for
foreign and domestic fleets, but different standards apply to
different types of vehicles. A lower mpg level is required for light
trucks, for example, whether foreign or domestically produced, than
for passenger vehicles.

<P>   The mpg performance of each model vehicle is calculated from the
combined average of city and highway mileage, according to tests
conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency. If a manufacturer's
average for a particular fleet falls below the mandated levels, a
penalty is imposed amounting to $5 per vehicle for each one-tenth of a
mpg by which the fleet average falls below the required CAFE level.
Significantly, the penalty applies to all cars sold in the fleet in
question, not just the particular models that bring the average below
the minimum level. Thus if a manufacturer produced one million cars
per year and its fleet CAFE average was 27.4 mpg instead of 27.5 mpg,
it would pay a fine of $5 million to the federal government. The Bryan
bill would increase these penalties. Beginning with the 1996 model
year it would: 1) index fines for inflation, and 2) double the fine
for any manufacturer that failed to meet the applicable standard by
one-half mile per gallon or more three years in a row.

<P>     It is questionable whether the 1970s CAFE standards did much to
increase the fuel efficiency of American cars. What actually did boost
mileage per gallon for American-made cars was the searing competition
from the high mileage imports and the sustained high gasoline prices.
In response to this, American manufacturers invested $88 billion to
make their vehicles more fuel-efficient. (Milton R. Copulos, "Why Auto
Mileage Rules Should Be Relaxed," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No.
426, April 23, 1985, p. 3.) As oil prices dropped in the 1980s, the
rate of fuel efficiency gain slowed. The reason: more Americans
preferred larger cars. 
<P>
CAFE KILLS

 <P>   While conservation of fuel is valued by proponents of higher
CAFE standards, they usually ignore what is more important: human
life. The evidence now is overwhelming that CAFE kills. The reason is
simple. The easiest way to increase a vehicle's fuel efficiency, and
beyond a certain point the only way, is to reduce the vehicle's weight
by reducing its size and its steel content. While technological
improvements in engines or body design also contribute to increased
fuel efficiency, there are limits to what technology alone can do. In
fact, other federal regulations often limit such improvements.
Controls on auto emissions, for example, have forced changes in engine
and exhaust system design that reduce gas mileage. (Thomas Gale Moore,
"The Unresolved Conflict Between Auto Safety and Fuel Efficiency,"
Journal of Regulation and Social Costs, Vol. 1, No. 1 (September
1990), p. 72.) 

<P>     Light-weight Cars. As such, reducing auto weight is the main
means by which CAFE standards have been met. The weight of the average
American automobile has been reduced 23 percent since 1974. (Robert W.
Crandall and John D. Graham, "The Effect of Fuel Economy Standards on
Automobile Safety," Journal of Law and Economics, Vol. XXXII (April
1989), p. 101.) Cars over 4,000 pounds accounted for about one-quarter
of all cars sold during the 1978 model year; they constitute only one
percent of the cars built since 1984. Cars of more than 3,500 pounds
made up over 70 percent of the 1978 fleet, but were only 36 percent of
the 1987 fleet. (R.M. Heavenrich, et al., "Light-Duty Automotive Fuel
Economy and Technology Trends Through 1987," Society of Automotive
Engineers, Inc., Technical Papers Series, May 1987, p. 12.)

<P>     While some car weight reduction would have occurred without
CAFE, the standards have had a significant effect in recent years.
According to a study by economists Robert Crandall of the Brookings
Institution and John Graham of the Harvard School of Public Health,
the average weight of passenger automobiles for the 1989 model year is
about 500 pounds less than it would have been without CAFE
regulations. (Crandall and Graham, op. cit., pp. 100-110.) Raising the
CAFE standard still further will force additional weight reductions,
especially since many of the technological improvements that can
increase fuel economy have already been made. 

<P>     This decline in vehicle weight reduces safety. Crandall and
Graham explain that "the negative relationship between weight and
occupant fatality risk is one of the most secure findings in the
safety literature." (Ibid., p. 110.) Today's cars have less steel in
their frames and bodies to absorb the force of a collision.
Furthermore, with their narrower wheelbases they are more prone to
turn over in an accident. The result: More accidents each year produce
major injuries and deaths. 

<P>     Increasing Fatalities. Crandall and Graham estimate that the
500-pound decrease in vehicle weight caused by the current CAFE
standard of 27.5 mpg already has increased the number of occupant
fatalities that will occur over the life of each model year's cars
between 14 percent and 27 percent. This amounts to between 2,200 and
3,900 additional deaths per model year, spread out over the lifetime
of the vehicles. Crandall and Graham also estimate that an additional
11,000 to 19,500 serious injuries are likely to occur over the life of
each model year's cars because of the current CAFE standards. (Ibid.,
pp. 111-116.)

 <P>    These additional deaths and injuries already are occurring
because of the existing CAFE standards. Raising the standards further
will add to the CAFE death and injury toll. Based on his study with
Graham, Crandall estimates that the substantial weight and steel-
content reductions that would be needed to achieve a fleet-wide
average of 40 mpg would raise the CAFE death toll to between 4,800 and
8,600 deaths per model year fleet. (See testimony of Competitive
Enterprise Institute and Consumer Alert (Sam Kazman) before the
Subcommittee on Water, Power, and Offshore Energy Resources of the
House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, 101st Cong., 2nd
Sess., September 11, 1990, p. 4.)

 <P>    Penalizing Safety. Some defenders of CAFE argue that these
weight reductions can be offset by other safety measures such as air
bags. Yet while a small car with an air bag might be safer than such a
car without one, it still will not be as safe as a large car with an
air bag. The weight reductions necessitated by CAFE tend to neutralize
the benefits from air bags and other safety measures. By one estimate,
adding air bags to a car is equivalent, from a safety standpoint, to
increasing the car's weight by about 385 pounds. (Leonard Evans,
"Passive Compared to Active Approaches to Reducing Occupant
Fatalities," General Motors Research Laboratories, March 1989, p. 7.)
Yet CAFE has led to average vehicle weight reductions of about 500
pounds. Moreover, air bags, anti-lock brakes, improved bumpers, and
other safety features also increase vehicle weight and hence also
reduce fuel economy. Higher CAFE standards would punish auto makers
for introducing similar lifesaving improvements in the future if the
improvements would make cars heavier.

<P>     The Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration (NHTSA) has conducted several studies that
confirm a significant relationship between vehicle size and the
incidence of death or serious injury. (Two such studies are reported
together in Effect of Car Size on Fatality and Injury Risk in
Single-Vehicle Crashes U.S. Department of Transportation, National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration, August 1990.) NHTSA
Administrator Jerry Curry, Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner,
and Energy Secretary James Watkins on safety grounds have criticized
proposals to raise CAFE standards further. Watkins has called Bryan's
bill the "Highway Death Act of 1991."

 <P>    Even self-proclaimed consumer advocate Ralph Nader's Center for
Auto Safety in 1972 observed that "Small size and light weight impose
inherent limitations on the degree of safety that can be built into a
vehicle." (Center for Auto Safety, The Nader Report: Small -- on
Safety (New York: Grossman Publishers, 1972), p. 87.) Nader, who does
not own a car himself but is an ardent supporter of the Bryan bill,
conceded in an interview in 1989 that "larger cars are safer" because
"there is more bulk to protect the occupant." (Rebecca E. Greer, "Be
Safer in the 90's: New Warnings from Ralph Nader," Woman's Day,
October 24, 1989, p. 32.) 
<P>
CAFE COSTS AMERICAN JOBS
<P>
     The CAFE standards already have cost over 200,000 American jobs.
CAFE will cost more if the Bryan bill becomes law. By making new cars
more expensive, CAFE reduces the demand for new cars. Studies indicate
that a 10 percent increase in the price of large cars decreases their
demand by 30 percent. (See Andrew N. Kleit, The Impact of Automobile
Fuel Economy Standards, Federal Trade Commission Working Paper No. 160
(February 1988), Technical Appendix, p. 3.) New car sales thus would
slide, and along with them the jobs of American autoworkers. More jobs
would be destroyed by the shift to those small cars that meet Bryan
CAFE levels, since small cars require less labor per car built than
large cars.

 <P>    Shifting Production Overseas. Higher CAFE standards, moreover,
would prompt American manufacturers to shift their large car
production overseas, cutting their U.S. payroll and employing more
foreign workers. This is because the CAFE law divides each
manufacturer's production into two separate fleets, domestic-made and
foreign-made, with each fleet required to meet the CAFE requirements
independently. Because U.S. manufacturers already build many of their
smaller cars overseas, it is even more difficult for them to meet the
CAFE requirements with their domestic fleets. By moving some of their
large car production abroad, they would be able to offset the lower
fuel economy of their larger cars with the higher fuel economy of
their smaller and lighter foreign cars. At the same time, moving
production of larger cars abroad would raise the average fuel economy
of their domestic fleet. 

<P>     In a similar fashion, CAFE also forces foreign auto
manufacturers with American assembly plants to purchase parts from
abroad. To be classified as a foreign car, at least 70 percent of the
total price of a vehicle must consist of value added outside the U.S.
Since their American-built cars tend to be larger and incapable of
meeting CAFE standards by themselves, these manufacturers have to keep
their U.S.-built cars classified as foreign for CAFE purposes.

<P>     Then, by reducing domestic auto production of U.S. and foreign
auto companies, CAFE eliminates jobs in industries that supply the
auto industry. The impact of higher CAFE standards on the steel
industry would be especially pronounced since reducing the steel
content of cars is the easiest way to increase fuel economy. 
<P>
CAFE PENALIZES EFFICIENCY

<P>     CAFE is not calculated on the basis of fuel efficiency
improvements model-by-model, but rather on the average efficiency of
all autos sold. (The averaging method currently used by the EPA counts
low-mpg cars more heavily than high-mpg cars, making it even harder
for manufacturers to achieve their fleet-wide targets. Thus, if two
cars are sold, one of which gets 20 miles per gallon and the other 40
miles per gallon, the average for the two is not 30 under the EPA
method but 26.7 See Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, Status
Report, Vol. 25, No. 8 (September 8, 1990) p. 5.) As a result, changes
in customer choices can place a manufacturer in violation of the CAFE
standards even though every car in its fleet may be more fuel-
efficient than the year before. 

<P>     Because auto makers have increased significantly the fuel
economy of their larger cars over the past decade, and because oil and
gasoline prices have fallen sharply during the same period, more
Americans are again buying larger, safer cars. And yet, although
automobiles of all sizes are more fuel-efficient now than they were in
the past, this shift in consumer demand from smaller to larger cars
brings down the fleet average mpg of American manufacturers. Thus,
because the CAFE formula takes the ability to comply out of the hands
of the manufacturers, the CAFE standards can actually have the
perverse effect of penalizing American auto manufacturers for the
efficiency gains they have made in the past.

<P>     Bizarre Situation. American auto manufacturers are in the
bizarre situation of having to protect themselves against the wishes
of their own customers. If a manufacturer allows its customers to buy
too many efficient but large cars, the manufacturer will end up in
violation of the CAFE standards. To prevent this, auto makers change
the "mix" of cars they sell by increasing the prices of larger cars
and lowering the prices of smaller cars. (For evidence that automakers
actually do this, see, e.g., Competitive Enterprise Institute v.
NHTSA, 901 F.2d 107, 124-25 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (Ginsburg, J.,
concurring).) In effect, CAFE acts as a tax on larger, safer cars
which is used to subsidize sales of smaller, higher-mpg, but less safe
cars. 

<P>  This skewed pricing system imposes burdens on consumers because
it limits their ability to purchase the cars of their choice. As a
result, many legitimate desires or needs of consumers can go
unfulfilled. Large families, for example, may need a large car. Older
citizens often prefer larger cars because they are easier to enter and
exit. CAFE standards make it more expensive for these buyers to
exercise their choices. In this way, CAFE and the Bryan bill penalize
large families and the elderly.

<P>  Recreational users also would suffer from an increase in CAFE
standards. This is because reducing engine horsepower can increase
fuel economy. And yet, large engines are needed for trailer hauling,
off-road driving, and other recreational uses. (Engine power can
sometimes be a safety factor as well. Some minimum degree of engine
power is needed to be able to accelerate quickly enough to get out of
the way of oncoming traffic and to get across railroad intersections
quickly and safely. See, e.g. Center for Auto Safety, op. cit., p.
73.)
<P>
CAFE IS UNNECESSARY FOR ENERGY CONSERVATION

<P>  The average fuel economy average of new cars sold in America has
risen substantially, from about 20 mpg in 1978, when CAFE first took
effect, to about 28 mpg in 1987. (James L. Gattuso and Kent Jeffreys,
"The Mounting Dangers of the 'CAFE' Mileage Standards," Heritage
Foundation Backgrounder No. 676, October 13, 1988, p. 4.) CAFE
supporters point to this as evidence of CAFE's success. In truth, CAFE
had little to do with this dramatic improvement. The evidence shows
that fuel economy rose as the market responded to high fuel prices.

<P>  Indeed, the average fuel efficiency of cars driven in America
began to increase before CAFE standards were enacted. In the four
years before CAFE took effect, new car fuel efficiency rose 40
percent. (Ibid.) When gasoline prices climbed from 36 cents per gallon
of regular leaded gasoline in 1972 to 53 cents per gallon in 1974,
(U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration, Annual
Energy Review 1987, p. 145.) consumers began to demand more efficient
automobiles. No federal regulation was needed to tell auto makers to
improve fuel economy -- the market was sending an unmistakable signal.
Thus when CAFE went into effect in 1978, its mandated 18 mpg standard
was below the average at the time of almost 20 mpg. (Gattuso and
Jeffreys, op. cit., p. 4.)

<P>  From 1978 through 1982 new car mpg averages improved by another
35 percent (Ibid.) as the average price of leaded gasoline reached a
high of $1.31 per gallon (or $1.88 in today's dollars) in 1981.
(Annual Energy Review 1987, op. cit., p. 145. Conversion to 1990
dollars based on Economic Report of the President, 1991, Appendix B,
Table B-58, p. 351.) According to research by Brookings economist
Crandall, these efficiency improvements were almost exactly what could
have been predicted from changes in gas prices alone. (Robert W.
Crandall and Theodore E. Keeler, "Public Policy and the Automobile,"
in Richard L. Gordon, Henry D. Jacoby, and Martin Zimmerman, eds.,
Energy: Markets and Regulation (Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press, 1987).)

<P>  Restricting the Market. Predictably, too, fuel efficiency
improvements in new model cars slowed somewhat after oil prices began
declining in 1982. This is because of the greater demand for larger,
more comfortable, and safer cars. Even so, the average mpg still
increased another 8 percent after 1982. (Gattuso and Jeffreys, op.
cit., p. 4.) But with lower gasoline prices, and the resulting
increase in demand for larger cars, the CAFE standards finally began
to restrict the car market, preventing auto makers from responding to
the turnaround in consumer demand. Instead of simply selling more
large cars, as their customers wanted, manufacturers raised the prices
of larger cars to avoid selling too many of them and thereby running
afoul of the CAFE standards. (See note 17, above.)
<P>
CAFE DOES NOT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE FUEL CONSUMPTION

<P>  Advocates of higher CAFE standards apparently reckon that if
cars get more miles per gallon of gas, people will burn less gas
driving the same number of miles. But, by reducing the number of
gallons of gas needed to drive a given distance, CAFE makes driving
less expensive. Americans have responded to this as would be expected;
they drive their cars more miles. Greater fuel efficiency prompts more
leisure driving and discourages car pooling and the use of public
transportation.

<P>  At the same time, CAFE makes new cars, particularly large
models, more expensive to buy. Thus it creates an incentive for those
who want the comfort, convenience or safety of a larger car to keep
their older cars longer. Others buy used instead of new cars. Yet,
older cars are generally less fuel-efficient than new ones. The result
is that these drivers use more gasoline in a year than they would have
if they had been allowed to buy the kind of car they wanted at a price
they could afford.

<P>  It thus is questionable whether increased CAFE standards would
reduce American gasoline and oil consumption significantly. If the
standards did reduce oil consumption, moreover, they would increase
the share of oil that America imports. The reason: when demand falls,
it is the marginal, highest-cost suppliers that drop out of the
market. Since American oil producers face substantially higher costs
per barrel than producers in other parts of the world, the Americans
would be forced to stop selling oil if the Bryan bill were to succeed
in reducing U.S. oil consumption. (In fact, the percentage of oil
imported has no connection with "dependence" on foreign oil. See,
e.g., Victor A. Conto, "It's BTU-tiful: Energy Markets in the New
Era," A.B. Laffer Associates, September 8, 1987.)
<P>
NO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT

<P>  Some advocates of higher CAFE standards maintain that cars with
higher mpg will pollute less. But by inducing drivers to keep older,
less efficient cars longer, CAFE may increase total emissions of
pollutants by delaying the introduction of newer cars with cleaner-
burning engines and exhaust systems.

<P>  CAFE represents, moreover, an indirect and very ineffective
approach to controlling pollution. If Congress wants to protect the
environment, it can do so at a much lower cost to consumers and the
economy by adopting measures that target auto emissions directly.

<P>  Studies have shown, for example, that approximately half of all
auto emissions are produced by only 10 percent of all cars, most
usually poorly tuned. (See, e.g. "Roadside Emission Test Targets Prime
Offenders," Chemecology, November 1990, pp. 10-11; Rick Henderson,
"Going Mobile," Reason, August/September 1990, pp. 32-36) A properly-
tuned car puts out less emissions than an untuned one, even if both
are driven the same distance, use the same gasoline, and have the same
mpg. CAFE provides no incentive to keep engines in tune nor does it
help to get high-pollution vehicles off the road. A much better
approach would be to measure periodically the exhaust each car
produces and levy a fee directly on the worst polluters.

<P>  Higher CAFE standards sometimes are defended as a way to deal
with the alleged problem of "global warming." The fear is that
increased concentrations in the atmosphere of what are called
"greenhouse gases," such as carbon dioxide and chlorofluorocarbons
(CFCs) supposedly will warm up the Earth's atmosphere, causing
droughts in some areas and coastal flooding in others. But automobiles
are a relatively minor source of these greenhouse gases. While an
"Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change" and the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency have estimated that at least a 50 percent to 80
percent worldwide reduction in carbon dioxide emissions would be
needed to keep the atmosphere's temperature at its current level, (See
Office of Technology Assessment, U.S. Congress, Changing by Degrees:
Steps to Reduce Greenhouse Gases (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government
Printing Office, 1991), p. iii.) the Bryan bill would reduce such
emissions by only about 0.5 percent, even under the most optimistic
assumptions. (This figure is calculated from data given in ibid., pp.
5, 7, 8, 21.)
<P>
CONCLUSION

<P>  An increase in CAFE standards is a poor way to deal with the
alleged problem of high fuel consumption. The bill introduced by
Senator Richard Bryan uses a regulatory, "command-and-control"
approach that fails to balance the need for more energy-efficient cars
with consumer demands. It ignores the market forces which in the past
did increase fuel efficiency. What is worse, higher CAFE standards
would not achieve any of their ostensible purposes. They would not
significantly reduce American fuel consumption or America's alleged
"dependence" on foreign oil. They would not reduce pollution, nor have
any significant effect on the alleged global warming problem. 

<P>  Tragic Consequence. At the same time, the Bryan bill would
reduce the range of choices available to American car buyers while
requiring them to pay substantially more for their cars. The bill also
would reduce the number of American jobs, first in the auto and steel
industries, and then in other sectors that serve the auto industry.
Most tragic, by forcing manufacturers to sell lighter and smaller cars
than customers want, the Bryan Bill would increase major injuries and
deaths on the highways. 

<P>  If Congress wants to foster energy conservation, it simply
should allow the price system to operate freely. As long as Congress
does not reimpose price controls on gasoline and other petroleum
products, as it did in the early 1970s, market prices will provide
consumers with the proper incentive to conserve.

<title>How To Salvage Agriculture Reforms In Budget Reconciliation -- Heritage</title>

<center>
<h3><i>HOW TO SALVAGE AGRICULTURE REFORMS IN BUDGET RECONCILIATION</i></h3>

By John E. Frydenlund<br>
Director, Agricultural Policy Project<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Issue Bulletin No. 219<br>
November 9, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
As conferees work to resolve differences between the House and Senate versions of budget reconciliation, they will determine whether any real agriculture reform will occur this year. Only the House has included fundamental reforms of some of the existing farm programs -- changes in the wheat, feed grain, cotton, rice, and dairy programs embodied in House Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts's Freedom to Farm Act (H.R. 2195).<sup>1</sup>  Unfortunately, neither the House nor the Senate has offered any significant reform of the sugar or peanut programs or the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). If Congress is serious about accomplishing anything close to real reform this year, it should adopt the House proposals. In addition, when Congress considers the farm bill either later this year or in 1996, those programs that were overlooked in reconciliation must be addressed.<sup>2</sup>
<p>

<b>COMPARING THE HOUSE AND SENATE AGRICULTURE PROVISIONS</b>
<p>
The only meaningful reforms of agriculture programs still being considered as a part of budget reconciliation are the Freedom to Farm Act provisions included by the House (Table 1 presents a comparison of the key agriculture provisions in the House and Senate reconciliation bills). These reforms would replace traditional payments for wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice with transitional payments that decline over a period of seven years. The House eliminates the deficiency payments based upon target prices, ending the federal government's role in telling farmers what and how much to produce. The House also eliminates the marketing loan payments and the three-entity rule, which would end the preferential treatment for cotton and rice and close the payment limitation loophole that allows these farmers to receive as much as $250,000 annually. In addition, the House bill provides similar reform of the dairy program, eliminating price supports and marketing orders and replacing them with transition payments. 
<p>
The Senate failed to include any reform of these programs, other than elimination of annual acreage reduction programs and the farmer-owned reserve, reforms also embodied in the House reconciliation package. The conferees should accept the reforms provided in the House version. Otherwise, there would be no meaningful reform of the current agriculture programs, and America's farmers will be denied the chance to capitalize upon the opportunities a free market provides.
<p>
In fact, the Senate would move away from real, free-market reform of the dairy program by establishing a "Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact" that provides a competitive advantage to dairy producers in six states.<sup>3</sup>  Under the Compact, a governing commission would set a minimum price for all milk produced in the Northeast region above the price set by milk marketing orders. Producers and processors from outside this region will be precluded from competing in these six states because no milk from outside the compact states will be allowed to come in at a lower price. This not only will increase prices to consumers in the Northeast, but also will create potentially costly surpluses that must be purchased by the American taxpayer. 
<p>
Even worse, the Senate bill establishes a two-tiered pricing system by requiring compensatory payments for nonfat dry milk used in higher value products. Allowing a lower price for nonfat dry milk being exported while setting a higher price for U.S. dairy and food manufacturers using nonfat dry milk in their products amounts to imposing a "powder tax" on domestic manufacturers who use nonfat dried milk as an ingredient. The Senate bill also establishes a mechanism for national pooling of milk prices by requiring milk producers in most areas of the country to pay into a "pool" to subsidize lower prices received for surplus milk products from other areas. The Senate provisions, rather than provide reform as in the House version, takes an already archaic system of milk pricing under the Federal Milk Marketing Orders and imposes more unnecessary federal regulation on the dairy industry.
<p>
The only positive provision in the Senate version, which is absent from the House version, provides that farm program authorities expire at the end of seven years. The House bill would establish the Commission on 21st Century Production Agriculture, ostensibly for the purpose of identifying the appropriate future relationship between the federal government and production agriculture after 2002. This proposal simply represents a delaying tactic. There is ample evidence pointing to the advantages of getting the federal government out of the business of centrally managing U.S. agriculture.<sup>4</sup>
<p>
Finally, both the House and Senate failed to include any meaningful reform of the sugar or peanut programs because reform advocates were virtually frozen out of any opportunity to offer amendments that would have reformed these archaic programs. They also failed to effect significant reform of the Conservation Reserve Program, which removes millions of sustainable acres from productive use. These programs should be addressed in the farm bill. 
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
House and Senate agriculture conferees for budget reconciliation should adopt many of the reforms embodied in the House reconciliation bill. These proposals would begin to free America's farmers to produce for the world marketplace rather than for the dictates of the federal bureaucracy. These include provisions which provide significant reform of the wheat, feed grain, cotton, rice, and dairy programs. The benefits are increased farm income and greater economic growth. Conferees must reject most of the Senate provisions, which, at best, preserve the status quo and, for dairy in particular, actually make the programs more restrictive and uncompetitive. Finally, in other program areas, such as peanuts, sugar, and the Conservation Reserve Program, little or no reform is accomplished in either the House or Senate versions of reconciliation. Therefore, Congress must address the reform of these programs in the farm bill.

<title>The Succession Struggle Begins in Russia -- Heritage</title>

<h3>THE SUCCESSION STRUGGLE BEGINS IN RUSSIA</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/cohen.htm"> Ariel Cohen, Ph.D.</a><br> 
Senior Policy Analyst <br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 457<br>
August 13, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Lieutenant General (Ret.) Alexander Lebed, Russia's new National Security Council Secretary and President Boris Yeltsin's defense aide, already is locked in a succession struggle with Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin. The outcome of this battle is particularly important in view of reports of President Yeltsin's poor health. The nomination of Lebed protege Colonel-General Igor Rodionov as Russia's Defense Minister on July 17 has strengthened Lebed's hand. The nomination of reformist Anatoly Chubais as Yeltsin's Chief of Staff strengthens the democratic faction and the Chernomyrdin camp. A situation of such uncertainty requires that U.S. policymakers maintain dialogue with all factions in Moscow, including General Lebed's.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Lebed joined the Yeltsin administration after the first round of presidential elections, and the next act of the Russian political drama began immediately, leaving little time for the thorough discussion of policy direction that Russia so badly needs. In exchange for supporting Yeltsin, Lebed demanded that Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, his former commander and boss, be fired. He also asked for and received a broad mandate to lead and reform both the military and the security forces.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

No sooner had he joined Yeltsin's administration than Lebed offended his new boss by saying that he, Lebed, might become president before the year 2000, when Yeltsin's term expires. Lebed is lobbying aggressively to be appointed to the currently nonexistent position of vice president, which would give him supreme power if Yeltsin was incapacitated. This was met with a sharp rebuke from Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, who said that Russia is still recovering from its experience with the previous Vice President, the flamboyant Alexander Rutskoy, who politically self-destructed in 1993. Lebed also may have annoyed Yeltsin by lobbying publicly to expand his authority as the de facto head of the Russian National Security Council.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The ambitious general has embarked on a power-grabbing expedition. No one knows where Lebed's anti-corruption drive may end, and who may become its next victim. In Russia's current legal limbo, almost anyone can be charged with corruption.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Western Russia-watchers initially looked upon Lebed as a born-again liberal. However, conversations by the author with his staff in Moscow indicate that the general, as they call him, is no follower of Jefferson. He hired, then dropped, a Moscow economist by the name of Vitaly Naishul, who is an admirer of Chilean General Augusto Pinochet's economic policies. Naishul is credited with writing a large part of "Truth and Order," Lebed's no-nonsense, market oriented election platform. But he also believes that Lebed, if he becomes president, needs to "nominate a professional parliament which will consist of experts" -- a chilling thought for those in Russia who believe in universal suffrage.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Lebed's sophisticated image-makers are deeply disenchanted with Russia's experiment with democracy and far too ready to drop it for imperial grandeur and "real power."  Moreover, the key roles in Lebed's inner circle increasingly are being played by hard-line military veterans who would like to re-orient Russia away from the West and toward cooperation with Iran and Iraq. One such insider -- Heydar Jemal, Chairman of the Islamic Committee of Russia, which claims to represent Russia's 20-million-strong Muslim community -- allegedly has  close links to the Islamic regime in Tehran, according to the newspaper Izvestiya.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

There are no guarantees that Lebed will remain a democrat. He sees his Security Council position as a stepping-stone to the presidency. Moreover, certain sectors of Russian society like the military-industrial complex, the security forces, and the armed forces remain inherently hard-line and can be counted on to seek senior political figures to represent them at the pinnacle of power. General Lebed seems almost tailor-made for the job.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

However, it is not clear whether Lebed will survive the infighting within the Kremlin. Yeltsin is a master of balance-of-power intrigue, and Lebed's utility dropped greatly after the second round of elections. In the words of one senior Russian diplomat, speaking recently off the record at The Heritage Foundation, "the Kremlin ice is so slippery -- you either learn how to skate, or you fall and break your bones."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Prime Minister Chernomyrdin is aware of Lebed's ambitious plans and already is taking steps to preempt the general in the forthcoming battle for succession. A veteran of Soviet and Russian power struggles, Chernomyrdin projects the image of a no-nonsense manager. He will retain the reins of the economy and close ties within the energy sector (he was Minister of the Gas Industry during the Gorbachev administration). Chernomyrdin enjoys the trust of the Soviet-era industrial managers: He is "one of them."  But he also will be supported by the new Russian business elite. If Chubais works in tandem with Chernomyrdin against Lebed, the backing of wealthy Russian bankers will be guaranteed as well.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Western multilateral financial organizations like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have invested heavily in a relationship with the Russian Prime Minister, and so has Clinton's White House through the high-powered Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, which supervises everything from space cooperation to defense conversion. The West would prefer to see the stolid and predictable Chernomyrdin at Russia's helm rather than the mercurial nationalist Lebed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

America and the West need to understand that the Lebed-Chernomyrdin power struggle has begun. In this struggle, the powerful Russian oil and gas industry will deploy its financial might against the muscle of the armed forces and security services. Lebed may rally to his side the nationalists and the inherently hard-line national security establishment. But Kremlin insiders view Lebed (whose name means "swan" in Russian) not as a regal bird, but as a raging bull on the Kremlin's slippery ice. The prognosis for his long-term success, while guarded, has improved with the nomination of Rodionov as head of the "Moscow Pentagon."  The outcome of this struggle will depend also on President Yeltsin's health, vigor, and longevity in office.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The U.S. and the West should establish an intensive dialog with Lebed and his staff. The general has shown that he is a quick study and that he possesses a good measure of common sense. But he is inexperienced about the West and its ways and values; he comes from the Soviet armed forces and therefore has received his share of indoctrination in anti-Western xenophobia and Russian nationalism.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Lebed should be invited both to Washington and to NATO headquarters in Brussels. He has yet to make up his mind about solutions to many of the burning issues facing Russia, such as economic and military reform and the fight against crime and corruption, and may be receptive to Western views, policy inputs, and assistance. While National Security Advisor Anthony Lake is Lebed's official counterpart, Secretary of Defense William Perry, who coordinates military and security aspects of the Administration's Russia policy, would be the best candidate to invite Lebed to Washington. Perry has the knowledge and interest in Russian affairs to educate Lebed about the U.S. and the West. In any event, a long-term dialogue between Lebed and American security officials should begin now.

The Missile Defense Act of 1995: The Senate's Historic Opportunity -- Heritage </title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<CENTER><H3><I> THE MISSILE DEFENSE ACT OF 1995:
THE SENATE'S HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY</h3></I>
<p>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/moore.html">Thomas Moore</a><br>
Deputy Director of Foreign Policy and Defense Studies<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum #423<br>
August 1, 1995.<br>
</CENTER><HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>

	Americans concerned about the growing threat of ballistic missiles can take comfort in the National Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 1996, S. 1026, recently reported from the Senate Armed Services Committee. Soon the full Senate will begin consideration of S. 1026, which contains a new Missile Defense Act. If enacted, it could infuse new life into the nation's ballistic missile defense (BMD) program, crippled by the neglect -- and in some cases the outright opposition -- of the Clinton Administration. But supporters of missile defense in the Senate should not be complacent. They should expect floor amendments from BMD's traditional opponents attacking key provisions of the BMD section.
<p>
<b>THE "NEW, IMPROVED" MISSILE DEFENSE ACT</b>
<p>
	S. 1026 replaces the Missile Defense Act of 1991 with a new Missile Defense Act designed to put the nation on a clear course toward deployment of Theater Missile Defenses (TMD) against shorter-range regional missile threats and a National Missile Defense (NMD) of the U.S. homeland against long-range strategic ballistic missiles. It also includes a Cruise Missile Defense initiative for the first time. And it addresses, though does not completely resolve, the problem of the 1972 ABM Treaty, which limits defense of the homeland against strategic ballistic missiles (but does not limit theater defenses).
<p>
	The most positive and significant elements of the new Missile Defense Act are:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Section 234</b>, which accelerates Theater Missile Defense and focuses the TMD program on four "core" systems.<br>

<li><b>Section 235</b>, which calls for deployment of a ground-based National Missile Defense with multiple sites, to be operational by the year 2003. <br>

<li><b>Section 237</b>, calling for a transition from the ABM Treaty regime to a strategic doctrine that is not based on Mutual Assured Destruction, or "MAD."  It would establish a Senate Select Committee to conduct a one-year review of the Treaty's validity in today's new strategic environment, and recommend a course of action for gaining relief from the Treaty's limitations. Relief from the Treaty will be necessary before a multiple-site National Missile Defense can become operational.<br>

<li><b>Section 238</b>, which establishes an ABM Treaty "demarcation" or technical performance threshold that determines whether a BMD system is a theater defense system not limited by the Treaty or a Treaty-limited defense against "strategic ballistic missiles."  If the BMD system in question is flight-tested against a target missile with a range less than 3,500 kilometers and a velocity of less than 5 kilometers per second, then it is a theater defense system and is not covered by the Treaty. If the system is flight-tested against a target missile with a range and velocity above this threshold, then the system is a strategic defense and is covered by the Treaty.
</ul><p>
<b>LIKELY ATTACKS ON BMD IN THE SENATE</b>
<p>
	The Heritage Foundation has proposed an even more robust BMD program to meet the most critical threat to the U.S. homeland, to U.S. forces abroad, and to America's allies -- the threat of ballistic missiles. (1) While the Senate bill does not go as far as the Heritage Foundation "Team B" proposal, it still represents considerable progress toward an effective defense. For that very reason, there may be an attack by opponents of the Missile Defense Act. This would come in the form of floor amendments by Senators traditionally opposed to missile defense.
<p>
<b>Possible Amendment #1:</b> Striking or reducing recommended funding levels. The Senate bill adds $490.5 million to the Administration's budget request for the Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, for a total of $3.4 billion. This includes $45.0 million for the Navy Lower Tier system, $170.0 million for Navy Upper Tier, and $300.0 million for National Missile Defense.
<p>
<b>Recommended Response:</b> Even with these additions, a $3.4 billion BMD program represents less than 1.5 percent of the defense budget -- to meet the most serious threat to U.S. security. The U.S. has conducted BMD research for over ten years, and proven technology is now available. The time has come to build and field BMD systems to protect Americans. That requires adequate funds. 
<p>
<b>Possible Amendment #2:</b> Watering down the demarcation standard between permissible TMD and Treaty-limited strategic defenses (Section 238).
<p>
<b>Recommended Response:</b> Despite the vigorous opposition of both houses of Congress, the Administration has persisted in misguided efforts to expand the ABM Treaty to include limits on modern theater defense systems, which are more capable than the systems that existed when the Treaty entered into force in 1972. Unless the Senate wants the ABM Treaty to be become an ABM-TMD Treaty and cripple the performance of the most promising theater systems, this provision is necessary.
<p>
<b>Possible Amendment #3:</b> Eliminating the Select Committee to review the ABM Treaty (Section 237).
<p>
<b>Recommended Response:</b> Section 237 would not force the abrogation or amendment of the Treaty, though it could lead to changes in the Treaty at some future point. But the ABM Treaty is 23 years old, a relic of the Cold War. Today's strategic environment is totally different from that of 1972. Ballistic missile technology and weapons of mass destruction are proliferating worldwide, and the U.S. faces potential missile threats from many regions, not just the former Soviet Union. No treaty should be an end in itself. When the conditions that led to a treaty's ratification change, that treaty should change. The ABM Treaty itself acknowledges this principle, and contains provisions for withdrawal when it no longer serves the national interest.
<p>
<b>Possible Amendment #4:</b> Eliminating or altering a multiple-site NMD (Section 235). 
<p>
<b>Recommended Response:</b> A single NMD site -- for example, at Grand Forks, North Dakota -- would be Treaty compliant but would not protect all of the continental United States, and certainly not Alaska or Hawaii, from a missile attack in the Northern Hemisphere. Coastal regions also would be vulnerable to missiles launched from submarines or from locations in the Third World. The choice is simple:  to protect the U.S. homeland against a limited attack or remain within a treaty that is both technologically and strategically outmoded.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
	The Senate has an historic opportunity to reinvigorate the BMD program and put the United States on the path to actual defenses for the homeland and forces abroad. As President Ronald Reagan once said, "If not now, when?  If not us, who?"  But supporters of missile defense in the Senate must act boldly, steadfastly, and with vision. Otherwise the U.S. will remain mired in the failed orthodoxies of the past that have left Americans needlessly vulnerable to the most threatening weapons in the world today.<p>

<H3><I> COMBATTING TERRORISM IN THE WAKE OF THE OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBING </I></H3>

<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br> 
Executive Memorandum #410<br>
April 26, 1995.<br> 

</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>

	The horrific April 19 bombing of the Alfred P.  Murrah Federal 
Building in Oklahoma City has shocked Americans and underscored the 
vulnerability of an open society to terrorism.  The death toll of 86, 
with about 100 missing and presumed dead, makes this bombing the worst 
terrorist outrage ever committed inside the United States.  The April 
19 bombing, apparently perpetrated by domestic terrorists, reinforces 
the lessons of the February 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, in 
which foreign terrorists, some of them recent immigrants, killed 6 
Americans and injured more than a thousand.  The U.S.  needs a 
systematic and comprehensive counterterrorism policy to defend 
against, deter, prevent, and punish terrorism.  The challenge to the 
Clinton Administration and Congress is to craft such a policy without 
eroding the constitutional rights of all Americans. 
 <P>
	President Bill Clinton has ordered the U.S.  government to study 
ways of enhancing the defenses of federal facilities against 
terrorism.  But it would be prohibitively costly, in terms of the 
federal budget and in terms of citizens' access to their government, 
to fortify all government facilities and public places against every 
terrorist threat.  Such "hardening" should be limited to the most 
likely targets, such as offices of the FBI, Drug Enforcement 
Administration, or Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. 
 <P>
	  A more fruitful and cost-effective policy would be to stop 
terrorist attacks before they can be carried out, through preventive 
policies such as the infiltration of terrorist groups and improved 
intelligence-gathering on their activities.  The FBI has had some 
success in preventing planned terrorist attacks, such as the aborted 
1993 bombings of New York City tunnels and buildings by the followers 
of Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman.  But the FBI's ability to monitor domestic 
terrorist groups has been undermined by restrictive guidelines that 
prevent it from gathering information on possible terrorist activity 
unless the group in question has committed, or is known to be 
plotting, a terrorist attack.  The guidelines on domestic 
intelligence-gathering need to be revised to permit federal law 
enforcement agencies to monitor the activities of organizations that 
clearly indicate their support of terrorism. 
 <P>
	The Clinton Administration unveiled legislation on February 10 to 
bolster U.S.  deterrence of terrorism and punish those who aid and 
abet terrorist activity.  The Omnibus Counterterrorism Act of 1995 
would outlaw fundraising in the United States in support of terrorist 
activities overseas, expedite the deportation of alien terrorists, and 
make international terrorism committed in the U.S.  a federal crime.  
This is a long-overdue step in the right direction, but Congress has 
an opportunity to strengthen U.S.  counterterrorism policy above and 
beyond these legislative proposals.  To do so, it should: 
 <P>
Improve the gathering and sharing of intelligence on terrorist groups.  
President Clinton has proposed the establishement of a domestic 
counterterrorism center under the aegis of the FBI to coordinate the 
U.S.  government's counter terrorism efforts.  Such a center is needed 
to collect, analyze, and disseminate timely information concerning 
domestic terrorist groups and the activities and immigration status of 
foreigners who have engaged in or supported terrorism.  This would 
help improve coordination among intelligence agencies, law enforcement 
authorities, and immigration officials.  Congress should work with the 
Administration to establish such a center and should maintain close 
oversight over counterterrorism programs to safeguard the individual 
liberties of all Americans.  However, the U.S.  government should have 
the righ to protect intelligence sources in deportation hearings 
against resident and illegal aliens who are suspected of terrorist 
activities. 
 <P>
Ensure that impending budget cuts will not undermine the war against 
terrorism.  Congressional appropriations committees must take care to 
avoid weakening America's defenses against terrorism --   particularly 
counterterrorism programs in the intelligence community, the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation, the State Department's Office of 
Counterterrorism, the Defense Department's Special Operations Command, 
and the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control. 
 <P>
Press the Administration to make counterterrorism a top priority in 
American foreign policy.  While the Oklahoma City bombing appears to 
be the work of domestic terrorists, it also highlights the  
vulnerability of the U.S.  to foreign terrorist attack.  Congress 
therefore should force the Administration    to drop its shortsighted 
plan to downgrade the State Department's Office of Counterterrorism, 
which spearheads international efforts to combat terrorism.  
Representative Benjamin Gilman (R-NY) has introduced H.R.  22 to 
preserve the Office on a permanent basis.  Congress also should press 
the Administration to raise the issue of terrorism in every 
appropriate bilateral and multilateral diplomatic contact, including 
the annual G-7 summits.  A series of congressional hearings on new 
trends in terrorism and the involvement of various groups and states 
in terrorist activity would highlight this threat and the high 
priority that should be assigned to fighting it.  Another vital topic 
is how to block the efforts of terrorist states such as Iran, Iraq, 
and Libya to obtain weapons of mass destruction.  A nuclear-armed Iraq 
or Iran could pose the ultimate terrorist threat. 
 <P>
Reform immigration laws to improve internal security.  Congress should 
pass legislation that enables the U.S.  government to deny visas to 
foreigners because of membership in terrorist groups.  Would-be    
terrorists now are denied entry only if the government can prove they 
have committed, or intend to     commit, terrorist acts.  These rules 
are too lax.  Moreover, tougher penalties should be imposed on the 
production or use of fraudulent passports and visas.  This includes 
giving the government the power to seize the assets of criminals 
convicted of creating or using false documents for terrorism or drug 
smuggling.  Nine of the original 35 indictable counts in the 1993 New 
York bombing involved visa or passport offenses. 
 <P>
Punish states that support terrorism on as many fronts as possible.  
The U.S.  should work with its   allies to raise the diplomatic, 
economic, political, and military costs of supporting international 
terrorism.  Although the Administration has singled out Iran as the 
world's most dangerous state sponsor of terrorism, it has not 
succeeded in persuading its allies, particularly Japan and Germany, to 
levy economic    sanctions against Tehran.  This is partly because, 
while imports of Iranian oil remain prohibited, the Clinton 
Administration has allowed American oil companies to become Iran's 
biggest customers, buying about $4.2 billion dollars of Iranian oil 
annually to supply their overseas markets.  This business-as-usual 
approach undermines American diplomatic efforts to isolate Iran and 
raise the cost of its continued support of terrorism.  Congress should 
step into this leadership vacuum, pass legislation banning American 
oil companies from purchasing Iranian oil, and call upon U.S.  allies 
to do the same as long as Iran supports terrorism.  Senator Alfonse 
D'Amato (R-NY) has introduced legislation (the Comprehensive Iran 
Sanctions Act of 1995) that would ban all U.S.  trade with Iran until 
the President determines that Iran has stopped supporting terrorism, 
ended its nuclear weapons program, and improved its human rights 
policies.  This proposal also would be a major step in signalling that 
the U.S.  is serious about fighting terrorism. 
 <P>
	The Oklahoma City tragedy demonstrates that domestic terrorists 
motivated by an extremist ideology can be just as dangerous as foreign 
terrorists.  The U.S.  government now must develop a comprehensive 
counterterrorism policy that effectively neutralizes both threats 
without infringing on the constitutional rights of all Americans.

INTRODUCTION   
<P>
     The Secretary of Defense soon will release a report outlining the
new role of nuclear weapons in protecting the national security of the
United States. Authored by a Pentagon task force headed by Assistant
Secretary of Defense for Nuclear Security and Counterproliferation
Ashton Carter, this report will make recommendations about issues
related to nuclear weapons policy. These recommendations may touch on
such important questions as nuclear strategy and doctrine, force
structure, operating procedures for nuclear weapons, safety and
reliability procedures, and the relationship between nuclear weapons
and counterproliferation and arms control policy.
<P>
     While it is impossible to predict the exact recommendations of
the task force, there are disturbing trends in Clinton Administration
defense and arms control policies that may well drive the findings of
the report. For example, the Administration is already committed to
negotiating a comprehensive ban on the testing of nuclear weapons.
This will result in a U.S. nuclear arsenal that over the long run is
neither safe nor reliable. Republican Senator Strom Thurmond of South
Carolina on April 20 accused the Administration of preparing to
eliminate intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and therefore
the so-called triad of land-, air-, and sea-based nuclear forces. If
this were to happen, it would reduce the survivability of America's
nuclear deterrent and limit U.S. ability to destroy important targets
in the event of a nuclear conflict.
<P>
     Before making these mistakes, the Carter task force should step
back and consider alternatives. As it does, the task force should
determine that:
<P>
Nuclear weapons will play an indispensable role in U.S. security
    policy for the foreseeable future.
<P>
The central purpose of strategic (long-range) nuclear weapons should
    be to deter an attack and to limit damage in the event deterrence
    fails. Thus, U.S. nuclear forces should exist in quantities
    sufficient to destroy potential enemy nuclear launch sites.
<P>
The central purpose of tactical (short-range) nuclear weapons should
    be to destroy enemy forces on the battlefield that might use
    nuclear, chemical, or biological munitions against U.S. or allied
    troops.
<P>
The nuclear operating doctrine must be flexible enough to allow for
    rapid use of strategic and tactical nuclear forces.  Confidence-
    building measures such as "de-targeting" of the weapons, which
    might slow response times, must be rejected as policy options.
<P>
The safety of the nuclear stockpile cannot be maintained without
    regular testing, including nuclear warhead detonation.
   <P>
U.S. nuclear weapons present a barrier to, not an incentive for, the
    proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass
    destruction. The reason: These weapons reassure U.S. allies that
    might otherwise seek their own nuclear arsenals. Moreover, the
    presence of these weapons provides a deterrent against regional
    bullies. 
<P>
The objective of nuclear arms control policy is to maintain strategic
    nuclear forces at a level commensurate with the number of
    strategic military and related targets to be destroyed in case of
    war. It should not be merely for reducing the number of weapons
    for its own sake.
<P>
ANSWERING SIX QUESTIONS
<P>
     Given the changes in the global security environment since the
end of the Cold War, a fresh look at the U.S. nuclear doctrine is
needed. The U.S. no longer faces a single over-arching nuclear-armed
opponent, but an increasing number of states armed with both nuclear
weapons and capable delivery systems.
<P>
     Recognizing this important change, then-Secretary of Defense Les
Aspin on October 29, 1993, appointed an internal Pentagon task force
to establish a new nuclear posture for the U.S. The task force is
chaired by Ashton Carter, who is Assistant Secretary of Defense for
Nuclear Security and Counterproliferation. The task force has been
organized into six working groups, each directed to answer one of six
questions about nuclear policy.
<P>
     Since its establishment, there have been unconfirmed reports that
the task force plans to eliminate the nuclear "triad" of land-, air-,
and sea-based strategic missiles. This would be a mistake and unlikely
to find support in Congress.
<P>
     Rather than attempting such a radical change to U.S. nuclear
doctrine, there is much the task force can do to ensure the country
retains a credible nuclear force. It could start by answering Aspin's
questions in ways that are consistent with the need to maintain a
nuclear deterrent capable of meeting U.S. security needs.
<P>
Question #1: What should be the role of nuclear weapons in the U.S.
       security posture, given the new global environment?
<P>
Answer: This question demands a clear answer that nuclear weapons
should remain an indispensable part of the U.S. military posture for
the foreseeable future. The task force should explicitly acknowledge
that nuclear weapons cannot be eliminated or otherwise disinvented.
Further, the task force should conclude that an arms control policy
aimed at zero nuclear weapons globally is not feasible or even
desirable. During the 1992 presidential campaign, Bill Clinton made it
clear that he understood this essential truth by declaring: "But as an
irreducible minimum, we must retain a survivable nuclear force to
deter any conceivable threat." (William Clinton, "A New Covenant for
American Security," Speech at Georgetown University, Washington, D.C.,
December 12, 1991.)
<P>
     In 1990, the Bush Administration stated that the primary
strategic interest of the U.S. was: "The survival of the United States
as a free and independent nation, with its fundamental values intact
and its institutions and people secure." (The White House, "National
Security Strategy of the United States," March 1990, p.  2.) This
interest is no less important today. Nuclear weapons play their role
in defending this interest by deterring any attack on the U.S. with
weapons of mass destruction and by limiting an opponent's ability to
strike American territory should deterrence fail.
<P>
     During the Cold War, a key element of strategic doctrine was a
policy of deterrence backed by an offensive strategic nuclear arsenal.
Deterrence rested on the notion that these offensive nuclear weapons,
if used in retaliation for an attack on the U.S., would impose such a
high cost on the would-be aggressor that he would not consider
attacking in the first place. Known as Mutual Assured Destruction,
this policy rested on the assumption that the superpowers would avoid
the risk of self-destruction which a nuclear first strike would
certainly bring.
<P>
     In short, deterrence policy rested on psychological assumptions.
It depended on affecting the thinking of foreign leaders. The doctrine
postulated that these foreign leaders were rational in terms of
assessing the costs and benefits of taking certain military actions
and in full control of their countries' strategic nuclear arsenals. In
the bipolar world of the time, deterrence policy sought to achieve
stability by ensuring that both the U.S. and the Soviet Union retained
a retaliatory strategic nuclear capacity such that each could impose
unacceptable damage on the other.
<P>
     The question facing U.S. nuclear planners today is whether this
Cold War notion of deterrence is an appropriate nuclear policy for the
future. The answer is almost certainly no. The future is likely to be
marked by foreign leaders who have radically different outlooks on
security and who may have only tenuous control over their strategic
nuclear arsenals. Should U.S. security, indeed survival, rest on the
daily thought processes of Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a potential future
president of Russia? What if dictators in Iran, Libya, or North Korea
obtain long-range delivery systems and nuclear weapons? How would Cold
War deterrence policy address the security implications of civil
strife within post-Cold War Russia?
<P>
     Since Cold War deterrence policy alone is not suited to
addressing security concerns in the new era, what should replace it?
The answer is a policy that seeks to destroy the means of attack on
the United States, combined with an effective defense against enemy
nuclear attack. The ultimate goal of this new policy should be, in
case of attack, to limit the damage inflicted on the U.S., its people,
and institutions to the greatest extent possible. A strategic policy
that seeks to protect the homeland in this manner is often referred to
as a damage limitation strategy. Under this strategy, U.S. security is
not as dependent on the intentions and whims of foreign leaders.
<P>
The Role of Defense. One of the unfortunate aspects of Cold War
nuclear policy was that it sought to define deterrence in a way that
was incompatible with defense. It did so by asserting that strategic
defensive measures were inherently "destabilizing" because they would
undermine the balance of terror brought about by vulnerability. This
was the thinking behind the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which
greatly limited the superpowers' ability to defend against ballistic
missile attack. This strategic philosophy also led to widespread
opposition to President Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative. 
<P>
     But in the post-Cold War world of multiple potential nuclear
threats, this anti-defense philosophy no longer makes sense. The
greatest nuclear threat to the U.S. is now a single or few nuclear
warheads delivered in a relatively crude fashion from a Third World
nuclear power or an errant launch from rogue elements in the former
Soviet Union. Such potential nuclear threats cannot be deterred in the
same way the Soviet Union was during the Cold War. The strict
rationale behind the strategic military policies of the two
superpowers during Cold War are not applicable to a multipolar world.
Further, accidental or unauthorized strikes, by their nature, are
undeterrable.
<P>
     A clear strategy of defense has its own value as a deterrent. A
foreign leader is going to have little incentive to launch an attack
on the U.S. when it is likely to be blunted. Now more than ever,
America needs to combine strategic nuclear defense with a robust (if
much smaller by Cold War standards) offensive nuclear capability.
<P>
     Regarding tactical, or so-called battlefield, nuclear weapons,
their role in the nuclear doctrine will be closer to the one that they
played during the Cold War. They should be used to counter the
advantage an enemy force might otherwise gain on the battlefield
through using weapons of mass destruction. Given this central purpose,
the U.S. must reserve the right to use tactical nuclear weapons if its
forces are subject to attack with chemical, biological, or nuclear
weapons. 
<P>
Question #2: What sort of nuclear force structure does the nation
       require and what missions should be assigned to nuclear forces?
<P>
Answer: The central mission for strategic nuclear weapons should be to
destroy the facilities an enemy would require to launch an attack
against the U.S. The central mission for tactical nuclear weapons
should be to destroy enemy forces on the battlefield that otherwise
might use weapons of mass destruction against U.S. troops.
<P>
     In designing a nuclear force capable of implementing this
strategy, Pentagon planners must first establish the number of global
targets to be covered by U.S. strategic and tactical nuclear weapons.
This force structure should be designed to have the capability to
destroy the designated targets in a timely fashion.
<P>
     Strategic Nuclear Forces. At the end of 1993, there were 1,809
long-range (strategic) nuclear delivery systems in the world,
excluding the 1,124 held by the U.S. These include 1,052
intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), 656 submarine-launched
ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and 101 long-range bombers. (These
strategic weapons are either in the possession of or located on the
territory of the following countries:  Belarus, Britain, China,
France, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine.) Taken together, these
delivery systems are capable of carrying 9,585 nuclear warheads. In
addition to the 1,809 delivery systems, there are some 25 strategic
submarine and long-range bomber bases. Further, there are about 800
non-weapon strategic targets. (This figure is estimated.  While global
strategic arsenals are described in considerable detail in open
literature, non-weapons targets have not been widely discussed.  This
estimate is derived from unclassified sources that have described U.S. 
nuclear targeting plans from an historical perspective, including: 
Desmond Ball and Jeffrey Richelson, eds., Strategic Nuclear Targeting
(Ithaca, New York:  Cornell University Press, 1986) and William C. 
Martel and Paul L.  Savage, Strategic Nuclear War:  What the
Superpowers Target and Why (New York:  Greenwood Press, 1986).) These
non-weapon targets include command and control centers, nuclear
storage sites, and some industrial facilities.
<P>
     Since it will take time to field a damage-limitation strategic
force of offensive and defensive weapons, as many as 100 urban centers
should be targeted as well. Until the U.S. is confident it can defend
itself against attack with this combination of offensive and defensive
forces, it must be able to hold the enemy's society hostage. These
urban targets are the legacy of a Cold War policy that all but barred
the deployment of effective strategic defenses.
<P>
     There are around 2,700 facilities and cities on the U.S.
strategic target list (see chart 1). Not all these targets, however,
are suitable to offensive operations. Missile submarines at sea and
heavy bombers expected to be airborne prior to the commencement of
hostilities, for example, cannot be targeted with offensive nuclear
weapons. When these elements are removed, the strategic nuclear target
list should number between 1,900 and 2,000. (Removing ballistic
missile submarines at sea from the strategic nuclear target list means
that no British or French forces are on the list.  British and French
strategic weapons, however, should remain on the strategic target list
for the purpose of addressing accidental or unauthorized launches.  On
this basis, they may be targeted by U.S.  strategic defenses in the
future.)
<P>
     U.S. nuclear weapons should be targeted on these weapons,
facilities, and urban centers and not, as the Clinton Administration
intends, on either nothing or open ocean. (During a meeting with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow on January 14, President
Clinton signed a joint declaration that commits the U.S.  to remove
targeting information from the Trident I, Trident II, and MX strategic
missiles.  The remaining Minuteman III missiles are to be targeted on
open ocean.  This "de-targeting" is to be implemented no later than
May 30, 1994.) The Clinton Administration's "de-targeting" policy
implies that there are no targets against which strategic nuclear
weapons can be directed. By this line of reasoning, there is scant
justification for maintaining a strategic nuclear arsenal at all.
<P>
     Maintaining the Triad. The force structure needed to cover these
targets should continue to be based on the triad of air, land, and
sea-based strategic weapons. Not only is a triad the most survivable
posture against preemptive strikes and a hedge against new
technological developments, but it also offers the greatest
flexibility in striking military targets. ICBMs and SLBMs can be
delivered rapidly and with great accuracy. Long-range bombers can be
called back if there is uncertainty during a crisis. Penetrating
bombers can destroy mobile strategic targets such as the SS-25 Sickle
ICBM over enemy territory.
<P>
     The strategic nuclear force structure required to hold these
1,900 to 2,000 targets at risk resembles the existing U.S. strategic
nuclear arsenal. (All recommended forces in this paper are deployed
forces.  Therefore they exclude those additional weapons kept in
storage for replacement and testing purposes.) At of the end of 1993,
the U.S. fielded 550 Minuteman III and MX ICBMs, 440 Trident I and
Trident II SLBMs, and 190 B-1B Lancer and B-52 Stratofortress long-
range bombers. This force is capable of delivering 7,900 warheads.
("U.S.  Strategic Nuclear Forces, End of 1993," Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists, January/February 1994, p.  65.) Since three warheads per
target should be sufficient to cover the necessary number of targets,
the U.S. should at a minimum maintain an arsenal of around 6,000
deliverable warheads, not counting the roughly 1,700 warheads deployed
on submarines in port.
<P>
     This establishes a three-to-one ratio of deployed warheads to
targets. Doing this is necessary because some hardened targets -- ICBM
silos, for example -- will require more than one warhead to ensure
destruction. Moreover, this ratio assures that all targets can be
covered even after an initial enemy strike has destroyed a portion of
the U.S. retaliatory arsenal. Finally, the three-to-one ratio allows
redundancy in case some U.S. strategic weapons do not perform as
designed.
<P>
     This strategic nuclear force presumes the existing ICBM force of
500 Minuteman III and 50 MX missiles will continue to be deployed.
Between them they carry 2,000 warheads. This will require that the
Minuteman III force undergo a service life extension program (SLEP)
later this decade. The submarine force should move toward deploying 18
Trident submarines, although all should be fitted with the modern and
more accurate Trident II missile. This submarine force will be capable
of delivering 3,456 warheads. But because only half of these boats are
likely to be at sea at any one time, only 1,728 warheads can be
counted against the target set. The bomber force should be maintained
at its current level, capable of delivering 2,800 warheads. This means
that B-52 bombers should be taken out of the strategic arsenal only as
B-2 bombers are deployed and that the B-1 bombers retain their
strategic nuclear role (see chart 2).
<P>
     Strategic Defenses Still Needed. But strategic nuclear weapons
alone are not enough to execute a damage-limitation strategy. They are
not suited for countering ballistic missile submarines at sea. The
same is true of countering long-range bombers already in flight. Most
important, they cannot counter ballistic missiles, whether ground-
based or submarine-based, once they are in flight. This is why
strategic defenses will play an indispensable, and eventually
dominant, role in the U.S. strategic force posture.
<P>
     Since strategic defenses and related weapons are not nuclear-
armed, they fall outside the scope of the Pentagon review. But their
impact on the strategic nuclear posture should still be considered.
For example, if the U.S. deploys the Global Protection Against Limited
Strikes (GPALS) anti-missile system proposed by the Bush
Administration, the U.S. strategic offensive arsenal could be reduced
by as many as 600 warheads. (The GPALS system included ground-based
and space-based weapons and sensors to counter accidental and
unauthorized strikes launched by the former Soviet Union and
purposeful strikes by lesser powers on the U.S., its allies, and
forces in the field.) This is because the GPALS system is designed to
destroy up to 200 warheads delivered by missiles. If these 200
warheads were deployed on the Russian single-warhead SS-25 Sickle
ICBM, then 200 weapons on the U.S. nuclear target list could be
removed. 
<P>
     Reducing the targeting list by 200 means that 600 U.S. nuclear
warheads could be removed from the arsenal. The same logic applies to
air defense systems, which can counter bombers and cruise missiles,
and attack submarines, which can counter SLBMs before they are
launched. Likewise, to the extent arms control reduces the number of
targets in the set, even fewer nuclear weapons may be required.
<P>
     Unfortunately, America's current strategic defense posture, with
the exception of the attack submarine force, is so feeble that it can
make only a limited contribution toward a damage-limitation force. But
as satellite technology and communications continue to improve, the
refusal to develop missile defense systems becomes less and less
sensible. Missile defenses will lead to a reduction of nuclear forces
needed to maintain a credible deterrent. 
<P>
     If America were to adopt a damage-limitation strategy, what might
its strategic nuclear force look like at the end of the first decade
of the next millennium? For the sake of comparison, assume that the
global threat remains at today's level. That means starting with a
strategic nuclear target list of 1,977 targets. First, all 100 urban
targets can be removed from the list, thereby reducing the target list
to 1,877. Of the remaining 1,877 targets, approximately 1,000 are
weapons targets. Further, assume strategic defenses can cover roughly
half, or 500, of these weapons targets. This leaves 500 weapons
targets on the U.S. list. If the non-weapon targets are added back,
the total number of U.S. nuclear targets would be 1,300. 
<P>
     Because strategic defenses will improve dramatically the
survivability of the offensive force, the weapon-to-target ratio can
safely be reduced from three weapons per target to two. Thus, instead
of some 4,000 warheads to destroy the 1,300 targets on the nuclear
list, the U.S. strategic nuclear force will require only 2,600
warheads. When the roughly 1,300 warheads mounted on submarines in
port are added, the total force numbers are around 4,000. This would
reduce the U.S. strategic nuclear arsenal by 3,700 from the current
force of 7,900. These warheads would be distributed as follows: 1) 500
warheads on 50 MX missiles; 2) 500 warheads on a new single-warhead
ICBM; 3) 2,592 warheads on 432 Trident II SLBMs (18 Trident
submarines); and, 4) 640 warheads on 40 B-2 bombers (see chart 3).
This smaller nuclear force would serve to complement defensive forces
in protecting U.S. territory.
<P>
     This force structure carries several important implications for
strategic nuclear modernization. The damage limitation strategy
requires that rapid delivery and accuracy be paramount. Therefore, the
accurate and fast MX missile force should be retained. In addition, a
new ICBM is needed that is not only accurate, but has the capability
of targeting mobile missiles. The entire Trident submarine force
should be deployed with the more accurate Trident II missile, although
the number of warheads mounted on each missile can be reduced from
eight to six. This means retrofitting those Trident submarines
currently equipped with the Trident I missile. Finally, it means
making sure that the B-2 bomber force has the guidance and targeting
systems required to destroy mobile missiles. It also suggests that 20
B-2 bombers be added to the plan fleet of 20 in order to maintain the
airborne element of the triad. This B-2 force will be capable of
searching out and destroying mobile targets in significant numbers. 
<P>
     Tactical Nuclear Forces. The tactical nuclear force structure
needs to include adequate numbers of low-yield weapons to counter the
most potent army fielded by any regional adversary the U.S. may face.
The central mission of the tactical nuclear force is to counter any
battlefield advantage an adversary may gain from striking U.S. and
allied forces with weapons of mass destruction. To meet this
objective, the U.S. must be able to target large concentrations of
conventional forces with tactical nuclear weapons.
<P>
     The most potent regional army the U.S. could face is Russia's.
Russian forces retain as many as 3,800 operational tactical nuclear
weapons. ("Estimated Russian (CIS) Nuclear Stockpile," Bulletin of the
Atomic Scientists, July/August 1993, p.  57.) It is also certain that
Russia possesses chemical and biological weapons. Russia may possess
50,000 tons of chemical agents. (Ronald F.  Lehman, "Concluding the
Chemical Weapons Convention," in Chemical Disarmament and U.S. 
Security (Boulder, Colorado:  Westview Press, 1992), p.  4.) While
there is scant public information about the size of the Russian
biological weapons program, the Bush Administration described it as
"massive." (U.S.  Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, "Adherence To
and Compliance With Arms Control Agreements and the President's Report
To Congress on Soviet Noncompliance With Arms Control Agreements,"
January 14, 1993, p.  14.) 
<P>
     Using a Russian standard for measuring U.S. tactical nuclear
force requirements does not mean that a U.S.-Russian conflict is
likely. Nevertheless, U.S. force structure should continue to be based
upon capabilities rather than intent, as the latter can change
rapidly. Indeed, with extremists like Vladimir Zhirinovsky waiting in
the wings, the possibility of Russian aggression in either Asia or
Europe cannot be discounted entirely.
<P>
     The U.S. tactical nuclear force should include: 1,000 Air Force
air-to-surface missiles (both air-launched cruise missiles and short-
range attack missiles), 500 Navy sea-launched nuclear-armed cruise
missiles, and 1,000 bombs deployed on both Air Force and Navy aircraft
(see chart 4). This number should deter not only Russian use of
tactical nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, but
also those of any other potential enemy in a regional conflict. In the
latter cases, this tactical nuclear force will prove adequate by a
considerable margin. (In the future the U.S.  may want to alter design
of its tactical nuclear arsenal.  For example, a new low-yield,
nuclear-armed cruise missile may be better suited for use in regional
conflicts than the existing cruise missiles.  The U.S.  should not
hesitate to develop and deploy new generations of tactical nuclear
weapons, as necessary.)
<P>
     As with strategic forces, defenses against aircraft, missiles,
chemical weapons, and biological weapons will play an essential role
in the U.S. force posture. This is because these defensive systems
will bolster allies in opposing regional aggressors possessing such
weapons and provide protection to U.S. and allied forces on the
battlefield. Thus, the U.S. will have to deploy systems like the
Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) weapon and the CorpsSAM
system. THAAD is being designed to down short- and intermediate-range
ballistic missiles, while CorpsSAM will destroy cruise missiles and
strike aircraft. Further, the U.S. will have to improve not only the
garments and masks used to protect its troops against chemical agents,
but the system for inoculating troops against biological agents.
<P>
Question #3: What operating procedures should govern the nation's
       nuclear forces?
<P>
Answer #3: U.S. nuclear forces should be able to wipe out enemy
strategic forces rapidly enough to limit damage to U.S. territory.
This requires the ability to destroy enemy strategic forces held in
reserve after a first strike.
<P>
     The temptation has been for the U.S. to lower the alert status of
its strategic nuclear force as the Cold War winds down. This trend
should be stopped. There should be a limit on the numbers of strategic
nuclear forces that can be taken off alert. The President's Nuclear
Initiative (PNI) announced by George Bush on September 27, 1991, took
off alert all strategic nuclear weapons scheduled for deactivation
under the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START). Further, the entire
bomber force was taken off alert. While these steps were appropriate,
further steps in this direction would not be. The bulk of U.S.
strategic nuclear forces, specifically the Minuteman III ICBMs, the MX
ICBMs and the Trident SLBM force must remain at high states of
readiness. This level of readiness must be backed by a robust,
redundant, and survivable strategic command and control system. Under
these circumstances, U.S. strategic forces will be prepared to make a
valuable contribution toward limiting damage to the U.S. in the event
of conflict.
<P>
     Tactical nuclear weapons should never be treated like
conventional munitions. Navy and Air Force tactical nuclear weapons
should, as has been the practice, be managed under a stricter command
and control structure than that applied to conventional weapons. For
example, launch procedures for tactical nuclear weapons must continue
to include two-person validation of launch orders, which can come only
from the commanders at higher echelons than unit commanding officers.
The decision to use nuclear weapons will have political ramifications.
Authority to use them should never be delegated to ship or aircraft
commanders. The Bush Administration went so far as to withdraw all
ground-based tactical nuclear weapons from forward-deployed units in
Europe and Asia. This is appropriate. There is no reason for either
the Army or the Marine Corps to retain a nuclear function. The chaotic
environment of close combat is no place for nuclear weapons.
<P>
     But Bush also decided to withdraw tactical nuclear weapons from
U.S. ships and store these weapons in the U.S. This was a mistake.
These weapons should remain on board ships and normal training cycles
resumed. The Navy has a decades-old record of zero nuclear accidents,
which was the result of constant training and readiness. Moreover, the
Navy's traditional role of rapid response would be restricted in the
event of a short-notice crisis if ships first had to be sent to
ammunition depots to be re-armed with tactical nuclear weapons.
<P>
     Given proper concerns about the control and use of tactical
nuclear weapons, deployments should favor "stand-off" platforms such
as Navy ships and Air Force bombers. This means that strikes behind
enemy lines should, to the extent possible, be conducted with tactical
nuclear weapons launched from considerable distances. These include
nuclear air - and sea-launched cruise missiles with low-yield
warheads, such as the Tomahawk. Such a policy would limit, although
not eliminate, the use of nuclear munitions on strike aircraft. This
will minimize the chances that nuclear weapons will fall into enemy
hands.
<P>
Question #4: What safety requirements should be established for
       nuclear forces?
<P>
Answer #4: Maintaining the safety and reliability of nuclear weapons
will require continued weapons tests. Former Secretary of Defense
James Schlesinger complained in a July 12, 1993, Wall Street Journal
column: "People who would not let their lawnmowers go untested for
more than a year argue with apparent seriousness that nuclear weapons
can go untested and stay reliable." (James Schlesinger, "Clinton
Defers a Necessity -- Nuclear Testing," The Wall Street Journal, July
12, 1993.)
<P>
     Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration is already committed to
negotiating a comprehensive ban on nuclear tests. This comes at a time
when Congress has imposed a moratorium on testing. Although the law
contained a procedure for allowing the moratorium to lapse if another
country conducted a test, the Administration chose to make the
moratorium a unilateral measure when it ignored an October 5, 1993,
nuclear test by the Chinese.
<P>
     In addition to ensuring the reliability of the existing
stockpile, testing has other important and practical uses. Nuclear
tests will be required to field new systems as previous generations of
weapons become old and obsolete. No testing means no modernization,
which means, ultimately, no nuclear stockpile. Moreover, testing is
used to "harden" conventional weapons and non-nuclear defenses by
exposing them to the effects of nuclear explosions. If these systems
are not hardened, a regional adversary will be tempted to explode a
nuclear weapon in the air in order to knock out these non-nuclear
systems. (The U.S.  ability to produce semiconductors that are
hardened against the radiation emitted by nuclear weapons is
weakening.  For a discussion of this alarming problem, see:  Lt.  Col. 
Bill Swiderek, "Evaluating the Viability of Rad-Hard Fab Lines,"
Military & Aerospace Electronics, September 20, 1993, pp.  4, 14-15.)
<P>
     Since the safety, reliability, modernization, and hardening are
all dependent upon testing, the Administration's test ban policy
effectively commits the nation to a policy of no nuclear weapons over
the long term. This is because nuclear weapons that can no longer be
certified as safe or reliable -- which can be assured only through
testing -- will have to be withdrawn from the stockpile. Eventually,
even the most modern weapons will be withdrawn and the U.S. will have
no deployable nuclear weapons. Indeed, to the extent that the Clinton
Administration's policy toward a comprehensive nuclear test ban will
require withdrawing large numbers of weapons from the stockpile, the
policy preempts the findings of the nuclear posture review. If over
the long term the U.S. will have no nuclear weapons, they will thus
have no role in maintaining the nation's security and Aspin's six
questions are moot.
<P>
     Another question related to safety is how to prevent or counter
the unauthorized or accidental launch of nuclear-armed weapons.
Unfortunately, this legitimate concern is leading to some short-
sighted proposals. One strategic theorist at the Brookings
Institution, for example, has proposed separating all warheads from
their delivery systems. (Bruce G.  Blair, "Russia's Doomsday Machine,"
The New York Times, October 8, 1993, p.  A35.) This concern also
prompted the Clinton Administration to adopt its ill-advised "de-
targeting" policy. Proposals such as these would render the U.S.
strategic nuclear force unable to meet its most important strategic
objective: to limit the damage to the U.S. caused by a nuclear attack
on it. If nuclear weapons cannot be relied upon quickly in a period of
rising tension, they have little deterrent value and perhaps no
military value. 
<P>
Question #5: What is the relationship between U.S. nuclear policy and
       counterproliferation policy?
<P>
Answer #5: The only proper answer is that U.S. nuclear weapons are
needed to counter nuclear proliferation.
<P>
     The popular wisdom is that the very existence of nuclear forces
encourages proliferation as other nations try to obtain such weapons.
Contrary to popular wisdom, though, the U.S. nuclear force makes a
valuable contribution to the global counterproliferation effort; this
is why the U.S. is designated as a nuclear power in the NPT. In the
absence of a U.S. nuclear force, Germany, Japan, and other non-nuclear
allies would feel compelled to obtain nuclear weapons if the U.S.
nuclear umbrella were removed. One anonymous Japanese official told
reporters last year that Japan might consider building a nuclear
arsenal if there were a rupture in the U.S.-Japanese security
relationship, which is bolstered by the U.S. nuclear guarantee. (Jacob
M.  Schlesinger, "Nuclear Arms:  Tokyo Hesitates To Say Never," The
Wall Street Journal, July 12, 1993, p.  A8.)
<P>
     There are other contributions the U.S. nuclear arsenal makes to
countering proliferation. Hostile countries wishing to obtain nuclear
weapons and other weapons of mass destruction will be emboldened to do
so if the U.S. nuclear presence is reduced or removed. Regional
bullies would be able to alter the balance of power by obtaining
nuclear weapons. In short, the removal of U.S. nuclear forces would
increase the value of nuclear weapons to would-be proliferators.
<P>
Question #6: What is the relationship between U.S. nuclear policy and
       arms control policy, particularly regarding the states of the
       former Soviet Union?
<P>
Answer #6: A damage-limitation nuclear strategy links the number of
enemy targets to the size of the U.S. force. Therefore, as arms
control reduces the numbers of these targets, so, too, can the size of
the U.S. nuclear force be reduced. Further, the more arms control
restraints on strategic defenses are lifted, the less central a role
offensive nuclear weapons will play in limiting damage to U.S.
territory. This is because strategic defenses will cover the targets
that would otherwise be left to offensive weapons.
<P>
     Nuclear policy and arms control policy are mutually reinforcing.
The more arms control succeeds in shrinking the target list, the fewer
strategic nuclear weapons the U.S. will need. Therefore, lifting of
the virtual ban imposed by the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty on
defenses against long-range missiles would be an incentive for greater
reductions of offensive nuclear arms.
<P>
     By way of example, U.S. targeting requirements could be reduced
by some 20 percent through the implementation of START I, as long as
countries other than Russia did not deploy additional strategic
weapons. (This conclusion assumes that the Russians deployed 726 ICBMs
under START I, which they would be allowed to do.  This would be a
reduction in the weapons target list of 266 and the non-weapons target
list by perhaps 110.)The impact of START II would be even more
dramatic. If the Russians ultimately deployed 500 single-warhead ICBMs
under START II, which they are allowed to do, U.S. weapons targets
could be cut from 1,077 to 685, and non-weapons targets from 900 to
650. Thus, as a result of START II, the strategic nuclear target list
could be reduced by 642 targets (see chart 5).
<P>
     A note of caution about strategic nuclear arms control is
warranted. The U.S. should proceed down the road of eliminating its
offensive arsenal only as it becomes clear that the targets -- the
strategic weapons of the former Soviet Union and the infrastructure to
support them -- are actually being eliminated. Otherwise, the U.S.
will find it impossible to meet its targeting requirements. START I
has not even come into full force, yet the U.S. is rapidly approaching
START I force levels. Secretary of Defense William Perry has announced
that the U.S. will delay reductions to the START II level until Russia
"undertakes comparable reductions." (Secretary of Defense William
Perry, Address at George Washington University, March 14, 1994.) This
is wise because it is far from clear that the Russian parliament will
agree to the ratification of START II.
<P>
     An important arms control consideration, of course, involves the
fate of the ABM Treaty. This treaty prohibits the deployment of a
missile defense system for the full-scale protection of U.S.
territory. Further, it restricts the development and deployment of
defenses against short-range missiles even though it was never
intended to do so. The ABM Treaty stands as a barrier to the
implementation of this damage-limitation strategy. Comprehensive anti-
missile defenses are essential to the strategy. Moreover, it bans the
deployment of the most effective theater defenses technological
advances would otherwise allow.
<P>
     Under these circumstances, the Clinton Administration needs to
press the Russians and other countries to participate in negotiations
to replace the ABM Treaty. The object of these negotiations should be
to establish a cooperative arrangement for the deployment of anti-
missile defenses. Thus far, the Administration has chosen to support
continued application of the ABM Treaty. This will mean a future with
more rather than fewer nuclear weapons worldwide.
<P>

CONCLUSION
<P>
     During the Cold War, nuclear weapons served as the central pillar
of U.S. security policy. As the world moves beyond the Cold War, an
opportunity has arisen to make these destructive weapons less
important to U.S. security. Doing so will require a shift in U.S.
nuclear strategy and policy. Instead of striving to destroy an
adversary with a nuclear attack, which was the purpose of U.S. Cold
War strategy, the U.S. should develop a strategy that focuses on
ensuring its own survival. This shift in policy will require the
deployment of extensive strategic defenses to counter strategic
nuclear weapons. Regarding battlefield contingencies, it means using
tactical nuclear weapons only in response to the use of weapons of
mass destruction by the enemy and only for specific military purposes.
Extensive battlefield missile defenses will be required as well.
<P>
     While this policy will not result in the complete elimination of
nuclear weapons, the world will still be able to issue a collective
sigh of relief. As Ronald Reagan noted, Mutual Assured Destruction is
just "mad," and the future U.S. nuclear doctrine should say so.

Executive Memorandum No. 441<br>
December 7, 1995<br>
<hr size = 3 width = 30%>
<p></center>

The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1995, similar versions of which were passed by the House and Senate on September 21 and October 19, respectively, would allow U.S. citizens whose property was confiscated by Fidel Castro to seek compensation in U.S. courts from foreign businesses that now operate on this property. To avoid a threatened Democratic filibuster, the Act's Senate sponsor, Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms (R-NC), agreed to remove Title III, which enables U.S. citizens to use U.S. courts to seek compensation for their confiscated properties. Title III is the backbone of the bill and should be re-inserted during the conference committee process.
<p>
When Fidel Castro rose to power in 1959, one of his first acts was to outlaw private property and transfer all private-sector assets to the state. As a result, many U.S. companies with manufacturing plants, offices, and other places of business in Cuba were expelled without being compensated for their lost property. Today, in an effort to save his drowning communist economy, Castro intends to sell these properties to investors from Canada, Mexico, Spain, and other countries. Under Title III, U.S. companies whose properties were stolen by Castro could act to discourage foreigners from operating and buying their property by seeking compensation through the U.S. court system.
<p>

<b>The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act</b>
<p>
There are three main titles in the Cuba bill:<p>
<ul><li>Title I strengthens international sanctions against the Castro regime by urging the President to seek an international embargo in the United Nations Security Council. In addition, this title prohibits indirect financing of Castro by U.S. citizens through loans or lines of credit for business ventures using confiscated U.S. property. It also requires the President to oppose Cuban membership in such international financial institutions as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund until a transitional government is established with a system in place to hold democratic elections.
<p>
<li>Title II specifically instructs the President to develop a strategy to support Cuba's transition to a democratically elected government.
<p>
<li>Title III seeks to protect the interests of U.S. citizens whose property was seized by the Castro regime without due compensation. American citizens could seek restitution from potential foreign investors through the U.S. legal system.
</ul><P>
The House version of the Cuba bill includes all three titles. However, the Senate dropped Title III to prevent a threatened Democratic filibuster and bring the bill to the floor for a vote. <p>

<b>Stolen Property and Ill-Gotten Gains</b>
<p>
U.S. companies have registered close to 6,000 claims related to Cuban confiscation of American property with the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission in the Department of Justice. These claims, including 6 percent simple interest, nominally are worth almost $6 billion. However, in today's dollars, they would be worth some $10 billion. Some examples:
<p>
Colgate-Palmolive Company. Colgate-Palmolive owned a soap and detergent manufacturing facility in Cuba before the 1959 revolution. When Castro seized power, Colgate's property was confiscated by the state. Foreign investors from the United Kingdom reportedly are trying to buy this property.<p>

Owens-Illinois Incorporated. This U.S. glass manufacturer owned and operated a glass and bottle production facility in Cuba before Castro's revolution. The property was confiscated by the Cuban state. Foreign investors from Mexico reportedly are trying to buy this property.<p>

Freeport-McMoran Incorporated. This U.S. company owned a nickel mining facility in Cuba. Today, foreign investors from Canada reportedly are trying to buy this property.<p>

ITT Corporation. This American company owned a telecommunications facility in Cuba before the revolution. Today, foreign investors from Mexico reportedly are trying to buy this property.<p>

<b>Protecting American Property Rights</b>
<p>
Critics argue that Title III is intended to enable exiled Cubans to reclaim their stolen property. In reality, it seeks to guarantee the property rights of Americans regardless of whether they are of Cuban origin. Nearly half of the 6,000 certified property claims filed against Cuba have been registered by some of America's largest companies. <p>

Critics also argue that handling these claims will clog U.S. courts. This is not true. To get a property claim to court under this bill, a claimant must meet a number of stringent conditions: 1) the claimant must be a U.S. citizen; 2) the disputed claim must be valued at over $50,000; 3) a foreign investor must occupy the disputed property after the bill is enacted (thus, the bill is not retroactive); 4) a foreign investor must be given 180 days to vacate the disputed property; and 5) a foreign investor laying claim to U.S. property must hold assets within the continental U.S. before he can be sued in a U.S. court. Only after all of these conditions are met may a U.S. claimant seek action in U.S. courts. Under these strict conditions, most of the 6,000 claims will not be brought to court.<p>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1995 is intended to protect the property rights of U.S. citizens whose property was confiscated by Castro without compensation. Foreign investors operating on these properties have disregarded the rights of U.S. citizens. These rights are recognized by U.S. and international law; they should be recognized by the U.S. Congress as well. It is time not only to end the injustice which Castro started over three decades ago, but to prevent foreign companies from unfairly and undeservedly profiting from Castro's crime.<p><p>

<B> INTRODUCTION</B>
<P>
     The Administration last spring released additional information on
President Clinton's "voluntary" 44-point plan to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions in the United States to 1990 levels by the year 2000. (When
the plan was unveiled in October 1993, the media and Administration
officials referred to it as containing 50 points or initiatives,
instead of the correct figure of 44. Even the President used the
50-point figure. The confusion stems from statements, made repeatedly
in the official plan and elsewhere, that there are "almost" or "about"
50 initiatives.) This plan is designed to address the potential threat
of global warming, or the enhanced greenhouse effect, which is the
unproved theory that man-made emissions will raise the temperature of
the Earth's atmosphere. The President's plan, as outlined, would be a
mistake for the United States and should be reviewed carefully by
Congress, the media, and the public.
<P>
     The Administration's calculation of costs and benefits is flawed
for at least five reasons:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> The plan would impose more than $60 billion of unnecessary costs on
   the economy over six years.<P>
It likely would not achieve its objective.<P>
It would not, in fact, be voluntary as the Administration claims. <P>
Most qualified scientists believe catastrophic global warming
  is improbable.<P>
There are better ways to address any threat which may exist.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     In recent years, numerous research studies have contributed to
the body of knowledge of the effects of greenhouse gases on the
planet's atmosphere. These efforts continue today, with well over $1
billion spent annually on climate research. As knowledge grows more
sophisticated, however, dire predictions are being scaled back. In
fact, many of the theories upon which the belief in global warming was
based have been shown simply to be wrong. For instance, contrary to
popular opinion, satellite data show the average temperature has not
risen in the last 15 years. Instead of rushing to expensive,
ineffective, and perhaps wasteful action, policy makers should ask one
fundamental question: should the priority be to take action based on
ignorance or to lessen this ignorance through continued scientific
research? Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration has embraced the
former option.
<P>

<B> WHAT IS GLOBAL WARMING?</B>
<P>
The theory of global warming holds that man-made gases will warm up
the Earth's atmosphere, thereby endangering life on the planet. While
most Americans have heard of this theory, few understand it, and there
is widespread confusion between global warming and another term, the
"greenhouse effect."  The greenhouse effect refers to the Earth's
release of certain gases, called greenhouse gases, which enable the
atmosphere to retain some of the heat received from the sun instead of
reflecting all of it back out into space. These gases -- which include
carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxide, and water vapor -- thus have
the same effect as glass in a greenhouse, keeping the Earth at a
higher average temperature, and a more even temperature, than would be
the case without them. 
<P>
     The greenhouse effect maintains a temperature which allows plant
and animal life to exist. Contrary to popular belief, all scientists
agree that the greenhouse effect is desirable; without it, life as we
know it would cease because global temperatures would plummet to an
average of -18C, or 0F. Explains Patrick Michaels, State
Climatologist for the Commonwealth of Virginia, the statement that all
scientists agree that the greenhouse effect is real "is about as
profound as a statement that all scientists agree that the Earth is
round." (Patrick Michaels, "Apocalypse Not Now: Science, Politics, and
Global Warming (Part 1)," National Chamber Foundation, U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, March 1992.)
<P>
     The theory of global warming (technically known as the "enhanced
greenhouse effect"), on the other hand, rests on the claim that
certain gases released by human activity warm the planet significantly
beyond normal greenhouse levels. These gases include carbon dioxide
and other greenhouse gases that are released naturally into the
atmosphere, (Water vapor, the primary greenhouse gas, is not increased
by human activity. Water vapor and clouds account for 98 percent of
the greenhouse effect.) along with chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), man-
made gases, associated chiefly with refrigeration, that do not occur
in nature. The need for the National Action Plan was premised on the
belief that gases produced by human activity over time will increase
the greenhouse effect, leading to undesirable changes in weather
patterns, crop failures, flooding, and other damaging effects that it
would take decades to reverse. Thus, the Administration argues, action
must be taken now.
<P>

<B> THE CLINTON PLAN
</B><P>
The Climate Change Action Plan to reduce greenhouse gases was
announced by President Bill Clinton in October 1993, and an
explanatory supplement was released in late March 1994. (The Climate
Change Action Plan (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office,
October 1993) and Office of Policy, Planning, and Program Evaluation,
U.S. Department of Energy, The Climate Change Action Plan: Technical
Supplement (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, March
1994).) The plan is to form the cornerstone of the U.S. commitment to
the international Framework Convention on Climate Change. This
international agreement, which requires that a National Action Plan be
developed and submitted, was signed by President George Bush in June
1992 and became effective this year. It requires that countries reduce
greenhouse gas emissions eventually to 1990 levels and that some
progress be made by the year 2000. But President Clinton has pledged
his commitment that the United States will attain the full 1990 levels
by the year 2000.
<P>
     The plan is a potpourri of initiatives designed primarily to
encourage companies and households -- by persuasion, by education, and
in some instances by compulsion -- to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
such as carbon dioxide and methane, produced in the manufacture or use
of a product. This would be accomplished by such means as reducing
energy consumption (which produces greenhouse gases) and limiting
methane releases from garbage dumps or landfills. In all, the plan has
44 different initiatives ranging from mandates that household
appliances and buildings be made more energy-efficient to increased
government funding of the Green Lights Program, an educational program
created during the Bush Administration to show companies how they can
reduce energy consumption while saving money. Other initiatives, such
as the Source Reduction, Pollution Reduction, and Recycling
Initiative, focus on spending federal monies to persuade companies to
reduce their emissions voluntarily without legislative mandates. Yet
another initiative is designed to reduce cow flatulence through
improved techniques of beef production. The Clinton Administration's
plan relies in part on existing legislative authority to implement the
initiatives through regulatory action, but it would also require
significant additional federal spending.

<P>
<B> HOW THE COSTS ARE UNDERESTIMATED</B>
<P>
The Clinton Administration estimates that it will cost $63.4 billion
to implement this plan over the next seven years. Of this amount, the
private sector's share is $61.5 billion, the government's only $1.9
billion. (The Administration calculates a net savings of $793 million
due to increased taxes and continued leasing of dams. This projected
figure is not used here for two reasons: 1) the $1.9 billion
represents projected cost outlays, and 2) the report incorrectly shows
the tax increase that is projected to reduce the government's "net"
outlays without showing the tax as a corresponding increase in private
sector outlays.) Most of the public sector funds, it is claimed, will
be transferred from other funding sources. At the same time, the
Administration projects savings to the economy of $268.1 billion,
primarily in energy savings if the initiatives are implemented. 
<P>
     Unfortunately, the Administration's figures are highly
misleading. Specifically, the Administration underestimates how much
the plan will cost both the government and the private sector, and it
overstates projected energy savings by using flawed accounting
procedures and unduly optimistic forecasts. Experience teaches that
once government programs are born, they almost never die, yet the
Administration assumes that every government program initiated or
augmented by the plan will cease within seven years. It also assumes
that all private sector costs will drop to zero at that time. Thus,
although these programs will continue to exist, and will probably
grow, the Administration ignores all costs that will be incurred after
the year 2000 and implicitly assumes that the costs of maintaining
greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels will be zero -- while
calculating the benefits from energy savings derived from the plan
until the year 2010, or for 17 years, with benefits beyond the year
2000 included in the calculation of costs and benefits. Moreover,
while it is true that some costs borne in the early years will
continue to reap benefits for another decade, this is not true of all
programs. 
<P>
     This disparity in the calculation of costs and benefits is only
one way in which the Administration distorts the plan's true costs and
savings. Another is its highly unusual accounting method. Under the
standard method, future figures would be discounted to their present
value; the Administration, however, has chosen to calculate all cost
and benefit figures in undiscounted 1991 dollars. The result: the
plan's supposed benefits are inflated far more than its costs because
cost or benefit figures occurring further in the future are inflated
proportionately more. Thus, potential but undiscounted savings yielded
17 years from now are greatly inflated, while costs 7 years from now
are only somewhat exaggerated. This deliberate obfuscation of the real
costs and benefits indicates that the Administration knows the real
present value costs of its program exceed the real benefits discounted
for inflation and the time value of money. If the Administration truly
believes the benefits justify the costs, it should present real
figures calculated in the standard way.
<P>
     Even using this flawed accounting methodology, the Administration
significantly underestimates the probable costs and overestimates the
likely benefits of many of the plan's initiatives. Perhaps the best
example is Action #16 -- the source reduction, pollution prevention,
and recycling program -- which encourages and subsidizes increased
recycling of, and reduced use in products and packaging of, certain
natural resources such as paper, plastic, and other materials. The
plan estimates this program will cost the government and private
sector $176 million but save the economy $36.5 billion, or 207 times
as much. If such a generous return on an investment was possible, it
seems odd that entrepreneurs would have not already seized the
opportunity without the need for government encouragement. In reality,
however, recycling is expensive and generally uneconomical, with the
exception of aluminum found in such products as cans. (Aluminum cans
are both economically and ecologically beneficial to recycle because
it takes 95 percent less energy to recycle aluminum than to make it
from bauxite (aluminum ore). Of course, since recycling aluminum cans
is profitable, over 50 percent of cans already are recycled as an
entrepreneurial activity.) Thus, the cost for the private sector will
be much higher than the Administration forecasts, and benefits that
otherwise might offset these costs will be lower.
<P>
     Similarly, redesigning packaging and other products to reduce
their natural resources content is very expensive. Past trends
indicate that manufacturers already try to cut packaging costs because
packaging, which adds weight and volume to a product, is expensive to
buy, store, and transport. (Packaging accounted for 30.3 percent of
waste in 1986, down from the 1970 level of 33.5 percent. See John
Shanahan, "A Plain Man's Guide to Garbage: The Reauthorization of the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act," Heritage Foundation Issue
Bulletin No. 172, March 30, 1992.) Expensive government programs to
encourage less packaging are thus unnecessary. At worst, they can be
counterproductive by encouraging manufacturers to reduce packaging
when it is uneconomical. For instance, reducing paper packaging of
food can be counterproductive because every pound of paper packaging
reduces food waste by an average of 1.41 pounds. Thus, reductions
would waste valuable food while increasing total garbage destined for
landfills. 
<P>
     The Administration also obscures the true cost of reducing
greenhouse gases by not counting funds dedicated to efforts now
underway, or programs already announced, that comprise part of the
plan. In short, $63 billion is not the total amount to be spent on
reducing greenhouse gases; it is only the additional amount to be
dedicated to this effort. One cannot accurately gauge the true costs
either to the government or to the private sector until the White
House is more candid in estimating how much is now being spent to
fight global warming and combining that with accurate, discounted, and
itemized projections as to how much its new initiatives will cost
Americans.
<P>

<B> WHY THE PLAN WILL BE INEFFECTIVE</B>
<P>
The technical supplement explaining many of the plan's underlying
assumptions does not support the Administration's claim that the plan
will be effective. For instance, a major goal of the plan is to reduce
carbon dioxide releases, but the Administration has included in this
comprehensive package many other environmental initiatives that will
increase net carbon dioxide releases. The Administration also proposes
in Action #16 to encourage and subsidize increased recycling of paper
and other materials as a way to reduce carbon emissions, assuming that
trees left to grow instead of being cut for pulpwood will continue to
absorb carbon dioxide. But this turns the facts upside down.
<P>
     If paper recycling increases, net carbon dioxide emissions
actually will rise, not fall. Eighty-five percent of all pulpwood
comes from tree farms where the trees are planted, grown, and
harvested on about a twenty-year cycle. These smaller, fast-growing
trees absorb much more carbon dioxide than slow-growing, older trees.
Thus, by continuing to harvest every twenty years to supply the paper
market, tree farmers are encouraged to replant young carbon-absorbing
saplings. If increased paper recycling caused the virgin pulpwood
market to contract, tree farmers generally would cut down their trees
and replant their land with some other crop -- if they plant at all --
in order to make a living. The number of trees in the U.S. would drop
and net carbon dioxide releases would increase, not decrease. (This
refers to the effect of the recycling initiative alone on carbon
dioxide releases, not to total carbon releases that actually will
occur given increased production, other initiatives, and likely
technological advances. See ibid.)
<P>
     While some of the mandatory provisions no doubt would achieve
limited success at high cost, other provisions are less likely to
prove effective. For instance, Action #3 -- Establish State Revolving
Fund for Public Buildings -- assumes that providing $1 million in seed
money to ten competitively selected states each year, for a total of
$55 million through 1999, will result in energy savings of 29 percent
for one in ten state and local public buildings and two percent of all
commercial buildings. (Presumably, this statistic applies only to
commercial buildings; the technical supplement is not specific. See
Technical Supplement, op. cit.) The Administration claims that loan
repayments funded from energy savings will allow these funds to be
lent several times over; but this assumes that all energy-saving
technologies are cost-effective, and experience shows this is not
always the case. Many of these upgrades will never repay their
investment. Administration officials also make the questionable
assumption that the private sector will be motivated to spend $2.5
billion in upgrades based solely on the $55 million seed money
provided to states and localities, (The Technical Supplement
specifically states that two percent of all buildings and ten percent
of state and local buildings "are assumed to use new technologies as a
result of this action" and will thus incur the $2.5 billion investment
in energy saving technology projected under this program. Ibid.) but
this would mean investing $45 for the benefits of a $1 loan. (Even if
the Administration's assumption is correct and the $55 million could
be re-lent, say, three more times, the ratio still would be
approximately 11 to 1.)
<P>
     Another program that is unlikely to produce any significant
benefits is Action #39 -- Improve Ruminant Productivity and Product
Marketing -- which attempts to reduce cow flatulence by increasing
beef productivity. Cattle flatulence contains methane, a greenhouse
gas. The Administration assumes that a $28 million investment over six
years will increase significantly the productivity of this multi-
billion dollar industry. It proposes to achieve this goal through
improved nutrition and grazing management practices, "production-
enhancing agents to improve feed efficiency," disease control, and
improved genetic characteristics and reproduction. The White House is
correct in arguing that, if this initiative were to be successful,
less methane would be produced per pound of beef at the supermarket,
but it assumes falsely that increased beef productivity per unit will
not mean increased total beef production. In fact, increased
productivity presumably would cause lower prices, spurring greater
demand for beef and more production. While the amount of methane
produced per unit might decrease, the total amount from cow flatulence
actually could increase.
<P>
     Even the environmental lobby is skeptical of the plan's
effectiveness. As Steve Kretzman of Greenpeace said when briefed by
the Administration, "It's a repackaging of some old ideas and a few
scattered new ones. There is no guarantee that any of this will get us
anywhere. The only thing worse than this policy would have been no
policy." (Gary Lee, "Clinton Sets Plan to Cut Emissions," The
Washington Post, October 18, 1993, p. A1.)
<P>
     Echoing this sentiment, Michael Oppenheimer of the Environmental
Defense Fund, a vocal and well known advocate of the global warming
theory, said, "I have doubts as to whether even taken all together
[the 44 initiatives] can achieve reductions to 1990 levels. The
problem is that almost all of the measures are voluntary and there is
very little to encourage industry to participate and punish those who
don't." (Ibid.) But while the criticism that the U.S. will not reduce
its emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000 is probably true, it is
certainly not because the plan is voluntary.
<P>

<B> THE PLAN IS FAR FROM VOLUNTARY</B>
<P>
Approximately one-half of the $63 billion plan results from mandatory
proposals. (It is impossible to know with certainty the exact costs of
the mandatory programs because the Administration's plan combines
major mandatory programs with minor voluntary programs in its cost and
saving estimates.) In Action #7, for instance, the plan proposes to
require appliance manufacturers to spend $19.5 billion to improve the
energy efficiency of household appliances. These costs in large
measure will be passed on to consumers in higher prices for
refrigerators, heaters, air conditioners, ovens, televisions, and
other appliances. The plan also calls for mandatory increases in
residential building standards under Action #10, which, according to
the Administration, will cost another $11.7 billion when combined with
two minor programs. (Ironically, this effort to seal buildings more
tightly to reduce energy loss, which will increase airborne illnesses
and hazards, comes at a time when the Administration is attempting to
address the problem of indoor air pollution.) Unfortunately, it is not
possible to know the exact projected cost for this program because the
Administration has combined the cost estimates of all three programs;
but the others appear to be minor in scope, so that costs under the
mandatory increased building standards will likely amount to nearly
all of the $11.7 billion projected for the three programs combined.
Added together, these two mandates will cost approximately $31
billion, or half of the total costs of the plan. This means that
households will spend an average of more than $300 each over the next
seven years on higher-cost houses and appliances, since these costs
largely will be passed on to consumers. Moreover, this $300 per
household is in addition to any costs that flow through companies to
consumers from the other 42 programs.
<P>
     Action #22 also calls for mandatory labeling of automobile tires
to encourage consumers to buy more fuel-efficient tires. According to
the Administration, this program would cost the private sector $2.2
billion but save fuel worth $3.9 billion. But, since the labeling
would be informational and would not itself result in energy
efficiency, it is impossible to estimate its benefits accurately.
Moreover, the Administration arrives at $3.9 billion in fuel savings
by making some rather suspect assumptions. For instance, it claims one
out of thirteen drivers will buy new tires in response to the labels,
supposedly because they will be able to drive almost a full mile
further for every gallon of gas. Thus, they will burn less gas, which
releases carbon. It is far from clear, however, that the government's
figures are accurate. In the body of the Action Plan, the government
assumes implicitly that the average car now only gets 1.7 miles per
gallon; it states that a .068 miles per gallon increase in average
fleet on-road fuel economy is a four percent increase over current
miles per gallon. Obviously, the Administration's claim is false. Yet
in the Appendix of the Action Plan, the Administration uses accurate
and fairly detailed fuel consumption figures.
<P>
     Several other provisions are also mandatory, such as pesticide
use reductions due to an Integrated Pest Management Program required
under Action #18. (The Administration assumes small energy savings
from the reduction in manufacture of pesticides, but its calculations
ignore the increased energy consumption needed to obtain the same crop
yield without pesticides, as well as the sizable increased costs
associated with pesticide reductions.)The plan does not rely solely on
inflexible "command and control" regulation. Most of the 44
initiatives are based on new "voluntary" partnerships between
government and businesses. (While "voluntary" initiatives comprise the
largest number of initiatives, it appears their cost is not more than
half the total cost of the plan.) As Secretary Hazel O'Leary said when
the plan was unveiled, "What 'voluntary' connotes is an agreement,
among parties of equal standing with full knowledge who agree, in
fact, to accomplish something." (Remarks at White House briefing,
October 19, 1993.) But, of course, companies do not have equal
standing with the federal government. This is not an agreement between
sovereign powers. Rather than take control of the method of production
directly, as many other environmental regulations do, the plan
encourages companies to sign onto "voluntary" reductions of greenhouse
gas emissions -- or face the regulatory hammer.
<P>

<B> CATASTROPHIC GLOBAL WARMING IS IMPROBABLE</B>
<P>
The enormous drain on economic resources to achieve questionable
success would cause concern even if the threat of catastrophic global
warming were real, but this assumption, on which the entire plan is
based, is under increasing challenge. According to a 1992 Greenpeace
survey, only 13 percent of climate scientists polled believe that
runaway global warming will occur, while 79 percent are split between
whether it is possible or will "probably not" occur. (Greenpeace press
release, "Climate Scientists Fear Effects of Understanding Global
Warming, Poll Shows," February 9, 1992.) This result is not
surprising. Accumulated scientific data and analyses of past studies
show that the dire predictions are either highly improbable or simply
wrong. Moreover, there is enormous uncertainty associated with the
scientific methodologies used to predict future climate changes. 
<P>
Climate change computer models that predict warming often rely on
  assumptions and oversimplifications that raise serious questions as
  to their reliability. One model, for example, effectively moved the
  Earth's orbit two million miles closer to the sun. (John Shanahan,
  "A Guide to the Global Warming Theory," Heritage Foundation
  Backgrounder No. 896, May 21, 1992.)
<P>
Models do not account accurately for the influence of important
  climate factors, such as the behavior and effect of clouds and
  oceans.
<P>
Temperature records over the last century are inconsistent with the
  predictions of global climate theories.
<P>
There are shortcomings in the data. Temperature records over the last
  century, for example, may show warming incorrectly because many
  weather stations are close to growing cities.
<P>
In contrast to measurements from ground stations, which are prone to
  various inaccuracies, more reliable satellite data collected since
  1979 show that temperatures over the last 15 years have not
  increased. (Telephone conversation with Dr. John R. Christy, Earth
  Systems Science Laboratory, University of Alabama in Huntsville. Dr.
  Christy and his co-author, Richard T. McNider, published their
  results in a January 27, 1994, letter in Nature.)
<P>
Concern about the quality of the models used is heightened further by
  the fact that they fail to predict accurately today's temperatures.
  When climate data from 50 years ago are fed into these models, they
  indicate that temperatures today should be much hotter than they
  actually are. Thus, the models contain a bias toward predicting
  hotter weather.
<P>
     Further, even if scientists were to become convinced that some
level of global warming is occurring and will continue, three
questions need to be answered.
<P>
QUESTION #1: Is the Earth warming because of human-caused greenhouse
   gases, or because of natural phenomena?
<P>
QUESTION #2: If the planet is experiencing a major warming trend, how
   will this warming take place? Will the Earth warm up substantially
   at night, perhaps cooling slightly during the day? Will the warming
   occur only in the tropical regions or only in the high latitudes
   around the poles? Will it occur in the summer or the winter? (These
   questions are important because any single figure suggesting the
   average temperature of all regions of the world for all times of
   day and night during the entire year ignores variations amid the
   warming trend that would have very different -- and not necessarily
   harmful -- effects.)
<P>
QUESTION #3: What will be the effect of any changes in the climate?
   Will the ocean levels rise, resulting in worldwide flooding, or
   fall, expanding Earth's landmass? Will worldwide agricultural
   production increase because of more crops in areas now too cold for
   major cultivation, thereby helping to alleviate world hunger, or
   decrease, prompting famine in some regions?
<P>
These questions must be answered before the consequences of global
warming -- assuming there is such a thing -- can be predicted. In any
event, the evidence suggests strongly that: (See Shanahan, "A Guide to
the Global Warming Theory.")
<P>
<LI> Widespread flooding from the melting of the ice caps will not occur.
<LI> Daytime temperatures will not increase.
<LI>Agricultural production will increase, not fall.
<LI>Increased periods and regions of drought will not result.
<LI> Plants will retain water better and thus will be more drought- 
resistant.
<P>
In light of the unanswered questions, new data, and the uncertainties
and inconsistencies of climate change models which are known to mirror
reality inaccurately, the final and most important question is: What
is the appropriate course of action?
<P>

<B> WHAT IS PRUDENT POLICY?</B>
<P>
Administration officials have decided to follow what some bureaucrats
and environmental lobbyists call a "no-regrets" policy. Basically,
this policy works on the "just in case" principle: government should
take decisive, albeit expensive, action if a potentially serious
problem is possible -- just in case. But while this argument may sound
plausible, it ignores the dangers of overreaction. Hundreds of
thousands of Americans could lose their jobs as the Administration
combats what may well be an entirely mythical problem. 
<P>
     When faced with uncertain science like the theory of global
warming, what should the government do? One of four basic strategies
can be adopted, depending on the particular situation. (S. Fred
Singer, "Environmental Strategies with Uncertain Science," Regulation,
Winter 1990, p. 65.) 
<P>
OPTION #1: Take no action, not even research. This option is, of
   course, costless, but it introduces the danger both of not dealing
   with a potential problem and of not learning the degree of a
   possible threat.
<P>
OPTION #2: Conduct more research, but take no other action. This
   option is relatively inexpensive, yet increases knowledge of the
   scope and likelihood of a potential problem. It risks the possible
   consequences associated with deferring action and having to catch
   up later; but if stepped-up research shows the problem to have been
   overrated, or nonexistent, huge and unnecessary costs will have
   been avoided.
<P>
OPTION #3: Take limited action to control greenhouse emissions, phased
   in over a period. This option is also less expensive than tackling
   the problem -- again, assuming it exists -- completely and
   immediately; but it is extremely expensive when compared with
   research, and the result may be huge expenditures on a problem that
   does not exist.
<P>
OPTION #4: Undertake full control of emissions on an emergency
   timetable. This option addresses the potential harm as quickly and
   thoroughly as possible, but it also means a heavy cost to the
   economy for what may be a nonexistent problem.
  <P>
If real, the threat posed by global warming is large enough to rule
out the first option as sound policy. Likewise, the cost to Americans
of an emergency program to avert an improbable catastrophe is heavy
enough to rule out the fourth option.
<P>
     The decision as to whether the U.S. should "take action" or
increase research should be based on the potential cost of delaying
action while research is conducted compared with the cost of action.
According to a scientific panel of the George C. Marshall Institute, a
Washington, DC.-based public policy institute focusing on scientific
matters, two important studies indicate that the cost of delay is in
fact very small:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> The calculations [of both studies] show that a five-year
     delay in limiting carbon emissions will make the world
     warmer in the next century by at most one tenth of a degree,
     compared to how warm it will be if there were no delay.
     (George C. Marshall Institute, "Global Warming Update:
     Recent Scientific Findings," 1992.)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     Meanwhile, knowledge is increasing rapidly because of stepped-up
research. The vast majority of what scientists know about climate
change has been learned in the last three or four years, and this
knowledge is expected to increase substantially more within a few
years.
<P>
     Despite the need for more data, and although the United States is
under no international obligation to leap without looking, the
Administration is pursuing the third option. Indeed, "this [national
action plan] is a political commitment of the president," according to
Dr. Susan Tierney, Assistant Secretary for Policy, Planning, and
Program Evaluation at the Department of Energy. (Speaking before U.S.
Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources hearing on
Administration's National Action Plan to Reduce Greenhouse Gases,
October 28, 1993.) Yet the total costs are unknown. The $63 billion
cost of the Administration's plan almost certainly is an underestimate
-- and it is only the first installment. If the aim is to limit CO2
emissions during the next century, the United States will have to
continue its efforts beyond the year 2000.
<P>
     Given the enormous but unknown costs and the negligible danger
from delay, the focus of U.S. efforts should be to expand scientific
knowledge about global warming, not to spend billions on a program to
minimize the risk of an improbable theory. Specifically, the U.S.
should:
<P>
Continue federal funding for climate change research. 
<P>
     Currently, the U.S. spends more on climate change research than
the rest of the world combined. Yet some environmentalists, as well as
the Office of Technology Assessment, advocate reducing scientific
research on whether global climate change will occur. (Office of
Technology Assessment, Preparing for an Uncertain Climate -- Volume
II, OTA-568, October 1993.) Instead, they want funds to be devoted to
studying the effects of global warming based on the assumption that
because runaway global warming could come suddenly at any time, it is
better to act now on this extreme improbability than to determine
whether it is even possible.
<P>
Open the National Archives to climate change researchers. 
<P>
     Subject to legitimate national security concerns, such as sources
and methods of intelligence gathering and existing programs,
scientific researchers should have access to the National Archives,
which houses mountains of data that could be used to accelerate
research. Collected by surveillance satellites, aircraft, submarines,
and oceanographic vessels, these data could aid in research on past
contours and thaw rates of polar ice caps, ocean chemistry and
temperatures, and scores of other questions.
<P>
These two steps would ensure that scientists could continue to
increase their knowledge of climate interaction at a rapid rate.
Moreover, America would avoid the mistake of spending enormous sums of
money on what science may show to be a non-problem.
<P>

<B> CONCLUSION</B>
<P>
Faced with an uncertain science and the known consequences of rash
action, sound public policy demands that lawmakers use care in
choosing how the United States addresses global warming. If billions
of dollars are squandered on what turns out to be a "Chicken Little"
threat, lawmakers will have failed in their duty.
<P>
     As envisioned, the Clinton Administration's National Action Plan
will impose large costs on all households even though scientists
remain divided as to whether adverse climate changes will occur. The
wisest course of action would be to increase the corpus of knowledge
of the Earth's atmosphere before spending billions on potentially
unnecessary programs.

<title>No IMF Loans to Russia -- Heritage</title>

<h3>NO IMF LOANS TO RUSSIA</h3>
<a href="/heritage/staff/cohen.htm">Ariel Cohen, Ph.D.</a><br> 
Senior Policy Analyst <br>
<p>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 447<br>
February 16, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Board of Directors of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is considering granting Russia a $9 billion loan, and the U.S.-run Export-Import Bank may provide an additional $1 billion to boost Russia's flagging civilian aircraft industry. President Bill Clinton strongly supports the IMF loan, hoping that it will bolster Boris Yeltsin's faltering presidency. But giving Russia a handout will not advance U.S. interests or help the Russian economy. The loans do not guarantee more responsible budgetary policies in Moscow. Nor do they lead to much-needed structural reforms, including agriculture and land privatization. Moreover, the loans do not secure Russia's peaceful conduct toward her neighbors, greater foreign policy cooperation with the U.S., or other American interests.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Economic reforms in Russia are faltering. First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais, the last remaining reformer in Yeltsin's cabinet, was forced to resign on January 16, 1996. He was sacrificed to appease Yeltsin's nationalist and communist critics. Now Yeltsin has left himself without any senior political figure capable of formulating and coordinating free-market reforms. Chubais's replacement, Vladimir Kadannikov, was the protectionist director of Russia's inefficient auto-making giant VAZ, whose low-quality products have long been the laughingstock of Europe. Kadannikov is hardly the economic policy leader to steer Russia to a stable free market.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; A succession of young, reform-minded economists did much to shift the Russian economy to a free-market course over the past four years. Despite their efforts, Russia's economic house is still not in order. The inflation rate in 1995 was between 120 and 130 percent. Budget deficits are very high, and privatization has failed to raise the revenues to reduce them. Moreover, election campaign pressures have forced Yeltsin to break budgetary constraints and promise billions of dollars in credits and payments to industry groups with the strongest lobbying clout. For example, about $4 billion was earmarked for the defense industry for a state-directed conversion program, and $2.2 billion in wage arrears has been promised to workers in the state sector. The notoriously inefficient Russian miners, who went on strike in December 1995, were promised another $2 billion. $3.3 billion has been pledged to the agricultural sector. Half a billion dollars went to pensioners, and over $1 billion will be paid to officers and soldiers in the armed forces.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Instead of implementing a package of comprehensive economic reforms, attempting to balance the budget, and lowering taxes, the Russian government is following economic policies which only exacerbate the problems. These policies include:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b>Industrial subsidies.</b> Moscow is giving billions of dollars to inefficient state-owned enterprises. These include the military industry as well as agricultural machinery and aviation manufacturers.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b>Stalled land privatization and subsidies to the state-owned agricultural sector.</b> The pro-communist agrarian lobby succeeded in derailing the emergence of private farming. Despite its immense agricultural potential, Russia still needs food imports and still suffers from low agricultural productivity.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b>Lack of military reform.</b> Russia's armed forces are oversized at 1.5 million servicemen. They also are poorly organized and inefficient, as demonstrated by their embarrassing performance in Chechnya. The armed forces need to be cut. Instead, the Ministry of Defense has demanded a 55 percent budget increase for FY 1996, and was granted a 16 percent real term increase by the state Duma.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b>Maintaining the bloated bureaucracy and state sector.</b> Russia today has more bureaucrats than the whole of the Soviet Union, which was almost twice as large. Moreover, many sectors of the Russian economy, such as health care, still are owned and operated by the state, which puts an additional drain on the federal budget.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b>Anti-investment policies.</b> More than $12 billion a year leaves Russia and is deposited in foreign bank accounts. Such capital flight denies the Russian economy investment and taxable income. According to the Russian Central Bank's Hard Currency Monitoring Department, over $4 billion a year is transferred illegally out of the country through fictitious import invoices alone. Why is this happening?  Because the government's economic policies are making Russia an inhospitable place to invest, especially compared to East Asia, Central Europe, Latin America, and other emerging markets. Instead of offering a handout to the Russian government, the IMF and the World Bank ought to provide policy advice to decrease the rates of taxation, boost the rule of law, and encourage investment in order to make the Russian economy more attractive for domestic and foreign entrepreneurs.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <b>Forgiving foreign debts.</b> While asking the IMF for loans, Moscow is forgiving an $8 billion debt owed by Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi, a $3 billion debt created by the Sandinista government of Nicaragua, and $250 million owed by Ethiopia. All these debts were generated when the Soviet Union was exporting the revolution and supplying Marxist regimes with weapons.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Russia's problems are not only economic. They are political as well. Russia may be on the brink of a takeover by unreformed communists led by Gennady Zyuganov, former ideology department chief of the Central Committee of the U.S.S.R. Communist Party. The irony is that this may be accomplished through the ballot box in the June presidential elections. Zyuganov, who is running first in the opinion polls, has promised to restore the U.S.S.R. "by voluntary means."  He is followed in the polls by ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who has declared that he will restore the Russian Empire and possibly expand it even further into the Middle East.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; If a hard-liner like Zyuganov or Zhirinovsky were to win the presidential elections in June, IMF credits would be going to a retrograde regime with little or no interest in reform. Under these circumstances, IMF credits would be throwing good money after bad. Moreover, there is a chance that these loans would never be repaid, since under a communist government Russia could sever relations with the IMF and the World Bank.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Leading Yeltsin administration officials, such as Interior Minister General Anatoly Kulikov, and Communist deputies in the Duma are discussing how to reverse privatization and stop the economic reforms in their tracks. Communists and their allies control the majority of the Duma's committees and the powerful Duma Executive Council. Without a clearer picture of the future direction of Russian politics and economic policies, the IMF loans are ill-advised. It makes no sense to approve the IMF loan until the rest of the world knows what kind of regime will be using the money.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Nor does it make sense to loan Russia money while it is prosecuting the war against Chechnya. According to estimates by Russian economists, this war costs over $4.5 billion a year. The IMF should not subsidize such a war, or any other military ventures into which a future Russian hard-line president might drag the country.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Clinton Administration should not be lobbying the IMF on behalf of Russia. These loans will not boost the cause of reform. At best the money will be wasted; at worst, it could be abused by some future anti-Western leadership. Either way, money will be thrown at problems which cannot be solved easily and which will not go away with the stroke of an IMF pen.

INTRODUCTION
 
<P>    Congress may act soon on legislation to reauthorize the 1980 
Comprehensive, Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act 
(CERCLA, pronounced sir-kluh), also known as Superfund. As it is 
enforced, Superfund is perhaps the most complex existing law. But it 
is now synonymous with failure and has become a symbol of wasteful, 
ineffective environmental legislation. 

<P>The Clinton Administration agrees that the Superfund law has not 
worked, and last February unveiled its reform proposals. These 
proposals have been substantially incorporated into two bills before 
Congress: S.1834, introduced by Senator Max Baucus (D-MT), who is 
Chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works; and H.R. 
3800, introduced by Representative Al Swift (D-WA), the Chairman of 
the Transportation and Hazardous Materials Subcommittee of the 
Committee on Energy and Commerce.

<P>Although $20 billion has been spent already on the 
program,Superfund has failed in its mission to clean up hazardous 
waste sites. So far, only a small fraction of the "worst" hazardous 
waste sites have been cleaned up. To clean up the remaining sites will 
cost hundreds of billions more. Unfortunately, the legislation fails 
to address the two fundamental problems that have created this 
situation.<P>
Specifically, the legislation:
<P>
Retains the law's retroactive, strict, joint and several liability 
scheme. 

  <P>   This delays site cleanup as responsible parties attempt to avoid 
liability by shifting it to others. Moreover, it adds to total site 
cleanup costs by creating a climate for increased litigation and other 
transaction costs.
<P>
Maintains overly stringent and inflexible cleanup standards.
   
<P>  Unreasonable cleanup standards are the other major factor behind 
the slow and costly pace of site cleanup. The current system not only 
fails to prioritize those sites posing the most significant risk, it 
also imposes excessive standards of "cleanliness."

 <P>    Instead of fixing these fundamental problems, the bills create 
the Environmental Insurance Resolution Fund (EIRF), funded by an 
unnecessary and inequitable $8.1 billion tax on the insurance and 
reinsurance industry. The purpose of this fund is to settle the 
problem created by current law that virtually forces companies to sue 
the insurance industry because the extent of insurer liability is not 
easily settled. This fund, built on retrospective and prospective
taxes, helps some insurance companies at the expense of others and 
still would leave insurers open to future risk.

<P>     The right solution would be to repeal retroactive, joint and 
several liability and fix the cleanup standards. By doing this, only 
the most needy sites would be cleaned up. Instead of the l itigious 
scramble for the responsible party and the ensuing litigation, the 
polluter would pay. For those sites where no one is legally 
responsible under the new law, the federal government should decide if 
they warrant cleanup, and if so, clean them up.

<P>     In addition, the bills contain other provisions that do nothing 
to fix the Superfund program and will only add to the cost of the bill 
and the cost of cleaning up hazardous sites, such as new Davis-Bacon 
Act expansions in the House bill. These have no place in such 
legislation.

<P>     The many problems with these bills underscore the need to move 
cautiously on Superfund reform rather than to rush through a bill in 
the final days of this Congress. With exploding costs on the horizon 
caused by Superfund's flaws, real reforms are necessary now. These 
bills, however, would virtually guarantee five years more of the 
status quo until the next reauthorization. If Superfund reform cannot 
be done right this year, it should not be done. 

<P>WHAT IS SUPERFUND?

<P>     The Superfund program was created in 1980 after widespread media 
attention to the exposure to high levels of dangerous chemicals of 
residents of Love Canal, near Niagara Falls, New York. The national 
media coverage thus provided the political impetus for legislative 
action. (It is  important to note that the company that buried the 
chemicals in the area, Hooker Electrochemical Company, took great care
to prevent public exposure to the chemicals.  Hooker buried the 
chemicals sealed in a thick protective tube of   impermeable clay with 
the intent of maintaining ownership of the land.  Unfortunately, the 
Niagara Falls Board of Education through threat of eminent domain, 
effectively forced the company to sell the land (for $1), despite the
company's warmings that the land was contaminated and not fit for 
public use.  A public elementary school was built on the site and city 
construction crews bulldozed through the clay seal, thus allowing the 
chemicals into the surrounding soil.  Additionally, some of the land 
was sold off for residential housing.  Thus, the problems at Love 
Canal were the direct result of government interference.) 

<P>     Superfund, known formally as the Comprehensive Environmental 
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), was intended to 
force companies to clean up their hazardous wastes. It also created a 
government fund to pay for cleanup of "orphan sites," which are 
contaminated properties where the polluter, say, has gone out of 
business. (42 U.S.C.  sec.  9601 et.  seq.; PL 96-510, as amended by 
97-216, July 18, 1982; PL 97-272, September 30, 1982; P.L.  98-45, 
July 12, 1983; PL 99-160, November 25, 1985; PL 99-499 (Superfund 
Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA)), October 17, 1986; 
PL 100-202, December 22, 1987; PL 101-144, November 9, 1989; PL 101- 
508, November 5, 1990; PL 101-584, (Superfund Surety Bonding),
November 15, 1990; PL 102-389, October 6, 1992; and PL 102-426, 
October 19, 1992.) The law was hurried through in the final days of 
the Carter Administration and many provisions were ill-considered. 
Consequently, CERCLA has cost approximately $20 billion or more while 
utterly failing in its mission of cleaning up hazardous waste sites. 
As Carol Browner, Administrator of the Environmental Protection  
agency (EPA), explains, "A lot of time and money is taken up with 
companies suing each other over how much they owe to clean up a 
particular site." (Remarks by EPA Administrator Carol Browner to the 
U.S.  Chamber of Commerce Policy Insiders Breakfast, February 16, 
1994.)
<P>
     To deal with orphan sites, Congress originally authorized a $1.6 
billion trust fund, or "Superfund." This sum was believed adequate by 
policy makers to clean up all orphan sites known or likely to be 
discovered. For many reasons, however, the program proved much more 
expensive. In 1986, the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act
(SARA) increased the trust fund by another $8.5 billion, to $10.1 
billion. The total was raised by another $5.1 billion, to $15.2 
billion, during the 1990 budget deal. The increases were financed 
through excise taxes, primarily on crude oil and petrochemicals, as 
well as a corporate environmental tax. Of this amount, $10.8 billion 
had been spent by the end of fiscal year 1994. (The 1994 figure 
includes estimated outlays for Fiscal Year 1994, which funds through 
September 1994.  The cost in real dollars is $12.2 billion.)

<P>     The $10.8 billion spent so far from the Superfund, moreover, 
comprises only a fraction of the total cost of CERCLA. The cost spent 
by companies and individuals in compliance with CERCLA has raised the 
overall price tag of the program by billions of dollars more. 
(Estimates vary greatly -- from $7.8 billion to $18 billion -- and 
typically are not based on solid data; nevertheless, there is uniform
agreement that the costs have been substantial.)

 <P>    Much of this cost has been spent not on cleanup, but on
litigation and other "transaction" costs. In fact, only 237 of the 
1,292 "worst" hazardous waste sites placed on the National Priorities 
List (NPL), or about 18 percent, have been cleaned up. (EPA Superfund 
Hotline run by Booz-Allen & Hamilton, as of September 23, 1994.  Note 
that some of those cleaned up sites, technically known as 
"construction  completed," actually are undergoing long-term 
remediation.  Also note that by the end of 1992, from which time many
of the cost figures for various studies were derived, only 149 of 
1,275 on the NPL had been cleaned up.) Moreover, only 60 sites have 
been deleted from the NPL. To clean up the remaining sites already on 
the NPL, the EPA's costs alone -- excluding costs to businesses and 
insurance companies -- will run an estimated $40 billion. Also, many 
more sites are expected to be listed on the NPL -- for an ultimate 
number between 2,100 to 10,000 -- thus driving up the costs even
higher. (Congressional Budget Office, "The Total Costs of Cleaning Up 
Nonfederal Superfund Sites," January 1994, citing Milton Russell, E.  
William Colglazier, and Mary R.  English, Hazardous Waste Remediation:  
The Task Ahead (Knoxville, Tenn.:  University of Tennessee, Waste 
Management Research and Education Institute, 1991); and the Office of 
Technology Assessment, Coming Clean:  Superfund Problems Can Be 
Solved....   (October 1989).) Over the next thirty years, according to 
the General Accounting Office, total costs are estimated at $300 
billion in 1990 dollars. (General Accounting Office, "Superfund 
Program Management," High Risk Series, December 1992.) The 
Congressional Budget Office, on the other hand, has put the total 
costs of cleaning contaminated sites not owned by the federal
government at between $106 billion and $463 billion in nominal 
dollars, or $42 billion and $120 billion in discounted dollars, over 
the next 78 years. (CBO, "The Total Costs of Cleaning Up Nonfederal 
Superfund Sites," January 1994.  The baseline projection in nominal 
dollars was estimated at $228.3 billion, or $73.9 billion in 
discounted dollars.  To calculate the discounted costs, the study used
a discount rate of 7 percent, which biased the study's  discounted 
costs downward.  While proper if the figure being calculated was 
return on investment (ROI) -- or payback on a present cost--to ensure 
a conservative estimate, it should not be used to estimate future 
costs.) The lion's share of those costs will be incurred within the 
next two decades, with annual costs potentially reaching a peak of 
$14.4 billion by the year 2003. (Ibid.  Note that this figure is the 
high case estimate in undiscounted dollars for cleanup of non-federal 
facilities.  The base case and low case estimates are $9.1 billion and 
$4.4 billion, respectively.  Inclusion of federal facilities in cost 
estimates, of course, would result in significantly higher estimates.)
If the costs of cleaning up federal facilities are added into the 
equation, the total cost could exceed $750 billion or about $7,800 per 
household in America. (Kent Jeffreys, "Science, Economics, and 
Environmental Policy:  A Critical Examination," Alexis de Tocqueville 
Institution, Arlington, Virginia, August 11, 1994, citing Milton 
Russell et al., Hazardous Waste Remediation.  The author calculated 
the potential average household cost by dividing the total by the 
number of households in the United States, or 96.391 million, in 1992, 
according to U.S.  Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, 
Current Population Reports, "Money Income of Households, Families, and 
Persons in the United States:  1992.")
<P>
WHY SUPERFUND DOES NOT WORK

<P>     The high cost and slow pace of Superfund cleanups are caused 
principally by two problems: the program's unworkable liability scheme 
and its overly stringent cleanup standards. The law's retroactive, 
strict, joint and several liability scheme results in endless 
litigation as potentially liable parties search for the "deepest 
pockets" to pay for cleanup. In addition, parties can be held liable 
for cleanup whether or not they are at fault, even if they dumped only 
minute amounts of waste and regardless of whether the dumping was
legal at the time. The program's unreasonable cleanup standards 
require hazardous waste sites, no matter what the location, be 
excessively clean and fail to set up a priority system that ensures 
the maximum bang for the cleanup buck.
<P>
The Liability Scheme Is Unworkable

<P>     The most important reason why the Superfund has failed to clean 
up more hazardous waste sites is its highly unusual liability scheme. 
This retroactive, strict, joint and several liability system delays 
cleanups and increases total costs by fueling constant litigation.

<P>     This liability scheme has led to countless examples of absurd and 
grossly unfair results. For instance, Russ Zimmer was named as one of 
the "potentially responsible parties" (PRP) ("Potentially Responsible 
Party," usually referred to by its acronym PRP, is the legal term 
referring to a person or institution that is identified as a liable 
party under CERCLA's liability scheme.  This term also is applicable
before any court determination of liability, as the word "potentially" 
implies.) for a Superfund site located at a battery cracking plant in 
Torrington, Wyoming. His  contribution to the problem? He sold a bag 
of dog food in 1977 and a bag of seed in 1984, and took a third-party 
check as payment for the items. Since the checks originally had been 
issued by the now-bankrupt company that had owned the battery cracking 
plant, Zimmer was sued as a PRP. Zimmer decided upon advice from 
counsel that he should settle or it would cost him even more in legal 
costs. So he agreed to pay $3,500. (Jack Anderson, Michael Binstein, 
"How Superfund Hurt the Innocent," The Washington Post, March 7, 1994,
p.  C11.)

<P>     Joint and several liability is much to blame for causing legal 
woes such as Zimmer's. Under joint and several liability, a person who 
contributed even a very small amount to a problem, such as by tossing 
a car battery into a landfill, can be held responsible for the entire 
cost of, say, a multi-million dollar cleanup. (Special rules apply now 
to very small (de minimis) contributors, but the problem discussed 
nevertheless still exists for many extremely small, as well as 
moderate, contributors.  The bills before Congress offer a partial 
solution to the current system by exempting truly tiny (de micromis) 
contributors, but the bills would not eliminate the problem because 
they would have the burden of proving a negative -- that they did not
pollute more -- to qualify for the exemption.  Moreover, moderate 
polluters would remain subject to enormous liability.) 

<P>     The concept is designed to find somebody -- anybody -- to pay for 
cleanups of hazardous waste. Under the doctrine, the "responsible" 
person presented with the tab often has no part or only a small part 
in creating the waste problem. In practice, this means that a firm 
with "deep pockets" ends up paying for the cleanup of wastes created 
by someone else. Naturally, any person or institution identified as a 
PRP has a strong incentive to prove that others are liable as well, in 
order to dilute the costs among more PRPs. Hence, litigation is 
virtually assured.

<P>     Although EPA Administrator Carol Browner has admitted the need 
for reform, she justifies Superfund's liability scheme because "a lot 
of good has come from the program. The polluter-pays concept that was 
first adopted in the Superfund law has changed the way businesses in 
this country deal with their waste." Unfortunately, Superfund does not
adopt the "polluter-pays" system, but rejects it. By  imposing joint 
and several liability, Superfund guarantees people like Zimmer pay for 
cleaning up the pollution of others. In short, joint and several 
liability works against the idea of making polluters pay the costs 
that their actions impose on others -- no more, no less. (For a clear
elucidation of the principle as properly defined, see John Shanahan, 
"The Conservative As Environmentalist," Heritage Lecture No.  358, 
November, 19, 1991.) 

<P>     Perhaps the most controversial part of this liability scheme is 
the retroactive component. (Retroactivity is not expressly provided 
for in the text of CERCLA, but that it is clear from the usage of the 
past tense that Congress intended for it to be retroactive.  Moreover, 
the courts have correctly interpreted that the intent of the law was
to impose retroactive liability.) Retroactive liability means that 
owners, operators, and other individuals and companies who otherwise 
would be liable under the strict, joint and several standards are held 
responsible for pollution that took place before the Superfund law was
passed in 1980. For instance, if a company made jeep parts during 
World War II, and during production some chemicals seeped into the 
ground, the company would be legally responsible for the cost of 
cleaning up those chemicals now. Thus, because of a law passed more 
than 35 years later, the company may be faced with tens of millions of 
dollars in cleanup costs -- even though the company's actions not only
were completely legal at the time, but were considered patriotic. (For 
many defense contractors, liability has amounted to hundreds of 
millions of dollars.)
<P>
     There are essentially three problems with retroactive liability. 
<P>
     Retroactive liability is of questionable constitutionality. The 
standard is seemingly unconstitutional on its face. In the same part 
of the Constitution that authorizes the existence of Congress, it
clearly and unequivocally states that "No... ex post facto Law shall 
be passed." (U.S.  Constitution, Article I, Section 9, Clause 3.) An 
ex post facto law is defined as "the infliction of punishment upon a 
person for an act done which, when it was committed, was innocent... 
[or] every law which, in relation to the offense or its consequences,
alters the situation of a person to his disadvantage." (Henry Campbell 
Black, M.A., Black's Law Dictionary, Sixth Edition (St.  Paul, Minn.:  
West Publishing Co., 1990).) 

 <P>    Superfund very clearly is an ex post facto law because
individuals and companies are surely punished and their situations 
"altered to disadvantage" when the government requires them to spend 
perhaps tens of millions of dollars to atone for actions that were 
legal when done. The intent of the Founding Fathers is clear, yet that 
intent has not been rigorously upheld by the Supreme Court. Relatively
early in the history of the nation, in fact, the Court held that the 
prohibition against ex post facto laws applied only to either criminal 
or penal measures. (Calder v Bull, 3 U.S.  (3 Dall.) 386, 1 L.Ed.  648 
(1798).) Thus, an important question is whether the imposition on a 
single person of liability for millions of dollars is penal by nature.
When individuals and companies may be bankrupted based on their own 
past behavior -- as opposed to, say, compliance with general 
regulations -- it is difficult to conceive of a law that could be more 
penal without being criminal.

  <P>   Even in cases where a statute was not considered penal, the Court 
traditionally ruled against retroactive laws. (See Railroad Retirement 
Board v.  Alton Railroad Co., 295 U.S.  330, 55 S.Ct.  758, 79 L.Ed.  
1468 (1935).  The Court bias against retroactive laws has not solely 
rested on the ex post facto law prohibition, but also has rested on 
several other constitutional grounds such as the due process.) In the 
last twenty years, however, there has been a shift in the 
interpretation. A relatively modern case that squarely addresses ex 
post facto "non-penal" laws suggests that, if ruled on, Superfund 
could be held constitutional if it is found to be rationally related 
to a legitimate government purpose. (Usery v.  Turner Elkhorn Mining 
Co., 428 U.S.  1, 96 S.Ct.  2882, 49 L.Ed.2d 752 (1976).) This is 
considered a low legal hurdle to overcome. In addition, lower court 
decisions have found that the prohibition against ex post facto laws 
poses no constitutional barrier to Superfund's retroactivity. (See 
U.S.  v.  Northeastern Pharmaceutical & Chemical Co., Inc., 810 F.2d 
726 (8th Cir.  1986), cert.  den., October 5, 1987.  The fact that the 
Supreme Court declined to hear this case lends some weight to the 
belief that the Court supports the 8th Circuit court's decision, but 
does not set Supreme Court precedent.) To date, however, the Supreme 
Court has not squarely addressed the issue of Superfund retroactivity.

 <P>    Retroactive liability is unfair. Fairness is another problem with 
retroactive liability. It is unfair to hold people accountable today 
for actions taken decades ago, perhaps by a previous owner of the land 
with several intervening owners. Yet the law, as enforced, does just
that. Thus, a farmer may find that his grandfather -- or indeed, 
someone whom he has never heard of -- fouled the sub-soil 50 years 
earlier using state-of-the-art equipment, and the farmer must fix the 
entire problem, no matter how much it costs. Even if the farmer caused 
the problem himself back in the 1960s, is it really fair to assume 
that a law-abiding citizen should know that his actions -- reasonable
at the time -- could destroy his children's inheritance of the family 
farm? Not only environmental sensitivity, but environmental knowledge 
has increased exponentially since that time.

<P>     Retroactive liability has triggered an avalanche of litigation. 
The third problem with this liability scheme is a very practical one: 
it leads to constant litigation. Litigation probably is the biggest 
contributor to Superfund's failure to achieve its primary objective of
cleaning up hazardous waste sites. 

  <P>   Perhaps the most important practical problem is that
retroactivity increases the raw number of PRPs for any given site. 
Numerous individuals and companies may have owned the land over the 
decades. Moreover, each of the previous owners typically had dealings 
with others who might be liable. When the fact that large numbers of 
owners and other potentially liable parties often have poor records, 
it is little wonder that those already targeted by the EPA as deep 
pockets turn to the courts to defray the costs.

 <P>    Another problem is that records for actions taken decades ago can 
be difficult to obtain. If an entrepreneur conducted regular business 
in the 1950s through the 1970s with a chemical company that created a 
hazardous waste site, he usually would not have kept records dating 
back that far. He would be ill-suited to defend himself in court 
against canceled checks and other such records from the chemical
company. His own culpability may be small or nonexistent, but without 
records of his own, the evidence may point to his liability. Moreover, 
since the law also is strict, joint and several, the entrepreneur is 
potentially liable for the entire cleanup if he has the deepest 
pockets. Thus,  liability potentially can occur due to a failure to
maintain decades-old records. 

<P>     Another practical problem of retroactivity is that companies 
recognize the government could very well decide to increase standards 
beyond those required today. After all, retroactivity has proved no 
barrier with this law. Thus, companies are vulnerable to uncertain and 
unknowable liability costs in the future. Naturally, this further
motivates companies involved in litigation to reduce their share of 
the liability by suing as many other companies as possible. (This list 
of problems is not exhaustive, but is representative only.)

<P>     In all, transaction cost accounts for approximately 32 percent of 
total private sector CERCLA costs, although the average varies from 17 
percent to 60 percent according to firm size. (Jan Paul Acton, Lloyd 
S.  Dixon, with Deborah Drezner, Laural Hill, and Steven McKenney, 
Superfund and Transaction Costs:  The Experience of Insurers and Very
Large Industrial Firms (Santa Monica, CA:  Rand Institute for Civil 
Justice, 1992).) Litigation comprises 65 percent of this amount, or 21 
percent of the total average site cost. While this figure is 
significantly lower than the widely publicized, yet inaccurate, 
estimate of 80 percent of site cost, it nevertheless represents a 
figure of about $6.7 million per site.
<P>
Cleanup Standards Are Overly Stringent, Inflexible

<P>     The extremely high costs of actually cleaning up Superfund sites 
also contribute to delay of cleanups and litigation. Although EPA 
estimates that hazardous waste sites are a medium to low health risk, 
the average site cleanup is now estimated at $24 million to $46 
million. (Ibid.  The $32 million figure is based on 108 companies at
18 sites with annual revenues less than $20 billion between 1981-
1991.) Yet this figure is unnecessarily high because of overly 
stringent and inflexible cleanup standards. This leads to numerous and 
costly problems. (The problems discussed are not exhaustive.)

<P>     The most egregious problem was highlighted by the Office of 
Technology Assessment when it found that cleanup decisions at the 
majority of Superfund sites are based on hypothetical future risks 
rather than on actual or likely future risks. ("Coming Clean:  
Superfund Problems Can Be Solved...  ," Office of Technology 
Assessment, October 1989.  Others also have identified this problem.) 
This means that remote or inaccessible contaminated sites that pose no
current or likely future danger to people's health are given a 
priority just as high as sites that expose people to a real present 
danger. In fact, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry 
announced in 1990 that under 12 percent of all Superfund sites pose an 
actual or current risk to human health or the environment. (Kathryn A.  
Kelly, Dr.  P.H., Nanette C.  Cardon, M.S., M.L.I.S., "The Myth of
10(-6) as a Definition of Acceptable Risk," EPA Watch, Vol.  3, No. 17 
(September 15, 1994), p.  8, citing reference in C.B.  Doty and C.C.  
Travis, "Is EPA's National Priorities List Correct?" Environmental 
Science and Technology Vol.  24, No.  12, pp.  1778- 1782.)

 <P>    To place sites on the National Priorities List, EPA uses a system 
known as the "hazardous ranking system" (HRS) to score sites on a 100 
point scale. If a site ranks 28.5 or above, it qualifies for the NPL. 
Yet this system has been widely criticized. As Peter Guerrero, 
Associate Director of Environmental Protection Issues at the General 
Accounting Office (GAO) stated, the HRS "utilizes an arbitrary 
criterion... not based on the risks posed by the sites." (Richard L.  
Stroup, Sandra L.  Goodman, "Rights vs.  Regulation:  How to Reform 
Superfund" (Political Economy Research Center, Bozeman, MT, September 
1994), endnote #17, p.37, citing Peter F.  Guerrero, testifying before 
the Subcommittee on Oversight of the Committee on Ways and Means, June 
11, 1992.  Serial 102-122, p.37.) 

 <P>    Another problem is CERCLA's preference for permanent cleanup, as 
opposed to on-going treatment or containment. This preference drives 
up the costs of remediation because containment and isolation are 
discouraged. Even if blanketing layers of plastic and clay on the 
soil, surrounding the property with a fence, and posting guards would 
completely eliminate exposure to the public for a small fraction of 
the cost of remediation, this option is not available. Moreover, 
Superfund is structured so that states pay only 10 percent of remedial 
construction costs, while it requires them to pay 100 percent of the 
Operation and Maintenance (O&M) costs of Superfund sites in the state.
Although ongoing treatment may cost much less over the long run and 
may reduce public exposure equally well -- and in some situations, 
more -- states have a built-in incentive to demand permanent and 
extremely strict cleanup standards in an effort to avoid future O&M 
costs. Thus, states reduce their costs, but companies, through 
increased taxation, needlessly pay more.

 <P>    Another problem is that EPA uses a range of "risks" -- from one 
in ten thousand to one in a million -- to define when the probability 
of contracting cancer crosses the line from being an acceptable risk 
to an unacceptable risk. Thus, one official may consider a site to be 
"hazardous," and thus subject to CERCLA, if the risk of cancer from 
the materials at the site is one in ten thousand over a lifetime. But
another EPA official may use a risk level of one in a million. There 
is much disagreement over whether using a range of risks is proper or 
whether EPA should set a single specific risk level, or risk-point, 
that is acceptable. The more important controversy, however, centers 
not on the range argument, but on whether using a one in a million
risk of contracting cancer over a lifetime of exposure is appropriate 
at all. (Any specific numerical risk level should be at the lower end 
of the current range, and should act as a threshold floor for 
prioritizing cleanups.)

<P>     Conceptually, it helps to put this risk level in context of 
overall cancer rates. The chance of developing cancer from all causes 
is 1 in 3, or 33 percent. Thus, if a site increases the cancer risk to 
an exposed person by one in a million, it increases the person's 
overall cancer risk by only .0003 percent. This is an extremely small 
increase in the overall chances of someone contracting cancer.
Realistically, moreover, it is unlikely that many people would be 
exposed over an entire lifetime. Thus, the real cancer risk increase 
is smaller yet.

 <P>    Oddly, there is no scientific justification for choosing a one in 
a million risk level. It has "never received widespread debate or even 
thorough regulatory or scientific review. It is an arbitrary level 
proposed 30 years ago for completely different regulations,... the
circumstances of which do not apply to hazardous waste site
regulation." (Kelly and Cardon, "The Myth of 10(-6) as a Definition of 
Acceptable Risk," p.  4.) Moreover, no one seems to know how this risk 
level came to be the standard of a one in a million risk. In fact, 
when representatives of Environmental Technologies International, 
Inc., asked one federal agency where the standard came from, they were
told, "You really shouldn't be asking these questions." (Ibid.)

<P>
PROBLEMS WITH THE REFORM BILLS

<P>     Given that the Superfund program is facing hundreds of billions 
in cleanup costs in the next few years it is critical that the five- 
year reauthorization bill address these two fundamental problems. 
Unfortunately, both the House and Senate bills make only half-hearted 
attempts to address them. Instead of repealing the law's liability
scheme, it sets up instead an unwise and inequitable fund that will 
settle only part of Superfund's litigation problems. With regard to 
cleanup standards, the bills fail to adopt acceptable risk standards 
for cleanup and site prioritization. Finally, they include unnecessary
giveaways for organized labor and environmental activists that will 
only increase the cost of the Superfund program. 
<P>
Failing to Establish Real Reform in CERCLA's Liability
<P>
     Perhaps the most controversial liability reform in the bills is 
the proposed Environmental Insurance Resolution Fund (EIRF). The EIRF 
ostensibly is designed to settle the problem created under current law 
that virtually forces companies to sue the insurance industry because 
the extent of insurer liability is not easily settled. Not only does
this drive up litigation costs, but it hurts the insurance industry's 
ability to make sound business decisions. Insurance is based on 
spreading risk, which in turn is based on actuarial calculations -- in 
short, the insurance industry is built on the predictability of risk. 
Yet Superfund defeats this purpose by inserting huge uncertainties 
into the process.
<P>
     This has hurt both insurance companies offering commercial 
multiperil coverage and those insured. Some insurance companies face 
bankruptcy, and those remaining are unable to gauge their liability 
exposure for policies written decades ago. Hence, CERCLA creates 
uncertainties in premium rate setting today because insurers must 
somehow recoup these losses through cost shifting. (Moreover, the
inevitable cost shifting hurts modern companies with newer policies 
because the insurance industry's liability costs for old policies are 
shifted to them indirectly.) 

<P>  The EIRF has been proposed as a way to enable insurers to "insure 
against" this uncertainty by creating a fund financed by an $8.1 
billion tax over ten years on the entire insurance industry offering 
commercial multiperil coverage. The tax, which would be levied on both 
direct insurers and reinsurers, would fund voluntary settlements by 
PRPs. Essentially, PRPs found liable for cleanup could agree to accept 
reimbursement from the fund in exchange for agreeing to settle any 
claim they had instituted against the insurers prior to this 
reauthorization. (The bills include specific provisions as to 
eligibility, timing, and necessary documentation.  The term "insurers" 
refers to both direct insurers and reinsurers.) This often would be 
advantageous to insured companies since their liability would be 
certain and litigation costs would be reduced. The choice to accept
the settlement would be voluntary for the insured company, so even 
though an insurer pays the tax, it still could be liable for all 
existing claims depending on the PRPs' decision-making. (The 
reimbursement offer made to the PRPs would be based on a fixed 
percentage of the cleanup costs.  These fixed reimbursement rates, 
broken into categories, vary according to the state.  The amounts were 
based roughly on the relative average awards by courts against 
insurers in each state.  Thus, each state is assigned to one of three
percentage categories for reimbursement settlements:  20 percent , 40 
percent , or 60 percent.  Most states are classified in the 40 percent 
reimbursement category, with a few states in each of the 20 percent 
and 40 percent reimbursement categories.  The categories, however, are
unnecessarily limited and broad.  Also, it is claimed that at least 
two states have been miscategorized.) Moreover, since future claims 
would not be covered by the fund, insurance companies would continue 
to be exposed to uncertain risk.

<P>     If fewer than 85 percent of the PRPs potentially eligible for 
awards did not accept the fund's settlement offer within 150 days of 
the bill's enactment, however, the fund would not be created. (Note 
that there would not be a five month accumulation of money in the EIRF 
because, although taxes are being accrued through the first 150 days,
payments are due only after the fund becomes operative, if at all. 
This period could be up to 150 days (known as the contingency period).  
This is a sound approach.) If this occurs, and there really is no way 
to assess adequately the probability of reaching the 85 percent 
threshold, one of the cornerstones of the "reform" would disintegrate. 
(The reauthorization attempts to increase the likelihood of achieving 
at least 85 percent by penalizing companies that decide to take 
advantage of their right to settle the matter in court, and either 
lose or are awarded less than the settlement offer.  In such cases, 
the insurance companies' attorneys' fees must be paid by the company.  
While an effective strategy, it is unfair and only is necessary
because the reform is so timid in its overall approach to real 
reform.)
<P>
     Even if the fund became operative, and thus brought some 
predictability to the situation, the EIRF is ill-conceived. Under H.R. 
3800, 70 percent of the tax raised in the first four years is to be 
financed through retrospective taxes on net premiums charged between 
1968 and 1985. (As this paper goes to press, the taxing structure in 
S.1834 is indeterminate.  This will change, however, during mark-up of
the bill by the Senate Finance Committee scheduled for September 28.  
Most notably, the Administration has proposed that the tax on 
reinsurers be different from that on direct insurers by making the tax 
on reinsurers 100 percent retrospective.  This would address some of 
the problems discussed regarding H.R.  3800, but would not eliminate
the problems from the Senate bill.  Moreover, the financing mechanism 
that would emerge from a conference of both chambers cannot be 
accurately predicted.  Note that the 70 percent figure in the text 
accompanying this footnote applies to years one to four only.  During 
years five to ten, retroactive taxes will account for approximately 25
percent of the annual total.) But retrospective taxes simply are 
unfair. While they may not be penal in nature, they nevertheless exact 
taxes based on financial activity between 26 and 9 years into the 
past. While many insurance companies may not be adversely affected by 
the tax, since they will recoup the loss through reduced future 
liability, others will be net losers. Many of these companies might 
have been more prudent when writing policies, or for other reasons may
have smaller liability risks in relation to their premiums. (There can 
be many reasons for this situation.  Insurance companies could have 
collected higher insurance premiums per policy for their level of 
Superfund liability exposure because their policies subjected them to 
what then was perceived to be greater risks.  Conversely, they could
have insured companies, that on average, pose lower Superfund 
liability risk to the insurance company.) Yet they would be taxed just 
as much.

<P>     A prospective tax is even more unfair, and some 30 percent of the 
proposed tax for the first four years -- and 75 percent for years five 
through ten -- is prospective. The entire purpose of the EIRF is to 
settle liability uncertainties from old policies, yet a prospective 
tax is based on future policies. This means insurance companies
offering multiperil insurance coverage that cut back market share or 
were less cautious in decades past reap a windfall at the expense of 
the cautious or expanding companies. For example, Lloyd's of London 
has cut back its market share considerably, but still faces enormous 
liability for past policies. Under a prospective tax, the firm's total 
exposure is reduced considerably at the expense of American insurers,
who would pay disproportionately. While the Administration proposes to 
amend this structure in the Senate bill to eliminate prospective taxes 
on reinsurers, the problems of the EIRF's inequitable collection of 
taxes cannot be completely cured. 

<P>     Despite the Clinton Administration's assurances that the EIRF is 
a "consensus" position, only a small percentage of insurance companies 
support this tax. The over 2,000 companies opposing the EIRF typically 
are much smaller than the companies supporting the EIRF. But even so, 
those opponents represent approximately two-thirds of total premiums 
written. This hardly represents consensus in favor of the new tax. As 
Jack Ramirez, Executive Vice President for the National Association of 
Independent Insurers, stated, "We are strongly opposed to the 
insurance fund. The product they have come up with is not the 
industry's  position, although it is being represented as such." 
("House Subcommittee Approves Reform Bill; State Role, Voluntary
Cleanup Titles Added," National Environment Daily, Bureau of National 
Affairs, May 13, 1994.) Rather than impose an inequitable $8.1 billion 
tax that has limited support at best, Congress would be better served 
by dealing with one of the fundamental problems of Superfund: a flawed 
liability standard.

<P>     Another important provision also is ill-advised. The bills 
attempt to reduce legal costs by allowing companies to use an 
arbitration process in which the costs would be allocated among the 
liable PRPs. On its surface, this proposal sounds like a step in the 
right direction because it would alleviate much of the litigious 
burden of joint and several liability. However, the proposal has a 
very serious built-in problem. Many companies may be unwilling to use
this system because it is an informal process that denies them the 
protection of the normal rules of evidence and procedure in court. 

<P>     To discourage companies from rejecting a settlement offer based 
on the arbitrator's decision, any company choosing to use the courts
still would face joint and several liability. The Administration has
stated candidly that this is intended as a stick to influence
companies to choose arbitrated settlements. In fact, if a company
rejects what it considers an unfair settlement offer, the bills
expressly make the company subject to liability for the portion of the
cleanup that the arbitrator allocated to the orphan share. For
example, suppose a company sought a court ruling on a $30 million
cleanup because the company was allocated 10 percent of the liability
when it caused only one percent, or $300,000, of the problem. By
rejecting the government's settlement offer to pay 10 percent, the
company potentially would face liability for the entire $30 million.
The proposed structure thus would be severely punish companies for
seeking the legitimate protections of the court.
<P>
Limited Steps in the Right Direction
<P>
     While these provisions, and the lack of reform of the underlying
liability scheme would ensure that costs continue to explode for five
more years, not all provisions in the bills move in the wrong
direction. Although the additional provisions are only limited steps
that largely would be unnecessary if real reforms were enacted, they
nevertheless move in the right direction.
<P>
     One positive provision in the bills is lender liability reform,
which would provide needed stability to the lending industry. This is
significant because an unintended consequence of CERCLA, as now
written, is that it dries up real estate loans. As interpreted by the
courts, lenders who foreclose on properties held as collateral or
exercise financial management, perhaps to rehabilitate a loan, are
subject to Superfund's liability scheme. (For a full discussion of the
legal issues, see In Re Bergsoe Metal Corp., U.S.  Ct.  App., 9th
Cir., 910 F.2d 668 (1990).) Thus, lenders have become hesitant to make
loans based on collateral that might be subject to later litigation
under the Act. Lenders are at risk of not only losing their original
loan investment, but of becoming liable for cleanup costs of perhaps
millions of dollars. Moreover, because banks typically are "deep
pockets," they are likely to end up paying more of the cleanup costs.
So, lenders now typically require that studies be undertaken to assure
the property is free of any contamination. If it is not, an original
or refinance loan on the property is virtually impossible to obtain.
<P>
     The benefit to the government of this situation is that banks
investigate or require potential applicants to investigate properties
around the nation for contamination, thus helping it to identify
contaminated sites more swiftly and cheaply. In effect, CERCLA has
imposed an unfunded mandate on the lending industry.
<P>
     Under the pending legislation, lenders' liability essentially
would be limited to their level of investment in the mortgaged
property. This is an important step in the right direction, it stops
short of taking this concept to its logical conclusion. Lenders should
not be liable for the costs of cleaning land that may have been
polluted without their knowledge or effective control. While the
extent of liability may now be quantified, which provides needed
stability, even limited liability distorts the economic markets and
unfairly shifts the burdens of Superfund onto innocent investors.
<P>
     Another worthwhile provision would reduce the state's
contribution to Operation and Maintenance costs of cleaned sites from
100 percent to a comparably small rate consistent with construction
remediation costs. This change will reduce the incentive on states to
demand unreasonably stringent cleanup standards to "front-load" the
costs so that the federal government will pay the vast majority of the
project cost. (Under current law, although the states must pay 100
percent of future O&M costs, they are only liable for 10 percent of
the front-end cleanup costs.  The bills set a 15 percent uniform share
for state governments.  This aspect of the provision has been
criticized because it will increase the burden to the states for
front-end construction costs.) 
<P>
     Yet another useful provision would create an exemption for so-
called micromis, or truly tiny, contributors. While this is welcome
relief, it would be unnecessary were it not for the current liability
scheme. Moreover, the provision is not without problems. If
Superfund's liability scheme is kept in place, truly tiny contributors
should be relieved of the burden of proving a negative -- that they
did not contribute significantly to the pollution.
<P>
Failing to Establish Reasonable Standards
<P>
     The House and Senate bills, unfortunately, fail to correct many
of the problems created by inflexible and overly stringent cleanup
standards. Moreover, while some issues substantively would be
resolved, other standards and requirements would create new problems.

<P>     One of the most controversial provisions would deal with the goal
of protecting human health through cleanup of Superfund sites. This
new national goal "shall be expressed as a single numerical health
risk level that ensures a reasonable certainty of no harm from
exposure to carcinogens and... noncarcinogens." (S.1834, Title V, Sec. 
501.) The risk level would be decided through negotiated rule-making
which would allow EPA to set, and likely result in, an excessively
strict and expensive risk level of one in a million. This would cause
the cost of Superfund cleanups to skyrocket because it would mandate
the cleanup of extremely small risks.

<P>     Another major problem with a national goal is that it would allow
an inflexible "bright-line" for deciding when cleanup should or should
not occur. A more prudent policy would base the cleanup decision on
the risk reduced per dollar of cleanup cost. (See John Shanahan, "How
to Help the Environment without Destroying Jobs," Heritage Foundation
Memo To:  President-Elect Clinton No.  14, January 19, 1993.) Thus,
for every dollar spent on Superfund cleanup, the most immediate risks
to the public would be addressed first. Essentially, the law should be
structured to get the "biggest bang for every environmental buck." But
as the Washington, D.C.-based non-profit National Research Council
found, none of the agencies with responsibility over waste sites,
including EPA, "have developed [their] over-all priority-setting
process in a manner that is explicit, adequately documented, and
sufficiently open to scientific and public scrutiny." (Bureau of
National Affairs, National Environmental Daily, September 12, 1994,
discussing National Research Council, Commission on Geosciences,
Environment and Resources, "Ranking Hazardous Waste Sites for Remedial
Action," September 8, 1994.) But these prioritization changes, plus
similar changes in other environmental laws, would allow the greatest
risks to the public to be reduced first, regardless of the type of
environmental problem. In this way, the nation could more efficiently
spend fewer dollars while pursuing a chosen "acceptable" risk level. 

<P>     The bills grant exemptions to PRPs from achieving the new
numerical risk standard if the necessary cleanup would be either
technically infeasible or unreasonably costly. In either case, the EPA
Administrator would be allowed to set a lesser cleanup level at a cost
that, while possibly quite large, is not unreasonable. At first
glance, this seems like a reasonable step in the right direction. But
a closer look reveals that the bills further codify the use of
unnecessarily strict cleanup standards. 

 <P>    The exceptions granted in the bill are qualified by the language
that the lesser cleanup standard chosen to avoid a unreasonable cost
cannot "result in a unacceptable risk to human health.... " Thus, any
relief from unreasonable costs must result in an acceptable risk. Two
questions about this exception must be asked: 1) Why should PRPs not
granted an exception pay huge sums if lesser standards would result in
an acceptable risk? 2) What does an "unreasonable" cost mean? Either
the bills are in most cases mandating expensive cleanups to meet
excessive cleanup standards, or the exception is meaningless since
both reasonable and unreasonable costs must be set at the same risk
level -- acceptable. 

<P>     Not all provisions in the bills, however, are so poorly crafted.
To its credit, the Administration effectively exempts industrial sites
and other properties from Superfund's unnecessarily stringent
requirements. Currently, CERCLA is indifferent to the traditional or
expected future use of the contaminated property. CERCLA's standards
effectively require that the dirt be clean enough to eat. (While there
is no official standard that the soil be "clean enough to eat," it
serves as an effective criterion because of the exposure assumptions
built into the standards, such as ingestion of a certain amount of
soil per day.) While this arguably may make sense in a residential
community, it is certainly unnecessary in an industrial park where
there is little likelihood of exposure to the soil. 

<P>     As a result of these high standards, industrial operators
invariably decide to locate their plants on pristine sites in order to
avoid future liability for cleaning up another company's expensive
mess. Often, the companies that contaminated plots have gone out
business in the intervening years, so the properties have become
"orphan sites," effectively increasing the cost to the public. (While
the costs are directly levied on businesses, much of this cost is
passed on to the consumer through increased prices.  Additionally,
there are the losses to the public in the form of reduced dividends to
shareholders and income to workers for costs that companies cannot
pass on to the consumer.) Even if these sites are cleaned up,
companies have little incentive to locate on them for fear of future
litigation. Since many of these older polluted industrial sites are
located in urban areas, Superfund effectively acts as barrier to urban
revitalization. Thus, the poor and minorities, who disproportionately
live in urban areas, are the unintended victims of this policy.
(Unfortunately, the Administration through S.  1834 and H.R.  3800
unwisely attempts to address "environmental justice" through the
creation of a Superfund affirmative action plan.  An in-depth analysis
of the problems created by "environmental justice" provisions,
however, and other provisions effectively targeted to the same groups,
is beyond the scope of this paper.) The bills properly relax the
unnecessary cleanup standards by allowing the EPA Administrator to
take into account the intended and historical uses of property in
setting the standards. Thus, albeit by a circuitous path, the bills do
take into account real expected exposures for some sites. 
<P>
Financing Environmental Pork 

 <P>    The bills also contain plenty of pork barrel spending for
organized labor and environmentalists. The House bill now under
consideration contains a provision applying the Davis-Bacon prevailing
wage law to Superfund cleanup sites. (The Clinton proposal did not
include Davis-Bacon provisions.) By mandating that PRPs pay union
wages, Congress is moving in the diametrically opposite direction of
containing Superfund costs, reducing litigation, and accelerating
cleanup. There can be no justification for mandating that cleanups be
more expensive than necessary. 

<P>     Perhaps the most egregious provision, however, effectively
creates an environmental welfare program diverting Superfund's money
to environmental activists. (This provision is in both bills.) Grants
totaling up to 4 percent of the Superfund pay-out in any given year,
or approximately $63.4 million, would be given to private citizens to
investigate hazardous waste sites, including those not on the National
Priorities List. (S.1834, Title I, sec.  101.  Those sites not listed
on the NPL would be limited to 1/8th of total grant expenditures.  The
dollar figure estimate cited in the text is based on 4 percent of
estimated Superfund outlays for Fiscal Year 1995, or $1,585,979,000. 
Naturally, this dollar figure would climb as Superfund figures
climbed.) The grants may be used to hire "experts" for informational
reasons, to hire a community liaison to PRPs, "to hire experts to file
comments with the federal government and generate other documents,"
and "for training funds for interested affected citizens to enable
them to more effectively participate in the remedy selection process."
None of the rules that govern agencies in selecting experts would
apply since all decisions would be made by private citizens, although
"guidelines" would be published. Thus, the grants would be open to
large-scale abuse.
<P>
     The practical effect, if not the purpose, of this provision would
be to make it easy for environmental activists to get paid with
federal tax dollars for what they now do with voluntary donations.
Environmental activists would be able to increase the scope of their
activities as well as their payrolls. 
<P>
     Another provision in both bills pursues a completely different
environmental objective -- recycling. The bills exempt from liability
recyclers who inadvertently contaminate property with hazardous waste.
(S.1834, sec.  410, adding new section, sec.  130(j).) Essentially,
this provision would reward recyclers for their environmentally benign
intent despite the actual damage done by their physical actions. It is
ironic that polluters pursuing other societal objectives, such as
national defense and health care, which arguably are as important to
the nation as recycling, are denied this favorable status. Indeed,
this provision would shift the recycler's costs onto those other
sectors because, as written, they would have to pay the recycler's
shares. (Moreover, recyclers who have been unsuccessfully sued to pay
for site cleanup would be allowed to recover attorney's fees. 
However, this treatment is not given to other PRPs that have
successfully sued a non-qualifying recycler.  While the "English rule"
of allowing the recovery of attorney's fees is preferable to the
dominant "American rule" of no recovery of fees as a general matter,
there is no justification for this unequal treatment.  The section
also has an arbitrary cut-off date of February 3, 1994; this date
coincides with the bill's introduction.) 
<P>
A WORKABLE SOLUTION

  <P>   The best solution to the current problems with Superfund would be
to repeal retroactive, joint and several liability. With the repeal of
retroactive liability, all sites contaminated before 1980 -- when
Superfund was enacted -- would be "orphaned," meaning that no one is
liable under the law. With the repeal of joint and several liability,
moreover, whenever actual polluters that partially contaminated sites
after Superfund was enacted could not be found, their shares of the
cleanup costs would become orphan shares. Cleaning up these orphan
shares would thus require expenditures from the Superfund created for
just this purpose. If society wishes to clean up orphan sites for
which no responsible party can be found, then society should pay the
tab -- Congress should not use a tax to shift the cost to another set
of innocent "deep pockets."

  <P>   The fund, however, should not be given additional appropriations
to account for this liability scheme change. Rather, substantive
reforms should be enacted to make cleanup standards more flexible and
less stringent. These two changes, together with the lower EPA
oversight costs that would follow, would reduce the average cost of
cleanups considerably. Limiting Superfund finances in this way would
force EPA to prioritize site cleanups according to its assessment of
which sites posed an actual present threat to public safety and would
force the agency to use judgment in reducing each site's cleanup
costs. Congress should give EPA the flexibility to make these
judgments. Adding more money to Superfund, or creating the
Environmental Insurance Resolution Fund, would remove this pressure
for substantive reform.
<P>
CONCLUSION

 <P>    The Superfund reauthorization now being considered by Congress
has been touted as a major reform of the costly Superfund program,
which is widely considered one of -- if not the -- most ineffective
and unfair laws today. Unfortunately, the reforms being considered are
as disappointing as the current law. If the proposed reauthorization
becomes law, it will: create yet another fund -- this one financed
through a new $8.1 billion tax on the insurance industry; create an
"environmental pork" grant program that will benefit environmental
activists, and inequitably shift recyclers' shares of costs of
cleanups to others who often are already paying more than their fair
share. Moreover, those few reforms that make positive strides, such as
limiting lender liability, are only half-measures.
<P>
     The most striking aspect of the reform, however, is what it will
not do. It will not reform the retroactive, strict, joint and several
liability system that is causing much of the litigation now plaguing
Superfund. Nor will it do much more than tinker around the edges of
the fundamental cost drivers of cleanups -- overly strict and
inflexible standards. Hence, the most important accomplishment of this
reform will be to lock in the most unworkable provisions of the
current law for another five years during a time of exploding costs,
thus ensuring even greater waste into the future.

INTRODUCTION
<P>
     The Clinton Administration wants the Senate to ratify quickly the
Chemical Weapons Convention, a treaty negotiated during the heady
early days of the "new world order" and signed by the United States on
January 13, 1993.  So far, the Chemical Weapons Convention has been
signed by 157 countries.  It will enter into force and become
recognized international law when 65 countries have ratified it and
deposited the signed and ratified documents with the Office of the
United Nations Secretary General in New York.
<P>
     Hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have
begun, and Chairman Claiborne Pell (D-RI) has said he hopes for a full
Senate vote by July 15.  But there is cause for concern that the
Chemical Weapons Convention will not fulfill its promise of
eliminating chemical weapons worldwide.  No country is required to
join the convention.  Syria and North Korea, two suspected chemical
weapons developers, have indicated they will not.  Further, the
treaty's verification procedures, although highly intrusive, are still
inadequate to catch governments determined to cheat.  In the end, the
Chemical Weapons Convention will only deceive law-abiding countries
like the United States into believing the chemical weapons threat has
been eliminated.
<P>
     Worse, the treaty creates a large international bureaucracy with
the authority to conduct highly intrusive inspections for chemical
weapons on the territory of treaty participants.  This bureaucracy,
likely to be a cross between the International Atomic Energy Agency
and the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency, will be granted
unimpeded access to American chemical manufacturing plants and
facilities, even if they are not suspected of producing chemical
weapons.  For example, inspections may be performed on facilities that
process or consume, as well as produce, certain types of chemicals
that may be used in weapons.  Some of these chemicals are found in
fertilizers and pesticides.  Thus, an agricultural facility that uses
certain types of fertilizers or pesticides may be subject to
inspection.  Dealing with these inspections undoubtedly will impose
heavy additional costs on U.S.  chemical companies.
<P>
     In fulfilling its constitutional role of advice and consent for
international treaties, the Senate should answer a series of basic
questions before determining the value of this or any treaty.  For
example, does the agreement: 
<P>
* contribute to U.S.  national security? 
<P>
* reduce the risk of war? 
<P>
* leave America with a military force commensurate with its global
  obligations?
<P>
* lend itself to verification? 
<P>
*  have adequate enforcement mechanisms? 
<P>
     In the case of the Chemical Weapons Convention, none of these
questions can be answered with enough certainty to justify the risk of
ratifying it.  In order to protect the interests of the United States,
the Senate should:
<P>
Demand a new treaty be drafted that is modeled on the Nuclear Non-
    Proliferation Treaty.  The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
    designates certain countries, such as the U.S., as states that are
    permitted to deploy nuclear weapons.  The Senate should press the
    Administration to withdraw the Chemical Weapons Convention and
    begin a new round of negotiations at the United Nations Conference
    on Disarmament to draft a new Chemical Weapons Convention.  The
    new agreement should permit the U.S.  to maintain a chemical
    stockpile as a deterrent to such known chemical weapons states as 
    Russia, Iraq, and North Korea.  Taking this approach also would
    exempt the U.S.  from intrusive inspections by international
    bureaucrats.
<P>
Establish a new policy for deterring chemical weapons strikes.  In May
    1991, President George Bush announced a decision to halt U.S. 
    production of new chemical munitions, eliminate existing U.S. 
    chemical weapons stockpiles, and foreswear the use of chemical
    weapons under any circumstances.  This step reversed existing U.S. 
    policy of threatening to respond in kind to a chemical attack. 
    The U.S.  should declare a new deterrence policy toward chemical
    weapons that resembles the one that existed prior to Bush's
    announcement.  This will require that the U.S.  retain chemical
    munitions.  Further, the U.S.  should declare that under
    extraordinary circumstances it reserves the right to respond to a
    chemical attack with nuclear weapons. 
<P>
Improve U.S.  defenses against chemical weapons.  The Chemical Weapons
    Convention will not protect U.S.  forces against chemical attack. 
    Outlaw nations will continue to produce and stockpile such
    weapons.  Given these circumstances, the U.S.  will need not only
    to maintain a chemical deterrent, but also to possess defenses
    against chemical weapons.  These should include sensors capable of
    detecting the presence of chemicals in the atmosphere, gas masks
    and protective clothing, missiles and aircraft capable of
    destroying chemical weapons delivery vehicles, and training for
    troops who may have to operate in a contaminated environment.
  <P>
Enhance the U.S.  ability to destroy not only chemical weapons on the
    battlefield, but their production and storage facilities as well. 
    In addition to relying on deterrence and defenses to counter
    chemical weapons, U.S.  armed forces need to be able to destroy
    chemical weapons production and storage facilities.  The same
    pertains to enemy forces deployed with chemical munitions.  Thus,
    Air Force and Navy attack forces must have enhanced capabilities
    to conduct strike missions against chemical forces and facilities
    in ways that limit contamination.
<P>
Strengthen arms control enforcement mechanisms.  One of the reasons
    that arms control agreements can pose such a threat to U.S. 
    security is that a policy of strict enforcement is lacking. 
    Absent such a policy, the Chemical Weapons Convention is likely to
    be unenforceable.  In part, this is because the convention puts
    enforcement powers in the hands of the United Nations Security
    Council.  The impact of this weakness could be lessened by
    designating the five permanent members of the Security Council as
    weapons states under the convention.  Otherwise, full enforcement
    of the convention will require that these states, each of which
    has the power to veto any enforcement resolution, find themselves
    in violation of the convention's terms.
<P>
THE DECADES-LONG EFFORT TO BAN CHEMICAL WEAPONS
<P>
     It has long been the aim of diplomats to curtail both the use and
stockpiling of chemical weapons.  Among the earliest attempts in
modern times to ban the use of chemical weapons was the 1907 Hague
Convention.  Approved by the European powers, the convention
prohibited the use of weapons containing poison, but the widespread
use of chemical weapons in World War I proved that this prohibition
had little effect. (Mark C.  Storella, Poisoning Arms Control:  The
Soviet Union and Chemical/Biological Weapons (Washington, D.C.: 
Institute for Foreign Policy Analysis, 1984), pp.  4-5.)  After the
war, a League of Nations conference convened in Switzerland to approve
the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which prohibited the use of both biological
and chemical weapons in war, but not their development, production,
and stockpiling.  Among the countries signing the Geneva Protocol were
the U.S., France, Germany, Britain, Italy, and Japan.  Unlike the 1907
Hague Convention, the Geneva Protocol was successful once war broke
out.  Chemical weapons were not used widely during World War II, but
this success was due to implicit threats by allied leaders,
particularly President Franklin Roosevelt, to respond in kind to any
chemical attack. (Roosevelt stated the following on June 8, 1943, when
there were reports that the Axis powers were considering the use of
poison gas:  "Use of such weapons has been outlawed by the general
opinion of civilized mankind.  This country has not used, and I hope
that we never will be compelled to use them.  I state categorically
that we shall under no circumstances resort to the use of such weapons
unless they are first used by our enemies.")  It is one of history's
clearest examples of a successful deterrence policy.
<P>
      The Geneva Protocol is still in force, and the U.S.  honors its
terms, although it did not ratify the protocol until 1975.  It is,
however, a weak agreement.  If countries violate it, they remain
unpunished, and there are no established procedures for determining
the veracity of reported claims of biological or chemical weapons use. 
It is sometimes referred to as the "no first use" agreement because
participating states agreed to comply with its terms so long as
biological or chemical weapons were not used against them first.  Some
states, including the U.S., ratified the agreement with the
reservation that it would cease to be binding if they were attacked
first.
<P>
     Violations of the Geneva Protocol have occurred on several
occasions since the end of World War II.  The Soviet Union and its
clients, for example, used mycotoxins, commonly referred to as "yellow
rain," against civilians in Afghanistan and Southeast Asia in the
1970s and 1980s, (Alexander M.  Haig, Jr., Chemical Warfare in
Southeast Asia and Afghanistan (Washington, D.C.:  Department of
State, 1982).) and Iraq used chemical weapons during its eight-year
war with Iran in the 1980s. (W.  Seth Carus, "Chemical Weapons in the
Middle East," Policy Focus, The Washington Institute for Near East
Policy, December 1988, p.  4.)
<P>
     Negotiations leading to the Chemical Weapons Convention began in
1971 when the U.N.  Conference on Disarmament's predecessor
organization, the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee, voted to
conduct separate talks on banning biological and chemical weapons. 
This allowed for the conclusion of the Biological Weapons Convention,
which banned the production and stockpiling of biological and toxin
weapons in 1972, but put negotiations to ban chemical weapons on the
back burner for well over a decade.
<P>
     By the mid-1980s, the Reagan Administration, expressing concern
over the large-scale Soviet chemical weapons program, began producing
a new generation of chemical munitions for the U.S.  military.  The
subsequent U.S.  program was legal because the 1925 Geneva Protocol
outlawed only the use, not the development, production, and
stockpiling, of chemical munitions.
<P>
     Diplomatic efforts in the 1980s focused on stopping the spread of
chemical weapons to Third World countries.  In 1984, Australia
proposed to establish controls on the export of ingredients that could
be used to manufacture chemical weapons.  This proposal was made to
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), an
organization of the industrialized states to coordinate economic
development policies for the Third World.  The Australians wanted
participating countries to coordinate export control policies to stem
the transfer of chemical weapons-related technologies to the Third
World.  Specific restrictions and enforcement mechanisms were left to
individual governments.  The "Australia Group" now has 20 members,
including such prominent nations as the U.S., France, Britain, and
Japan. (The Australia Group includes Australia, Austria, Belgium,
Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Holland,
Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal,
Spain, Switzerland, and the United States.) 
<P>
     The informal and voluntary nature of the Australian proposal has
limited its effectiveness.  For example, the enforcement of the export
restrictions falls to individual member governments, but
industrialized nations have a spotty record on how vigorously they
enforce export restrictions.  In the 1980s, a Phillips Petroleum
Company subsidiary in Belgium delivered the chemical thiodiglycol
(used in manufacturing mustard gas) to Iraq, (Gary Thatcher and
Timothy Aeppel, "The Trail to Samarra," The Christian Science Monitor,
December 13, 1988, p.  B-1.) and Britain is reported to have sold
thiodiglycol and thionyl chloride to Iraq in 1988 and 1989. (Ralph
Atkins, et al., "Britain Exported Poisonous Gas Ingredients to Iraq,"
The Financial Times, July 29, 1991, p.  1.)  Both transfers were
contrary to the commitments made by Belgium and Britain in the
Australia Group.  Export control policies, while useful to pursue, by
themselves cannot stop the spread of chemical weapons.
<P>
     Bush's Drive to Ban Chemical Weapons. George Bush came to office
determined to ban chemical weapons.  Bush and Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev signed an agreement on June 1, 1990, in Washington to reduce
the chemical stockpiles of the U.S.  and the Soviet Union to 5,000
metric tons each.  No accord, however, was reached outlining
inspection procedures for confirming the destruction of these weapons. 
That was left to subsequent negotiations which were supposed to be
completed by December 31, 1990.  This deadline passed without
agreement between Moscow and Washington.  The failure was, to some
extent, due to the turmoil in the Soviet Union, which was collapsing
politically.  Further, both sides were aware that progress was being
made on the Chemical Weapons Convention at the U.N.  Conference on
Disarmament, and that this convention would have extensive inspection
procedures and ban the weapons entirely. 
<P>
     Nevertheless, Bush announced on May 13, 1991, in the flush of
America's post-Desert Storm success, that the U.S.  would agree to a
complete ban of chemical weapons even if other nations did not
eliminate their arsenals.  Bush also pledged that the U.S.  would
foreswear the use of chemical weapons under any circumstances,
including situations in which U.S.  forces are attacked with such
weapons first. (The White House, The Weekly Compilation of
Presidential Documents, Vol.  27, No.  20 (May 20, 1991), pp. 
599-600.)
<P>
     Until that time, Washington had reserved the right to use
chemical weapons if attacked with them first and to maintain a
chemical weapons stockpile for the purpose of deterrence and possible
retaliation.  This unilateral concession by the U.S., along with
another to drop the demand for stringent "any time, anywhere"
inspections of possible chemical weapons facilities, put the Chemical
Weapons Convention negotiations on the fast track.  The final draft of
the convention was completed on September 3, 1991, in Geneva and was
signed in Paris by more than the required 65 countries.  Assuming
these 65 countries ratify the convention by July 1994, it will take
effect on January 13, 1995.  Thus far, only seven (Albania, Australia,
Fiji, Mauritius, Norway, the Seychelles, and Sweden) have ratified the
convention; many are waiting for the U.S.  to ratify before they act. 
<P>

 PROVISIONS OF THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION
<P>
     The purpose of the convention is to ban all existing chemical
weapons and forbid their production, stockpiling, and use.  It would
do so by establishing elaborate procedures for eliminating all
chemical weapons no later than ten years after the convention enters
into force and by requiring the elimination of chemical weapons
production facilities within the same ten-year period.  The
convention, however, does not require the destruction of toxic
chemicals, their precursors (chemicals that can be combined to form
toxic chemicals), or facilities or precursors that are used for
peaceful purposes.  Likewise, small stockpiles of lethal chemicals may
be retained for developing defenses against chemical weapons.  These
chemicals, precursors, and production facilities are subject to
verification measures to detect any attempt to convert them into
weapons.  The convention is of unlimited duration, which is designed
to make the destruction of chemical weapons permanent.
<P>
     Overseeing the implementation of the agreement will be a large
international bureaucracy that in many ways resembles the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a U.N.  agency that fosters
cooperation among nations in the peaceful uses of nuclear power.  In a
similar vein, a new chemical weapons bureaucracy will be created and
called the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. 
Headquartered at The Hague, this organization will have three parts. 
The first will be the Conference of State Parties, consisting of the
representatives of all states participating in the convention.  It
will establish general policies for implementing the convention and
oversee the functions of the organization.  The second will be the
Executive Council, the executive arm of the organization, consisting
of the representatives of 41 participating states picked to achieve
geographic balance.  The third will be the Technical Secretariat, led
by a Director General, which will be responsible for carrying out the
inspections to verify compliance. 
<P>
     The first meeting of a commission preparing the groundwork for
the chemical weapons organization took place on February 8, 1993, at
The Hague.  Since that meeting, the Preparatory Commission has focused
on building the Provisional Technical Secretariat, the forerunner of
the monitoring agency that will be created after the convention comes
into force.  Activities of the Preparatory Commission thus far have
included finding a building to house the agency, establishing
inspection procedures, drafting inspection manuals, procuring and
testing inspection equipment, and hiring and training inspectors.  The
1994 budget for the Preparatory Commission is almost $30 million, of
which the U.S.  will pay 25 percent. (Keir A.  Lieber, "Highlights of
the Fifth PrepCom Plenary," The CWC Chronicle, January 1994, p.  1.) 
Once up and running, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons will operate at a minimum cost of $500 million annually -- but
could wind up costing three to four times this amount, depending on
the number of employees it hires.
<P>
     The verification responsibilities of the Technical Secretariat
are vast.  The convention's Annex on Implementation and Verification
(Verification Annex), over 100 pages long, establishes a long list of
inspections to verify that chemical weapons and chemical weapons
production facilities are destroyed.  The Technical Secretariat also
is tasked with ensuring that commercial chemical production facilities
are not used to develop and produce weapons.  The Verification Annex
outlines a number of inspection procedures, including the timing of
inspections, the appointment of inspectors, the privileges and
immunities that governments must extend to inspectors, and the
equipment inspectors may bring with them.
<P>
     The Verification Annex establishes eight different kinds of
inspection regimes, all of which must be carried out by the Technical
Secretariat.  The first kind of inspection verifies whether chemical
weapons are destroyed.  The second is to verify the destruction or
conversion of chemical weapons production facilities.  The third,
fourth, and fifth detect whether certain types of chemicals have been
used in building chemical weapons. (Detecting the so-called diversion
of chemicals for use in weapons is complex.  First of all, chemicals
are broken into three categories called schedules.  Schedule I
chemicals are those most easily used in weapons and therefore subject
to the strictest types of inspections.  Schedule II and Schedule III
chemicals are more difficult to turn into weapons and therefore
subject to less strict inspections.)
<P>
     The sixth kind of inspection pertains to production facilities
that produce chemicals not found in any of the first three schedules. 
The seventh is the most sensitive insofar as it involves short-notice
inspections of states suspected of violating the terms of the
convention.  The final kind of inspection requires investigating sites
where chemical weapons may have been used.
<P>
     At first, the U.S.  demanded that so-called challenge inspections
be allowed anywhere and at any time a violation was suspected.  It
ultimately abandoned this approach in favor of a British proposal for
so-called managed access to suspect sites.  Under this provision, the
inspected state may take steps to guard its national security, as long
as it does not involve evading the convention's terms.  In order to
protect its security, an inspected state may remove sensitive papers,
shroud displays and equipment, log off computers, restrict the types
of analyses that may be carried out on air, soil, and effluent
samples, and even limit which inspectors may gain access to particular
areas at a suspect site.
<P>
     The inspection process is long and involved.  It starts with OPCW
officials inspecting the locations declared by a member state as
weapons sites.  The declaration must be filed with the Technical
Secretariat no later than 30 days after the convention enters into
force.  Work on destroying the chemical weapons at the sites must
begin within two years.  They must be completely destroyed within ten
years.
<P>
     Once on a weapons site, inspectors will place seals and
monitoring devices to guard against a violation.  Similar procedures,
such as placing cameras, exist for monitoring whether or not the
chemical weapons, production facilities, and non-weapons chemical
production facilities have been destroyed.  As many as 1,000
inspections a year may be required.
<P>
     The Chemical Weapons Convention also contains a provision on
compliance.  The Executive Council bears the responsibility for
demanding that a participating state redress a violation.  If
corrective action is not taken, the Conference of State Parties may
suspend the offending state's privileges under the convention.  This
could include terminating cooperative programs to assist states in
developing chemicals for peaceful purposes or denying the offender the
right to vote in the Conference of State Parties.  In more serious
cases of violation, stricter countermeasures would be taken.  For
example, trade in all chemicals with the offending state could be shut
off.  In cases where violations pose a threat to the security of other
states, the Conference of State Parties may refer the matter to the
United Nations General Assembly and the United Nations Security
Council.  Ultimately, the Security Council serves as the court of
final appeal in the enforcement process.
<P>

FIVE FLAWS IN THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION
<P>
     There are five flaws in the Chemical Weapons Convention which
must be considered as the Senate gives its advise and consent.
<P>
FLAW #1: The CWC does not enhance U.S.  national security. 
<P>
     Arms control is one of several means for achieving the goal of
national security.  It should never be thought of as an end in itself. 
Reduced arsenals are not always better.  A comprehensive security
strategy will make room for the tools of deterrence, defenses, and
even offensive military operations, as well as arms control.  In
short, any arms control agreement must serve the supreme purpose of
foreign policy, which is protecting the nation's security.
<P>
     The Chemical Weapons Convention does not meet this most basic
test.  The convention requires that the U.S.  completely abandon its
chemical deterrent, but this will not enhance U.S.  security.  Since
no country is compelled to join the convention, it will be perfectly
legal for those that do not join to retain chemical weapons.  And
since it is unrealistic to expect countries which want to retain
chemical weapons to join, the result cannot possibly be global
chemical disarmament.  It makes no sense for America to give up its
chemical weapons if other nations still possess them.
<P>
FLAW #2: The CWC will not reduce the risk of war. 
<P>
     Reducing the level of armaments is not the most important goal of
arms control.  Reducing the risk of war is far more important.  Arms
control agreements should not be destabilizing.  It is
counterproductive to achieve an arms control agreement that, by
reducing arms, only invites attack.
<P>
     Yet this is precisely what the Chemical Weapons Convention will
do.  The CWC is the product of a policy that equates reduced levels of
armaments, in this case reduced to zero, with greater security, but
the experience of World War II shows that having chemical weapons can
deter a chemical attack.  If the U.S.  bans all of its chemical
weapons, outlaw states that retain them will have a military
advantage.
<P>
     Almost as important as reducing the risk of war is the goal of
preventing the escalation of an existing conflict to a higher level of
violence, but the Chemical Weapons Convention will encourage
escalation in two ways.  First, a chemically armed enemy, knowing that
the U.S.  and its allies do not possess chemical weapons, will have
little incentive to refrain from using such weapons.  They will enjoy
a unilateral advantage over the U.S., and in time of war they are
likely to use it.  Second, the convention may increase the likelihood
that nuclear weapons will be used.  Lacking chemical weapons, the U.S. 
will be forced to rely on nuclear weapons to deter a chemical attack
on U.S.  forces.  While it is prudent to reserve the right to use
nuclear weapons, it is certainly unwise to take steps that lower the
threshold of nuclear war.
<P>
FLAW #3: The CWC ignores America's global responsibilities.
<P>
     With the Cold War over, the U.S.  is the world's sole superpower. 
Superpower status imposes important global responsibilities which the
U.S.  can fulfill only by maintaining armed forces capable of
projecting overwhelming force around the globe.  Because America has
these special responsibilities, it is treated as an exceptional case
in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.  This amounts to an
international stamp of approval for America's nuclear arsenal.
<P>
     The same principle should apply to America's chemical weapons
arsenal.  In Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and elsewhere, the U.S. 
has proved on numerous occasions that it exercises its unmatched power
in a manner that is both responsible and respectful of the legitimate
interests of other states.  But America's global responsibilities also
mean that its forces are the most likely to be engaged in major
conflicts.  The more dangers America faces, the greater the likelihood
that chemical weapons will be used against U.S.  forces.
<P>
     The Chemical Weapons Convention ignores the special
responsibilities of the U.S., treating all countries in the same
manner.  It assumes that U.S.  troops face the same likelihood of
chemical attack as the tiny constabulary force fielded by Costa Rica,
which has the same rights and obligations under the treaty.  In this
way it contrasts sharply with one of the more successful arms control
agreements of the post-World War II era, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty in which the U.S.  and four other nations (Britain, China,
France, and Russia) are treated in a manner fundamentally different
from all other nations.  The NPT accounts for the special
responsibilities and broad political roles played by these five
acknowledged nuclear weapons states in world affairs.  The Chemical
Weapons Convention should do so as well, by naming the same five
countries as weapons states.
<P>
FLAW #4: Compliance with the CWC cannot be verified. 
<P>
     The Chemical Weapons Convention is not adequately verifiable. 
Many lethal chemicals are common and have peaceful uses, and trying to
keep track of all these chemicals throughout the world is an
impossible task.  In a devastating report prepared for the Defense
Nuclear Agency in 1991, contractors stated:  "Detecting most types of
cheating [possible under the Chemical Weapons Convention] will be
highly unlikely, if not impossible." (Kathleen Bailey, et al.,
"Noncompliance Scenarios:  Means By Which Parties To The Chemical
Weapons Convention Might Cheat," August 1991.  The same report
outlines several scenarios for future cheating under the convention. 
One posits that a country possessing a commercial plant that produces
hydrogen cyanide, a lethal chemical, diverts some to underground tanks
as a strategic reserve for later weaponization.  Another scenario
posits that a country builds a clandestine facility to produce the
nerve agent tabun, stores the agent in bulk, and then destroys the
facility and decontaminates the site.)
<P>
     Unable to verify whether a hostile country is cheating, the U.S. 
would never know with certainty what kind of chemical weapons threat
it faced.  As a result, the U.S.  would run the risk of high combat
casualties as it was surprised by attacks with chemical weapons U.S. 
leaders did not even know existed.
<P>
FLAW #5:  Violations will go unpunished. 
<P>
     Verification of compliance with an arms control agreement is not
enough.  The U.S.  also must be able to do something if other
countries are caught violating the agreement.
<P>
     The Chemical Weapons Convention makes only a feeble attempt to
address the question of enforcement.  It states that unspecified
sanctions can be imposed on a state that is violating the convention
either by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons or
by the United Nations.  Ultimately, the United Nations Security
Council would have to impose penalties severe enough to change the
behavior of an outlaw state.
<P>
     The history of the Biological Weapons Convention provides an
object lesson in what can go wrong with this agreement.  Starting in
the early 1980s, the U.S.  acknowledged that it suspected the Soviet
Union of violating the BWC.  Yet the U.S.  never lodged a complaint
with the U.N.  Security Council, which is charged with resolving the
BWC's enforcement problems.  The reason for this inaction is clear: 
If the U.S.  had lodged a complaint against the Soviet Union, Moscow
simply would have vetoed any enforcement resolution brought before the
U.N.  Security Council. 
<P>
     The Chemical Weapons Convention would have the same flaws as the
Biological Weapons Convention, and international politics would make
it impossible to enforce its provisions.
<P>

TOWARD AN EFFECTIVE COUNTER-PROLIFERATION POLICY:THREE PRINCIPLES
<P>
     The U.S.  has a clear interest in stopping the proliferation of
chemical weapons around the world, but an effective counter-
proliferation policy cannot depend on arms control alone.  A truly
effective policy will balance arms control with deterrence, effective
chemical defenses, and, if necessary, military options for destroying
chemical weapons facilities.  As the Senate considers the merits of
the Chemical Weapons Convention, it should ask whether it is part of
an overall counter-proliferation policy that rests on these three
principles. 
<P>
PRINCIPLE #1:  The need to deter a chemical attack.
<P>
     Deterrence requires maintaining a credible threat to retaliate
for chemical attacks against the U.S.  or its allies.  This
retaliatory threat must be able to convince any potential aggressor
that he has nothing to gain by attacking the U.S.  with chemical
weapons.
<P>
     By requiring the destruction of chemical weapons, the Chemical
Weapons Convention would deny the U.S.  the capability to retaliate in
kind for a chemical attack.  America would be left with only two
options in case of a chemical attack:  1) to escalate the conflict by
launching large-scale counter-attacks with conventional (non-chemical
and non-nuclear) arms or 2) to retaliate with nuclear weapons.  But
the Clinton Administration has not made the adjustments necessary to
deal with these options.  Not only is it cutting the conventional
forces needed to deter chemical attacks; it also has not declared that
nuclear weapons have any role in deterring chemical weapons attacks.
<P>
PRINCIPLE #2:  The need for defenses against chemical weapons. 
<P>
     There are no guarantees, however, that deterrence will always
work.  Such dictators as Saddam Hussein and Muammar Qadhafi may not
act rationally in a crisis or exhibit restraint.  Therefore, the U.S. 
needs some insurance against chemical attack if deterrence fails; it
needs defenses against chemical weapons and their delivery systems. 
U.S.  forces need to be outfitted with garments, masks, and
decontamination kits, and the American people need to be defended as
well from aircraft and missiles which may carry chemical munitions.
<P>
     There is certainly room for improvement in chemical defenses. 
The General Accounting Office's Director of Army Issues, Richard
Davis, testified before Congress on April 16, 1991, that America's
soldiers were neither adequately trained nor equipped to conduct
operations in an environment contaminated by chemical weapons.
(Richard Davis, "Soldiers Not Adequately Trained or Equipped to
Conduct Operations on a Chemical Battlefield," testimony before the
House Armed Services Committee Subcommittee on Readiness, April 16,
1991.)  As for defenses against missiles armed with chemical weapons,
the Clinton Administration has cut funding for the nation's missile
defense program by more than 50 percent.
<P>
     Furthermore, if history is any guide, the Chemical Weapons
Convention will make it politically difficult to field better
defenses.  In 1969, President Nixon announced that the U.S.  would
foreswear the use or development of biological weapons in preparation
for the Biological Weapons Convention in 1972.  After the Nixon
decision, the U.S.  biological defense program withered.  This outcome
was not a result of a provision in the Biological Weapons Convention
outlawing defenses; it was a result of constant criticism of these
programs by arms control advocates who viewed them as contrary to the
spirit, although not the letter, of the Biological Weapons Convention.

<P>
     The unintended consequences of the Biological Weapons Convention
surfaced during the Persian Gulf War.  An interim report to Congress
on the results of the Gulf War stated that America's biological
defense capabilities were so weak that if the Iraqis had used
biological weapons, which later evidence shows they possessed, the
casualty levels would have overwhelmed the military medical care
system. (Department of Defense, Conduct of the Persian Gulf Conflict,
An Interim Report to Congress (Washington, D.C.:  Department of
Defense, 1991), p.  6-6.) 
<P>
     This same sort of vulnerability to chemical attack is likely to
be the unintended consequence of the Chemical Weapons Convention.  The
CWC does not outlaw defensive programs, yet arms control advocates are
sure to lobby against defenses, arguing that they will not be needed
because chemical weapons have been banned, at least legally.
<P>
PRINCIPLE #3: The need for offensive capabilities.
<P>
     Defensive systems are not the sole means for countering a
chemical attack.  U.S.  armed forces can preemptively destroy an
enemy's chemical weapons with air strikes and other forms of offensive
combat operations.  Targets for such strikes should include chemical
production facilities and storage depots, as well as forces armed with
chemical munitions.  Destruction of the production facilities and
storage depots would limit the enemy's supply of weapons, and
targeting enemy forces armed with chemical munitions would lessen the
chances chemical munitions will be used against U.S.  and allied
forces.
<P>
     The Clinton Administration should devise a comprehensive strategy
for destroying enemy weapons and facilities in time of war.  It can do
so by continuing and improving a Pentagon program already underway. 
The Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) has
a program called Warbreaker, the aim of which is to devise a
comprehensive system for directing Air Force, Army, and Navy attacks
against enemy chemical forces within minutes.  The Warbreaker program
also needs to include among the targets it is being designed to
destroy those that support, either directly or indirectly, chemical
attacks.
<P>
REDRAFTING THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION
<P>
     The Chemical Weapons Convention is a flawed agreement.  Likewise,
the existing U.S.  policy to counter chemical attacks also is flawed. 
Neither is the fault of the Clinton Administration.  The decisions to
conclude and sign the convention and to change U.S.  policy toward
countering chemical attacks were made by the Bush Administration.
<P>
     Nevertheless, the Clinton Administration apparently does not plan
to alter the policies begun by the Bush Administration.  As the
Clinton Administration proceeds down the same path, it will be up to
the Senate, as it considers the Chemical Weapons Convention, to adopt
a different approach.  It can do so through the advice and consent
process established by the United States Constitution for approving
the ratification of treaties.  As it does so, it should consider that:
<P>
A chemical weapons treaty should be modeled on the Nuclear Non-
    Proliferation Treaty. 
<P>
      Two treaties serve as models for agreements on weapons of mass
destruction throughout the world:  the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty of 1968 and the Biological Weapons Convention of 1972. 
<P>
     The Biological Weapons Convention is a discredited treaty.  It
seeks to ban biological weapons in their entirety by requiring all
participating states, including the U.S., not to develop and deploy
biological weapons.  But it is now known that the BWC has been
violated by the Soviet Union since its inception.  Further, a report
issued by the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in January 1993
states that China, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Libya, and Taiwan either
definitely have or may have violated the terms of the convention.
(Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, "Adherence To and Compliance
With Arms Control Agreements and the President's Report to Congress on
Soviet Noncompliance With Arms Control Agreements," January 14, 1993,
pp.  14-15.)  In most of the listed cases, it is impossible to
determine with absolute precision because compliance with the
convention cannot be verified.  However, while other countries
retained biological weapons, the U.S.  completely destroyed its
biological deterrent. 
<P>
     The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, by contrast, has been
relatively successful.  While it has not prevented the spread of
nuclear weapons, it has limited proliferation significantly.  Today
only a handful of countries outside the five declared nuclear states
have nuclear weapons.  More important, the Non-Proliferation Treaty
did not require the elimination of the U.S.  nuclear deterrent. 
<P>
     The Clinton Administration could have resolved many of the
problems with the Chemical Weapons Convention by referring the treaty
to the United Nations Conference on Disarmament to be redrafted.  The
Administration, unfortunately, chose not to take this step.  The
Senate has the option of concluding that the treaty is flawed.  If
this conclusion were reached, the Senate could request that the
Clinton Administration renegotiate the terms of the CWC. 
<P>
     If the Clinton Administration resists, there is a second
alternative available to the Senate.  The advice and consent process
used by the Senate to grant permission to ratify a treaty is not
limited to approving or disapproving ratification.  The Senate can
amend the text of a treaty.  Through this amendment process, the
Senate can redraft the Chemical Weapons Convention itself so that it
resembles the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.  Doing so will require
amending the convention in several articles.  After adopting these
amendments, the Senate then could approve its ratification.  The
practical effect would be that the Clinton Administration would have
to ask other treaty signatories to accept the changes made by the
Senate.  Thus, the net effect would be a demand to renegotiate the
treaty.
<P>
A new policy is needed for deterring chemical weapons strikes. 
<P>
     Changing the Chemical Weapons Convention itself, however, will
not address the threat to U.S.  security posed by chemical weapons. 
This would require changing the overall chemical weapons policy
adopted by the Bush Administration.  The policy established by
President Bush on May 13, 1991, committed the U.S.  to the
unconditional elimination of its chemical arsenal.  This policy should
be dropped, and the U.S.  should announce that it will reserve the
right to retaliate with nuclear weapons if it or its allies are
attacked with chemical weapons.  Such a response should be considered
only in the most extreme circumstance when it clearly would save the
lives of many U.S.  and allied troops and civilians. 
<P>
     While it would be preferable that the Clinton Administration make
these changes in U.S.  chemical deterrence policy, the Senate also can
take actions that could result in the same changes.  First, the
Chemical Weapons Convention would have to be amended to permit a U.S. 
chemical deterrent.  Second, the Senate could adopt a reservation -- a
means by which the Senate can qualify its approval of ratification --
that declares that the U.S.  reserves the option of retaliating
against a chemical attack with nuclear weapons. (Adopting such a
reservation would require that the Senate strike Article XXII of the
treaty.  Article XXII prohibits reservations of this sort.  Striking
Article XXII, however, may be something the Senate has an interest in
doing whether or not it adopts the reservation concerning nuclear
retaliation.  The tool most frequently used by the Senate in its
advice and consent process is adopting reservations, and Article XXII
represents a direct assault on the prerogatives of the Senate.)
<P>
U.S.  defenses against chemical weapons need to be improved. 
<P>
     Pursuing an effective defense program is not prohibited by the
Chemical Weapons Convention, even as currently drafted.  In fact, the
convention explicitly allows for the continuation of defensive
programs.  The danger is that the implementation process will be
hijacked by arms control advocates who oppose such programs and who
will undermine them with calls for budget cuts.
<P>
     The Clinton Administration can counter these pressures on U.S. 
chemical defense programs in three ways.  First, it can request
adequate funding levels for chemical defense programs.  At a minimum,
the Administration should pledge to hold chemical defense funding
levels in real terms at the fiscal 1993 level of $600 million in each
of the next five years.  This will send a message that adoption of the
Chemical Weapons Convention, in whatever form, does not mean weakening
this country's commitment to fielding defensive systems.  The money
could be used to develop such defensive equipment as improved gas
masks, protective garments, and chemical detectors. 
<P>
     Second, the Administration should move to improve training for
U.S.  soldiers, so they are better prepared to conduct operations in a
contaminated environment.  This requires that military officers follow
the recommendations made by Richard Davis of the General Accounting
Office in testimony before Congress. (Davis, op.  cit.)  These include
meeting minimum chemical training standards set forth in service
regulations and properly integrating chemical defense training into
the overall training program for U.S.  troops. 
<P>
     Third, the Administration should pledge to improve U.S.  defenses
against delivery vehicles used to launch chemical attacks.  In most
cases, these delivery vehicles are aircraft and missiles.  Living up
to this pledge will require moving toward deployment of the Corps
Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) air defense system and the F-22 fighter
and fielding effective defenses against short-range missiles by 1996
and long-range missiles by 2002.  The Senate could force these
outcomes by adopting reservations requiring the Administration to meet
these goals as the price for ratifying the convention.
<P>
The U.S.  capability to destroy chemical weapons production and
    storage facilities, as well as deployed forces with chemical
    weapons, should be improved. 
<P>
     Defensive systems cannot meet all the requirements for defending
U.S.  and allied forces and civilians against chemical attack.  These
can be met only by maintaining offensive capabilities for striking at
enemy positions.  For example, countering enemy artillery firing
chemical munitions requires an offensive response with opposing
artillery or air strikes, as does interrupting enemy command and
control networks and destroying chemical production and supply
facilities.
<P>
     The U.S.  proved during the Persian Gulf War that it has an
effective deep strike capability.  Many command and control centers,
for example, were destroyed by U.S.  air power in and around Baghdad. 
But this is not to say that improvements cannot be made.  For example,
the U.S.  had trouble countering Iraqi mobile Scud missiles with air
power.  To deal with this problem, the Pentagon launched the
Warbreaker program, which is focused on enhancing the U.S.  ability to
strike quickly and accurately at enemy forces and facilities.  While
recognizing that this program's applications go far beyond countering
chemical attacks, the Clinton Administration should announce that it
backs Warbreaker in part as a way to strike preemptively at weapons
capable of delivering chemical munitions.  The Senate again has the
option of adopting a reservation during its advice and consent process
that will force the Administration to continue the Warbreaker program
and gear it to meeting the chemical weapons threat.
<P>
The Chemical Weapons Convention's arms control enforcement mechanisms
     need to be strengthened. 
<P>
     There are three problems with U.S.  policy for enforcing
compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention.  First, the Chemical
Weapons Convention has a built in conflict of interest in terms of
enforcement.  By establishing the U.N.  Security Council as the court
of last appeal in its enforcement process, the convention will allow
the U.N.  Security Council's five permanent members to veto any
pending resolution ordering sanctions against it for an alleged
violation.  Any attempt to impose sanctions -- on China, for example
-- for violating the convention are doomed to failure at the outset. 
<P>
     This problem can be resolved through a proposal to redraft the
Chemical Weapons Convention along the lines of the Nuclear Non-
Proliferation Treaty.  Since the redrafted convention would establish
declared chemical weapons states, it would be logical that these
states be the five permanent members of the U.N.  Security Council,
thereby eliminating the conflict of interest. 
<P>
     The second enforcement problem is that the U.S.  historically has
been reluctant to take action to remedy a violation by an arms control
treaty partner.  Despite clear evidence of Soviet violations of the
Biological Weapons Convention and the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty, the U.S.  did not in either case take the proportionate steps
allowed to it under international law.  Thus, the violations
effectively went unpunished. 
<P>
     Solving this problem will require a change in the government
process for handling these issues.  Currently, the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency reports annually on arms control treaty violations,
but there is no requirement for follow-up.  Ultimately, the law could
be changed to require that the President propose a proportionate
response to a reported treaty violation no later than 60 days after
the report is issued.  This would guarantee a substantive response
once a violation is discovered. 
<P>
     The third problem is addressing the actions of states that refuse
to ratify or accede to the Chemical Weapons Convention.  This can be
dealt with only by retaining a strong military posture that can deter
and, if necessary, retaliate against a chemical attack.
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
     Meeting the chemical weapons threat requires redrafting the
Chemical Weapons Convention to declare that a few countries, including
the U.S., are weapons states.  It also requires a policy under which
the U.S.  reserves the right and capability to respond to chemical
attack either in kind or with nuclear weapons.
<P>
     Perhaps the best example of a successful deterrence policy in
history came during World War II.  Despite the existence of chemical
arsenals, chemical weapons were not used during that conflict.  The
reason:  the Allied powers, including the United States, convinced the
Axis that the use of such weapons would result in swift retaliation.
<P>
     The U.S.  is now throwing away this successful policy.  By
adopting the Chemical Weapons Convention, the U.S.  would eliminate
its chemical arsenals, even though it could never be sure that
potential enemies have done so.  U.S.  national security interests
demand that this process be reversed.  The U.S.  must not abandon its
ability to defend itself against chemical attack -- and to deter such
attacks in the first place.

<center><H3><I>CLINTON BLOWS SMOKE OVER FOREIGN AID CUTS</H3></I>
By Thomas P. Sheehy<br>
Jay Kingham Fellow in International Regulatory Affairs<br>
Executive Memorandum No. 416<br>
June 7, 1995<br>
</center><hr size =3 width = 30%>
<P>
	The U.S. Agency for International Development (AID) and its allies are pulling out all the stops in their fight against congressional foreign aid cuts and the reorganization of the foreign policy bureaucracy. AID Administrator Brian Atwood and other Clinton Administration officials have resorted to tagging as "isolationists" those critical of the status quo, including supporters of the American Overseas Interests Act (H.R. 1561). Yet the U.S. foreign aid program, particularly development aid, is riddled with wasteful projects that benefit only the AID bureaucracy and outside contractors. Administration officials have never explained how failed development aid programs demonstrate foreign policy credibility.
<P>
	Cutting Time. Congress is sure to reject the Administration's request for increased foreign aid spending for 1996. Instead, it will reduce foreign aid from its 1995 level of $13.7 billion. President Clinton, vowing to reject such cuts, threatens to veto H.R. 1561, which trims $2.8 billion from the Administration's proposed $21.6 billion overall foreign affairs budget. H.R. 1561 reduces development aid by some $800 million and abolishes AID, moving its functions into the State Department. 
<p>
	The Administration's response is an orchestrated campaign to "tar" those seeking to cut and revamp foreign aid as isolationists. National Security Adviser Anthony Lake calls supporters of the House bill "back door isolationists," his epithet for critics of the Administration's foreign aid policies. Atwood, whose AID faces long-overdue extinction, says that would-be foreign aid cutters are "playing with fire."
<p>
	Notwithstanding Atwood's alarmist rhetoric, AID has been known for years for its inefficiency and wasteful spending. Indeed, previous administrations, repeatedly but unsuccessfully, have tried to reform AID. Atwood himself once recognized the problem. Upon taking office, he described AID as a "disaster" and quickly volunteered it for "reinvention" under Vice President Al Gore's National Performance Review. Administrator Atwood has made much of his reforms in trying to fend off legislative efforts to abolish AID.
<p>
	Reform efforts have been hamstrung, however. The Vice President's review recognized that AID's reinvention could not succeed if new foreign aid authorization legislation was not secured. The Administration's foreign aid "reinvention legislation" failed in the last Congress. AID's legislative agenda today is different. In the Agency's own words, its bureaucrats seek to "delay, postpone, obfuscate, derail" congressional reform efforts.
<p>
	Delaying reform will result only in a continuation of AID's notorious waste and inefficiency. AID employs over 9,200 full-time employees and contractors at a cost of more than $600 million annually and has 998 foreign service officers stationed overseas at a cost of between $150,000 and $300,000 per employee -- not including salary. By contrast, the German and British development agencies have 27 and 47 overseas staff, respectively. Former Secretary of State James Baker was right when he said that "AID's only useful purpose is to serve as a standard for inefficiency for other agencies to avoid."  But the agency's heaviest burden is defending its work. 
<P>
	AID Pork. There is no evidence that foreign aid is instrumental in promoting economic growth. More often, it is destructive. Sometimes it is simply wasted. Consider the following: 
<P>
<ul><li>A U.S. group called Development Associates, Inc., performed an AID contract to study the Agency's own evaluation studies -- i.e., a study to study AID's studies.
<P>
<li>A U.S. company called Planning & Development Collaborative International contracted with AID to sponsor a 1993 study tour in the U.S. for the Romanian Union of Architects. AID never explained how acquainting Romanians with American architecture helps Romania develop a free-market economy. 
<P>
<li>Four organizations collaborated to perform an AID contract worth over $2 million which culminated in a study of "ecotourism" in Central America that includes a section on "the cultural and socioeconomic impacts of tourism" and a list that ranks "the desirability of native fauna for the tourist industry by marketing value and observation satisfaction."  American tourists are better equipped than AID-contracted experts to determine their level of "observation satisfaction" when touring Central America.
<P>
<li>The Academy for Educational Development of Washington, D.C., in 1993 undertook a study for AID of how Indonesian health workers can improve their interpersonal communication skills. One recommendation of this study: to conduct further study. 
<P>
<LI>Chemonics International of Washington, D.C., has a multiyear contract with AID worth nearly $2 million to spearhead a project "that promotes [throughout the world] public awareness and support for environmental policies and practices by changing individual behavior, institutional activities, and governmental approaches."  AID never explains why it is worth $2 million to the American taxpayer to conduct an environmentalist public relations campaign in the Third World.
<P>
<li>AID is planning to award a $1.3 million contract to supply street lamps to the city of Moscow at the same time the Russian government is spending more than $1 billion to make war on the people of Chechnya.
<P></ul>
	AID has spent hundreds of billions of dollars on junkets for university professors, studies that gather dust, and other efforts that are irrelevant to promoting economic growth. At best, development aid can make a marginal contribution to encouraging the free-market transitions responsible for economic growth. The programs listed above do not pass even this low standard of success.
<P>
	Spreading the Pork. Aware of its weak hand, AID has been playing the pork game. In fighting for survival, it has made a virtue of the fact that it spends the taxpayers' dollars at home. Atwood recently noted, "Now, fully 79 percent of the USAID procurement budget, spent to purchase goods and services essential to USAID development work, is spent here in the U.S."  AID has been rallying its American beneficiaries to lobby against foreign aid cuts.
<P>
	Many of AID's American contractors are only marginally "private," being heavily dependent upon AID for support. In essence, they are quasi-government agencies. Some are havens for former AID employees adept at pulling the procurement strings. And like AID, many contractors suffer from large overhead. For example, the U.S. Ambassador to Chad noted in an April report to the Secretary of State that U.S. development aid to that African country "was spent mainly on overhead, expensive contractors and consultants, and had little impact except to develop the culture of dependency which is part of the problem."  Congress should resist the temptation to look at development aid as serving a domestic constituency.
<P>
	The real isolationists are not those looking to eliminate wasteful foreign aid projects. The real neglect of America's international interests comes from those who engineer reckless defense cuts and trade wars with allies like Japan. These are the great issues of the day upon which isolationist reputations will be made -- not whether Washington spends a couple of billion dollars less on wasteful development aid and abolishes a hopelessly inefficient AID bureaucracy. When it comes to foreign aid, it is the Clinton Administration that not only is "playing with fire" but blowing smoke.

<TITLE>Abolish The Wasteful Agency For International Development  -- Heritage </TITLE>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">

<CENTER><H3><I>ABOLISH THE WASTEFUL AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT </I></H3>
<P>

<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum #402<br>
January 27, 1995<P>
</CENTER><HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>
 
It is time to abolish the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID), the 
executive branch agency that administers most American foreign aid 
programs. AID has failed in its mission to promote economic development 
overseas. Despite billions of dollars spent on economic assistance, most of the
countries receiving U.S. development aid remained mired in poverty, 
repression, and dependence. In addition, AID lacks focus and, 
notwithstanding repeated attempts at reform, is poorly managed. Only a 
complete overhaul of America's foreign aid programs will make those 
programs more efficient and effective. 
<P>
To its credit, the Clinton Administration realizes that there is a serious 
problem with AID. Vice President Al Gore's September 1993 report, Creating 
a Government That Works Better and Costs Less, concludes that "AID does 
not have a single, clearly defined and articulated strategic mission." This 
conclusion has been reached by scores of commissions and independent 
studies. After two years and several reform attempts by Administrator J. Brian 
Atwood, including his Peace, Prosperity and Democracy Act of 1994, which 
failed to pass Congress, AID continues to be notable for its fuzzy mission, 
poor management, waste, and fraud. 
<P>
AID's failures cannot be papered over by folding it into the State Department, 
as some in the Clinton Administration were advocating this week. Abolishing 
AID by moving its functions to another bureaucracy offers little chance of 
significant reform in the way the U.S. designs, distributes, and spends nearly 
$14 billion in foreign aid dollars each year. U.S. policymakers should abolish 
the agency altogether, along with most of its functions. 
<P>
The best way to determine which AID functions should be saved and which 
should be abolished is to examine critically the purposes and effectiveness of 
U.S. foreign aid programs rather than the programmatic effectiveness or even 
managerial efficiency of any given bureau. These programs should be cut or 
eliminated based on their own merits. If, after this analysis, a program is 
retained, it should be administered by an existing office within an existing 
agency. Under no circumstances should a new bureaucracy be created inside 
the State Department or any other agency to accommodate programs spun off 
from an abolished AID. 
<P>
Once AID is eliminated, some foreign aid programs will still exist. Military 
and security assistance programs, for example, are administered primarily by 
the Department of Defense and should be retained for national security 
reasons. So, too, should military and security aid to Israel and Egypt. 
Although economic support funds for these two countries do nothing to 
promote economic development -- in fact, they may actually harm their 
economies -- an argument can be made that they should be continued in order 
to demonstrate political support for the Middle East peace process. If 
Congress deems Israeli and Egyptian aid necessary for national security 
reasons, lawmakers should rename it "Security Supporting Assistance," which 
is what it was called before 1978 when it was renamed Economic Support 
Funds (ESF). Once AID is abolished, these programs could be administered 
by such offices as the Under Secretary for Arms Control and International 
Security Affairs and the Bureau of Political and Military Affairs. 
<P>
There are, however, two broad areas of foreign assistance that should be cut 
back drastically or eliminated entirely, as should the AID bureaucracies which 
have administered them. These programs are: 
<P>
Economic Development Assistance. According to AID, Development 
Assistance funds are intended to promote economic growth in less developed 
countries. AID spent nearly $2.1 billion on development assistance projects in 
FY 1994. Since 1946, the U.S. has given nearly $265 billion in development 
assistance to foreign countries. Yet there is scant evidence that this aid has 
propelled many countries into the developed world. The late AID 
Administrator Alan Woods was right when he argued in his 1989 study, 
Development in the National Interest, that "Where development has worked, 
and is working, the key has been economic growth. And this is largely the 
result of individual nations making the right policy choices and making the 
most of their internal human and material resources." 
<P>
The keys to economic development are free markets and free trade. Whether 
aid promotes or fails to promote them should be the fundamental criterion for 
economic assistance. The Index of Economic Freedom published by The 
Heritage Foundation provides such a criterion. The Index uses ten economic 
factors to grade the level of economic freedom in a given country. Countries 
with high levels of freedom have established the necessary economic system 
for achieving sustainable levels of economic growth. Countries with low 
levels of economic freedom still have systems in which government impedes 
economic growth. Sending development assistance to these countries would 
be a waste. The U.S. should adopt the Index as a tool to determine which 
countries are most likely to benefit from foreign aid and which ones are most 
likely to waste it. 
<P>
Once this is done, much U.S. economic assistance would be cut. It would be 
impossible to justify maintaining all of the nearly $4 billion a year in U.S. 
economic aid if the criteria in the Index were applied. As much as $2 billion a
year could be trimmed from AID's budget alone. As these funds were 
eliminated, so, too, could the supporting AID and related overseas offices be 
abolished. This would lead to a substantial reduction in bureaucracy which 
need not be moved to the State Department or any other governmental 
agency. 
<P>
P.L. 480 Food Aid. Given the major agricultural reform bill coming before 
Congress this session, as well as requirements that the U.S. reduce agricultura
subsidies as part of recent free trade agreements, Congress should eliminate 
one of America's largest agricultural subsidy programs: the so-called P.L. 480 
programs aimed at providing food to impoverished countries. All too often, 
by depressing prices, this aid ruins the local food market of the very people i
is intended to help. While some of its functions may be maintained under an 
"emergency food relief program" administered by the State Department or 
other departments, most of the $1 billion spent annually on emergency aid 
and agricultural development could be eliminated. So, too, should the AID 
supporting bureaucracy. 
<P>
AID has failed in its mission to promote economic growth in less developed 
countries. There is little correlation between foreign aid spending and 
economic growth. Rather, the evidence shows that those countries which have 
graduated from the depths of poverty and into the developed world did so by 
creating the economic freedom that is necessary for expanding economies. 
<P>
When he introduced AID in the early 1960s, President John Kennedy said it 
should be seen as a temporary transitional agency. AID never was intended to 
make the developing world dependent on international welfare. It is time for 
Congress to abolish AID and transfer whatever useful functions remain to the 
State Department.

<title>Oppose The UN Convention on Discrimination Against Women -- Duplantier</title></head>

<hr>
<h2>Oppose The UN Convention on Discrimination Against Women</h2></center>
<P>

 
The United Nations Convention on Discrimination Against Women  
would upset the constitutional balance of power between our federal and  
state governments, undermine many of the rights possessed by American  
women, and subject our society to regulation by a committee of  
international inquisitors. 
                            <P>
The very first article of the UN Treaty on Women should have aroused  
the suspicions of every U.S. Senator. How could anyone sworn to uphold  
the U.S. Constitution fail to recognize the impropriety of ratifying a  
treaty that candidly promises to control "private organizations and even  
interpersonal relationships," and to reach into areas that are not regulated  
by the federal government? Neither magnifying glass nor fine-tooth comb  
was needed to examine this treaty; the threats it poses to our nation's  
sovereignty and the rights of American citizens are writ large! 
                       <P>
Article 2. for example, would invalidate laws that register males only for  
military service and assign males only to combat duty. Does any Senator  
believe that the majority of the American people favor the drafting of  
women and their assignment to the combat infantry? Article 2 would also  
require Congress to pass "appropriate corrective legislation" to regulate  
"membership in private clubs or organizations." Would this mean the  
sexual integration of women's colleges, of professional sports  
organizations, of Scout troops, of convents and monasteries? You bet it  
would! 
                               <P>
That's not the half of it. Make no mistake about it: what we're talking  
about here is the other half In the interest of eliminating alleged  
discrimination against the half of the population that is female,  
everything must be cut in half. Article 4 authorizes strict sexual quotas in  
employment, stipulating that special measures "aimed at accelerating de  
facto equality between men and women shall not be considered  
discrimination." Article 10 would require the "elimination of any  
stereotyped concept of the roles of men and women at all levels and in all  
forms of education, " and that means both public and private schools. 
                                       <P>
Article 11 would require Congress to legislate Comparable Worth, the  
feminist notion that government functionaries should establish wage  
scales based on their own subjective notions of "value." Never mind the  
influence of such market variables as the availability of labor, the demand  
for a given product or service, and the cost of living in a given area.  
Never mind that all the countries that rely on government-set wages have  
lower wages, and lower standards of living, than we Americans do.  
Article 11 would also require "the establishment and development of a  
network of child-care facilities," so that all women would be free to cast  
off the joys of motherhood and revel in the drudgery of wage labor.  
Article 16 would keep down the demand for such child care facilities by  
providing for abortion on demand. To make sure that all the preceding  
articles are adhered to, Article 17 would bring us under the supervision of  
a committee of 23 so-called experts elected from countries dominated by  
repressive regimes.

Duplantier</a> <br>November 16, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Anti-Poverty Program Supports Leftist Causes</h2></center><P>




[Every year on the weekend before Thanksgiving, American Catholics 
are asked to contribute to their Church's Campaign for Human 
Development (known as CHD). More and more Catholics are declining 
to do so, however, as they learn about the Campaign's strange support for 
radical, left-wing organizations.]
<p>
The Capital Research Center in Washington DC reports that the 
Campaign for Human Development. the antipoverty program of the 
American Catholic bishops. is not at all what the faithful have been led 
to believe it is. If American Catholics had had any idea where the money 
really goes, they would not have dumped more than $230 million into 
the CHD collection baskets over the past 25 years. "What they are not 
told. and what the bureaucrats at CHD do not want them to know." the 
Capital Research Center charges. "is that most of CHD's money goes to 
support liberal activists who use it teach people how to organize and 
agitate for more government spending programs."
<p>
Adding insult to injury. "CHD-funded activists are often openly 
disdainful of the teachings of the Catholic Church. Whose offerings they 
gladly accept." CHD's 25th anniversary conference, held three months 
ago in Chicago. provided a good example of the persons and policies 
unwittinglv promoted by pious parishioners. Conference participants 
were treated to speeches By "a Marxist college professor. pro-abortion 
and pro-gay rights activists. and a strident opponent of school choice."
<p>
The Campaign for Human Development "operates on the same 
assumptions as Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty," providing no 
incentives for "individual striving and responsibility." According to the 
Capital Research Center. "Rather than offer the poor the example of 
success, and guidance in achieving it. CHD explains why poverty is the 
system's fault and teaches how to radicalize institutions." Despite its 
claims of nonpartisanship, "almost all of its activities fall on the left -- 
often the far-left -- side of the ideological spectrum. CHD-funded groups 
invariably favor public policies that require state intervention and 
decision-making. And these build support for their positions by resorting 
to the rhetoric of class consciousness and the tactics of social conflict."
<p>
The Capital Research Center contends that "CHD has established a long 
track record of funding groups whose activities many Catholics would 
find repugnant." It also has a history of responding to the problems of 
society with solutions that "preclude genuine Christian social action. By 
concentrating on tried-and-failed methods of victimization and blame, 
CHD undermines the individual's capacity for spiritual, moral, and social 
renewal."
<p>
The Capital Research Center implores the American bishops "to initiate 
a desperately-needed overhaul of the Campaign for Human 
Development," urging them to "exercise active oversight, not rubber-
stamp decisions by CHD professional staff." If nothing else, the bishops 
should be "honest with parishioners about the aims and activities of 
CHD." In the meantime, if American Catholics want to know what 
they're contributing to, they'll have to conduct their own investigations.

May 27, 1996<br><p></i>
<h2>The Working Rich</h2>


<i><blockquote>


There are many kinds of bigotry in the world, but most of them, in 
America at least, are recognized as morally repugnant. There is one kind 
of bigotry, however, that seems to be socially acceptable -- the irrational 
prejudice against people who are wealthy.
</blockquote></i>

The vast majority of rich people in America acquired their wealth the 
old-fashioned way: they earned it. Industriousness, determination, 
shrewdness, and daring -- these are the qualities they cultivated to 
achieve self-sufficiency and, ultimately, abundance. The relatively few 
Americans fortunate enough to inherit great wealth have had to display 
these same qualities in order to maintain their positions. Nevertheless, it 
is quite common -- among people who are lazy, aimless, dull, and timid -
- to bemoan their unfortunate lot in life and rail against the undeserved 
luck of those who happen to be rich.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Economist and syndicated columnist Thomas Sowell has had enough of 
this nonsense. "Far from being the idle rich, those in the top fifth of 
income-earners work more than most people and far more than those in 
the bottom fifth," says Sowell. "They work more time and they have 
more people in the same family working. When people are putting in 
long hours of work often after having put in long years of schooling, 
followed by long years of building up the skills and experience that put 
them where they are today, we are not talking about lottery winners or 
people who got lucky some other way. We are talking about 
achievement. And we are talking about the kind of work that other 
Americans benefit from."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Sowell cites Bill Gates as one man whose wealth is richly deserved. With 
his innovative computer software products, the Microsoft 
multimillionaire has provided enormous benefits, directly or indirectly, 
to every single American. "The economy is not a zero-sum game, where 
every gain is somebody else's loss," says Sowell. "We are all better off 
because of those [supposedly] 'fortunate' people who work long hours at 
difficult tasks that not everyone is capable of doing."

The generation of wealth generally requires long, hard work. For this 
reason, improved economic standing is usually associated with 
advancing age. The rich and the poor "are often the same people at 
different stages of their careers," says Thomas Sowell. "People in their 
60s have earned far more than people in their 20s, even though everyone 
in his 60s was once 20. This is not an injustice by 'society.' It is a 
reflection of the mundane fact that there is a huge difference in 
competence and efficiency before and after spending years doing what 
you do." Precious few people start out rich, and the vast majority of 
Americans who begin their careers in the bottom fifth in income "are out 
of there before a decade has passed. For one thing," says Sowell, "they 
have 10 years more experience at the end of a decade."

 <i> September 13, 1996 </i><p> 
 
<h2> Recycling </h2><p>



<i>There are more than 7000 curbside recycling programs in the United States, with more than 100 million Americans participating. Two questions need to be asked, however: Do these programs work? Are they cost-effective?</i><p>

"Americans seem to be having a love affair with recycling," observes writer Harvey Black in a recent issue of Environmental Health Perspectives. "No longer do people simply look for a refuse container to toss away a used soda can or plastic bottle. They search for the right recycling receptacle. All over the United States, when it's time to take out the garbage, millions of people take out carefully sorted bundles of newspapers and cardboard, bags of aluminum and steel cans, and plastic containers -- all destined for recycling."<p>

The question is, does all this extra effort make any sense? In his article, entitled "Rethinking Recycling," which was reprinted by the Heartland Institute as an antidote to Earth Day propaganda, Black reports that "a number of economists and policy analysts have questioned whether the benefits of recycling outweigh the ease of disposing of waste materials in landfills. Critics say that what seems at first to make a great deal of sense doesn't always stand up to a close examination. For instance, some critics argue that collection costs make recycling a bad bargain for many localities because the costs often exceed the prices that the recyclables bring on the open market. They also charge that operating additional trucks to pick up recyclables increases toxic diesel emissions, offsetting any environmental gains."<p>

Black notes that "forms of recycling have been in use in the United States for almost 100 years At the turn of the century," he observes, "waste paper and rags were used to make new paper when wood pulp was scarce or too expensive. Recycling scrap metal and other materials was an American institution during World War II. And deposits on glass soda bottles in the 1950s and 1960s encouraged people to recycle and reuse them."<p>

These traditional forms of recycling all made economic sense at the time. "When the modern version of recycling began," says Black, "its economics were disastrous in some cases." He explains that "the economics of recycling is a mosaic of issues including collection costs, market demand, landfill costs, and recycling infrastructure and technology. Determining whether recycling makes economic sense involves analyzing these components to see how they fit into the total picture."<p>

Such considerations "may seem complex," concedes Harvey Black, "but they are at least somewhat quantifiable. The health and environmental benefits of recycling -- including energy conservation, toxic emissions reductions, and preservation of resources -- are far more difficult to quantify. Health and environmental benefits are somewhat indirect and are valued differently from individual to individual. Still, advocates of recycling argue that the more intangible benefits offer the most compelling case for recycling." Could it be that they simply don't understand economics, or do they just prefer not to have their efforts measured by an objective standard?<p>

Duplantier</a> <br>January 12, 1996
<br></i><hr><h2>Judicial Usurpation</h2></center><P> 
 
[By extending rights to illegal aliens, federal judges undermine the value 
of American citizenship and de-legitimize self-government.]
<P>
Washington Times columnist Paul Craig Roberts warns that self-
government may be "a thing of the past" in America. He cites a federal 
judge's recent order blocking implementation of California's Proposition 
187, which received 59 percent of the votes cast in a statewide election in 
1994. "The judge," says Roberts, "ruled that the right of illegal aliens to 
publicly-provided benefits, such as education and welfare, exceeded the 
right of citizens to utilize the democratic process to limit or curtail their 
financial obligations to people illegally residing in our country."
<P>
The judge's ruling is just the most recent example of judicial usurpation 
in what has become "a frontal assault on citizenship and the exercise of 
self-rule," says Roberts. "It demeans citizenship by eliminating any 
difference between the claims of citizens and illegal aliens to taxpayer-
provided benefits. And it destroys self-rule by denying citizens the right 
to limit their taxpaying responsibilities through the exercise of the 
democratic process."
<P>
Judges have been undermining citizenship and self-rule for decades. 
Roberts cites a 1982 Supreme Court decision in which five of the nine 
justices "decided that the State of Texas could not restrict the use of its 
limited resources to educate only lawful residents. The court's cavalier 
disregard of the rights of U.S. citizens was not based on any law or legal 
precedent," says Roberts. "It rested entirely on the subjective feelings of 
five justices that it was good social policy for taxpayers to be made to 
finance public education for illegal aliens."
<P>
Roberts notes that Chief Justice Warren Burger and the three other 
dissenting justices "criticized their brethren for violating the separation of 
powers by assuming a policymaking role. The Constitution, they said, 
does not vest the court with 'the authority to strike down laws because 
they do not meet our standards of desirable social policy."' That's exactly 
what the High Court did and got away with, however, thereby 
demonstrating "how readily blackrobed social engineers substitute their 
own policy predilections for the will of the people."
<P>
Judicial decisions "based on feelings and not law" are unworthy of our 
respect, says Roberts. "If Americans are to be ruled by sociology, we 
have no need of law schools. There is nothing in a legal background to 
give jurists guidance on the 'correct' social policy," and every judge who 
oversteps himself in this manner should be swiftly censured. "The 
elevation of social engineering above law and self-rule has dire 
implications," says Roberts, noting that it may now be plausible for 
illegal aliens to resist deportation by claiming the rights of citizenship. 
This much is clear: no republic can survive without respect for the rule of 
law. When the personal agendas of powerful men replace objective 
standards, when emotion usurps reason, our God-given rights cease to be 
secure and we can no longer rely on the truth and the law to defend 
ourselves from injustice.
<p>                           <P>

<h2>
Broadcasting for Freedom
</h2>



<P>  <blockquote><i>

 
The Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, and Radio Liberty were  
instrumental in the collapse of Communism in Europe. So, why aren't we  
broadcasting the blessings of  liberty to the Communist countries of East  
Asia? 
 

</i></blockquote><P>


Lech Walensa and other veterans of the fight against Communist  
oppression in Eastern Europe have testified to the tremendous contribution  
that Radio Free Europe made to their struggle. Radio Free Europe's impact  
on the rise of the Solidarity union in Poland "cannot even be described,"  
said Walensa in a 1989 interview. "Would there be earth without the sun?"  
he asked rhetorically. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 
"Broadcasting can be one of the most effective and economical components  
of America's diplomatic and military efforts," says James Tyson, president  
of the Council for the Defense of Freedom. The $350 million currently  
allotted for the U.S. government's foreign broadcasting effort is a small  
fraction of the $250 billion annual defense budget. Ironically, the Voice of  
America, Radio Free Europe, and Radio Liberty were so effective in  
bringing the message of freedom to the captive nations of the world that  
many of our elected of officials have concluded that they are no longer  
necessary. "Following the collapse of communism in Europe, Radio Free  
Europe and Radio Liberty have been drastically downsized," says Tyson.  
The rush to cut back on such effective programs may prove to have been  
premature, especially if the resurgence of hardliners in Russia continues  
unchecked. "It is unfortunate," he says, "that Radio Liberty is becoming  
ineffective" just as Russia may be slipping back into dictatorship. 
 


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;



Even if the situation in Russia does stabilize, there will still be 1.4 billion  
people suffering under brutal Communist governments in China, North  
Korea, Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. Tyson argues that our broadcasting  
efforts should be focused on the Far East. "China is the largest and most  
dangerous nation in the world today," he observes. "More than a million  
people are confined in its slave labor camps. With its massive increase in  
arms -- including long-range missiles and atomic, chemical, and biological  
weapons -- the regime represents a threat to all its neighbors." Tyson says  
recent emigres report a growing hunger among the common people in  
China for accurate news about what is really going on in their own  
country. 


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;



 
A proposal to establish a Radio Free Asia broadcasting service was under  
consideration for several years, says Tyson, who served in 1992 on the  
Presidential Commission on Broadcasting to Asia. But it wasn't until 1995  
that Congress finally appropriated $10 million in start-up funds. Tyson  
contends that Radio Free Asia is "one of the most cost-effective policies we  
could follow," and estimates that an annual budget of $30 million would be  
sufficient to sustain the service. This would be money well spent. "If Radio  
Free Asia could accelerate the democratization of China as Radio Free  
Europe and Radio Liberty did in the Soviet bloc," says Tyson, "it would  
result in huge savings in our defense budget."

<html><HEAD><TITLE>Duplantier:  SOCIALISM'S CONTINUING APPEAL
</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><center><h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES </h4><i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/duplbio.html">F.R. Duplantier</a> <br>December 6, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Socialism's Continuing Appeal</h2></center><P>
[Socialism makes no economic or intellectual sense. How, then, do we 
explain its continuing appeal?] 
 <p>
"Thanks to its promise of regeneration, thanks to the hope it flashes 
before all the disinherited of life, socialism is becoming a belief of a 
religious character rather than a doctrine." Thus concluded French social 
psychologist Gustave Le Bon in a book entitled "The Psychology of 
Socialism," published at the turn of the last century. The dream of 
socialism is "to substitute itself for the ancient faiths," said Le Bon. It 
seeks to do so by appealing to "the sentiments of envy and hatred which 
it creates in the hearts of the multitudes. To the crowd, no longer satisfied 
with political and civic equality, it proposes equality of condition." 
 <p>
Socialism is a form of collective fatigue, a kind of mass despair. 
Energetic peoples have no use for it. Thriving cultures are characterized 
by "a considerable extension of what is confided to personal initiative, 
and a progressive reduction of all that is left to the state to perform." In 
worn-out cultures, that is, cultures on the decline, "the government is 
always a power absorbing everything, manufacturing everything, and 
controlling the smallest details of the citizen's life." 
 <p>
Le Bon argued that all forms of  government enshrine one or the other of 
"two different and opposing fundamental principles -- individualism and 
collectivism. By individualism, man is left to himself; his initiative is 
carried to a maximum and that of the state to a minimum. By collectivism 
a man's least actions are directed by the state . . . the individual possesses 
no initiative; all the acts of his life are mapped out." Le Bon had no 
difficulty determining which of these two conflicting principles leads to 
greater results. "The peoples among whom individualism is most highly 
developed are by this fact alone at the head of civilization," he said, "and 
today dominate the world." 
 <p>
Socialism has no appeal for a vigorous, self-confident people. It begins to 
gain ground, however, when the middle and upper classes lose their 
moorings, when they are "no longer sure of their rights. Or rather, they 
are not sure of anything, and they do not know how to defend anything." <p>
Once they succumb to what Le Bon called a "vague humanitarianism," 
their days as free men are numbered. "Under the unconscious but 
disintegrating influence of this humanitarianism, the directing classes 
[lose] all confidence in the justice of their cause. They surrender more 
and more to the leaders of the opposing party, who merely despise them 
in proportion to their concessions." 
 <p>
To avert the triumph of socialism, Le Bon counseled his countrymen to 
"give up our perpetual prospects of reform, and also the idea that we must 
always be changing our constitutions, our institutions, and our laws. 
Above all we ought to limit, and not constantly extend, the intervention 
of the state, so as to force the citizens to acquire a little of the initiative 
and the habit of self-government" of which they have been deprived by 
pandering and paternalistic programs.

<i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/duplbio.html">F.R. Duplantier</a> <br>January 15, 1996
<br></i><hr><h2>Long-Term Commitment in Bosnia </h2></center><P>

[Will American troops return from Bosnia in 12 months or less -- or will 
they still be there 20 years from now?] 
 <P>
John Hillen of the Heritage Foundation warns that "there are very serious 
questions that need to be answered about the political viability of the 
[Bosnian peace] accord and the effectiveness of the American military 
intervention to implement it." For starters, how realistic is a Bosnian state 
composed of "two separate political entities -- the Bosnian Muslim/Croat 
Federation and the Bosnian Serb Republic"? For such a state to be viable, 
says Hillen, "the two separate entities will have to show the most 
extraordinary goodwill and cooperation toward each other, qualities that 
have never been in evidence in Bosnia." Hillen contends that "the accord 
does not address fundamental issues of sovereignty and ethnic self-
determination. Instead, it freezes those unresolved issues in place and 
offers up an elaborate power-sharing agreement for a Bosnian central 
government." 
 <P>
The Bosnian Muslim/Croat Federation itself is pretty fragile. "There is 
considerable doubt about the solidarity of this alliance," says Hillen. 
Local support for the peace accord is also tenuous. "All three Bosnian 
Serbs present-at the- Dayton peace talks refused to sign the peace accord, 
and Bosnian Serb leaders denounced the accord within hours of its 
initialing." Among the issues left unsettled by the accord was the question 
of "how to integrate the two (or possibly three) rival armies into one that 
would serve the foreign policies of the central government." With such 
considerations in mind, Hillen concludes that "the United States will 
incur some form of continuing security obligation to Bosnia" far beyond 
its one-year commitment. 
 <P>
"There are also serious questions about the military feasibility of NATO's 
Implementation Force," says John Hillen of the Heritage Foundation. 
"Clearly defined, decisive, and attainable military objectives" have yet to 
be identified. The Bosnian peace implementation plan "strips any 
advantage from American ground forces and places U.S. troops in a 
passive and reactive posture." Despite President Clinton's assertions of a 
limited deployment, "the peace accord opens the door for NATO 
peacekeepers to perform many nation-building activities such as ensuring 
the free movement and resettlement of refugees, aiding humanitarian 
workers, resolving boundary disputes, creating secure conditions for free 
elections, and responding to violence against civilians." 
 <P>
The continuing expansion of peacekeeping duties -- and the perception 
that early withdrawal of U.S. troops could jeopardize the NATO mission 
-- would seem to dictate an extended American presence. "European 
allies have universally condemned President Clinton's proposed timetable 
for American forces in Bosnia," says John Hillen. "President Chirac of 
France has predicted an armed NATO presence that could last up to 20 
years." Clinton knows that the American public would never agree in 
advance to such "a protracted and costly intervention in an area of 
marginal strategic interest," but is counting on our reluctant support for 
his fait accompli. "Once the prestige, blood, and treasure of the United 
States are engaged," the Europeans hope that "the U.S. will have to see 
the intervention through to its conclusion."

                    General Gordon R. Sullivan, Chief of Staff, <BR>
                    United States Army, February 5, 1994
<P>
     This curious statement by the Army Chief of Staff suggests he
knows something the rest of the national security establishment has
not yet figured out: The Clinton Administration has no intention of
developing and equipping the forces needed to defend America's global
interests for the rest of the 20th century. Indeed, President Clinton
will fall some $100 billion short in funding the level of military
might he has determined is necessary over the next five years. (For a
full discussion of the Clinton 1995 Defense Budget, see Baker Spring,
"Clinton's Defense Budget Falls Far Short," Heritage Foundation
Backgrounder Update No. 217, March 15, 1994.) But in no armed service
are the potential effects of the Clinton Administration's dismantling
of America's defenses more vividly foretold than in the United States
Army.
<P>
     The Clinton Administration's defense budget for the period of
1995 through 1999 leaves the Army with a Hobson's choice: it will
either be too small to perform its mission of seizing enemy-held
territory overseas, or it may be large enough, but lack modern weapons
and not be combat-ready. General Sullivan, for good reason, is balking
at having to make this choice at all. But his statement of "smaller is
not better" suggests that he will resist further force structure
reductions beyond those that the Clinton Administration proposed in
its comprehensive 1993 analysis of defense policy, known as the
Bottom-Up Review. Hence, for the time being, General Sullivan
apparently hopes to preserve the Army's size, which risks creating a
"hollow force" short of equipment, spare parts, and necessary
training.
<P>
THE ARMY'S TWO OPTIONS
<P>
     The full scope of the dilemma facing General Sullivan is best
understood by analyzing the two options provided by Clinton's defense
budget proposals. If Clinton's figures are accepted, the Army ends up
with two equally unattractive options. They are: 
     
     
<P>
 Option 1: A smaller, but more combat-ready Army
<P>
     In this option, the Clinton Administration decides to reject its
own analysis of future defense needs and instead builds an Army
smaller than the one envisaged in the Bottom-Up Review. The force most
closely resembling this option is Les Aspin's "Option B," which he
developed in 1992 while he was Chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee. (Les Aspin, "Defense 1997 Alternatives," February 25,
1992.) That force consisted of eight active divisions and four reserve
division equivalents, with 808,000 active and reserve troops. (A
division equivalent is a collection of lower level units (such as a
brigade or regiment) not formally organized as a division but of
roughly the same size and strength.) This compares with the
recommendations of the Bottom-Up Review, which calls for ten active
divisions and five reserve division equivalents. At this lower force
level, more money would be available to spend on operations and
maintenance, the mainstays of combat readiness.
<P>
     Further, the size of this Army would be much smaller than that
proposed for the coming fiscal year. The Army plans to have twelve
active divisions and eight reserve division equivalents by the end of
1995, with 1.152 million troops. Thus, to reach the force structure of
Option 1, the Army would have to eliminate four active divisions and
four reserve division equivalents (see Table 1). It would also have to
eliminate 344,000 billets between 1996 and 1999 to meet the levels in
this option (see Table 2).
<P>
     A smaller force structure would enable the Army to maintain a
budget that is better balanced among its various components. For
example, if full funding of military pay is assumed, while funding for
the remaining accounts is proportional to that proposed for fiscal
1995, the outcome would be: 1) Military Personnel (compensation) =
$20.5 billion (Whereas the Clinton Administration proposes dedicating
just under 43 percent of the Army's budget in fiscal 1995 to military
pay, the hypothetical Option 1 budget for fiscal 1999 would devote 41
percent to military pay.); 2) Operations and Maintenance = $18.1
billion; 3) Procurement = $5.1 billion; 4) Research and Development =
$4.5 billion; and, 5) Military Construction and Family Housing = $1.8
billion (see Table 3). 
<P>
     Broken down this way, more could be spent on combat readiness
(the Operations and Maintenance account) in Option 1 than on a larger
force consisting of ten active duty divisions and five "division
equivalent" forces in reserves. Whereas the larger force would
allocate less than $12,000 (1994 dollars) per soldier from the O&M
account, the smaller force would spend more than $20,000. Thus, the
Option 1 or smaller Army would be more combat-ready than the larger
force option (see Table 4).
<P>
     This force may be more combat-ready, but it would be too small to
meet the defense needs outlined in the Bottom-Up Review, which
concluded that the U.S. must be able to fight two major regional
conflicts "nearly simultaneously." When the U.S. fought Operation
Desert Storm in 1991, the Army had 26 active and reserve divisions and
still found it necessary to shift forces and material from around the
globe to support General Schwarzkopf's efforts. The Option 1 force
will consist of only twelve active and reserve division equivalents.
If a force almost twice the size of Option 2 had difficulties
fulfilling the requirements of only one regional contingency, the
Option 1 force cannot possibly handle two wars "nearly
simultaneously."
<P>
     In fact, the Option 1 force could not sustain operations in one
major regional conflict if it lasted longer than a few months. For
example, the U.S. sent seven Army divisions to Operations Desert
Shield and Desert Storm. But had the conflict lasted longer, the
forces rushed to the Gulf after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait would have
to have been replaced in accordance with standard wartime troop
rotation requirements. Thus, an additional four or five Army divisions
ultimately would have to have been deployed in the Gulf War. In the
end, if the war had lasted longer, the Army would have needed eleven
or twelve divisions. This requirement is one or two divisions higher
than that envisioned in Option 1.
<P>
Option 2: A larger, but "hollow" Army
<P>
     This option assumes that the Army sticks with the size of the
force structure recommended in the Bottom-Up Review. That study
concluded that by 1999 the Army must retain ten active duty divisions
and approximately five "division equivalents" in the reserve component
(see Table 1). In this force, the Army would maintain 1.07 million
active duty and reserve troops (see Table 2). (The Army expected by
the end of 1995 will comprise twelve active duty divisions and eight
reserve division equivalents, a total of 1.152 million men and women
under arms. Thus, to reach the 1999 projections, the Army will have to
jettison two active duty divisions, more than two division equivalents
from the reserves (see Table 1), and 82,000 positions (see Table 2).)
The 1999 Army budget will be approximately $50 billion, not accounting
for inflation
<P>
     But this $50 billion is not enough to keep the Army combat-ready.
For example, Congress will insist that military pay be "fully funded,"
that is, regularly adjusted for inflation. However, if Congress fully
funds military pay for the force of 1.07 million and allocates the
rest of the funds in proportions similar to those found in the fiscal
1995 budget, it will greatly distort the Army budget. If these
proportions are followed, the Army's 1999 budget will be: 1) Military
Personnel (pay and allowances) = $27.8 billion; 2) Operations and
Maintenance = $14.0 billion; 3) Procurement = $4.0 billion; 4)
Research and Development = $3.4 billion; and, 5) Military Construction
and Family Housing = $1.4 billion (see Table 3). This breakdown
clearly demonstrates that by 1999 the cost for personnel will swamp
the budget, constituting almost 55 percent of the entire Army budget. 
<P>
     Not even during the years of the "hollow" Army in the 1970s did
the personnel accounts exceed 50 percent. For example, in 1978, when
the Carter defense budget was at its lowest, personnel accounted for
40 percent of the Army budget.  Thus, this option commits the nation
to an Army that has too many troops for the amount of modern weapons
and equipment needed to maintain combat readiness.
<P>
     The impact of adopting Option 2 on the Army's modernization
program is nothing short of catastrophic. This is because the Army's
modernization accounts have been on a downward slope for a decade. For
example, the Army budget for new weapons and equipment peaked in
fiscal 1985 at $23.7 billion (in 1994 dollars). The current fiscal
year will see $7.4 billion invested in procurement, a 69 percent
reduction from the 1985 level. Option 2 would provide only $4 billion
for procurement in 1999. This translates to slightly more than $3.5
billion when adjusted for inflation. Therefore, Army procurement under
Option 2 will be only 15 percent in 1999 of what is was in 1985 (see
Table 5).
<P>
     These draconian cuts in the Army's modernization budget are
already having an effect. For example, the Army will purchase no new
tanks in fiscal year 1995, whereas it purchased 448 in 1990 and 720 in
1985. According to General Sullivan, the Army must terminate 57
programs now in production or development between 1995 and 1999 to
meet the procurement reduction requirements imposed on him by the
Clinton budget. Another 77 programs will be delayed or deferred during
the same period. With such a budget, the Army cannot continue to be
the modern, high technology force it was in the late 1980s and early
1990s.
<P>
     Option 2 also will seriously weaken the Army's combat readiness,
which is paid for mostly out of the Operation and Maintenance (O&M)
account. Under this option, O&M will constitute only 28 percent of the
total Army budget in 1999, down from 35 percent in 1995. This level of
spending means that while around $19,000 (in 1994 dollars) in O&M
funds will be available per soldier in 1995, only $12,000 per soldier
will be spent in 1999 (see Table 4). Such low levels of funding for
operations and maintenance will produce an Army unable to fight. As
Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona warned last year, "Today,
that readiness [exhibited in Operation Desert Storm] is beginning to
evaporate." (Senator John McCain, "Going Hollow: The Warnings Of Our
Chiefs of Staff," July 1993, p. 1.)
    <P> 

CONCLUSION
<P>
     If the Clinton Administration intends to disregard its own
conclusions regarding America's defense requirements and build a much
smaller military force, the President should tell Congress and the
American people. Instead, he clings to the Bottom-Up Review, but fails
to budget enough money to build that force. He reiterated his support
for the Bottom-Up Review force in his January 25 State of the Union
Address, where he stated: "Last year, I proposed a defense plan [the
Bottom-Up Review] that maintains our post-Cold War security at a lower
cost." (The text of President Clinton's State of the Union Address is
reprinted in the January 26, 1993, edition of The Washington Post, p.
A-12.) In so doing, the Administration risks a $100 billion shortfall
by 1999.
<P>
     Fully funding the Bottom-Up Review Army will cost about $57
billion (not accounting for inflation) in 1999, or $7 billion (15
percent) more than the Administration is likely to propose. From 1995
through 1999, additional funding for the Army would amount to about
$18 billion.
<P>
     The President's strong rhetoric on defense is not being matched
by his budgetary actions. (For a full discussion, see Baker Spring,
"Rhetoric vs. Reality: Assessing Clinton's Defense Policy," Heritage
Foundation Backgrounder Update No. 216, February 14, 1994.) It is not
a question of whether, but when, this President or his successor will
have those defenses tested by threats to the nation's global vital
interests. When that happens, it will be too late for the American
people to get the full accounting of how the Clinton Administration
was allowed to dismantle America's fighting machine.

<h2>Illiteracy and Delinquency</h2></center><P> . 

[Everyone's got his own idea of the best way to reduce crime -- more  
policemen, longer sentences, more prisons, and so on. But a number of  
studies suggest that teaching criminals to read may be the best solution of  
all!] 
 <p>
The National Adult Literacy Survey, commissioned by the U.S.  
Department of Education, found in 1993 that nearly half our adult  
population are poor readers. Another U.S. Department of Education  
survey, also in 1993, disclosed that more than two-thirds of U.S.  
schoolchildren cannot read up to their grade level. Al Shanker, longtime  
president of the American Federation of Teachers, declared in 1989 that  
only 3 to 6 percent of 17- and 18-year-olds are able to read editorials and  
articles in major newspapers and write a several-page essay. He said that  
80 percent of public school graduates cannot even write a two-paragraph  
letter to a supermarket manager applying for a job. A study on illiteracy  
commissioned by the Department of Justice in l992 said that 21 million  
Americans can't read at all, 45 million are marginally illiterate, and 20  
percent of high school graduates can't read their diplomas. 
 <p>
A l 993 U.S. Department of Justice study concluded that "the major cause  
of delinquency" is reading failure, and that-children in schools are  
"denied the means to achieve the goal to read." Juvenile delinquents and  
adult prisoners who are taught to read using a traditional intensive  
phonics method show a marked decrease in behavior problems as they  
become literate. 
 <p>
With a research grant funded by the U.S. Department of Justice, Michael  
Brunner spent two years analyzing the literature on illiteracy and  
recidivism. In a new book called Retarding America: The Imprisonment  
of Potential, he comes to the chilling conclusion that reading failure is a  
major cause, rather than just a correlate, of anti-social behavior. Brunner  
found that a high percentage of incarcerated juveniles were diagnosed  
early in school as "learning disabled" even though there was no evidence  
of specific neurological abnormalities. These children never received the  
kind of reading instruction that is successful -- namely, intensive,  
systematic phonics. So they never learned how to identify sounds in  
isolation, to blend individual speech sounds into words, or to segment  
polysyllabic words into speech sounds. Brunner discovered that failure to  
learn to read is a major cause for the frustration and low self-esteem that  
lead to juvenile delinquency. 
 <p>
Brunner reports a poignant interview with an incarcerated teenage boy  
who could decipher only four words and spell two. His years in the public  
school system were a time of constant humiliation because he could not  
read. Combative behavior was the only means he could think of to keep  
his peers from laughing at him. In the correctional institution, the boy  
was taught to read with remedial intensive phonics. Another teenager,  
interviewed at Ironwood Maximum Security Prison, felt like a new  
person once he had mastered phonics and learned to read. It sounds  
incredible, but making sure children learn how to read in the first grade is  
a proven crime prevention technique!

<title>Television's New Fall Lineup -- Duplantier</title>

<h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES</h4>

<h2>Televisions New Fall Lineup</h2></center>

Does art imitate life, or does life imitate art? Television's new fall lineup may hold the answer.<p>

The question -- whether art imitates life, or vice versa -- can be applied 
fruitfully to television, if one assumes a loose interpretation of the word 
art, which, of course, is the interpretation in vogue. The "situations" in 
some television programs do reflect an existing reality, while others 
clearly serve as models for imitation. Most, however, fall somewhere in 
between mere re-creation and outright advocacy. The single-parent TV 
family, for instance may now reflect an unfortunate demographic trend, 
but it's been a television standby for years. Perhaps the phenomenon 
began as a matter of plot convenience, or as a cheap trick for winning 
instant sympathy for the main character. Whatever the case, on TV at 
least, the broken home has proven to be more enduring than the 
traditional American family as memorialized in Leave It to Beaver. Ozzie 
and Harriet, and The Dick Van Dyke shows. Nowadays, only minority 
families are allowed to remain intact on television.<p>

Which comes first, the broadcast broken home or the real-life broken 
home? It's hard to say. Nevertheless, the number of broken homes on TV 
is disproportionately high and constitutes a distortion of reality. Single-
parent TV families naturally lend themselves to grief mongering. What in 
public schools today goes by the name of "Death Education" has wormed 
its way into prime-time programming. Those single-parent TV families 
that have not resulted from divorce presuppose the death of one of the 
spouses. Such programs encourage the immature viewer to contemplate 
the prospect of his own parents' estrangement from each other, as well as 
the even grimmer possibility of their untimely deaths.<p>

Casual sexual practices are also more prevalent on the air than off. and 
gratuitous displays of flesh and simulated carnality are on the rise, 
especially in "dramatic" serials. Raunchiness and the rapidly changing 
multiple-plot format often go hand in hand, for they both pander to the 
demand for immediate gratification. The mature, loving relationship and 
the sophisticated, sustained plot require a keener insight into human 
nature and a greater attention span than are commonly possessed by 
people who respond to mental images with their sweat and salivary 
glands. With their incessant jumping from one swiftly developing plot to 
another. and the endless permutations of "relationships," the nighttime 
soaps are custom-made for the impatient hedonist.<p>

As with each new television season, there are one or two bright spots on 
the video horizon. Most of the new shows, of course, will fail to generate 
any significant interest among jaded television viewers, and some will set 
new standards for the stinker. A rare few will carve out audiences 
sufficient to perpetuate their existence. Still, we'd all be better off if the new fall lineup were completely disappointing. Then maybe we'd find the 
time, and the energy, to read a book, dine out with our spouses, play 
games with the kids, or visit the neighbors.<p>

<CENTER><B>Daniel Casse on Lamar Alexander</B></CENTER>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE="+2">L</FONT></B>amar Alexander is an unorthodox, populist, and persuasive Republican
leader. That is why I gladly moved from Washington to Nashville
to work on his presidential campaign, and why I believe he will
be the party's nominee in 1996. 

<P>
Our legislative branch's leadership
of national government is a temporary (albeit fascinating) phenomenon.
But we need our next president to set the agenda, not take his
cues from Congress. Conservatives should be looking for a candidate
who can present a bold design for government along with the ability
to execute it. 

<P>
Lamar Alexander has the imagination, energy, and
executive background to do both. The major themes of his campaign-growth,
freedom, and personal responsibility-are indisputably conservative.
But what distinguishes him is his unorthodox approach to politics,
his populist style of governance, and his skills of persuasion.


<P>
<B>Unorthodox.</B> In 1978, Alexander was elected governor of Tennessee,
only the third Republican to win that office this century. Nothing
that followed was typical, either. He began his crusade to improve
Tennessee's pitiful public-school system by introducing merit
pay and master teachers, relatively radical notions that weakened
the teacher unions. The National Education Association fought
him vigorously. He ignored warnings that it was hopeless, fought
back, and won. 

<P>
Alexander broke new ground on other issues. At
a time when most governors were using state airplanes to fly to
Washington, Alexander closed Tennessee's D.C. office altogether.
He chided other governors for behaving like senators. As early
as 1981, he advised President Reagan to end the federal role in
education. Four years later, he called two relatively unknown
congressmen named Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott and invited them
to join a small group of GOP governors to plot a united strategy
for second stage of the Reagan Revolution. 

<P>
He showed the same
verve when he arrived at the Department of Education in 1991.
By then, the intellectual excitement of the Bill Bennett years
had passed, and the Bush administration's school-choice agenda
amounted to little more than photo-ops with local education activists.
Alexander understood that school choice-despised by country-club
Republicans and misunderstood by most suburbanites-was at risk
of becoming a political loser. His &quot;America 2000&quot; program
was a true grass-roots initiative that breathed life into education
reform. Conventional wisdom dubbed it a quirky agenda that offered
little federal legislation. But it tapped into a decentralization
movement that remains the only path to school choice. His 1992
school-choice bill was a true voucher program for public, private,
and parochial schools, but the Democrats in Congress made sure
it never came to a vote. 

<P>
<B>Populist.</B> Alexander's well-publicized
assault on Congress-&quot;cut their pay and send them home&quot;-is
no mere slogan. It reveals his deep sympathy with the populism
that has justifiably become the bedrock of conservative politics.
An unapologetic champion of term limits, he sincerely believes
that a citizen legislature would transform the character of the
federal government. With none of Ross Perot's demagoguery, Alexander
offers a mature, but no less revolutionary, brand of popular discontent
with government in Washington. 

<P>
While some Republicans still waver
on the wisdom of block grants, Alexander is advancing the idea
both philosophically and practically. He suggests ending the federal
role in education, welfare, and job training altogether. He applauded
the Supreme Court decision striking down the 1990 Gun-Free Schools
Zone Act, an attempt to federalize local responsibility that every
GOP senator supported. &quot;We know what to do&quot; is the central
tenet of his populist conservative political theory, which holds
that Americans should be given the freedom to make decisions about
their own lives. Although every Republican will offer bromides
about &quot;states' rights&quot; or &quot;new federalism&quot;
during the coming months, Alexander's own policy prescriptions
suggest a fully conceived populist vision.

<P>
<B>Persuasive.</B> If conservatives
are to remake government, we must do more than merely express
support for conservative ideas. We must also win over others not
fully in our camp. It didn't take much leadership to point out
that the Clinton health-care plan was a socialistic fantasy. The
political challenge was to convince half the nation-including
many Democrats-that the Clinton plan was bad medicine. 

<P>
The job
of president is almost entirely about setting a principled agenda
and then persuading the country of its wisdom. Alexander's public
career has prepared him to do just that. As governor, he led a
Democratic legislature toward his goals. When 38 governors competed
to get GM's Saturn division to build its plant in their states,
Tennessee won, in part because Alexander convinced the company's
executives that a right-to-work state with school choice, merit
pay, and no income tax was the best environment for business.
No tax breaks were involved. 

<P>
As the chairman of the National Governors
Association, he transformed its agenda by convincing fellow members-including
Bill Clinton, John Sununu, Dick Thornburgh, and Michael Dukakis-that
they should end their obsession with Washington issues and focus
on state matters instead. 

<P>
A president who is at once unorthodox,
populist, and persuasive will quickly establish a very different
type of presidency. But that is exactly what conservatives and
libertarians should be looking for next year.The danger we face
is that, with an irreparably damaged president in the White House,
Republicans will try to coast to victory in 1996 on a poll-driven
platform of GOP boilerplate.  Alexander will offer none of that
blandness. He governed Tennessee in the 1980s in much the same
way that Wisconsin's Tommy Thompson and Michigan's John Engler
govern in the 1990s. True, his view of the role of the federal
government may be at odds with much of established Washington.
But it is a view understood and applauded around the country.

<CENTER><B>Paul Gottfried on Patrick Buchanan</B></CENTER>
<P>
The announcement by Pat Buchanan of his candidacy for the Republican
presidential nomination has done more to change the Republican
race than has the entry of any other candidate. More than any
other contender, Buchanan represents the populist right and has
fought all of its enemies. He has tangled with the liberal media;
the gay, feminist, and civil-rights lobbies; and the corporate
economic interests allied with big government. He has also dished
out, in his provocative speeches and blistering columns, fully
as much as he has taken. There is a certain bulldog tenacity about
him that even his bitterest opponents acknowledge. When Buchanan
believes he has been unfairly attacked, he stands his ground,
and he shows as much civility or incivility to his critics as
they display toward him. In 1992, I thought that he should have
done more to defuse accusations of being anti-Jewish, a charge
that plagued him particularly after he had linked support for
the Gulf War to the activities of Israel's &quot;amen corner.&quot;
But Buchanan would not apologize for what he--and others, including
commentators Michael Kinsley and Rabbi Jacob Neusner-took to be
a false charge. As he told his Jewish advisers, he would not dignify
a &quot;libel&quot; charge by responding to it. 

<P>No, I do not always
agree with Buchanan's positions, but they are honestly stated
and consistently held. Unlike senators Gramm and Dole, he has
not waffled on affirmative action or aid to illegal aliens, which
Buchanan has always opposed. And like Alan Keyes, but unlike most
of the other Republican candidates, he is genuinely opposed to
abortion. 

<P>
Equally important to me are the populist themes that
resonate in his campaigns. In the Wall Street Journal in 1993,
Irving Kristol predicted the inevitable success of a national
leader carrying out Buchanan's ideas. Buchanan's passionate concerns-violent
crime, immigration controls, the disintegration of morals, and
the disappearing jobs of American workers-are now, according to
Kristol, widely shared. New York cabdrivers, even those from the
Third World, express most of these concerns with equal vehemence.
Kristol is no friend of Buchanan or his candidacy, but he does
recognize the timeliness of his populist themes-and the foolishness
of those who would resist them. 

<P>
Buchanan belongs to a movement
that is also sweeping Europe. In Italy, Austria, and Germany,
there is a surging populist protest against capricious public
administration. There is also a growing demand that government
bring itself into line with the beliefs and traditions of those
it is intended to serve. Democracy, populists maintain, is not
an exercise in sensitivity training or the formulation of administrative
policy. It is the practice of self-government by self-identified
communities, whether regional or national. 

<P>
When the popular will
seeks to affirm traditional morality or limit the political community,
but is disregarded or overruled judicially, then both democracy
and citizenship are devalued. This is now a regular occurrence
in the U.S. The populist call for both political accountability
and true self-government has joined a conservative goal: the defense
of family and traditional communities endangered by a therapeutic
managerial state. 

<P>
Buchanan personifies the populist revolt against
this. Unlike neoconservatives and gentrified Republicans, he concedes
nothing, rhetorically or programmatically. He calls for seismic
change: devolution of power to states and open confrontation with
moral and cultural revolutionaries posing as value-free judges
or public servants. As president, he would not merely dicker with
liberal administrators. He would find ways to dispatch them and,
wherever possible, dismantle their agencies. 

<P>
Buchanan's spiritedness
and unwavering conviction persuade me that he would make a difference
as president. Unlike Ronald Reagan, he would not leave the Washington
power structure as he found it. He would make strenuous efforts
to restore the dual federalism established by our founders. 

<P>Buchanan
knows that genuine democracy must come from below. It cannot be
mandated from Washington or, in imperialist fashion, imposed abroad.
In our own country, democracy is an ideal to be recaptured, not
a blueprint to be forced on other nations. 

<P>
I doubt that Buchanan
would be a rigidly isolationist president. His stern warnings
against foreign entanglements have a constructive aim. He rightly
fears that our own society is deteriorating in many ways. Especially
now that our communist enemy is gone, it may be best to work on
domestic problems instead of shouldering the burdens of other
peoples.  

<P>
Nor should we encourage unskilled workers from less
developed lands to immigrate, take advantage of our social services,
and displace those most at risk in our own work force. America,
as Buchanan sees it, should hope neither to remake nor to absorb
the rest of humanity. In contrast to the nationalism expressed
by Ben Wattenberg, one of his frequent debating partners, Buchanan's
nationalism has no global imperative and is respectful of cultural
differences. Because of his feisty and principled character and
his democratic counterrevolutionary vision, I shall cast my own
vote in the Republican presidential primary for this modest nationalist.

<CENTER><B>DavidKuo on Bob Dole</B></CENTER>
<P>
The elections of November 1994 did more than usher in the first
conservative Congress in two generations. They also signaled the
public affirmation of a conservative agenda. In so doing, they
forced conservatives to change both their congressional and their
presidential perspectives. Suddenly, long-held conservative hopes
became new-found conservative realities. The balanced budget is
fashionable-the only real question now is whether it will be accomplished
through the budget process or through an amendment to the Constitution.
Federalism is renewed and devolution is the new buzzword. Illegitimacy
is bad and the family needs to be strengthened. As conservatives
consider whom among the presidential candidates to support in
1996, the question is, &quot;Who is best suited to take us to
the next stage of our conservative realignment?&quot; The clear
answer: Bob Dole. 

<P>The next stage of the realignment is not for
communication and symbolism, but for the detailed work of devolving
federal power, strengthening families, and reasserting American
interests abroad. It is a stage for implementing an agenda already
defined. 

<P>
Although some things may have caused conservatives some
angst, the simple fact remains: On every serious issue on our
agenda, Bob Dole is not only on board, he is the leader. 

<P>
This
is not a recent phenomenon. The man now calling for the abolition
of the departments of Commerce, Housing and Urban Development,
Education, and Energy is the same man who voted against creating
both Education and HUD. The man now speaking out against our nation's
social pathologies has a pro-life voting record of nearly 100
percent. The man now advocating a U.S. foreign policy based on
American interests has been one of the leading voices in foreign
policy for years. And the man who has pledged to balance the budget
has made tough choices, year after year, on spending cuts. 

<P>
Today,
Bob Dole is arguably the most respected statesman in the country.
He has proven himself an excellent strategist who remains cool
under fire, a coalition-builder, and a political achiever. He
has demonstrated both the courage and the decisiveness that will
be required to implement our agenda. 

<P>
Too often, conservatives
have belittled and diminished legislative experience as a liability-suggesting
that a man who legislates cannot be trusted with the ideological
mantle. But as Ronald Reagan, George Bush, and even Bill Clinton
have learned, accomplishing-legislating-is difficult business.
Any agenda, however aggressive, however bold, however visionary
is merely an agenda unless it is implemented. But Majority Leader
Dole is not only a legislator, he is a master at getting things
done. And President Dole would be able to translate his experience
and ability into the tough work of reversing 30 years of growth
in the welfare state. 

<P>
Many contend that the president's most important
role is commander-in-chief of our armed forces, and they may be
right. Though Cold War pressures have receded, our recent dalliances
in Somalia, Bosnia, and North Korea testify to the continuing
need for serious and responsive leadership. Bob Dole, who has
emerged as the leading Republican voice in foreign policy, would
bring to the presidency a developed view of world affairs. His
view combines two things: an expansive interpretation of America's
role in the world and a personal and pragmatic understanding of
the dangers of global involvement. 

<P>
For someone who has worked
for both the National Right-to-Life Committee and Empower America,
all of these things are important. But the real source of my attraction
to Dole lies elsewhere. The true reason I believe Bob Dole should
be president of the United States stems from his character. 

<P>
The
presidency helps define the character of the country. People look
to the president for leadership, inspiration, and guidance. The
president should be someone to whom parents can point and tell
their children, &quot;Be like him.&quot; In Bob Dole, parents
could point to someone who served his country in war, overcame
physical infirmities thought to be insurmountable, and dedicated
his life to serving the American people-all good and noble things.
He has also proven himself to be a man who keeps his word.

<P>
In the 1980s, following a decade of turmoil and the &quot;malaise&quot;
presidency, America needed a particular kind of conservatism-an
inspiring conservatism of sweeping visions, a conservatism that
could hasten the downfall of communism abroad and the restoration
of confidence at home. In President Reagan, it had an unparalleled
leader. But America now needs something very different. It needs
a conservatism that is still visionary, but one whose greatest
virtue is belief in community and responsibility. In Bob Dole
it has its rightful leader. His presidency would not only bury
the aberration that is the Clinton presidency, but would also
consolidate the conservative revolution.

<CENTER><B>William E. Dannemeyer on Bob Dornan</B></CENTER>
<P>
True leadership emanates from men who say the right thing at
the right time to the people who need to hear it most. This is
how I think of Bob Dornan. In my mind's eye I return to 1990,
on a typically hot and humid July morning in Washington, D.C.,
where a not-so-typical debate began to boil on the floor of the
House. 

<P>
At issue was the expulsion of Representative Barney Frank,
who had brought shame upon our institution for misjudgments involving
a male friend and prostitute over an 18-month period. As the sponsor
of the resolution to expel Frank, I can tell you that the experience
was one of the most intensely sobering dramas with which I was
ever involved in my 14 years of service in the House. It was not
a time for the timid. Only four members spoke in favor of the
expulsion. Bob Dornan was one of them. 

<P>
Bob began his comments,
&quot;I have not been this nervous in this well in over a 14-year
span in this House.&quot; And then he did something that has become
trademark Dornan, something only courageous men can do under fire.


<P>
Knowing that he stood virtually alone, knowing that ridicule and
contempt would be heaped upon him by Frank's defenders and a vicious
liberal media, Bob turned and looked Barney Frank square in the
eyes, not once turning his attention elsewhere, and said what
had to be said to the man who needed to hear it most: &quot;I
don't care about the details. The devil is in the details. That
is for you lawyers.&#133; I will vote for expelling you because
you did not have the honor or decency to resign.&quot; 

<P>
Bob Dole,
as inspirational as his life has been, would never have shown
such leadership. Phil Gramm would have become invisible. Dick
Lugar would have prayed that the moment would quickly pass. And
Arlen Specter would have defended Frank. Under those circumstances,
not one of these Republican candidates, who all serve in elective
office, would have done what needed to be done or have said what
needed to be said. This is a major reason why I support Bob Dornan
for president. 

<P>
Bob's conservatism is real. It is passionate. And
it is based on a deep and abiding faith in God. I was glad, although
not surprised, to hear Bob inject themes of liberty and virtue
into the presidential debate. Unlike the congressional colleagues
who have become his presidential competitors, Bob actually understands
the historical, moral, and philosophical basis of these themes.
He knows, and has stated, that we cannot be a free people unless
we are a virtuous people. He did not need million-dollar handlers
to tell him that. Nor did he need the incessant prodding of pro-family
special interests to motivate his comments. He knows the relationship
of liberty to virtue because he is a self-motivated student of
truth. 

<P>
History is one of Bob's closest friends. His life-long
relationship with history has honed his bubbling idealism into
a practical and balanced conservative philosophy. As a staunch
proponent of lower taxes and lower federal spending, Bob knows
the bounds of governmental authority, not only because he has
worn this mantle of authority over the last 18 years in Congress
but also because he has studiously examined history. From ancient
Rome to modern America, Bob Dornan knows what makes nations rise
and fall. The presidential rivals who serve with him in Congress
haven't got a clue. 

<P>
Bob Dornan is not the only good conservative
in this race for the presidency. Pat Buchanan and Alan Keyes are
also running-and I count each as my friend. Even so, when I have
to choose, it is Bob Dornan I will support. Few other qualities
in a presidential candidate could offset a lack of elected public
service. Bob has been elected to Congress nine times, in Democratic
districts. These experiences have built character that cannot
be found anywhere else in politics.Moreover, Bob's record of service
both in and on behalf of the military is a nearly essential requirement
of the role of commander-in-chief. I know Bob feels it is an absolute
requirement. Through a variety of circumstances, he has witnessed
firsthand how America has influenced the world for good and has
developed the deepest appreciation for U.S. sovereignty. Bob Dornan
would not rush us off to war, nor would he abandon genuine freedom
fighters anywhere in the world. In determining this delicate balance,
I know he would excel-always erring on the cautious side in preserving
American lives and sovereignty. 

<P>
Bob Dornan belies the public persona
crafted and manipulated by an adversarial media elite. His passion
for life, his love of country, his deep commitment to his wife
Sallie and their children and grandchildren, and his uncanny identification
with all types of people sometimes make him an easy target for
mean-spirited and shallow adversaries. Yet he has remained eternally
optimistic about life and about the future of America specifically.
Great men deserve even greater opportunities to show their mettle.
This is why I unhesitatingly support Bob Dornan for president
of the United States of America.

<CENTER><B>Lewis E. Lehrman on Phil Gramm</B></CENTER>
<P>
Who is the authentic heir of the Reagan Revolution, the iron
man who can fulfill its promise? Who among us is the leader with
the compelling vision, the experience, and the perseverance to
lead us out of our time of troubles? I say I know such a man.


<P>
Born a son of the South, a grandson of Yankee immigrants, raised
in Georgia, and grown to manhood in Texas, he has risen to leadership
by virtue of his own remarkable energy and intelligence-just as
he rose to the rank of legislative statesman as the senior senator
from Texas. Phil Gramm is the man. 

<P>
Born poor, self-made, and unencumbered
by the cultural baggage of country-club Republicans, Phil Gramm's
life has demonstrated the promise of the American dream: that
every American, no matter how humble his beginnings, has the right
and the opportunity to rise by indefatigable effort and indisputable
merit as high as he might go. Phil Gramm will rise to the highest
office in the land because he will, conventional wisdom notwithstanding,
roll up the primaries in 1996. And he will win the general election
going away. 

<P>
This is how Phil Gramm will win! He will win with
the most compelling campaign of conservative ideas. He knows what
he believes and loves what he knows. He will win by recruiting
legions of true conservative activists to embrace his definition
of the American dream. He will win by the sheer force of his superior
talent and leadership, which explains why he has built more organization,
raised more money, and won over the vast majority of conservative
activists who know where he stands. 

<P>
Every true conservative who
aspires to the highest office should uphold a clear program of
reform designed to restore our limited constitutional government.
Yet we know, from the failures and disappointments of the past,
that a program by itself is not sufficient. Neither will it be
sufficient in 1996 to choose careerism or time-serving political
credentials. 

<P>
The conservatives now assembled for victory have
learned from hard experience that the man who leads us will only
be sufficient unto the task if he has, in addition to the gift
of intellect and a well-laid plan, something more. That something
is true grit, unimpeachable character, and the irrefragable tenacity
to carry his plan for a rebirth of the American dream to total
triumph. We the people want a president of the United States whose
impeccable conservative ideas and matchless record are joined
with a driving will to win. We want a winner, a big winner, a
man with a strategy for victory.

<P>
In the domain of political economy,
Phil Gramm is the best-trained, best-equipped presidential candidate
in American history. A free-market professor of economics long
before it was trendy, a co-author of the Reagan economic program,
he is the very apostle of low tax rates, a balanced budget, stable
money, and a deregulated economy. Phil Gramm is without peer in
his grasp of how to create full employment, long-term interest
rates of 4 percent, and a tax code based on a flat rate. 

<P>
In the
domain of defense policy, Phil Gramm has prepared himself for
the post-communist world. He has declared that he is &quot;ready
for a world where the lion will lie down with the lamb, and if
such a world comes about, I want the United States of America
to be that lion.&quot; No other policy is acceptable to Phil Gramm,
whose presidential inaugural oath, registered in heaven, will
require him to &quot;preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution
of the United States of America.&quot; 

<P>
Believing as I do that
economics and foreign policy are contingent, but cultural and
social principles are central, what assurance does one have that
President Gramm will encourage and foster the indispensable moral
reformation of the public square? Speaking in May before Liberty
University and The Heritage Foundation, Phil Gramm said: &quot;Faith
and family produced the values and virtues that helped make America
the world's greatest and most powerful nation long before we had
any of the trappings of greatness and power.&quot; Quoting Alexis
de Tocqueville, Gramm said, &quot;'Not until I went into the churches
of America, and heard her pulpits flame with righteousness did
I understand the secret of her genius and power. America is great
because she is good, and if America ever ceased to be good, America
will cease to be great.' I believe that Alexis de Tocqueville
was right 160 years ago, and I believe he is right today.&quot;


<P>
In more specific terms, Gramm has argued that &quot;the social-security
net that we erected has become a hammock. Government programs&#133;have
changed the way we behave, corrupted our values, and diminished
our virtue. As we look more and more towards Caesar to take care
of us, we have turned more and more away from family and faith.
In rendering unto Caesar, we have stopped rendering unto God.&quot;


<P>
And thus we are brought to consider the soul of the Republican
Party as we debate its presidential nomination. During the greatest
crisis of American history, the Republican Party of the United
States was founded on the everlasting covenant of &quot;free soil,
free men, and free labor.&quot; And with the victory of our party
and of President Lincoln came vindication of the inalienable right
to liberty and the end of slavery in America. More than a century
later, the Republican Party of Ronald Reagan came to stand for
many things, but there was one unique covenant in the platforms
of 1980 and 1984. Let us call it the one needful thing. And what
is that thing? Senator Gramm described &quot;the day when all
unborn children are welcomed into life and loved when they get
here.&quot; A Republican Party-indeed, a Republican president-without
a commitment to the inalienable right to life, without unequivocal
opposition to abortion, is as unthinkable as a Republican Party
without Lincoln, the inalienable right to liberty, and unequivocal
opposition to slavery. 

<P>
We conservatives know that, after this
imminent contest for the presidency, our philosophical agenda
entails no less than the comprehensive reformation of our political
institutions. But to pursue a goal without the right man and the
right means to attain it is to court political disaster. Republicans
are blessed with several authentic candidates. But I believe that
Phil Gramm is the only leader with the intellect, the force of
will, and the preparation for greatness who can marshall our forces
for an overwhelming and irreversible victory over our foes.

<CENTER><B>Mary Parker Lewis onAlan Keyes</B></CENTER>
<P>
For the millions of Americans who are brokenhearted over the
decay of moral standards, the disintegration of families and neighborhoods,
and the slaughter of innocents in the womb, Alan Keyes is the
most powerful spokesman on the scene today. More than any other
candidate, Alan Keyes offers a healing message of hope and renewal,
based on the immortal principles of our great Declaration of Independence,
and delivered without apology to the better angels of our nature.


<P>
The former president of Citizens Against Government Waste, Alan
Keyes offers credentials second to none as a champion of Americans
fed up with overtaxation, overspending, and overregulation. For
example, when many Republican leaders were assuring us that Dick
Darman's 1990 budget deal was a winner for George Bush and the
GOP, Alan warned that the agreement would prove disastrous for
taxpayers, the economy, and the party. Events proved him right.


<P>
Today the GOP endorses the policies of tax reduction, spending
restraint, and local empowerment that Alan has championed for
years. That is well and good. But as Alan eloquently reminds Republican
audiences, economics is not at the heart of what ails America.
Serious though they are, our economic problems are largely derivative,
the consequences of having abandoned the moral and constitutional
principles of the American founding. The transfer state is bankrupting
America, but the transfer state comes into its own only when hordes
of people see nothing wrong with living off the toil of others.
In any event, moral vices produce the social problems for which
government programs are inevitably proffered as solutions. 

<P>
That's
why Alan's front-and-center emphasis on moral issues is the only
genuinely practical approach. Consider these words from his February
19 address to the New Hampshire Republican State Committee: &quot;Why
is it that we spend so much money on welfare and illegitimacy?
Why is it that we spend so much money on crime and violence in
our streets? Why is it even that we spend so much money dealing
with the problems of irresponsible behavior that contribute to
the decline of the health of this nation? I think you all know
in your hearts what the real answer is. We don't have money problems,
we have moral problems. And it's time we stood up and faced that
truth.&quot; We will never succeed in relimiting the federal government
until we restore the family to its rightful place as the first
and best &quot;welfare provider&quot; and strengthen the marriage-based,
two-parent family as the fundamental moral unit of society. 

<P>
Of
all the policies eroding the moral foundations of family life
and American freedom, the policy of abortion on demand poses the
greatest danger. There are, of course, many decent people on both
sides of the abortion controversy. Nonetheless, the pro-abortion
position is anti-family. As an institution, the family both depends
upon and nurtures an ethic of duty and self-sacrifice. But the
pro-abortion position fosters an ethic of self-indulgence. It
says, in effect, that the convenience or pleasure of the adult
is the supreme law. 

<P>
Worse, the pro-abortion position implicitly
justifies political despotism. The Declaration of Independence
proclaims the right to life to be a gift from God and, therefore,
inalienable. The pro-abortion argument assumes either that government
(not God) is the source of rights, or that we have the right to
decide whose humanity shall be recognized and whose shall not.
Obviously, the doctrine that there are no natural rights (hence
no natural wrongs) advances the ambitions of those whose chief
interest lies in the expansion of government power. But liberty
is also subverted when we claim the authority to decide who among
us is human, and who is not. Alan put it this way in an April
8 speech to Delaware Republicans: 

<P>
&quot;Don't you realize that
opens the door to every form of tyranny? Because all I have to
do if I want to snuff out your life or trample on your rights
is decide that you're not human. And of course you'll look at
me and say, 'But you can't do that.' And I'll say, 'Well, the
last time the American people decided they were going to draw
the line, my folks ended up on the wrong side of it.' And I don't
think it was because we had the poor judgment to draw the line
in the wrong place. I think it was because we claimed a right
we do not have. We do not have the right to draw that line. God
drew it, and all we have the right to do is respect His will.&quot;


<P>
Slavery and abortion on demand are both what Alan calls &quot;Declaration
issues&quot;-moral wrongs that must be addressed because they
contradict the basic premise of a self-governing polity. I believe
Alan sees so deeply into the nature of the abortion controversy
because he has thought long and hard about slavery and the black
experience in America. 

<P>
Keyes's book, <I>Masters of the Dream:
The Strength and Betrayal of Black America</I>, is not just an
antidote to decades of left-wing revisionism. It is a meditation
on the universal significance of the black experience-the moral
and civic lessons to be learned therefrom. Slavery did not make
blacks slavish, nor did material deprivation turn them into passive
victims. Rather, slavery whetted their natural thirst for freedom,
much as it did to the Hebrews of old. Deprivation taught them
to recognize the true, non-material basis of human dignity. To
survive in the face of adversity, blacks had to become diligent,
dependable, hopeful. They learned to honor hard work, self-discipline,
family, and the riches of the spirit. Such qualities of moral
and spiritual strength are the key to restoring the true American
dream-the dream of freedom. 

<P>
Beginning in the 1960s, black America
was betrayed by the same forces that are destroying the dream
for all Americans: the perverse incentives of the transfer state,
and the debilitating doctrines of sexual permissiveness and moral
relativism. Alan Keyes's candidacy is a candidacy like no other.
Drawing on the moral lessons of black history, the imperishable
truths of the Declaration, and the arts of statesmanship, Alan
Keyes will elevate the 1996 presidential contest to a plane not
seen in America since the Lincoln-Douglas debates.

<CENTER><B>MitchellE. Daniels Jr. on Richard Lugar</B></CENTER>
<P>
 As they search for the best national leader in 1996, conservatives
should look beyond words, votes, and even public actions. The
true measure of authenticity must encompass not only what a man
has shown to the camera, but also what he has shown to his family,
his neighbors, and his Maker. For Dick Lugar, conservatism is
not merely a school of thought, it is a way of life, and it is
in that context that he emerges as the right man to lead America
back to strength and virtue. 

<P>
By every conventional yardstick,
Dick Lugar has been a rock of conservative principle and consistency.
As the mayor of Indianapolis, he cut taxes five times in eight
years, and battled tirelessly against federal intrusion into state
and local autonomy. As a senator, he has amassed a voting record
in the most conservative fifth of each Congress in which he has
served; statistically, he was Ronald Reagan's number-one supporter
for the eight years of the 40th presidency. 

<P>
Lugar's campaign for
the presidency is animated by these same bedrock beliefs. His
determination to shrink government and reduce spending is confirmed
by his ongoing, often lonely battle to cut agricultural subsidies
and free American farmers to plant for the market, not the government.
Like Churchill, he believes that &quot;The responsibility of Ministers
for the public safety is absolute and requires no mandate. It
is in fact the prime object for which governments come into existence.&quot;
He knows, and is unafraid to state, that the safety of our country
cannot be left to chance, but will demand American activism on
nuclear proliferation, ballistic-missile defense, and terrorism.


<P>
Dick Lugar rejects the current establishment's constrained vision
of a U.S. economy growing at only 2 or 3 percent per year. His
clarion call to abolish all taxation of enterprise is the single
most radical and promising idea on the 1996 agenda. Alone among
the candidates' reform proposals, it would uproot today's entire
anti-growth, anti-savings regime of income, capital-gains, and
estate taxation, and turn loose a 1980s-like explosion of investment,
exports, jobs, and higher incomes. 

<P>
But for all its macroeconomic
appeal, the true significance of the Lugar tax plan lies in its
underlying values. Leapfrogging the flat tax and its imitators,
Lugar would abolish at a stroke the most dehumanizing aspects
of modern statism: the invasions of privacy, the abuses of power,
the insidious invisibility of withholding, and the unspoken assumption
that income belongs to the state rather than the individual. Through
their consumption decisions, individuals would have full control
of the rate of their taxation. In a real sense, Dick Lugar's tax
plan is the ultimate expression of conservative philosophy. 

<P>Anyone
can write a platform. Many have compiled positive records of words,
votes, and public deeds. It is the rarest of public men who can
also lead a life in complete congruence with the principles he
espouses. 

<P>
Dick Lugar has lived the virtues of self-discipline,
duty, devotion to country, and religious faith that we all admire
but practice imperfectly. He was first in his class in high school,
first in his class at college; he has been a Methodist lay minister,
and an Eagle Scout. Like Bill Clinton, Dick Lugar visited the
American Embassy in London while he was a Rhodes Scholar; unlike
Clinton, Lugar went there to enlist in the U.S. Navy. 

<P>
Lugar served
his country with distinction, including a stint as intelligence
briefer to Admiral Arleigh Burke, the chief of naval operations.
Returning to his home town, he saved a struggling family manufacturing
business, carried on the family farming operations, and with Charlene,
his wife (and co-president of their college's student body), built
his own little platoon of four sons. As a school-board member,
he fought for racial integration and against forced busing. That
brought him to the public's attention, and eventually to an elective
career. But throughout his public life, he has remained closely
involved in both his businesses. Dick Lugar has always been a
citizen legislator. 

<P>
When President Lugar calls Americans to reassert
the moral superiority of hard work, personal responsibility, intact
families, and respect for life, his conviction will not be drawn
merely from congressional testimony of the latest policy analysis.
His leadership of a cultural recovery in our country will be grounded
in a life of commitment to virtues early learned and deep embedded.


<P>
The conservative revolution is yet to be won. Building upon the
congressional breakthrough of 1994 will require the election of
a Republican president, and not just any Republican will do. Total
triumph will only be won by a president who can attract and hold
the respect and affection of millions of citizens. 

<P>
Dick Lugar's
brand of inclusive, reasoned, friendly conservatism has allowed
him to build larger coalitions and shatter electoral records throughout
his career. Just as he is the candidate most certain to disarm
President Clinton in a general election, he is the man best equipped
to win the enduring trust of the larger majorities whose support
will consummate the conservative crusade.

<P>
<CENTER><B>Roger J. Stone
Jr. on Arlen Specter</B></CENTER>
<P>
Arlen Specter is a Jew, he comes from a big city, he has a record
of commitment to racial equality (without quotas), he's pro-choice,
and he believes strongly in tolerance and the First Amendment
doctrine of church-state separation. For social-issue conservatives
who take their marching orders from Pat Robertson and Ralph Reed,
who believe in Pat Buchanan's &quot;holy war&quot; for the soul
of America, some or all of these factors probably make Specter's
candidacy anathema. Frankly, this article is not addressed to
them. 

<P>
The conservatives to whom this article is addressed are
conservatives like myself-the kind of conservatives I met in 1964
as a member of Young Americans for Freedom, fighting the good
fight for Barry Goldwater; the conservatives I led as National
Chairman of Young Republicans, and worked with beginning in 1976,
and then in 1980 and 1984, to give America eight magnificent years
of a Ronald Reagan presidency; and the supply-side conservatives
I worked with in Jack Kemp's 1988 presidential campaign in an
effort to continue that tradition. 

<P>
This article is addressed to
conservatives who, like Barry Goldwater, believe that government
ought to get off our backs, keep out of our pocketbooks, and stay
out of our bedrooms. This article is addressed to conservatives
who, like Ronald Reagan, believe in a strong America: strong enough
militarily to secure our interests and keep the peace around the
world, strong enough domestically to win the war against drugs
and violent crime on our streets. This article is addressed to
conservatives who, like Jack Kemp, believe in an American future
of unlimited economic opportunity and unprecedented growth fueled
by low taxes, free trade, and free markets. 

<P>
To those libertarian
conservatives, who I believe are the true core of American conservatism,
I say Arlen Specter is your candidate. In Arlen Specter, you will
find a senator with a strong record of conservatism that goes
back to his first days in the senate. In the Specter '96 campaign,
you will find a program thoroughly grounded in conservative ideals
and ideas, and a candidate committed to fiscal and economic conservatism
who has the best chance of beating Bill Clinton in a general election.


<P>
First, the Specter record. Arlen Specter came to the Senate in
1981 with an outstanding background in law enforcement as Philadelphia's
district attorney, where he fought successfully to end plea bargaining
and win stiff sentences for violent criminals. In the Senate,
he immediately made tough anticrime policies a legislative priority,
and authored the 1984 Armed Career Criminal bill, the first federal
law to use &quot;three strikes&quot; to get long-term jail terms
for repeat offenders. A strong believer in the deterrent force
of the death penalty, Arlen Specter has for 15 years been the
driving force in Congress to put teeth back into state death-penalty
laws by eliminating ridiculous judicial delays in carrying out
death sentences. 

<P>
Throughout the Reagan presidency, Arlen Specter
was a solid supporter of the revitalization of the American military,
including the Strategic Defense Initiative. He firmly opposed
any effort to relax the Cuban embargo. He has been at the forefront
of the fight to combat terrorism at home and abroad, and was a
leading Senate voice in support of the Gulf War resolution. Recently,
he has been a vocal Senate force in opposition to the Clinton
administration's appeasement of North Korea and its pointless
risk of U.S. lives in Haiti. 

<P>
Specter's fiscal record in the Senate
is solidly conservative: long-time support for both a balanced
budget amendment and the line-item veto (including sponsoring
his own legislation during his second term); support for the Reagan
era tax cuts; and, early this year,his own flat-tax bill-the Senate's
only such legislation.

<P>
For the same reasons that Specter has opposed
government interference into Americans' private lives, he has
always opposed gun-control and supported the rights of law-abiding
citizens to own firearms. He believes that swift, certain, and
severe punishment of criminals, not confiscation of guns from
the public, is the effective way to fight violent crime.

<P>
The defining
themes of the Specter '96 campaign are squarely conservative.
As Arlen Specter said in announcing his candidacy last March:
    
<P>
&quot;With the election of a Republican Congress in 1994 and
a Republican president in 1996, we have a unique opportunity to
move America toward unprecedented prosperity and unlimited opportunity....


<P>
&quot;We do so by implementing our core Republican values: smaller
government; less spending; lower taxes; civil rights and liberties;
strong national defense; and effective crime control.&#133; I
stand before you today as a man willing to work with every ounce
of my energy and every fiber of my determination to renew once
again the dreams of freedom and opportunity that for 200 years
have made this nation the envy of and the example for the world.&quot;


<P>
In his announcement speech, Specter made just two specific pledges
on domestic policy, and both reflect the fundamentally conservative
orientation of his governing philosophy: to balance the budget
by 2002 (and to write the first check to reduce the national debt
in January, 2003); and to deliver a flat-tax bill to the Congress
at his own inauguration. 

<P>
The flat-tax concept-a single 20 percent
tax rate on all business and personal income, elimination of all
loopholes and deductions except for a portion of home-mortgage
interest and small charitable contributions, and no taxation on
interest, dividends, and capital gains-has become the economic
centerpiece of the Specter campaign. As welcome as specific tax
cuts might be, they are mere Band-Aids for a tax system that is
long on bureaucrats, rules, and regulations and short on incentives
for economic growth. The future of conservative fiscal policy
lies with the flat tax-House Majority Leader Dick Armey said the
next president would be elected on a flat-tax platform-and Arlen
Specter is the only Republican candidate to commit foursquare
to such a system. 

<P>
Conservatives need to be realists. We need to
recognize that Bill Clinton is not as vulnerable as he once seemed
or as we might like. The 1996 Republican nominee will face in
Bill Clinton an energetic campaigner, a president determined to
use the considerable powers of incumbency in support of his re&euml;lection,
and a man zealously supported by interest groups determined to
retain their last link to political power. As conservatives, we
need a Republican nominee who can defeat Bill Clinton in a general
election-and that means Arlen Specter. 

<P>
Since 1980, Arlen Specter
has won three tough Senate races (and two tough primaries) in
a bellwether state where Democrats have always far outnumbered
Republicans. In 1992, despite the fury of radical feminists over
his defense of Clarence Thomas, Specter carried Pennsylvania by
three points while George Bush was losing the state to Clinton
by a million votes. Arlen Specter has a reputation as an indefatigable
campaigner-a reputation I can tell you is well deserved. He has
the intellect, tenacity, and toughness to take on Bill Clinton
in a presidential debate-and to win going away. 

<P>
In Arlen Specter,
conservatives have the chance to support a candidate committed
to a balanced budget and a flat tax at home, and to the restoration
of American strength, resolve, and credibility abroad; a candidate
who has the knowledge and experience to lead a national war on
crime and drugs; and a candidate who can win the White House on
these issues. Conservatives who see themselves as heir to the
libertarian legacy of Barry Goldwater, the Reagan tradition of
American strength abroad and limited government at home, and the
Kemp commitment to broad-based growth and prosperity belong in
his camp.

<P>
Today the commonsense conservative philosophy that so many have
fought for, for so long, holds sway in the Supreme Court, in the
U.S. Senate, and in the House of Representatives. There is only
one piece missing in the conservative political jigsaw puzzle-the
White House. When that piece is in place, a picture of real political
revolution will emerge, a revolution that could roll on well into
the next century.

<P>
That is why the stakes next year are so high.

<P>
There
have been three successful conservative Republican presidents
elected in our lifetimes-Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard Nixon,
and Ronald Reagan. I've worked to help elect and then serve with
two of them, and I believe there are certain requirements that
a person must have to win the Republican nomination and then the
presidency.   

<P>Here's the short list:
<UL>
<LI>They must have rock-solid
conservative views on national security and economic policy, and
they must be in accord on a wide range of social issues important
to the conservative base of the Republican party.
<LI>They must
be political warhorses, with a powerful political base-preferably
California (54 electoral votes), New York (33 votes), or Texas
(32 votes)-and skilled campaigners. Executive experience in government
is a big plus.
<LI>They must have high intelligence, great stamina,
and a record free of scandal. Running for president against any
incumbent Democrat, in the teeth of a hostile, liberal press,
is a mind-numbing, exhausting gauntlet. 
</UL>

<P>
The Republican candidates
running for president in 1996 are a distinguished group; any one
of them would be a dramatic improvement over President Clinton.
By the fall of 1995, it is likely that the race will narrow to
three men: Senator Dole, Senator Gramm, and Governor Wilson. They
are all good men, but I believe that one of them-Pete Wilson-best
meets the criteria for getting nominated, getting elected, and
governing successfully. 

<P>
<B>Peace and National Security.</B> Pete Wilson
has a strong, consistent record of conservative positions on national
defense and foreign policy. Known as a national defense hawk in
the U.S. Senate, he was a leading supporter of President Reagan's
Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) and one of the few who called
for early deployment. An expert on strategic nuclear policy and
arms control he was a critic of the SALT II treaty and backed
President Reagan's INF treaty.  

<P>
As governor, he has been an outspoken
critic of President Clinton for squandering U.S. prestige and
influence around the world and cutting national defense spending
to dangerously low levels. 

<P>
In the 1950s, he was a platoon leader
in the U.S. Marines. On national-defense matters, they don't come
any tougher than former U.S. Marine officers. On national security,
Pete Wilson is as tough a defender of U.S. interests as any Republican
running. 

<P>
<B>Prosperity and Economic Policy.</B> As a U.S. Senator, he
consistently supported both a constitutional amendment to balance
the federal budget, and line-item veto authority for the president.
As a candidate for the Senate, he strongly opposed the 1982 tax
increase; and as senator, he voted against President Bush's 1990
tax increase. 

<P>
When he became the governor of California in 1991,
he inherited the worst economic mess in the state's history. The
deficit facing him was one third of the state's general fund request,
comparable to a $500 billion deficit in today's federal budget,
but with one big difference-the California constitution mandates
a balanced budget. Unlike Washington, where you can take seven
years to achieve fiscal responsibility, he only had one year and
a legislature controlled by Democrats. Although some taxes were
raised, the lion's share of that deficit was eliminated by tough
spending control. 

<P>
In fact, during the four years of his first
term he held spending flat in current dollars. If you account
for inflation, real spending went down-not from some bogus baseline
projection, but from actual 1991 spending levels. If the federal
government had exercised comparable toughness, the federal budget
would be in balance today. 

<P>
California also went through a few
other trials-drastic defense-industry cutbacks, the collapse of
real-estate values, fires, floods, mudslides, riots, and earthquakes.
But Pete Wilson's tough spending control, unmatched in any other
state, laid the foundation for a strong economic recovery that
confounded the experts-a recovery strong enough to generate sufficient
new tax revenues to pay off temporary debts, to fund spending
increases for education and law enforcement, and to propose a
15 percent across-the-board tax cut for all individuals and businesses.
If the Democratic-controlled legislature refuses to pass the tax
cut, Pete Wilson has vowed to hold a statewide ballot referendum
and let the voters decide. When passed, the new tax rates will
be below what they were when he took office. 

<P>
Pete Wilson is the
only Republican candidate proposing a true supply-side tax cut-not
increased deductions or exemptions, but an across-the-board reduction
in tax rates. 

<P>Speaking to the Republican Midwest Leadership Conference
on May 19, 1995, he spelled out the Reagan supply-side formula
for economic prosperity: &quot;If we both cut taxes and cut spending...there
is every reason for not just optimism but for justified confidence
in America's dynamic growth.&quot; 

<P>
<B>Justice and Social Issues.</B>
Here his record is overwhelmingly on the side of conservative
values, a clear sense of what is right and wrong, and of achieving
justice. Pete Wilson, the governor of our largest state, took
the lead not only in reforming welfare, but also in actually cutting
the amount of benefits paid. He was the first political leader
to sound the alarm on the injustice of paying billions of taxpayers'
dollars for the welfare, medical care, and education expenses
of illegal aliens. He led the battle for &quot;three strikes and
you're out&quot; for career criminals, locking them up for life
after their third felony conviction. 

<P>
A supporter of term limits
for politicians and the kind of federalism the Founding Fathers
intended for the United States, he has led the fight against the
heavy hand of federal mandates, declaring that California is &quot;not
a colony of the federal government.&quot; 

<P>
He has fought for regulatory
and legal reform, proposed a state constitutional amendment to
limit regulatory excesses, and issued an executive order suspending
the environmental regulations that contributed to the recent flood
damage. He has consistently vetoed legislation that would extend
special rights to gays, while opposing measures that would discriminate
against them. Pete Wilson, an expert pistol shot when he served
in the Marine Corps, has always supported the fundamental Second
Amendment rights of Americans to keep and bear arms, subject only
to some commonsense restrictions that support law enforcement.
On affirmative action, he has called for commonsense justice-a
color-blind society in which people would be treated equally regardless
of race or gender. 

<P>
On the social issue that most troubles the
Republican party today-abortion-Pete Wilson holds strong, consistent
views. While fully aware of the deeply held beliefs of those who
oppose all abortion and the reasoning behind those beliefs, he
has also carefully considered the rights and responsibilities
of the individuals involved, and the dangers of allowing an already
too powerful federal government to intrude itself into the most
intimate, difficult decision a woman can make. He strongly believes
we should encourage the kind of responsibility that would make
abortion unnecessary, that the question of abortion is best left
to the family and church, and that we should try to remove this
issue from the political arena to the extent possible. 

<P>
Is this
conservative? Well, it is the position shared by a substantial
majority of the Republican Party. Considering the terrible moral
dilemmas involved, it is a commonsense conservative view. 

<P>
<B>Electability.</B>
Most of my conservative friends are primarily interested in ideas
and principles, but for those who are also concerned with mundane
things like winning elections and taking power, I have a final
thought. 

<P>
If Pete Wilson wins the Republican nomination in 1996,
he will win the 54 electoral votes of California in the general
election. No Democratic nominee can be elected president without
winning California. 

<P>
Therefore, the nomination of Pete Wilson is
as close to a guarantee as you can get that Republicans   will-for
the first time in 44 years-control both houses of the Congress
and the White House. 

<P>If that happens, well then, as Ronald Reagan
once said: &quot;You ain't seen nothin' yet.&quot;

August 8, 1996</i><br><p>
<h2>WORLD HERITAGE AREAS</h2>

<i>Did you know that the United Nations has sovereign control over 
Yellowstone Park? That's right, the UN, for all practical purposes, owns 
Yellowstone National Park!</i>
<p>
World-famous Yellowstone Park in Montana was visited by UN officials 
last fall, but they weren't there on vacation! Tom Deweese of the 
American Policy Center reports that these internationalist bureaucrats 
were "inspecting a site for a proposed gold mine . . . located on property 
outside of the Yellowstone National Park boundaries." In a recent issue of 
his group's newsletter, called Insider's Report, Deweese revealed what 
these world-governing wannabes were up to. "Radical environmentalists 
who oppose the mine development deliberately brought the UN into the 
debate in an attempt to stop it," he explained. "The decision of the UN 
site inspectors will determine if the mine may be developed. Their 
decision will end the debate."<p>

You heard correctly. This isn't some paranoid, futuristic fantasy. It's real, 
and it's happening right now. The UN is deciding whether or not 
American citizens have the right to put their own property to productive 
use. "What does the United Nations have to do with determining how 
land is used inside United States territory?" you ask. Deweese provides 
the shocking answer. "The United Nations," he says, "has sovereign 
control of Yellowstone Park."<p>

According to Deweese, radical environmentalists "invoked a little known 
treaty called the World Heritage Convention in order to involve the 
United Nations in an internal United States dispute. Jimmy Carter, in 
1978, signed the treaty and thereby designated Yellowstone a World 
Heritage Site. Now the United Nations has ultimate say in what happens 
to the park." Though not on park land, the site of the proposed mine 
happens to fall into the treaty-mandated "buffer zone."<p>

"There are several more World Heritage Sites within U.S. borders," 
observes Deweese. And, if you're not scandalized already, you will be, 
when you hear what two of them are: the Statue of Liberty in New York 
harbor and Independence Hall in Philadelphia! "That's right," says 
Deweese; "the United Nations controls the spot where America's 
Founding Fathers created our nation." In other words, authority over the 
two most famous symbols of our freedom has been ceded to an 
organization that seeks to destroy that freedom.<p>

"The World Heritage Convention is just one of a series of treaties that the 
United States has signed in the past few decades that grant control to the 
United Nations over U.S. law," Deweese points out. "Most of these 
treaties now have programs already in place to grab U.S. soil. And son e 
of these programs are much worse than just taking our nation's 
landmarks. Some have targeted all of the private property in the nation. 
That means your home." Perhaps the worst offender is the UN 
Convention on Biological Diversity, which, Tom Deweese charges, "lays 
down the plans for a 'reversal' of the process of civilization, ultimately 
overseeing the herding of people into pre-selected, isolated enclaves, 
while the rest of America becomes vast wilderness."<p>

<title>Duplantier: Holding Criminals Responsible --5/21/96 </title>

<h2>Holding Criminals Responsible</h2>
<blockquote><i>

Noted criminologists say it's time to quit finding excuses for the   
behavior of criminals and start holding them responsible for their   
actions.  </i></blockquote><P>
  
The criminal shares certain personality traits in common with the   
psychopath, says Robert James Bidinotto, editor of a book called   
"Criminal Justice: The Legal System vs. Individual Responsibility."   
Those common characteristics include: "a short-range, self-indulgent   
outlook on life; a lack of any sense of self-responsibility; the desire to   
manipulate and dominate others through chronic deception and force;   
and the ability to shut off his conscience at will." Treating a person who   
exhibits those traits as though he were a responsible citizen is a grave   
error, and yet, that's exactly what our criminal justice system does.  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Whether that assumption is warranted in a particular 
Bidinotto asserts that the criminal justice system has been captured by   
"intellectuals in the social science establishment," who have convinced   
themselves -- without any evidence whatsoever -- that the criminal is not   
responsible for his own actions, but that society is somehow to blame.   
This "Excuse-Making Industry," as Bidinotto calls it, has recklessly   
abandoned the punishment of criminals in favor of a fervently hoped-for,   
but ever-illusive rehabilitation. Needless to say, this change in policy has   
found favor with the self-indulgent, irresponsible, manipulative, and   
remorseless personalities who make up the criminal element.  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"For the last quarter-century, a network of anti-incarceration, pro-  
prisoner analysts, activists, lawyers, lobbyists, journalists, and judges has   
perpetuated a number of false ideas about crime and punishment in the   
United States," say criminologists Charles Logan and John DiIulio, two   
of the authors featured in the book "Criminal Justice." Logan and DiIulio   
argue that "the consequences of these false ideas have been quite tragic   
indeed," making it easier for criminals to indulge in crime, and   
concentrating crime "in economically distressed inner-city   
neighborhoods, inviting the criminal predators of these areas to   
repeatedly victimize their struggling underclass neighbors."  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"When a person commits a particularly sordid crime, his sanity may be   
questioned," but even the most violent criminal "is rational, calculating,   
and deliberate in his actions," observes clinical psychologist Stanton   
Samenow, in another chapter of the book "Criminal Justice." "Criminals   
know right from wrong," Samenow insists. "In fact, some know the laws   
better than their lawyers. But they believe that whatever they want to do   
at any given time is right for them. Their crimes require logic and self-  
control."  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Criminals are not "mentally ill," nor should they be excused as "victims   
of poverty, broken homes, racism, and a society that denies them   
opportunities," says Samenow. "Sociological explanations for crime,   
plausible as they may seem, are simplistic. If they were correct, we'd   
have far more criminals than we do. Criminals come from all kinds of   
families and neighborhoods. Most poor people are law-abiding, and most   
kids from broken homes are not delinquents. Children may bear the scars   
of neglect and deprivation for life, but most do not become criminals."

<h2>Filth on Film</h2></center><P>

["By the time the average child leaves elementary school, he will have 
witnessed 8,000 murders and i00, 000 other acts of violence on TV."]
<P>
"TV, if used for responsible purposes, can have a positive impact," says 
Focus on the Family research manager Robert Waliszewski. "Yet, 
positive television is only a small portion of what America is watching. 
For many, the 'education' received from televised programming can have 
a detrimental effect." Waliszewski cites a 1993 report by the American 
Psychological Association that declared emphatically that "higher levels 
of viewing violence on television are correlated with increased 
acceptance of aggressive attitudes and increased aggressive behavior." 
Surveys of prison inmates imprisoned for violent crimes reveal that as 
many as a third "reported having consciously imitated criminal 
techniques learned from television pro ,rams."
<P>
In a new report called Bringing Out the Worst in Us: The Frightening 
Truth About Violence, the Media, and Our Youth, Waliszewski argues 
that "television's preoccupation with sex, violence, and sexualized 
violence would have been unthinkable in the minds of its early pioneers," 
adding that "public sentiment would not have embraced the likes of The 
Playboy Channel, MTV, Spice, HBO and Showtime." But ugliness and 
depravity are pervasive on television today, and "TV talk shows are just 
the tip of the iceberg. With its offering of offensive sitcoms, cartoons, 
made-for-TV-movies, film releases and graphic news footage, television 
has sunk to new lows."
<P>
Waliszewski warns that "television transmits values that are opposite to 
those being taught at home," forcing children "to choose which message 
to believe." Alarming increases in juvenile delinquency rates would seem 
to suggest that television is winning the values battle. "TV receives the 
lion's share of a young person's attention -- and does so in their most 
impressionable years," says Waliszewski. "By the time the average 
American child graduates [from] high school, he or she will have spent 
nearly 20,000 hours in front of a television" -- nearly twice the amount of 
time spent in school.
<P>
Much of the trash on television is recycled garbage from Hollywood. 
Waliszewski laments the passing of the Production Code, which 
discouraged directors from giving in to their baser instincts. "Since the 
days of silent movies, the power of a motion picture, with its potential to 
negatively impact society, has not gone unnoticed. For that reason, 
industry pioneers drafted a self-regulatory code of ethics in 1930 that 
governed the content of movies," prohibiting films that undermined the 
sanctity of home and marriage, disparaged the clergy, blasphemed, or in 
any way lowered the standards of viewers. That code has long since been 
abandoned.
<P>
Waliszewski concedes that "films do not 'cause' anyone to commit 
destructive acts. However, they can, and do, shape the values of the 
watchers." He notes that films like Natural Born Killers and Menace II 
Society have encouraged numerous impressionable viewers to imitate the 
unspeakable violence they glorified. But the ill effects don't end there. 
"For many undetermined others, their values were molded -- causing a 
desensitization toward violence and a loss of respect for society's laws 
and lawkeepers."

 <i> September 10, 1996</i><p> 
 
<h2> Environmental Logic </h2><p>


<i>Protecting the- environment requires accurate information and sound reasoning When environmentalism degenerates into sentimentalism, it winds up doing more harm than good.</i><p>




Joseph Bast of the Heartland Institute charges that "the biggest barrier to improving environmental protection . . . is the environmental movement itself." Co-author of a new book called Eco-Sanity, A Common-Sense Guide to Environmentalism, Bast argues that "the lack of understanding and critical thinking on the part of most environmentalists has compromised the movement's ability to be an effective force for environmental protection. The popular wisdom on issue after issue," he contends, "bears little resemblance to what objective scientists have to say." As a result, "many environmentalists are wasting their energy -- and the dollars of consumers, businesses, and taxpayers -- fighting nonexistent problems or problems that already are being solved, while bigger problems go unnoticed."<p>

Bast offers a quick course in critical thinking. Lesson Number One: "Correlation is not causation," he says. "Just because two things happen at the same time doesn't mean one is causing the other. We need proof, including a reasonable theory showing the path by which one thing causes another to occur. Most environmental scares -including global warming, electromagnetic fields, and dioxin -- resulted when the correlation of two things was mistaken for causation."<p>

Lesson Number Two: "Not everything can be explained. The truth," says Bast, "is that the causes of most specific cases of cancer, miscarriage, and child deformity in the U.S. are unexplained." He points out that "the victims of these afflictions" are not necessarily "experts on the causes of their illnesses. A victim's guess is no more reliable, and may be less reliable, than the guesses of any other nonexpert."<p>

Lesson Number Three: "Trends can't predict the future. During the 1 970s, global temperatures fell several years in a row and [so-called] 'experts' . . . predicted a new ice age," recalls Bast. "During the 1980s, temperatures rose several years in a row and the 'experts' . . . predicted catastrophic global warming."<p>

Lesson Number Four: "We can never avoid risk completely. Everything we do carries with it some risk," says Bast. "There is no such thing as a product, decision, or action that carries no risk whatsoever. Keep in mind that the risks of drowning (16 in a million), or dying in an accident at home (90 in a million), or dying in an automobile accident (192 in a million) greatly exceed the alleged environmental risks being decried by some organizations."<p>

Last Lesson: "We have to make choices," says Joseph Bast, even when it comes to protecting the environment. "We have to choose among different ways to do it. We can't do everything, all at once, because trying to do so would be extremely wasteful, unnecessarily injure many people, and probably produce unintended consequences that harm the environment. Instead, we must apply the same prudence that we apply to other important parts of our lives. The importance of environmental issues doesn't somehow exempt them from this discipline. In fact, their importance makes careful planning and efficiency all the more necessary."<p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>





Algeria is engulfed in a bloody civil war that has claimed around 40,000 lives since January 1992. 
In that month the Algerian army seized power, ousted President Chadli Benjedid, and canceled 
parliamentary elections to avert a takeover by Islamic radicals, or "Islamists."  The provisional 
military government and the loose coalition of Islamists who seek its overthrow have fought to a 
standstill. It is gradually becoming clear that neither side is likely to score a decisive military 
victory. Unless this civil war is halted, Algeria will disintegrate into political chaos that could 
destabilize the entire region. But as bad as Algeria's situation is now, an Islamist victory would be 
even worse.
<p>
A radical Islamic victory in Algeria would pose significant long-term threats to U.S. interests in 
North Africa, the Middle East, and the Muslim world generally. The triumph of Muslim militance 
in Algeria, at a minimum, would embolden Islamists elsewhere in the Islamic world to redouble 
their revolutionary efforts, increase subversive pressures on pro-Western secular regimes, and 
encourage further opposition to the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations. In the worst case scenario, a 
radical Islamic Algeria could become another Iran -- a base for actively exporting anti-Western 
revolution, terrorism, and anarchy. 
<p>
The Clinton Administration has distanced itself from the beleaguered Algerian military regime and 
has established diplomatic contacts with the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), the umbrella group of 
radical Islamic organizations opposed to the secular regime. The President and his advisers believe 
this policy will lay the groundwork for a political settlement in Algeria. But FIS leaders increasingly 
have lost control over the ultra-radical guerrillas who do most of the fighting and adamantly reject 
compromise with the Algerian regime. It makes little sense to conduct a dialogue with leaders who 
cannot deliver a negotiated peace even if they wanted to do so. Moreover, reaching out to Algerian 
Islamic "moderates" is counterproductive because it undermines the ability of secular Arab regimes 
to resist the surge of militant Islam.
<p>
Supporters of the dialogue with the FIS argue that it will lead to better Algerian-American relations 
in the event that Islamic revolutionaries come to power. This dangerously wishful thinking flows 
from the false premise that Western powers can co-opt radical Muslim movements through 
negotiation, dialogue, and compromise, practices valued in democratic societies but not in radical 
Islam. Any Islamist leaders that come to power in Algeria after years of bloodshed inevitably will 
be virulently anti-Western. Their totalitarian ideology uncompromisingly rejects Western values, 
which are perceived to threaten the purity of Islam, and is hostile to Western interests. Moreover, 
the political dynamics of revolutionary struggle favor militants at the expense of moderates, who 
tend to become increasingly irrelevant as political violence intensifies.
<p>
The Clinton Administration appears to be making the same mistakes in Algeria that the Carter 
Administration made in Iran. By reaching out to Islamic revolutionaries and undertaking a political 
dialogue, the Administration puts American national interests at risk and loses credibility with 
nervous allies battling their own Islamists. The Carter Administration's over-eager courting of Iran's 
revolutionary provisional government backfired in November 1979, when Iranian radicals seized 
American diplomats as hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. The Clinton Administration's 
courtship of Algeria's FIS is even more misguided because it could help boost Algerian Islamists to 
power by demoralizing the embattled military regime in Algiers.
<p>
The United States has relatively little direct influence over what happens in Algeria in the coming 
months. What little leverage it has should be used to help block the rise of Islamists hostile to 
American values and interests, not to ease their path to power. The sad truth is that any power-
sharing arrangement between the regime and the Islamic opposition would be the first step toward a 
complete victory for the Islamists.
<p>
Instead of seeking to ingratiate itself with FIS "moderates" who are likely to be squeezed out of 
power and discarded by their more radical rivals if Islamists take power, the U.S. should:
<P><ul>
<li> Break diplomatic contacts with the FIS. These contacts risk undermining the Algerian 
government with no real benefits for the U.S.
<p>
<li> Halt efforts to pressure the Algiers regime into a suicidal power-sharing arrangement. Power-
sharing would only be a prelude to an Islamist takeover. 
<p>
<li> Cooperate with France and other allies to help buy time for the regime. Washington should help 
Algeria reschedule its heavy debt burden, although it cannot afford to give direct economic aid.
<p>
<li> Seek to deprive Algerian Islamists of external support. The U.S. needs to increase economic and 
diplomatic pressures on Iran and Sudan, which aid Algerian Islamists, and cooperate with European 
allies to reduce the flow of arms and money from Algerian expatriates in Europe.
<p>
<li> Prevent future Algerias. There is little the U.S. can do in concrete terms to solve Algeria's 
immediate crisis. The Algerian government has been a repressive failure, but the Islamist 
alternative would be worse. The U.S. should encourage the Algiers regime to adopt free-market 
economic reforms and cautious democratic reforms, although this will be difficult while the regime 
is fighting for survival. The U.S. is likely to have more success encouraging long-term political, 
economic, and educational reforms that can help other secular Arab regimes avoid Algeria's 
mistakes.
</ul><P>


<B>ALGERIA'S POLITICAL BREAKDOWN</b><P>

Algeria's plunge into civil strife was precipitated by three intertwined crises -- economic, social, and 
political -- that undermined the legitimacy of the ruling National Liberation Front (FLN) regime. 
The FLN had spearheaded Algeria's bloody eight-year war for independence and dominated Algeria 
for 30 years after it won independence from France in 1962. Although it enjoyed considerable 
prestige based on this success, it squandered its popular support by building a one-party socialist 
state that badly mismanaged Algeria's deepening economic, social, and political problems.
<p>
The FLN nationalized large portions of the economy and built a Soviet-style command economy. It 
undertook an overly ambitious industrialization program that led to the development of swollen, 
inefficient state enterprises. The regime collectivized Algeria's thriving agricultural sector and 
experimented with "socialist villages" designed ostensibly to develop the economy and modernize 
society. The burgeoning state bureaucracy grew increasingly corrupt and inefficient. The 
mismanaged socialist economy was kept afloat by Algeria's oil and gas revenues, but the 1985-1986 
fall in energy prices dealt a body blow to the economy, reducing oil revenues from $12.5 billion in 
1985 to $8 billion in 1986. Rather than institute free-market economic reforms to revive the 
economy, the FLN regime borrowed heavily abroad. By the early 1990s, Algiers was forced to 
expend most of its oil and gas income -- roughly $8 billion to $9 billion per year -- just to finance 
its mushrooming $26 billion external debt. 
<p>
This economic crisis exacerbated a fundamental social crisis posed by rapid population growth and 
declining living standards. Algeria's population surged from 10 million in 1962 to its current level 
of 28.5 million (and continues to grow at the rapid rate of about 3 percent per year).   Peasants 
uprooted from the countryside, in part because of the regime's mismanagement of agriculture, 
crowded into the coastal cities in search of scarce housing and jobs. Algerians grew profoundly 
disenchanted with the FLN's one-party rule and its inability to deal with such persistent problems as 
high unemployment (now estimated to run about 25 percent, but much higher for younger workers), 
chronic food shortages, overcrowded housing, rising prices, and an overburdened infrastructure. <p>
The standard of living fell sharply following the 1985 decline in international oil prices, with 
private consumption per capita plummeting 18 percent between 1985 and 1992.  
<p>
Widespread discontent over the regime's mismanagement of the economy and resentment of the 
socialist pretensions of the ruling elite boiled over into anti-FLN riots that swept many Algerian 
cities in October 1988. Although they began as a spontaneous protest in a working class 
neighborhood in Algiers against austerity measures imposed by the regime, the mass 
demonstrations subsequently took on an Islamist cast and spread from the capital to other cities. 
The army was deployed to halt attacks on government buildings, state enterprises, and FLN 
political offices. Roughly 500 people were killed and $250 million in damage was inflicted on 
government facilities before the riots were suppressed after five days of bloodshed. 
<p>
Stunned by the scope of the political violence, President Benjedid undertook a series of reforms to 
open up the political system and defuse opposition. A new constitution was approved by national 
referendum in February 1989, and the parliament approved the transition to a multi-party system in 
July 1989. The chief political challenge to the FLN came from the FIS, formed in March 1989 as a 
coalition of more than 20 Islamist groups dedicated to creating an Islamic state ruled by the Sharia, 
Islam's sacred law. The FIS quickly mobilized a mass following, drawing its strongest support from 
the urban poor and Algerian youths who sought a sense of purpose and identity in a society that 
presented them with a bleak future of diminishing opportunities. The FIS got a head start over other 
opposition parties because it enjoyed an informal support network in the mosques and was 
bolstered by heavy funding from Islamists in Saudi Arabia and other oil-rich Persian Gulf emirates.
<p>
The FIS also profited from the miscalculations of President Benjedid, who greatly underestimated 
its strength. Despite the fact that a July 1989 law banned political parties based on "sectarian 
practice" and "intolerance," the government recognized the FIS as a legal party in September 1989. 
Benjedid may have hoped to use the growing challenge posed by the FIS to offset FLN hard-liners 
opposed to his reform program. Or he may have allowed the FIS to operate openly in a 
Machiavellian attempt to scare voters into supporting the FLN. 
<p>
Benjedid's approach clearly backfired. In the June 1990 municipal and district elections, the first 
free elections since Algeria gained independence, the FIS decisively defeated the FLN, winning 54 
percent of the popular vote to the FLN's 28 percent. Although the Islamists won control of 850 of 
Algeria's more than 1,500 municipalities, this vote was not an accurate barometer of their true 
strength. The FIS benefited from a boycott of the elections by several secular parties that led 38 
percent of the electorate to abstain from voting. Others cast ballots for the FIS as a protest vote 
against the FLN.  
<p>
Despite this electoral setback, Benjedid pressed ahead with his plans to move rapidly toward multi-
party legislative elections to restore the FLN's shattered political legitimacy. He unwisely designed 
a winner-take-all electoral system that would magnify the number of parliamentary seats awarded to 
the leading political party, perhaps assuming that the pre-election gerrymandering of electoral 
districts would guarantee an FLN victory. For its part, the FIS became increasingly aggressive in 
politically attacking the regime, organizing civil disobedience, calling for general strikes, and 
appealing to army officers to rebel against the FLN regime. The June 1991 elections were 
postponed when violent political protests erupted over the FLN-engineered electoral reforms. 
Martial law was declared and thousands of Islamists were arrested. Despite this, the FIS was 
allowed to participate in the legislative elections, rescheduled to take place in two rounds of voting 
in December 1991 and January 1992. 
<p>
The first round resulted in an FIS landslide. Although the FIS actually received 1 million fewer 
votes than it had at the peak of its popularity in the June 1990 municipal elections, the misguided 
electoral reforms magnified its victory.   The FIS gained 188 of the 230 seats contested in the first 
round, eclipsing the FLN, which picked up only 15 seats. The non-Islamist vote was severely 
fragmented, and many voters opted for the FIS rather than their preferred parties because they 
feared their vote might be wasted under the winner-take-all system. Shocked by the size of the 
Islamists' political victory and suspecting that President Benjedid had cut a deal with the FIS, the 
army ousted Benjedid on January 11, 1992, canceled the elections, banned the FIS, and set up a 
transitional authority, the five-man High State Council (HCS).

<p>
<b>SPIRALING POLITICAL VIOLENCE
</b><P>
Although many Algerians were relieved that the army had stepped in to block an Islamist takeover, 
the new regime lacked a solid base of support. To remedy this, the HCS chose Mohammed 
Boudiaf, an unblemished hero of the revolution against the French who had opted for self-exile, as 
the new prime minister. Boudiaf led a crackdown against the Islamists, who had gone underground 
and had begun an escalating campaign of armed attacks against the regime. But Boudiaf also 
asserted his independence from the entrenched elite that had run Algeria for their own benefit and 
made clear his intention to root out corruption in the FLN-controlled state bureaucracies. Boudiaf 
was assassinated by one of his own bodyguards on June 29, 1992, possibly because he was regarded 
as a threat to hard-liners within the army and FLN.
<p>
The Islamist camp also was fractured by internal political rivalries and disputes. Once the FIS was 
forced underground, its unity partially dissolved, and radical splinter groups proliferated and grew 
stronger. The military wing of the FIS, the Islamic Salvation Army (AIS), has become increasingly 
independent of the political leadership, much of which is under arrest or in exile. Local guerrilla 
leaders, known as emirs, have waged largely autonomous struggles against the government, and 
unaffiliated groups have opportunistically engaged in rising levels of criminal activity.
<p>
In early 1992, militant Islamists formed the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), one of the most ruthless 
and violent Islamic revolutionary organizations in the world. Founded by Algerian veterans of the 
Islamic jihad (holy war) against the Soviet and Afghan communist forces in Afghanistan, the GIA 
adamantly opposes any negotiated settlement with the government and scorns the FIS for its 
willingness to consider a dialogue with the regime. While the AIS has focused its attacks on the 
regime, particularly on police and military personnel, the GIA has unleashed a fierce terrorist 
campaign against a broad array of civilian targets, including secular opposition leaders, journalists, 
artists, academics, and foreigners. 
<p>
The GIA has chosen such a wide variety of targets because it is fighting a cultural war, not just a 
political war. It seeks to impose its vision of pure Islam on Algerian society by violently eliminating 
Western cultural influences that it considers a threat to that vision. Because it fears that secular 
education "undermines the jihad" by "taming" Algeria's youth, the GIA has sabotaged or destroyed 
roughly 700 schools and murdered over 200 teachers.   It has assassinated intellectuals, particularly 
those that write in French, as symbols of the francophone elite that it wishes to destroy because of 
that elite's secular and "Westoxicated" values.   GIA and other fanatical Islamist terrorists have slit 
the throats of young school girls for not wearing veils that conform to their view of Islamic 
modesty. They have impaled the decapitated head of a hapless contractor on the satellite television 
antenna that he was installing, because in their eyes he was helping to spread the decadent values of 
Western culture. The GIA also has killed more than 100 Algerian religious leaders with whom it 
disagreed.  
<p>
GIA terrorism increasingly threatens foreigners as well as Algerians. More than 90 foreign 
expatriates have been assassinated in Algeria since the GIA issued an ultimatum for foreigners to 
flee the country in September 1993 in an effort to undermine the regime. The GIA also has exported 
its indiscriminate brand of terrorism in an effort to deprive the Algiers regime of foreign support. 
Four GIA terrorists hijacked an Air France passenger jet on December 24, 1994, and planned to 
crash it into the streets of Paris on Christmas day. Fortunately, French commandos stormed the 
plane while it was refueling in Marseilles and killed the terrorists before they could deliver their 
gruesome Christmas offering.   The GIA on October 7, 1995, also admitted responsibility for a 
series of eight terrorist attacks in France that had killed eight people and wounded 130 since July.  
 On October 17, it struck again, setting off a bomb on a crowded Paris commuter train and 
wounding 29 people. 
<p>
The GIA's terrorist tactics, particularly its use of massive car bombs and kidnappings, are similar to 
those of Hezbollah (Party of God), the pro-Iranian Lebanese Islamist group. This is not surprising, 
since the GIA is believed to enjoy clandestine support from Iran and has dispatched representatives 
to meet with Hezbollah leaders and with Iran's Minister for Intelligence, Ali Fallahian, who 
oversees much of Iran's terrorist and subversive operations.   U.S. officials maintain that Sudan 
also assists Algerian Islamists by allowing Iran to use Sudanese territory as a transit point for arms 
and ammunition smuggled through Chad and Niger to Algeria.   The Algerian government broke 
relations with Iran and Sudan in 1993, charging that both Islamic regimes supported Algerian 
terrorists. 
<p>

<b>CURRENT STALEMATE AND GRIM FUTURE
</b><p>
There is no end in sight to the killing, which has claimed an estimated 40,000 lives since January 
1992. As the conflict has intensified, both the Islamists and government security forces have 
become more indiscriminate in their use of force, leaving many Algerians fearful and resentful of 
both sides. The army controls the urban centers, large towns, and oil and gas facilities, but central 
authority is gradually crumbling. Islamists, increasingly dominated by the GIA, control wide areas 
of the countryside, many villages, and poor neighborhoods in many cities. Even the most secure 
bastions of government supporters are subject to terrorist attacks.
<p>
The government's security forces are stretched thin, battling against roughly 20,000 insurgents who 
are assisted by extensive support networks.   The military employs about one-third of its 155,000 
forces against the Islamists. It prefers to deploy only professional military units, because many of its 
conscripts have defected to the rebels. Senior officers are said to distrust young officers with the 
rank of captain or lower.   The regime relies on a paramilitary gendarmerie of roughly 30,000 and 
the police to perform most internal security tasks. By one estimate, it can rely on about 63,000 men 
for security operations but can raise this to about 90,000 in a crisis for a short period of time.   The 
government also announced in March 1995 that it will organize and arm up to 50,000 men in local 
militias. Such militias are likely to be unreliable, except perhaps in the mountain strongholds of 
Algeria's Berber minority, which generally is secular and hostile to Islamist doctrines.
<p>
The Islamists have had some success infiltrating the security forces and assassinating key 
government officials. In March 1994, they attacked a prison, allegedly with inside help, and freed 
more than 900 prisoners. But the GIA and other groups also have been penetrated by government 
intelligence services. This has allowed the internal security forces to target the commanders of the 
revolutionary Islamic forces, killing several of them. In March 1995, the army struck a devastating 
blow against the GIA, ambushing roughly 900 guerrillas and killing hundreds of them in a running 
battle that lasted several days in the rugged Ain Defla region, 90 miles west of Algiers.  
<p>
The government claims that it now has the upper hand in the fighting, but this remains to be seen. 
Hundreds of Algerians continue to die each week, but there is little chance the army can score a 
military knockout with the Islamists so well entrenched throughout Algeria. It is more likely that a 
bloody stalemate has set in, with both sides too exhausted to win a decisive victory. While the 
regime commands little enthusiastic support, it has the passive acceptance of most of the 
population. Moreover, the GIA's terrorist excesses have tarnished the appeal of the Islamists and 
provoked a backlash. More young men now appear to be defecting from the insurgents than from 
the army. 
<p>
The military regime tentatively has sought a political resolution to Algeria's predicament, but has 
found no acceptable interlocutors willing and able to halt the bloodshed. In October 1993, it created 
a Commission for National Dialogue, which sought to prepare the way for elections. The political 
parties declined to participate, ostensibly because they did not wish to "legitimize" the regime. But 
opposition parties also have been intimidated by ruthless terrorist attacks by the GIA, which rejects 
any form of compromise with the regime.   The High Security Council appointed Liamine Zeroual, 
a proponent of dialogue, as President on January 31, 1994. General Zeroual, a career military man 
and devout Muslim who had resigned from the army in 1988 to protest the harsh repression of the 
October 1988 riots, had been persuaded to return as Defense Minister in July 1993. Zeroual had 
engaged in secret contacts with imprisoned FIS leaders before becoming President and quickly 
made it clear that he was prepared for political dialogue with all political factions, including the 
FIS.  
<p>
Throughout most of 1994, the two top FIS leaders, Abassi Madani and Ali Belhaj, who had been 
imprisoned since July 1991, refused to enter political negotiations with the regime unless all FIS 
prisoners were released and Zeroual agreed to immediate elections. They relented and agreed to 
start discussions in September 1994 when promised unhindered contact with other FIS leaders. The 
two were moved from prison to a loose form of house arrest, but little came of the talks. The FIS 
leaders, apparently perceiving Zeroual's gesture as a sign of weakness, demanded a purge of the 
army and refused to call for an end to the violence. The talks had broken down by late October.
<p>
Opposition leaders briefly revived hopes for a fruitful political dialogue when they met in Rome, 
Italy, in January 1995 under the auspices of Sant' Egidio, a Catholic lay group. In Rome, eight 
prominent opposition politicians representing the major political parties, principally the banned FIS, 
the FLN, and the Socialist Forces Front (FFS), agreed to a "national contract" that set conditions 
under which talks with the regime could begin. They called for the regime to recognize the FIS as a 
political party, release its leaders, and proceed with multi-party elections. Significantly, the 
"contract" did not require the FIS to commit itself unequivocally to democracy. The FIS made its 
commitment contingent on "the framework provided by our religion," a vague formulation that can 
be interpreted any way the Islamists see fit. The Zeroual regime understandably rejected the Sant' 
Egidio declaration, which also was denounced by the fanatical GIA and the increasingly militant 
AIS. 
<p>
Nevertheless, Zeroual maintained contact with the imprisoned FIS leaders, Madani and Belhaj, 
through a presidential adviser. These contacts finally were broken off in July 1995, with each side 
accusing the other of bad faith. The Algiers regime now is pressing ahead to hold presidential 
elections on November 16, despite the refusal of the major opposition parties to participate.
<p>

<b>U.S. INTERESTS AND ALGERIA
</b><P>
The military regime fighting for survival in Algiers is not a pro-Western ally. Since independence 
in 1962, Algeria has been ruled by radical Arab nationalists who have imposed Soviet-style 
economic policies and supported anti-Western liberation movements while staking out a claim to 
leadership of the nonaligned movement. Since the Algerian government was not aligned with the 
West in the Cold War, Washington has no moral obligation to align itself with the regime clinging 
to power in Algiers today. <p>

 But Washington does have a major stake in the outcome of the struggle inside Algeria. This is 
because the triumph of Islamic revolutionaries in Algeria, the largest state in North Africa, will 
have strong and lasting impact on the region, the Arab world, and radical Islamic movements 
throughout the Muslim world. A successful Algerian Islamic revolution probably would have a 
greater effect on the Middle East than the 1979 Iranian revolution. Unlike Iran, Algeria is 
predominantly an Arab nation, and its people are Sunni (orthodox) Muslims, not members of the 
smaller Shiite branch of Islam. This closer cultural affinity and Algeria's revolutionary history 
would give Algerian Islamists an entree into other Arab societies that Iranians do not enjoy.
<p>
Specifically, a revolutionary Algeria would undermine U.S. interests by posing a threat to:
<p><ul>
<li>Pro-Western Arab secular regimes. An Islamist regime is likely to provide sanctuary, training, arms, 
advice, and moral, political, and material support to Islamist movements elsewhere in the region. 
The Algerian "Afghanis" already have established links with a wide variety of other Islamists, both 
during the war in Afghanistan and in training camps in Pakistan and Sudan. Exiled FIS leaders have 
made contact with a wide array of Islamic radicals in Europe. Even if the Algerians should neglect 
to support their counterparts in other countries (an unlikely prospect), their success will embolden 
other Islamic revolutionaries, providing a psychological boost to those who will see it as a 
vindication of Islamism and a harbinger of things to come in their own countries. 
<P>
<li>The countries most strongly threatened would be Algeria's neighbors, Tunisia and Morocco. Both 
already have suffered terrorist attacks at the hands of Algerian Islamists.   Egypt, which has 
managed to survive an upsurge of Islamist terrorism since 1992, also would face the possibility of 
Algerian aid to Egyptian Islamists channeled through Sudan. All of these governments have a 
strong hold on power and enjoy considerable popular support. They are by no means dominoes to 
be toppled easily. But the spillover effects of Islamic revolution in Algeria will exercise a long-term 
destabilizing influence in the region that harms U.S. allies and gratifies anti-Western forces.
<P>
<li>Containment of international terrorism. The triumph of Islamic revolution in Algeria will be a 
victory for ruthless and indiscriminate terrorism. Not only are other Islamists likely to imitate the 
tactics and strategy of Algeria's GIA, but Algeria's new rulers -- if they should win -- are unlikely to 
discard terrorism as an instrument of policy. Islamic Algeria, like Iran, Sudan, and Afghanistan 
before it, is likely to become a haven and base for Islamist terrorist groups. 
<P>
<li>Arab-Israeli peace negotiations. The Algerian revolution is likely to electrify disgruntled 
Palestinians and help strengthen the appeal of Islamist groups such as Hamas and the Palestinian 
Islamic Jihad. Algeria's Islamists vehemently reject any compromise with Israel and would 
cooperate with Iran, Sudan, and Palestinian Islamists to block a permanent settlement. The 
galvanizing effect of Algeria's revolution also would limit the degree to which cautious secular 
Arab regimes could take risks to support further peace efforts.
<P>
<li>Nonproliferation efforts. U.S. intelligence agencies in January 1991 discovered a nuclear research 
reactor that Algeria was building secretly with Chinese assistance. It is believed to be part of a 
clandestine nuclear weapons program.   After it was discovered, the Benjedid government 
announced that Algeria would sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which it did in January 
1995, probably to help ensure continued Western support. But signing the treaty and accepting the 
accompanying inspection regime of the International Atomic Energy Agency cannot guarantee that 
the present regime or a future regime will abstain from developing a nuclear weapon. Saddam 
Hussein's nuclear efforts demonstrated how easy it is to get around IAEA "safeguards."  A nuclear-
armed revolutionary Islamic Algeria, just 200 miles from Europe's southern shores, is a chilling 
possibility that would pose a critical threat to NATO allies, regional friends, and American forces in 
the Mediterranean basin. Moreover, an Islamist regime in Algiers might consider sharing nuclear 
technology or materials with Iran, Sudan, or radical Islamic terrorist groups. 
<P>
<li>Western access to energy. Algeria has the fifth largest reserves of natural gas in the world and ranks 
14th in oil. It is a major energy exporter, the third largest source of the European Community's 
natural gas imports. Its importance is likely to grow when the Europe-Maghreb gas line, scheduled 
to be completed in 1996, links Algeria to Spain via Morocco. Although any regime that comes to 
power in Algiers will have an interest in continuing energy exports to maximize export income, 
Islamic revolutionaries will be prone to subversive and terrorist activities that are likely to disrupt 
the operations of the pipeline through Morocco or the Transmed pipeline bringing Algerian gas to 
Italy via Tunisia. Support for international terrorism also could trigger international economic 
sanctions that would disrupt the flow of Algerian gas to Western markets. Algerian support for 
Saudi Islamists, who provided FIS with considerable financial support,  would increase the risk of 
destabilization in Saudi Arabia, which in turn could disrupt the flow of Saudi oil exports and push 
up world oil prices.
<P>
<li>Human rights. Although the Algerian military regime has abused human rights in its desperate 
struggle against Islamist terrorists, these abuses are dwarfed by the ruthless and indiscriminate 
campaign of terrorism and intimidation unleashed by the Islamists. For example, secular women 
have been a favorite target of Islamic extremists, who have imposed "temporary marriages" -- rape 
-- on those they despise. If the Islamists seize power, Algeria's human rights situation is sure to 
worsen as they seek vengeance on the supporters of the current regime and struggle for power 
among themselves.
</ul>
<P>Given the grave threats that a revolutionary Islamic regime would pose to American foreign policy 
goals and security interests, the overriding U.S. goal in Algeria should be to prevent an Islamist 
takeover. Yet current U.S. policy is to ease Algeria's transition to "democracy" by including the FIS 
in a power-sharing arrangement that leads to national reconciliation. <P>
This is wishful thinking that 
dangerously undermines U.S. interests by making it easier, not more difficult, for Islamists to seize 
power in Algeria.

<P>
<b>U.S. POLICY TOWARD ALGERIA
</b><P>
The Clinton Administration has shunned high-level diplomatic contacts with the Zeroual 
government, concerned that such contacts will be interpreted by the Islamists as unconditional 
support for the regime. No senior U.S. official has visited Algiers since 1992. Moreover, American 
diplomats began discreet talks with Anwar Haddam, a high-level FIS representative based in 
Washington, in late 1993. The ostensible purpose of these talks is to pull the FIS into a political 
dialogue with the regime that will lead to a political settlement. But such a dialogue is doomed 
unless the FIS disavows terrorism -- in which case it will be attacked by the GIA and other 
militants. 
<p>
The Administration's policy is based on a number of questionable assumptions:<p><ul>
<li>That the FIS is willing and able to halt terrorism.
<P>
<li>That the FIS is willing to play by the rules of democratic politics.
<P>
<li>That the regime is willing to accept a suicidal power-sharing agreement.</ul><P>

None of these assumptions is realistic. The Administration's policy therefore is understood more 
properly as an insurance policy that it hopes will improve the chances of good relations with the FIS 
if and when it comes to power. Advocates of a dialogue with the FIS hope to prevent the U.S. from 
becoming the "Great Satan" in Algerian eyes, as it did in the eyes of Iranian Islamists. But this 
effort to placate Islamic revolutionaries is doomed to failure. Algerian Islamists already are 
convinced of U.S. perfidy by virtue of their ideology. They hate America as much for its culture, 
which they believe promotes corruption and decadence in their own societies, as they do for its 
policies. Years of bloody struggle are not likely to dilute their hostility, particularly if they are 
successful in shooting their way to power. 
<P>
The Clinton Administration would do well to remember that it was the Carter Administration's 
attempt to stage a rapprochement with the provisional Iranian government that triggered the biggest 
explosion in U.S.-Iranian relations, the 444-day hostage crisis of 1979-1981. Islamic militants 
seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in large part to discredit the provisional government of Prime 
Minister Mehdi Bazargan and preclude the normalization of
Iranian-American relations.   Radical fears of Iran-U.S. rapprochement were fed by a November 1, 
1979, meeting in Algiers between Bazargan, Iranian Foreign Minister Ibrahim Yazdi, and Carter 
National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski. The Carter Administration's well-intentioned 
dialogue with Iranian moderates ultimately benefited Iranian hard-liners, who used it to oust 
Bazargan and poison U.S.-Iranian relations. The Reagan Administration also suffered a major 
policy setback when it tried to cultivate Iranian "moderates" to secure the release of American 
hostages held in Lebanon. 
<P>
 The Clinton Administration should halt its risky efforts to cultivate Algerian moderates. If they 
truly are moderates, the political dynamics of revolutionary struggle increasingly will marginalize 
them and limit their usefulness to the U.S. Furthermore, an American embrace actually could 
accelerate their demise by helping hard-liners in the GIA or in the FIS itself to discredit them. 
<p>
The U.S. should work to combat and contain Islamists, not to tame them -- a risky course that 
cannot be accomplished with any certainty. The Clinton Administration therefore should:
<p><ul>
<li> Break diplomatic contacts with the FIS. American diplomatic talks with Algeria's Islamists 
undercut the Zeroual regime by suggesting that Washington is hedging its bets and working to 
establish good relations with the prospective victor in the bloody civil war. This eventually could 
undermine confidence in the regime and encourage defections. Diplomatic talks also confer a form 
of legitimacy that strengthens the Islamists' sense of manifest destiny and confirms their belief in 
Western weakness.   While breaking contacts with the FIS and tilting toward the Zeroual regime 
may increase the risk of Algerian terrorist attacks on U.S. targets, continuing a dialogue is no 
guarantee against such attacks. In any event, the U.S. must take every precaution to improve 
security against terrorism.  
<p>
<li> Halt efforts to pressure the Algiers regime into a suicidal power-sharing arrangement. Given the 
brutality of the ongoing low-intensity war, it is unrealistic to expect the combatants to agree to 
genuine power-sharing arrangements. Power-sharing has become a euphemism for gradual Islamic 
takeover. Once placed in government positions, the Islamists would quickly consolidate their power 
and infiltrate the internal security forces. The military regime knows this and will not accept such a 
disguised form of surrender. Rather than publicly pressure the regime to negotiate with Islamists, 
which only undermines the regime and strengthens the Islamists, the U.S. should privately urge the 
regime to broaden its political base. The U.S. also should make it clear that it advocates political 
dialogue with the secular opposition parties, not the Islamists. Washington should resist the 
temptation to meddle in Algerian politics in a vain effort to ingratiate itself with the Islamists. Such 
appeasement will only make things worse by feeding the Islamists' sense of power and disdain for 
the weak-willed West. It would be a tragedy if the U.S. helped Islamists win through negotiations 
what they are incapable of winning for themselves. 
<p>
<li> Cooperate with France and other allies to help buy time for the regime. France bolstered the 
Algiers regime with $1.2 billion of foreign aid last year and has taken the lead in lobbying the 
International Monetary Fund and the Paris Club of creditor governments to lower Algeria's heavy 
debt burden. The IMF provided a $1 billion standby credit in April 1994 for rescheduling its debt 
and a $1.8 billion loan in May 1995 to support its cautious free-market reforms. The Paris Club 
rescheduled $3.4 billion of debt in July 1994, which cut Algeria's debt service ratio from 75 percent 
in 1993 to 30 percent in 1995.  
<p>
The U.S. gives no economic aid to Algeria beyond $550 million in loans under the Commodity 
Credit Corporation program for imports of American agricultural commodities and $2 billion in 
loans guaranteed by the Export-Import Bank to U.S. corporations, primarily involving construction 
of the Europe-Maghreb gas pipeline. Given its shrinking foreign aid budget, Washington cannot 
afford to provide direct aid to Algeria. But it can and should cooperate with France to secure aid 
from international lending institutions such as the IMF and World Bank. Washington also should 
lobby Saudi Arabia and the other oil-rich Persian Gulf emirates to come to Algeria's aid. Finally, 
the U.S. should encourage Algeria to undertake free-market economic reforms that can fuel 
economic growth and create jobs that help alleviate Algeria's socioeconomic crisis. This will be 
especially difficult in the prevailing civil turmoil, but Algeria's long-term economic prospects 
depend on it. 
<p>
<li> Seek to deprive Algerian Islamists of external support. The FIS has strong grass roots that enable 
it to impose taxes on "liberated" territory and siphon aid from radicalized groups of Algerians living 
in exile in Europe, particularly in France. But the GIA also receives considerable aid from Iran and 
Sudan. The U.S. should seek to cut this aid by punishing Iran and Sudan on as many fronts as 
possible. Senator Alfonse D'Amato's proposed legislation to ban all U.S. trade with Iran and punish 
corporations that continue such trade, the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions Act of 1995, would be a 
step in the right direction. Washington also should press Saudi Arabia to crack down further on the 
financial support that wealthy Saudi Islamists have provided to Algerian Islamists. U.S. intelligence 
agencies should cooperate with their European counterparts to reduce the flow of money and arms 
to Algerian insurgents from Algerian expatriates in Europe.
<p>
<li> Prevent future Algerias. There is little Washington can do in the short run to defeat Islamic 
revolutionaries in Algeria. But in the long run, the U.S. can seek to prevent friendly secular regimes 
in other Arab countries from making the same mistakes that Algeria's FLN regime made. This 
means:
<ul>
<li> Encouraging free-market economic reforms that fuel economic growth and provide jobs and hope 
to the unemployed youth who serve as the vanguard of Islamic revolutions. 
<p>
<li> Encouraging the emergence of a European Union-Maghreb free-market area to bolster export-
driven job growth in North Africa.
<p>
<li> Encouraging the development of secular political parties that can give voice to political 
opposition and keep Islamists based in mosques from attaining a monopoly over political protest.
<p>
<li> Taking a go-slow approach to democratization. The U.S. should stress the building of civil 
society and pluralism, not just holding elections. Algeria's rush to elections gave the Islamists an 
advantage over other political movements that were not as organized or prepared.
<p>
<li> Paying more attention to the education of the young. Islamists gained a solid foothold in Algeria 
in part because the Algerian government carelessly imported hundreds of Egyptian teachers who 
sympathized with the Muslim Brotherhood as part of its "Arabization" program in the 1970s. The 
U.S. should encourage North African states to duplicate the Tunisian model of education, which 
has greatly reduced the appeal of radical Islam among the young.
</ul></ul><P>

<b>CONCLUSION
</b><P>
Algeria's fate will be decided by Algerians. But the U.S. can and should apply the lessons it learned 
from its experience with Iran to avoid making Algeria's situation worse. Rather than try to appease 
Islamists, an approach that is doomed to failure, the U.S. should break off its dangerous flirtation. 
Islamic "moderates" are a mirage. They cannot be depended upon to restrain terrorism or deliver a 
political settlement. Washington should work to isolate the Islamists and help prevent them from 
seizing power, not facilitate a cosmetic power-sharing agreement that enables them to seize power. 
<p>
There is no short-term solution to Algeria's problems. The U.S. should focus instead on long-term 
political, economic, and educational reforms, as well as appropriate security measures, that can 
prevent future Algerias. If Islamists do seize power, the U.S. must work with France, Morocco, 
Tunisia, Egypt, and other interested countries to devise and implement a patient, firm, and 
concerted containment policy to prevent the spread of Islamic revolution from Algeria.

Gambling
</h2>

<i>"Roughly three-quarters of all Americans now gamble -- and they have 
an abundance of venues from which to try their luck. Presently 48 of the 
50 states allow one or more forms of legalized gambling."</i>
<p>
"More and more state governments have seized upon legalized gambling 
as a revenue-generating gold mine -- a voluntary tax willingly paid out by 
citizens enamored with visions of quick riches," says Robert Reno of 
Focus on the Family. "This development has reversed government's 
historic position as a gambling regulator. Instead, state governments are 
now pouring resources into promotion and marketing, attempting to 
induce citizens to gamble." Once hooked on the tamer forms of gaming, 
state governments soon lose their resistance to the more intense forms. "A 
state's initial foray into the gambling arena is frequently via a lottery," 
notes Reno. "After an initial flurry of activity, revenues from the lottery 
begin to decline. However, the state becomes increasingly dependent on 
gambling revenues, and therefore must offer other, more attractive, ways 
to entice citizens to part with their money." Reno points out that, "by 
introducing the lottery, government also expands the potential market for 
other gambling ventures." Research shows that "gambling participation 
rates increased sharply as states increased the number of forms of 
gambling allowed."
<p>
Politicians make a lot of extravagant promises to justify the legalization 
of gambling, but somehow the promises don't pan out. "Gambling 
proponents in government frequently justify their stance by noting that a 
significant portion of the proceeds are earmarked for education, public 
works, or other such projects intended to benefit communities," observes 
Robert Reno. "However, they often fail to mention both the unreliability 
of gambling as a revenue source . . . and the fact that diverting gambling 
funds to such projects often yields little, if any, net gain in funding for 
those projects."
<p>
Reno confirms that "the introduction of gambling on a widespread basis 
correlates with a marked increase in crime." For one thing, "gambling 
tends to attract a criminal element." For another, problem gamblers 
frequently "turn to crime to finance their involvement." Researcher 
Robert Reno notes that "one of the alleged benefits often cited by 
proponents of legalized gambling" is that it allows state governments to 
"undercut illegal gambling and thus hinder organized crime." Au 
contraire! "By enlarging the pool of bettors and, at the same time, 
reducing gambling's stigma," says Reno, "the state actually creates an 
increased market for illegal gambling activities."
<p>
Gambling is not the economic godsend the hucksters would have us 
believe. In fact, says Robert Reno, "the net economic effects are often 
negative." That's because "gambling-related jobs tend to be low-paying; 
other businesses suffer from the introduction of gambling; and gambling 
is associated with a host of costly social problems." What does gambling 
really offer? "A legacy of broken families and shattered lives," says 
Reno, "not to mention a price tag to society that runs into the billions of 
dollars. The government's present infatuation with and promotion of 
gambling," he concludes, "is unconscionable in light of the devastation."

<h2>Orphanages</h2>
<i><blockquote>
<P>
Orphanages filled a vital need in America for more than a   
hundred years -- until meddling do-gooders decided that   
these benevolent institutions were somehow inhumane! 
</I></Blockquote><P>

"In the colonial era small children without parents were taken   
in by relatives or cared for informally by neighbors; older   
children were indentured to a master who would teach them a   
trade," observes Marvin Olasky in the May issue of   
Philanthropy, Culture & Society, published by the Capital   
Research Center. "Apprenticeship bore no stigma since it was   
common to send a child at 13 or so into another person's   
home for training or education; all who had hands capable of   
work were expected to use them at an early age." As of 1800,   
there were no more than seven institutions in America for   
parentless children.  
  <p>
"The number of orphanages grew throughout the first half of   
the nineteenth century largely in connection with an   
outpouring of evangelical benevolence," says Olasky. "Every   
epidemic . . . created orphans and new orphanage efforts; by   
1850 there were between 71 and 77. Individual and church   
contributions paid most of the cost, but it was not-unusual to   
have -municipalities pay up to a third, and for expenses to be   
held down through some work by the orphans themselves.   
The Civil War greatly expanded demand for orphanages, and   
the supply skyrocketed to over 600 by 1880. Character as   
well as quantity changed, however," says Olasky, noting that   
"in the late 1800s children of destitute single parents   
increasingly found their way to orphanages."  
  <p>
What was life like in these institutions? "Orphanage directors   
during the second half of the nineteenth century saw their   
mission as not merely furnishing basic material needs but   
creating model American citizens," says Olasky. "They tried   
to instill virtues such as thrift, self-reliance, and sobriety, and   
to create a capacity for hard work; they believed in busy daily   
routines and strict discipline."  
  <p>
By 1910, there were more than 100,000 children in American   
orphanages. "The word 'orphanage' itself became a   
misnomer," says Olasky, "as children of parents who were   
still living but had problems with finances or alcohol found   
the institutions safer and better than life at home. Yet, even   
though the quality of care was evident to observers, reporting   
of orphanages started to turn negative in tone. Much of the   
criticism had an ideological tinge, portraying [these   
benevolent institutions] as materially satisfactory but   
psychologically inhumane."  
 <p> 
As often happens, yellow journalism set the stage for   
government intervention. "Two White House Conferences on   
the Care of Dependent Children, in 1909 and 1919, bent in an   
anti-orphanage direction," observes Olasky; they concluded   
that "single mothers were to receive financial aid so children   
could stay at home, and orphans or those completely   
abandoned should be placed in foster care." It was not long   
before states took over the task that orphanages had   
performed. Marvin Olasky argues that children were better   
off before the government started running their lives.

<h2>New-Contract With America</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
"How has a nation conceived in liberty and opposition to tyranny arrived    
at a point today where citizens are more fearful of their own government    
threatening their rights than they are of any other government?" A    
firebrand freshman Congressman answers his own question.  
</i></blockquote>
<P>     
"Americans deeply believe in the principles of America, but they don't    
see [those principles] reflected in their government," observes freshman    
Republican Representative Sam Brownback of Kansas in the March issue    
of Policy Review. ''Americans believe in freedom, democracy, moral    
values, family, community, and free markets," says Brownback. "Yet    
their government seizes their rights without their consent. Government    
has become their master, not their servant. " Brownback is a staunch    
proponent of the three R's: Reducing, Reforming, and Returning. He says    
we should reduce the size of the federal government, reform Congress,    
and return to "the basic values that built the country: work and family    
and the recognition of a higher moral authority."   
  <p>
In a frenzy of false compassion, our once-limited government "now tries    
to do all things for all people," Brownback observes, arguing that it fails miserably in this task. "We have discovered, by spending trillions of
dollars and taking rights and freedoms away from individuals, that    
government cannot solve all of our problems." The American people    
believe, and rightly so, that "they can handle most of their problems    
better than the federal government can."   
<p>   
If we return to our original principles of limited government, "then our    
nation, our economy, our liberties, and our social fiber will grow    
stronger than we have seen for a generation," predicts Brownback. The    
Congressman from Kansas contends that Americans must "look first to    
themselves and to each other for help," rather than rely on their elected 
representatives. He calls for the restoration of "the master-servant    
relationship between the people and the government," acknowledging    
that many of his colleagues need to be reminded that they hold the    
subordinate position. They also need to be reminded that the powers of    
the federal government are strictly limited by our Constitution.    
Observing that there is "no constitutional basis" for most of the federal 
government's current activities, Brownback argues that it is time to "re-   
limit our federal government so it can perform its proper functions well, 
and leave to the people and the states those functions which the federal    
government was never intended to perform."   
<p>   
Brownback calls for "a new Contract with America -- one that passes    
laws, not merely proposes them." Brownback's Contract would reduce    
federal spending "from 22 percent of our Gross Domestic Product to 15    
percent or less," restrict the tax code to the raising of revenue and    
"remove all social engineering" from it, cut the number of cabinet    
agencies from 14 to no more than nine "and restrict their regulatory    
powers under constitutional principles," require the citation of "precise  constitutional authority" for all proposed legislation, and eliminate all
government interference in private charity. Sounds like a pretty good    
contract. Where do we sign?

<h2>Real Men</h2></center><P> 
[Remember the good old days when men were the towers of strength and 
faithfulness we expected them to be?]
<P>
Tens of thousands of American males are trying to rediscover what it 
really means to be a man, and thousands of American women are rooting 
for them. Syndicated columnist Armstrong Williams reports that a group 
called Promise Keepers is "attracting men of all backgrounds to publicly 
declare their faith in God and acceptance of responsibility for leadership 
in their families and communities." Promise Keepers have filled football 
stadiums to demonstrate their determination to keep their marriage 
promises. What's behind it? Why is it happening now? Williams believes 
that, after three decades of experimentation it's become indisputably 
clear that the deconstruction of traditional gender roles by the feminist 
and the playboy movements has failed.
<P>
"After more than a quarter-century that saw the rise of feminism, gay 
rights, and societal approval of a variety of so-called 'alternative 
lifestyles,' we have come almost full circle," says Williams. "The results 
of our cultural experimentation -- high divorce and illegitimacy rates, 
rising crime and violence -- have forced us to take a second look. 
Perhaps the traditional male role as a leader of the family and 
community, should be restored."
<P>
There's little doubt about that, of course. The big question is, How many 
young American males can even remember what it means to be a real 
man? Not many, concludes Williams, who offers a refresher course. 
Being a real man means respecting "the institution of marriage" and 
being responsible for the children that you bring into the world. It means 
scrupulosity in word and deed. "A real man has no need for profanity 
[and] does not engage in public disorderliness or drunkenness. A real 
man accepts responsibility for his actions; he does not make excuses for 
his mistakes or failures. He learns from them and improves himself to 
ensure that they do not happen again."
<P>
A real man is always conscious of the impression he makes, knowing 
that he is "an example and role model for his own children and the 
children in his neighborhood." He is honest, bold, and resolute. "That 
means making a decision consistent with your principles and sticking to 
it," says Williams. "A real man knows that showing love is not a 
weakness, but a strength." He understands the difference between men 
and women, accepts it, celebrates it. At the risk of being denounced for 
his gallantry, he holds doors open for women and gives up his seat on 
the bus for them.
<P>
A man must have "integrity," says Armstrong Williams, and that means 
"holding on to your principles regardless of the circumstances." A lot of 
men need these lessons in manhood, Armstrong says, because Americans 
"have forgotten where we came from and so we don't know where we're 
going. Only by remembering how things once were will we be able to 
begin working to restore civility and virtue to our chaotic society." Three 
cheers for the Promise Keepers!
<p>                           <P>

<title>Duplantier: "Kinsey Part II" -- 6/03/96</title>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/duplbio.html">F.R. Duplantier</a><br>
June 11,1996<br><p></i>
<h2>Kinsey, Pt. II </h2>


<i><blockquote>
<P>
According to a videotape expose released by the Family   
Research Council in 1994, Alfred Kinsey's famous research   
on human sexuality was either fraudulent or based on   
"criminal experimentation on children funded by taxpayers. " 
</I></Blockquote><P>

A 30-minute documentary entitled The Children of Table 34   
charges that Kinsey incorporated into his research data from   
the rape of children and infants, that he used these records of   
perversion and criminality as the basis for his influential   
observations on normal childhood development, and that he   
not only concealed the full extent of his experiments but   
shielded the adults involved in them from criminal   
prosecution. 
<p>
In a booklet that accompanies the videotape,   
Robert Knight of the Family Research Council observes that   
Kinsey's 1948 report, Sexual Behavior in the Human Male,   
and his 1953 study, Sexual Behavior in the Human Female,   
"ignited a controversy over sexual morality that persists to   
this day. Both painted a picture of Americans of all ages   
awash in secret sexual experimentation." The philosophy of   
Kinsey and his cohorts "placed all sexual acts on the same   
moral, social, and biological level." The Kinsey Reports, says   
Knight, "provided the [seemingly] 'scientific' foundation for   
America's sexual revolution."  
  <p>
That foundation remained unchallenged until 1981, when Dr.   
Judith Reisman offered a critique of Kinsey's research at the   
Fifth World Congress of Sexology in Jerusalem. "She began   
asking questions that have yet to be answered," says Knight.   
"How did the Kinsey team obtain the data on children? Did   
parents give consent? Was there any follow-up on the   
recorded experiments? Where are the children now?"  
  <p>
Nearly 10 years later, Dr. Reisman attempted to answer some   
of these questions with a book called Kinsey, Sex and Fraud.   
The book, says Knight, "reveals shocking evidence that   
children were sexually abused by adults in the name of   
science." But that was just the beginning of the tragedy.   
Kinsey's bogus and/or criminal research became the basis for   
a burgeoning sex-education industry. "The Kinsey data are   
the sole source of child sexuality data, since no other   
researchers have been willing to risk criminal prosecution for   
reporting on or conducting systematic molestation of   
children," Knight explains. Kinsey's conclusions "have   
permeated America's educational institutions and are the   
major behavioral model on which sex education programs are   
designed for children."  
 <p> 
Today, sex education programs in schools across America   
"systematically strip children of sexual modesty, ridicule the   
idea of sexual restraint . . . and reduce parents' roles to that of   
consultants, not authorities in their children's lives. The   
[rationalization] for this radical departure from traditional   
sexual morality begins with the Kinsey Reports," says   
Knight. "Kinsey's work remains an underpinning for many   
ongoing federally-sponsored research programs," he adds,   
noting that a group with close ties to Kinsey, the Sex   
Information and Education Council of the United States   
(known as SIECUS), was chosen in 1994 "to evaluate sex   
education programs throughout the United States and to make   
recommendations to the federal government."

<title>U.N. Treaties to Limit U.S. Citizens' Rights -- Duplantier</title></head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center><h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES </h4>
<i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.<br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/duplbio.html">F.R. Duplantier</a> <br>
October 23, 1995 <br></i>
<hr>
<h2>U.N. Treaties to Limit U.S. Citizens' Rights</h2></center>
<P>

 
Despite their lofty rhetoric, the various treaties proposed by the United  
Nations would not give Americans any additional rights. What they  
would do is restrict or repeal many of the rights we already have, and  
Americans certainly don't want that! 
 <P>
A treaty is a solemn agreement between nations that is legally binding on  
the signatory governments, and on their peoples. U.S. diplomats have no  
business participating in the drafting of treaties that threaten our nation's  
sovereignty and the Constitutional rights of American citizens. U.S.  
Presidents have no business signing such treaties. And U.S. Senators  
have no business ratifying them. 
                <P>
It is incumbent upon anyone sworn to uphold our Constitution to be ever  
mindful of the impact a treaty may have on it and to examine such a  
potent document scrupulously, anticipating contrary constructions and  
adverse interpretations of ambiguous terms. The preservation of U.S.  
sovereignty and of the liberties of American citizens should be the  
primary concern at all times -- not the self-esteem of statesmen, or  
fearsome but fictitious "world opinion." Willfully jeopardizing the  
security of our country, whether in the interests of a foreign nation or as a  
prelude to world government, is treason plain and simple. 
                           <P>
Treaties pose far more of a hazard to the United States than to any other  
nation because of the preeminence of treaties in our system of  
government. Under the U.S. Constitution, laws passed by Congress must  
be "in pursuance" of the Constitution, but there is no such express  
limitation on treaties. In an address to the American Bar Association in  
1952, former Secretary of State John Foster Dulles acknowledged the  
grave danger inherent in treaty ratification. "Under our Constitution  
treaties become the supreme law of the land," he explained. "They are  
indeed more supreme than ordinary laws, for Congressional laws are  
invalid if they do not conform to the Constitution, whereas treaty laws  
can override the Constitution." 
                                    <P>
The various UN treaties, which internationalist pressure groups are  
constantly urging us to sign, have nothing to offer the American people.  
On the contrary, they pose serious threats to the blessings of liberty that  
we already enjoy. These treaties would supersede the U.S. Constitution  
that protects our rights, override our federal and state laws, and upset the  
balance of power unique to our federal system. They provide no real  
benefits to the citizens of other countries either, and the sacrifice of our  
own rights would not be justified even if they did. We would not be  
protected by the so-called Reservations and Statements of Understanding  
which could be attached. They serve only to acknowledge the many  
dangers in the treaties.   <P>
 
Any treaty that threatens the rights of Americans -- the rights our  
forefathers fought so hard for -- is a treaty we can do without. Nor do we  
advance the cause of human rights worldwide by diminishing our  
sovereignty. We serve that cause far better by concentrating on concerns  
closer to home and trying to set a noble example for others to follow. Let  
the tricksters have their treaties. America should perfect its own standard  
of human rights, and let other nations follow our lead.

<h2>Federal Government Supports Advocacy Groups</h2></center>
<P>


   

[The U.S. Government awards more than $39 billion a year in grants to 
advocacy groups that most Americans would not support, if given a 
choice. That's $39 billion of our money to promote ideas we don't agree with!]
<p>
The American Association of Retired Persons (known as AARP) 
received more than $73 million in taxpayer funds in a single year. The 
National Trust for Historic Preservation raked in $7 million. The AFL-
CIO and the American Bar Association each garnered more than $2 
million. Neither the lawyers lobby nor any other group is entitled to such handouts, but they obviously have no scruples about asking for them. 
<p>"The financial cost to the taxpayer is far higher than the amount 
funneled to these organizations," say Marshall Wittrnann and Charles 
Griffin of the Heritage Foundation. "Each one not only lobbies for its 
contract or grant but also advocates for bigger, more expensive social 
welfare programs."
<p>
Wittmann and Griffin have no objection to privately funded advocacy. "It 
is an entirely different matter, however, to employ the coercive power of 
the federal government to force taxpayers to finance organizations which 
lobby Congress or other government entities." This practice is an affront 
to Americans of all political persuasions. "It is ever bit as unjust to force 
liberal taxpayers to fund organizations on the right as it is to force 
conservative taxpayers to finance organizations on the left." say 
Wittmann and Griffin. Taxpayers should not be forced "to underwrite 
advocacy with which they disagree."
<p>
Wittmann and Griffin argue that taxpayer funding of advocacy 
organizations is wrong on at least three levels: "It is fiscally irresponsible 
to spend federal revenues on activities that provide no meaningful return 
to American people. It is morally wrong for the government to take sides 
in any public policy debate by assisting the advocacy activities of an elite 
few. And it is logically wrong for the government to fund activities that 
often result in lobbying for increased federal expenditures."
<p>
Our Founding Fathers took great pains to design a government that 
would discourage the growth of factions who seek to promote their own 
special interests without regard to the common good or the rights of 
other citizens. "Instead of restraining factions, however, the federal 
government today subsidizes them," say Wittmann and Griffin. "This 
distorts the political process by favoring one faction over another and by 
nourishing a network of special interests" committed to the growth of 
government.
<p>
Wittmann and Griffin call for "tougher laws" that would put an end to 
the subsidization of factions. They recommend that witnesses testifying 
before Congress "be required to divulge . . . whether they receive federal 
funds and, if so, for what purpose and in what amount." They insist that 
any organization receiving federal funds should be prohibited not only 
from lobbying, but also from maintaining "organizational ties to any 
entity that engages in lobbying activity." This, they say, is the only way 
to make sure that no American is "compelled to finance lobbying 
activities with which he disagrees."

<h2>Demise of the Home Economy
</h2>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>
The industrial revolution created material prosperity in America, but in 
the process it also destroyed the traditional household economy. Did we 
lose more than we gained?
</I></blockquote>
<P>

"Before 1840, the vast majority of Americans -- over 90 percent -- lived 
on farms or in small villages: the life of the cottage," observes Allan 
Carlson of the Rockford Institute in the February issue of The Family in 
America. "While many adults had a specialized trade, most households 
aimed at -- and commonly achieved -- self-sufficiency in food, clothing, 
and other essentials." Children were an integral part of this home-based 
economy. "By age five, children were active participants in the work of 
the household, as were elderly or unmarried kin. Husbands and wives 
were bound together in a partnership of home-centered work," notes 
Carlson. "Family loyalties rested not only on love and emotional 
companionship, but also on need: wife and husband, child and parent 
were intertwined."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Carlson contends that this traditional home-based economy "began to 
change, about 1840, as industrialists harnessed the logic of the division 
of labor to the steam engine and to finance capital. The results included 
a considerable increase in productive efficiency; an accelerated output of 
goods such as wheels, shoes, and clothing; and a sharp lowering of their 
costs relative to the work of cobblers, tailors, smiths, and other displaced 
craftsmen. Decentralized, small, family-held enterprises gave way to 
large, centralized, joint-stock, limited-liability firms."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Perhaps most important, this dramatic change was what made high taxes 
and Big Government possible. "Although families could now purchase 
an array of cheaper consumer goods, the price this new freedom exacted 
was the surrender of productive family functions such as candlemaking, 
food processing, and weaving to the industrial sphere. It also meant 
moving the family production of goods, normally uncounted, into a cash 
nexus, where it would be counted and transformed into profit (and, later, 
into taxes as well)." Carlson charges that "the immediate interest of 
employers lay in keeping wages low and the pool of potential workers 
large. Wives, husbands, and children competed against each other in the 
sale of their labor, driving wages downward, to the level of individual 
subsistence."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The stifling of the productivity of the home had drastic ramifications. "In 
this new order, the home became separated from the factory and the 
office, a revolutionary shift in living patterns. People now worked in one 
place . . . and slept in another," Carlson observes. "With mothers and 
fathers pulled out of the 'cottage,' the care of children became a social 
question; again, something altogether new in human affairs. Time for 
tending the cottage garden or the family cow disappeared, and families 
were forced to enter the market to buy all of their food. In general terms, 
the ownership of productive property such as land and tools gave way to 
a reliance on cash wages and factory-produced goods. Economic loyalties 
were no longer rooted in family relationships, but increasingly owed to 
the employing firm."

<h2>Welfare Reform/IA &SC</h2>
<i><blockquote>
<P>
Iowa and South Carolina offer two examples of innovative   
welfare reform.
</I></Blockquote><P>

"In 1993, the Iowa state legislature enacted a welfare reform   
program designed to help welfare recipients become self-  
sufficient,'' reports Amy Frantz of the Public Interest Institute   
in Mount Pleasant, Iowa. Writing in the May issue of   
Alternatives in Philanthropy, published by the Capital   
Research Center, Frantz relates that Aid to Families with   
Dependent Children (known as AFDC) "was replaced with   
the Family Investment Program [which] provides cash   
benefits to participants based on their assets, income, and   
family size." Participants in the program "must sign a   
contract, called the Family Investment Agreement, in which   
they promise to participate in Iowa's employment program,   
Promise Jobs." The program provides such services as   
"education and job training, resume writing, and [instruction   
in] interviewing techniques."  
  <p>
Participants in the Family Investment Program "must agree to   
meet a timetable for achieving self-sufficiency,'' says Frantz.   
"Those who refuse to sign a Family Investment Agreement   
must enter a Limited Benefit Plan. This pays reduced benefits   
for three months, then terminates all benefits." Under-aged   
parents who have not yet finished high school "must pursue   
their diplomas to receive benefits."  
  <p>
Frantz reports that "Iowa has also created programs that   
allow private organizations to help those in the Family   
Investment Program." Individual Development Accounts, for   
example, "are held by low-income individuals and can be   
used for post-secondary education, the purchase of a home, or   
starting a small business," says Frantz. "In addition to funds   
that individuals contribute to [these accounts], community-  
based organizations can provide matching funds."  
  <p>
Also in the May issue of Alternatives in Philanthropy, Mike   
Hubbard of the South Carolina Policy Council Education   
Foundation in Columbia reports that South Carolina "has   
joined a growing number of states that have enacted major   
welfare reform. Last year, the General Assembly passed the   
Family Independence Act, requiring the South Carolina   
Department of Social Services to reorient its mission from   
distributing welfare checks to helping welfare recipients find   
jobs." The state must obtain "waivers from certain federal   
laws and regulations," however, before it can implement   
some of the proposed reforms. "Unfortunately," says   
Hubbard, "the Clinton administration is fighting the state   
over most of these, delaying the full impact of reform."  
  <p>
The Family Independence Act redefines success for state   
agencies as "a shrinking caseload and an increase in the   
number of recipients placed in jobs," Hubbard continues.   
"Benefits are limited to 24 consecutive months," and new   
applicants for welfare must "prove they have been looking   
for work." South Carolina goes to great lengths to facilitate   
that job search. "The state helps recipients relocate to areas   
with better job opportunities," for example, and offers   
employers "a tax credit for hiring and maintaining   
recipients." The program is practical rather than sentimental,   
however. "Teenage unwed mothers must live with a parent or   
guardian," says Hubbard, and fathers who fail to pay child   
support have their drivers licenses and other sporting and   
professional licenses revoked.

<h2>Kit Carson Scouts</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
"To be an enemy of the United States can be dangerous, " Senator 
Daniel  Patrick Moynihan once quipped. "To be an ally can be fatal. "
</i></blockquote>
<P>     
 
They were called the Kit Carson Scouts, these daring young Vietnamese  
men recruited into the U.S. Army and Marine Corps to guide our combat  
units into enemy territory. They served us faithfully, and we abandoned  
them. 
<p>
Many of the Kit Carson Scouts were former members of the Viet Cong  
who had seen the evils of communism and turned against it, says James  
Tyson, president of the Council for the Defense of Freedom. Others were  
recruited from border villages because of their familiarity with the terrain  
occupied by the communists. Nearly 7,000 Kit Carson Scouts were  
recruited during the Vietnam War, and 4,000 of these courageous soldiers  
were still actively serving when American forces pulled out in 1975.  
"Since then," says Tyson, "the U.S. has done nothing to help these men  
get out of Vietnam safely." 
<p>
What's become of our faithful allies? No one knows for sure. What's  
worse, no one seems to care. "After the fall of Saigon, the Vietnamese  
communists started a campaign to round up all members of the South  
Vietnamese government and armed forces, or those who had worked for  
the Americans," reports Tyson. "Most were killed or thrown into deadly  
're-education camps.' The Kit Carson Scouts were a primary target. The  
communists put a bounty on them, so that many neighbors in their  
villages turned them in. Two thousand are believed to have been  
executed." 
<p>
Half of the Kit Carson Scouts, our former allies, may have been  
slaughtered because we made no provision for their deliverance. What  
about the other half? "Another 2000 are estimated to have survived  
undetected," says Tyson. "These men have faced deadly danger ever  
since and need our help. Many may still be in Vietnam, but some may be  
among the flood of refugees who have succeeded in getting out of the 
country, by risking their lives at sea or through other means." Getting out  
is one thing; staying out is another. Tyson concedes that "thousands of  
Vietnamese have been settled in the U.S. and other countries since the  
war. But 70,000 still languish in refugee camps in the neighboring  
countries of Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Hong Kong." 
<p>
Repatriation means certain death for the Kit Carson Scouts. Nevertheless,  
those who have made it to the refugee camps must prove that they are  
"political" refugees, with the right to be resettled in other countries. Mere  
"economic" refugees, whose concerns about their personal safety in their  
native land are considered unwarranted, do not qualify for asylum. "The 
Kit Carson Scouts have an air-tight case as 'political' refugees, since they  
were employed by the U.S. military," says Tyson. "But our government 
has failed to do anything, either to help them escape from Vietnam or to  
assist those who have gotten out in being properly classified."

<h2>Environmental Phobias</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
What do radon, second-hand smoke, global warming, and the hole in the 
ozone layer all have in common? Just this: The danger they pose has 
been greatly exaggerated in order to justify some unnecessary 
government action.
</i></blockquote>


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"During 1995, scare stories about a future catastrophic greenhouse 
warming gained much momentum, while at the same time the evidence for 
such warming became weaker and weaker," observes Fred Singer of the 
Science and Environmental Policy Project in a recent Washington Times 
editorial. Those scare stories, unfortunately, provide seemingly 
justification for the Global Climate Treaty. The UN-sponsored 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change last year approved two 
summary reports that "convey the impression of impending doom and 
provide a spur for hasty and ill-advised action to cut the use of 
energy fuels." The reports created this misleading impression, says 
Singer, by "withholding crucial information (such as that the data 
show a warming rate of zero!)."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Singer points out that 1995 was also the year in which "the production 
of CFCs and other useful chemicals was banned -- in the mistaken 
belief that this policy would avert an epidemic of skin cancer. 
Scientific evidence does not support this hasty action," he says. 
"There is no data to indicate that ultraviolet radiation reaching the 
earth's surface is increasing by even a few percent -- as might be 
expected if the ozone layer were thinning."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In November of last year, the Congressional Research Service released 
a report that reviewed published studies of the effects of "second-
hand" smoke. The report, says Singer, "found no support" for the 
Environmental Protection Agency's 1992 classification of second-hand 
smoke as a "Class A carcinogen" in the workplace. The risk of lung 
cancer posed by second-hand smoke was not statistically significant, 
it turns out, so the EPA simply redefined "statistical significance." 
Singer charges that the EPA "distorted science to establish a 
correlation and suggest a causation that cannot be proven with the 
data at hand."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Also in 1995, evidence was published demonstrating that low levels of 
radioactivity pose no health threat to humans. Ironically, says 
Singer, "the EPA is stirring up more fears just as we learn that 
naturally occurring radon is a very minor risk for lung cancer."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
So, is the earth getting warmer? No, but this is the excuse used to 
restrict access to energy. Is the ozone layer developing a hole? No, 
but this mythic menace sufficed to prohibit the production of CFCs. Is 
second-hand smoke a statistically significant carcinogen? No, but 
trumped-up findings to that effect could have led to mandated smoking 
bans in workplaces everywhere. Is radon the "number one environmental 
health hazard"? No, but EPA scare tactics will likely make radon 
mitigation a multi-billion-dollar industry. Fred Singer of the Science 
and Environmental Policy Project points out that "environmental 
regulation is now costing the nation more than $150 billion per year." 
That's a cost we can ill afford, especially for imaginary dangers.

"The focus of Indiana's welfare policy should be to help families become 
self-sufficient," says Andrew Bush of the Hudson Institute in 
Indianapolis. "Government can best achieve this goal by recognizing its 
own limitations and by drawing on the strengths of charities, 
community-based organizations, and other private service providers." In 
the April issue of "Alternatives in Philanthropy," published by the 
Capital Research Center, Bush reports on the Indiana Independence 
Initiative, a graduated work-based plan that "would dramatically change 
the orientation of welfare." This Initiative would help "able-bodied 
parents find immediate work," says Bush. It also "would open public aid 
to a wide range of non-government service providers that would help 
families pursue self-sufficiency."

In the same issue of "Alternatives in Philanthropy," Michael Hartmann 
of the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute in Milwaukee reports that the 
Badger State "has imposed stringent work requirements on welfare 
recipients and has successfully moved many able-bodied recipients into 
productive work." Wisconsin's welfare caseload fell nearly 25 percent 
during a period in which state caseloads across the country "increased by 
an average of 35 percent." In 1988, Wisconsin implemented the Job 
Opportunities and Basic Skills program, which, as Hartmann explains, 
"required caseworkers to closely monitor and motivate welfare recipients 
in their search for employment." In 1993, the state implemented a 
program called Work, Not Welfare, which "limits AFDC payments to 
two years and offers major job-training services."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The state legislature recently approved a new program called Wisconsin 
Works, which provides "four graduated work options" for welfare 
recipients. "Recipients unable to perform self-sustaining work will 
engage in work activities, vocational rehabilitation, and counseling," 
says Hartmann of the first, transitional phase of the program. "Recipients 
will learn work habits and job skills necessary for employment in the 
private sector" by doing community-service jobs in the second phase. A 
period of subsidized employment follows, after which participants "will 
be guided to the best available immediate job in the private sector."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Also in the April issue of "Alternatives in Philanthropy," Tom Tancredo 
and Dwight Filley of the Independence Institute in Golden, Colorado 
point out that social pathologies such as juvenile delinquency, drug 
abuse, teen pregnancy, and welfare dependency have all been linked to 
"the absence of a married father in the household." Given this 
documented correlation, they ask, "why does government policy seem 
geared toward driving fathers away?" Despite the "oppressive burden of 
federal laws," Colorado still has "considerable latitude to end the 
perverse incentives that wreck families and contribute to our social ills," 
say Tancredo and Filley. "AFDC, for example, is a matching fund 
program. If the Colorado legislature refused to fund its share, AFDC 
would end in the state."

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
	The strong showing of pro-democracy candidates in this month's legislative election in Hong Kong is a clear signal that the people do not trust Beijing's pledges to respect their autonomy and freedoms. Hong Kong residents voted overwhelmingly for pro-democracy candidates out of fear that China will scrap their democratic freedoms and legal system after Hong Kong reverts to China in 1997. For the first time, Hong Kong's entire 60-seat Legislative Council (LegCo) was elected at one time. Pro-democratic forces now constitute a working majority, but Beijing has promised to dissolve the LegCo when it takes over Hong Kong's government.
<p>
	The British territory of Hong Kong will become a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the People's Republic of China on July 1, 1997. The transfer from British to Chinese rule was agreed upon in the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration,1 which provides autonomy to Hong Kong residents in local government, economic, social, and cultural affairs for at least fifty years after reversion. During this time, Hong Kong's government and courts are to remain intact, although China will assume control of Hong Kong's security and foreign affairs. The Basic Law,2 Hong Kong's post-1997 constitution, mandates that China will refrain from imposing its socialist policies on Hong Kong and pledges to respect the Joint Declaration's guarantees of local government autonomy and an independent judiciary.
<p>
	Notwithstanding Beijing's assurances, America's political and economic interests in Hong Kong are significant and will endure. American corporations' multibillion-dollar investments and their use of Hong Kong as a regional operations center can continue only if Hong Kong remains as open and free as it is today.
<p>
	Hong Kong is America's 12th-largest trading partner, with 1994 two-way trade in excess of $21 billion.3 The U.S. enjoys an annual trade surplus with Hong Kong of nearly $2 billion which is expected to rise as American technology and service-related industries commit themselves more deeply to the region and join the over 1,000 American businesses already there. The American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong is the largest outside of the U.S.
<p>
	American economic interests in Hong Kong are built on its respect for the rule of law, which serves as the guardian of economic and political freedom. The U.S. therefore has a direct interest in Beijing's compliance with its pledges to respect Hong Kong's autonomy. Only if the rule of law continues can residents' freedom be protected and the economy continue to flourish.
<p>
	The United States has an interest in seeing both the Joint Declaration and Basic Law implemented. These instruments provide the framework for a smooth and comprehensive transfer of sovereignty in 1997. They guarantee that Hong Kong will remain not only a leading international business center, but also a free society. The critical conditions of the Basic Law that Beijing must respect after 1997 include:
<p><ul>
<li>Continuation of Hong Kong's autonomy and prosperity;
<p>
<li>The existence of a free market;
<p>
<li>Commitment to such democratic and open institutions as a free press;
<p>
<li>Preservation of Hong Kong's apolitical, independent civil service;
<p>
<li>The rule of law built upon the inviolability of human rights and civil liberties;
<p>
<li>Maintenance of Hong Kong's independence in fiscal and taxation matters; and
<p>
<li>Cooperation between Hong Kong and foreign law enforcement authorities.4</ul><p><b>THE COURT OF FINAL APPEAL</b><p>	The Court of Final Appeal (CFA) will replace the United Kingdom's Privy Council as Hong Kong's final appeals court. On June 9, 1995, the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, established in 1985 to implement the Joint Declaration, reached agreement on the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong.5 It is envisaged that the CFA will provide continuity in the rule of law.<p>	Supporters of the Court deal, most notably in Hong Kong's international business community, argue that it "sweeps away the uncertainty, for people and businesses, here and abroad, about a gap in the judicial system."6  Critics, such as Democratic Party leader Martin Lee and Hong Kong's Bar Association, accuse Britain of appeasing China.7 Lee condemns the agreement as the "final nail in Hong Kong's coffin."8<p>	This deal is not without shortcomings. Most disturbing is that the Court of Final Appeal will be established not before the 1997 reversion, but immediately after the transfer of government authority to Beijing.9 Therefore, the danger exists that Beijing will not permit a truly independent judiciary.10 The Basic Law, drafted and approved by China, stipulates that China's National People's Congress will retain control over "acts of state," or "affairs that are the responsibility of the Chinese government."  Beijing could exploit this language to reverse decisions reached by the Court of Final Appeal.<p><b>PROTECTING AND ADVANCING AMERICAN INTERESTS</b>
<p>
	Against a backdrop of growing uncertainty over Hong Kong's future, Congress in October 1992 adopted the U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act, which defines America's economic, political, and human rights interests in Hong Kong and requires the State Department to report to Congress on these issues. The Act categorically states American support for Hong Kong's continued participation in international organizations after 1997 and asserts that the U.S. should regard Hong Kong as autonomous in all economic and trade matters.11 It also specifies that U.S. laws "shall continue to apply with respect to Hong Kong, on and after July 1, 1997... unless otherwise expressly provided by law or by Executive order."12<p>	Given continuing concerns over the fate of the recently elected Legislative Council, as well as over the future of democracy and the rule of law in Hong Kong, the U.S. should work during the remaining months of this transitional period to support American interests and strengthen Hong Kong's ability to shape its own future. Thus, the Administration should:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Firmly support Hong Kong's free enterprise system.</b> Hong Kong symbolizes the free-market system. In a recent Heritage Foundation study, <a href="econ_index/toc.html.cgi"><i>The Index of Economic Freedom</i></a>, Hong Kong far outstripped most of its competitors to place first in a global ranking of economic freedoms.13 But unless free-market policies and a strong, reliable system of dispute resolution continue after 1997, Hong Kong cannot retain its economic freedom and entrepreneurial dynamism. Should the rule of law be replaced by the rule of personal connections, which is often the practice in the PRC, Hong Kong's prosperity will be threatened.
<p>
<li><b>Urge China not to dismantle Hong Kong's Legislative Council.</b> The current Legislative Council, elected on September 17, 1995, should be allowed to serve out its entire four-year term free of any disruption brought about by reversion to Chinese sovereignty. Beijing remains committed to nominating a provisional council to oversee Hong Kong after reversion. This would violate Beijing's commitment to non-interference in Hong Kong's affairs, sabotage international confidence in Hong Kong, and disappoint the expectations of its residents. The U.S. should communicate to China that a popularly supported legislative body is crucial to Hong Kong's future. The overwhelming victory won by pro-democracy candidates in the recent election emphasizes the need for LegCo's continued, uninterrupted existence.
<p>
<li><b>Continue U.S. Navy port calls to Hong Kong while not accepting a new Chinese consulate in Honolulu.</b> Hong Kong has been a free port for visits by 60 to 70 U.S. Navy ships a year. These visits should be continued. They demonstrate America's engagement in the region, support the American position in Hong Kong, and provide evidence of a stable relationship with the PRC. The U.S. Navy resumed port calls to the Chinese mainland earlier this year, showing a commitment to a better U.S.-China relationship and removing a key obstacle to continuation of port calls to Hong Kong. However, the U.S. should rebuff China's attempt to trade acceptance of American port calls in Hong Kong for establishment of a Chinese consulate in Honolulu. It clearly is not in America's interest to allow China an official presence in such a militarily sensitive area, from which it could monitor U.S. naval movements in the Pacific.
<p>
<li><b>Speak out in favor of a professional, non-biased civil service in Hong Kong after 1997.</b> Hong Kong's professional civil service is regarded as one of the keys to the territory's success. Its ability to remain impartial and unbiased during the run-up to 1997 will ensure a smooth and stable transition, and its continued existence after reversion will enhance confidence in Hong Kong's future.
<p>
<li><b>Continue to support Hong Kong's participation in international organizations that do not require sovereignty for membership.</b> Hong Kong has played a valuable role in the World Trade Organization, the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, and other international organizations. Its membership in these organizations should continue after 1997. Hong Kong's autonomous voice in these organizations has opened the door for free-market reforms in China and throughout Asia.
<p>
<li><b>Continue high-level visits to Hong Kong.</b> Visits of high-level Americans to Hong Kong after reversion would help cement the U.S.-Hong Kong bilateral relationship and would provide an excellent forum in which the remaining agreements, including those on extradition and investment, can be established with the Hong Kong SAR after 1997. High-level visits also send a message to Beijing that Hong Kong is important to American interests throughout Asia.
<p>
<li><b>Urge China to protect human rights in Hong Kong.</b> The uncertainty over Hong Kong's future requires constant vigilance on the part of the international community. The United Nations requires the United Kingdom to report to the U.N.'s Human Rights Committee on Hong Kong's human rights record. But China is not a member of the committee, so these reports will end after the 1997 transfer. Because China remains unwilling to enter into the U.N. covenant on human rights, the U.S. should continue to press China either to enter into the covenant or to allow Hong Kong to enter and report on human rights after 1997.
<p>
<li><b>Insist that U.S. law enforcement agreements with Hong Kong continue.</b> Cooperation between Hong Kong and American law enforcement agencies has been one of long-standing goodwill and mutual benefit. Washington should ask that this cooperation continue after 1997. An extradition agreement with the Hong Kong authorities is nearing completion and soon will be placed before the U.S. Senate for ratification. The U.S. has worked with mainland authorities to control illegal narcotics, money laundering, and organized crime. This cooperation not only should continue after reversion, but should be intensified.
<p>
<li><b>Complete negotiations on outstanding U.S.-Hong Kong agreements.</b>The three most important outstanding agreements involve extradition, civil aviation, and bilateral investment. The extradition agreement awaits final PRC approval within the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG). A civil aviation agreement has not yet been reached, and no new negotiations are planned. Completion of the investment agreement is mired in questions of format. The U.S. has a standard draft that it wishes to advance, while Hong Kong has its own model text from which it wants to develop an agreement. Negotiations are scheduled for later this year. The U.S. should strive to complete these agreements as soon as possible. They would relax barriers to American business in the region, increase official interaction with Hong Kong, and help ensure Hong Kong's autonomy after 1997. Some were drafted directly with Hong Kong authorities, others with the United Kingdom under an "entrustment" clause. Under international law, the latter agreements will lapse upon Hong Kong's reversion in 1997. It is in the interests of both sides to see them replaced with a new agreement before such a lapse occurs.
<p>
<li><b>Encourage China to prepare a post-1997 travel document for Hong Kong residents.</b> Hong Kong's ability to remain a vibrant center of international commerce is only as strong as its residents' ability to travel abroad without undue interference. Without a document that allows them to travel abroad, Hong Kong's businessmen and women will lose to competitors, causing a natural erosion in the territory's competitive edge. Until the 1997 reversion, the U.S. should continue to recognize Hong Kong residents' British National Overseas (BNO) and British Dependent Territories Citizen (BDTC) passports as legal travel documents. In the meantime, Washington should urge Beijing to prepare travel documents for Hong Kong residents that respect their right to travel freely. Such freedom is vital to the continuation of Hong Kong as a business center.
<p>
<li><b>Continue U.S.-sponsored international academic programs in Hong Kong.</b> The United States Information Agency's International Visitor Program, the Fulbright Program, and a host of unofficial academic exchanges strengthen American educational and cultural links to Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government has shown an interest in funding the development of a Hong Kong-American Center devoted to fostering academic ties. This effort should be encouraged by the U.S. It would increase American involvement after 1997 without adding significantly to U.S. government costs.
<p>
<li><b>Prevail upon Beijing to keep its promise of eventual universal suffrage in Hong Kong.</b>14 This promise was written into the Chinese-crafted Basic Law. If honored, it would provide a further measure of confidence in Beijing's willingness to respect Hong Kong's autonomy. Furthermore, it would give residents of Hong Kong greater confidence in their ability to shape their own future. Failure to provide residents a say in their political system would cause the middle class to flee and dampen the enthusiasm felt by international businesses for Hong Kong.
<p>
<li><b>Maintain an active consulate general up to and after 1997.</b> The American diplomatic presence in Hong Kong should not be scaled back just to defer to Beijing's wishes. Given American economic interests and numerous bilateral programs, it is natural that the U.S. government should remain committed to operating in Hong Kong. America's Hong Kong policy should be run from Hong Kong, not from Beijing. Therefore, the U.S. should maintain a consulate office in Hong Kong after 1997.
<p>
<li><b>Urge resolution of the dispute over Container Terminal 9.</b> The delay in construction of Container Terminal 9 (CT9), a major infrastructure project at the port of Hong Kong, directly affects American economic interests. It is key to Hong Kong's ability to compete as a regional shipping and business center. The U.S. stake in the project is significant because a major American firm, Sea-Land Services Inc., has based a large part of its presence in Asia on the project's completion. The U.S. should make it clear to both Britain and the PRC that resolution of this dispute, which arose mainly over inclusion of the British Jardines Matheson consortium, would benefit all parties and ease the shipping bottleneck that already threatens to blunt Hong Kong's competitive edge over other ports in the region.
</ul><p>


<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
	Even in an area as economically vibrant as East Asia, Hong Kong stands out as a tremendous free-market success. Through its dynamism, free-market policies, entrepeneurship, and rule of law, Hong Kong has transformed itself into something much more than a successful economic center of six million people. It has become the focal point for social and economic development within China and in many ways is an inspiration to other countries in the region as well.
<p>
	All of this will be jeopardized if Beijing fails to honor its promises after 1997. China's threats to dismantle the LegCo and run Hong Kong as it sees fit have eroded confidence in Hong Kong's future. And because the fate of Hong Kong will continue to be a factor in shaping American views of China, erosion of faith in the U.S.-China relationship is inevitable if Beijing breaks its word.
<p>
	As this century draws to a close, China's emergence as a major global power will play a larger role in determining the American course of action in Asia. China's deeds and words carry growing weight. Its threats regarding Hong Kong's future autonomy, and the direct effect these threats have on American interests in Hong Kong, cannot be ignored. In addition to being an important economic interest of the United States, a prosperous and autonomous Hong Kong represents a test of China's intentions and behavior, both in Asia and in the rest of the world.

<h2>Aristotle on Democracy</h2></center><P> 

[The Greek philosopher Aristotle analyzed the benefits and 
disadvantages of various forms of government. His comments on the 
nature of democracies are especially valuable to Americans.]
<P>
Aristotle believed that communities are established when men are 
"drawn together by a common interest," each attaining "a share in good 
life." This good life is "the chief end, both for the community as a whole 
and for each of us individually." Aristotle argued that monarchies, 
aristocracies, and democracies can all be acceptable to the citizens of a 
country if their constitutions are just: "Those constitutions which 
consider the common interest are right constitutions," said Aristotle. 
"Those constitutions which consider only the personal interest of the 
rulers are all wrong constitutions, or perversions of the right forms."
<P>
Justice demands that a nation's rulers -- whatever their number -- be 
bound by law. Men have a right to expect impartiality when they sue for 
justice. For this they need "a neutral authority; and law is a neutral 
authority." The sovereignty of the law must supersede the sovereignty of 
the ruler. The law is a higher authority than the ruler because it proceeds 
from a higher authority. "He who commands that law should rule 
[commands] that God and reason alone should rule," said Aristotle: "he 
who commands that a man should rule adds the character of the beast."
<P>
Democracies inevitably decline when they cease to respect this higher 
authority and place the interests of any one group above the common 
good. In so doing, they ultimately destroy their middle classes. Without 
those middle classes, or "golden mean." democracies are left with 
"people who are ignorant how to rule and only know how to obey, as if 
they were so many slaves, and, on the other hand, people who are 
ignorant how to obey any sort of authority and only know how to rule as 
if they were masters of slaves." Clashes between the envious and the 
contemptuous will soon level such a state. "Nothing could be further 
removed from the spirit of friendship or the temper of a political 
community," warned Aristotle. "Community depends upon friendship."
<P>
The continued existence of a substantial middle class in America is vital 
to the preservation of our form of government. Every assault upon the 
middle class threatens to undermine the integrity of that government. 
The most obvious assault upon the middle class is our confiscatory 
income tax. The progressive income tax was one of Karl Marx's goals, 
and he supported it specifically to impoverish the middle class, thereby 
polarizing society and promoting class warfare. If we are to retain our 
freedom, we must protect this beleaguered middle class from further 
encroachment. Efforts to restore our constitutional government would be 
greatly facilitated by a swelling of the middle class. We are indebted to 
Aristotle for his exposition of the crucial role that the middle class plays 
in safeguarding freedom and a just society.
<p>                           <P>

<h2>
John T. Flynn on Socialism
</h2>

<i>The former managing editor of the New York Globe, John T. Flynn was 
a frequent contributor to America's most prestigious magazines, the best-
selling author of several books on the evils of socialism, and the 
originator of our Behind The Headlines commentaries.</i>
<p>
"A socialist society cannot be organized and conducted by the federal 
government under our Constitution," wrote John T. Flynn in his book 
called The Decline of the American Republic, And How to Rebuild It, 
republished in condensed form in 1957 in America's Future's All-
American Book Digest. "There is not one sentence in the Constitution," 
said Flynn, "that would authorize the federal government to socialize our 
medical facilities, to regulate or finance our schools, to engage in 
industrial or mercantile enterprise, or to carry on any of that multitude of 
activities which have, as a matter of record, brought the federal 
government into almost every kind of business in one degree or another. 
The great limitations on the federal government; were specifically set 
down in the Constitution."
<p>
Flynn pointed out that the Constitution was designed "to bring into 
existence a government that possessed all the powers necessary to defend 
the nation from foreign enemies and to guarantee to all the citizens 
certain great fundamental rights of freemen, and to leave to the states -- 
the several small republics -- the powers essential to the government of a 
free people." The Constitution thus stood as an insurmountable barrier to 
power-hungry socialists -until Franklin Delano Roosevelt acceded to the 
presidency. "Despite all the endless care exercised by the framers of the 
Constitution, and the judgments of the Courts for 148 years," Flynn 
lamented, "the revolutionary elements in the United States found a way in 
which to complete their perversion and subversion of the Constitution 
without submitting these radical changes to the states [which were] the 
only authority empowered to make changes in the Constitution."
<p>
Flynn explained how this was accomplished: "The Supreme Court is 
empowered, under the Constitution, to 'interpret' the meaning of the 
Constitution where questions of judicial differences appear," he observed. 
"It had, according to its time-honored practice, interpreted the 
Constitution to mean what its framers wanted it to mean. There was, 
therefore, but one course open to the revolutionary cabal in Washington. 
It was a plan to change the Constitution, literally to wreck the whole 
fundamental structure of the American government . . . by judicial 
interpretation."
<p>
And so, the safeguards were discarded, and America got its taste of 
socialism. "The vast and compulsive apparatus of government had been 
dismembered by our forefathers and its various parts entrusted to a 
variety of agencies," observed John T. Flynn, to ensure that our federal 
government would never have "sufficient power to oppress the citizen." 
But the power that our Founding Fathers so wisely divided was 
recombined "by the decisions of a group of judges who were put on the 
bench in a revolutionary maneuver to give to words in the Constitution 
wholly new meanings."

<h2>
Constitution Not Outmoded
</h2>



<P><blockquote><i>  
It's a familiar refrain. The Constitution, we're told, was designed for an 
18th-century agrarian society, not for the complex, technological world 
we live in today.
</blockquote></i>




<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"The Constitution is based on three timeless truths," wrote Jackson 
Pemberton in an essay published in "The Freeman" during our 
bicentennial year. "First, it is founded on the fact that it is necessary, in a 
society, that the citizen must either control himself by his own moral 
self-discipline, or he must be restrained so that he cannot abuse his 
liberty. Second, it is the nature of man to seek recognition, then 
influence, and then power in his relationships to his fellows. Third, it is 
the nature of man to work untiringly for himself when he is confident in 
the usefulness of his effort. Those are the footings of the Constitution, 
and there is nothing there that is either 18th century or agrarian!"
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In his essay, recently reprinted by the Foundation for Economic 
Education in a collection called The Foundations of American 
Constitutional Government, Pemberton argued that the Constitution was 
founded "upon an exquisite recognition of the dual disposition of man, 
his propensity for good and his capacity for evil." The objective of the 
Founding Fathers was "to place the forces of human nature in a 
framework which would cause those forces to lift man, to protect and 
release his conscience, his will, his talents, and his noble desires, and at 
the same time would discourage and punish him in his vices."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Founding Fathers knew that, if Americans should ever "turn from 
morality and good religion, they would also turn from liberty," wrote 
Pemberton, "for, if man is to be free, he must control himself." For that 
reason, they strove to make sure that "religion should be thoroughly 
protected and even encouraged." They did not intend for "any particular 
religion to have the advantage over another, but that the citizens' rights 
to complete liberty of private and public belief and practice should in no 
way be infringed."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Founding Fathers, Pemberton explained, "set up the plan of 
government so that its powers were restricted, separated, and dispersed 
throughout the states in order to defeat the tendency of men to 
consolidate power and ordain themselves rulers over the people." They 
then applied "the checks and balances to set each branch of government 
as a watchman over the other two, and gave each certain prerogatives so 
as to place the ambition of self-aggrandizing men in opposition to the 
ambition of other similar men."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Founding Fathers recognized that "man is most inclined to produce 
an abundance when his property rights are held inviolate," wrote 
Pemberton. "Man, by nature, will strive with great energy and 
innovation to improve himself . . . so long as he has confidence that he 
will be allowed to enjoy the fruits of his labors." The Founding Fathers 
disdained "excessive taxation and regulation," because they knew that 
"the freest economies were the greatest source of plenty. "

Duplantier</a> <br>November 22, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Unfunded Mandates Shackle States</h2></center><P>



           

[State governments used to agree to almost anything to get on the federal 
gravy train. Now that Washington is making them pay for the ride, some 
states want to get off that train.]
<p>
Unfunded mandates. That's what the uproar's about. It seems the federal 
government is imposing more and more obligations on state 
governments without providing the funds necessary to pay for them. and 
so the states have to come up with the money themselves. Having to raise 
millions of dollars to comply with federal regulations. Or divert funds 
from their own programs, does not sit well with state officials. It's 
patently unfair, and it's unconstitutional. But, in the short run, it may be 
a good thing. After all. the states raised few objections as long as federal 
mandates were fully funded and they might never have complained if 
they hadn't felt the pinch.
<p>
How did the states get themselves into this fix? Thomas Atwood and 
Chris West of the Heritage Foundation explain: "States succumb to the 
temptation of federal funds and buy into a program; the people and the 
state become dependent on it; Congress changes the rules of the game: 
and the state is directed actually to change its law or even its constitution 
in order to continue receiving the popular funding. Strings-attached 
programs can lead to the federal government's virtually dictating state 
law. Yet. all too often. states have been quick to bargain ~" a! their 
autonomy in pursuit of federal dollars."
<p>
Complying with the dictates of the federal government used to be seen as 
"a small price to pay for federal funding of popular state-implemented 
programs." say Atwood and West. "But now the federal share of that 
funding is decreasing while the mandates are becoming more numerous. 
complex. and expensive. Unfunded federal mandates and highly 
prescriptive federal programs have backed many states and localities into 
a fiscal comer. forcing them to sacrifice their own programs and 
priorities in order to comply with standards set by a distant federal 
government."
<p>
Now at long last. state officials are "challenging the authority of the 
federal government to impose these mandates. whether funded or not." 
They're monitoring the votes of their Congressmen on mandates. They're 
challenging the federal government's ever-widening interpretation of the 
Constitution's Comrnerce Clause. Theyre accusing the federal 
government of violating the Tenth Amendment, which reserves to the 
states and the people all powers not expressly delegated to the federal 
government. And on occasion, they're just plain refusing to comply.

Atwood and West warn that "the centralization of power in Washington 
threatens to smother America's enterprise and liberty." But the battle is 
joined, and the tide may be turning. "The states have the power, the 
authority, the opportunity, and the responsibility to rein in an out-of-
control federal government," say Atwood and West. All they need now is 
the will to assert themselves, and the determination to stick to their guns.

<title>Environmental Protection -- Duplantier</title>

<h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES</h4>

October 9, 1995<br></i><hr>

<h2>Environmental Protection</h2></center>

The federal government has undermined private property rights in the 
name of environmental protection, but it's becoming increasingly clear 
that protecting the environment and protecting the rights of landowners 
go hand in hand.<p>

"The growth of federal land-use regulation over the past two decades has 
sparked a firestorm of grassroots opposition," says Jonathan Adler of the 
Competitive Enterprise Institute. "Landowners around the country are 
upset with their government for denying them the reasonable use of their 
land in the name of protecting endangered species. maintaining 'wild and 
scenic' rivers, preserving wetlands. and establishing national parks." 
Adler says there is "broad public support for current environmental laws." 
but there is also "strong public sentiment in favor of compensation for 
regulatory takings." In other words. Americans believe in protecting the 
environment against despoliation, but they also believe in protecting the 
landowner against expropriation. Americans believe that landowners 
should be reimbursed for any losses caused by environmental regulations.<p>

Although "literally dozens of federal statutes and programs restrict the 
nonharmful use of private property." federal laws all by themselves 
account for "the lion's share of regulatory takings," says Adler, citing the Endangered Species Act and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act as the 
major culprits. Seventy-five percent of threatened species "rely upon 
private land for some or all of their habitat." and most officially 
designated wetlands are held privately. "Thus, as long as the federal 
government continues to rely upon regulation to conserve these 
resources, widespread conflicts with private landowners are inevitable."<p>

"The proper aim of federal government efforts to protect 'the 
environment' is to prevent the imposition of harmful substances upon 
unconsenting persons and their properties; and. failing that. punishing 
those who transgress against others in this manner," Adler contends. 
"Pollution is a 'trespass' or 'nuisance' under the principles of common law. Environmental statutes should not supersede common law protections, as 
most have. but rather reinforce them."<p>

Adler points out that "'public goods' such as military bases and highways 
are created by purchasing lands from private owners. On the other hand, 
'public goods' like wetland preserves and wildlife refuges are created by 
bureaucratic edicts that deny property owners the use of their land. This 
is not how it should be." Adler insists. "If the public wants to protect the habitat of an endangered species or preserve an ancient stand of trees for some aesthetic, spiritual, or broad 'environmental' value, then the public should be willing to pay for it, just as it pays for other 'public goods."' The current landowner should not be expected to absorb the loss.<p>

Adler maintains that property rights are "important for both economic 
and environmental reasons, and must be protected from both government 
regulation and private malfeasance. Compensating landowners when they 
are deprived of the reasonable use of their land will not produce 
environmental catastrophe. Far from it. In many cases, it will eliminate 
the negative environmental incentives created by the heavy hand of 
existing government regulations."<p>

<h2>Anticipating "The Pacific Century"</h2>

     It's become faddish in our lifetimes to name each decade
     according to its defining characteristic. One presumptuous
     prognosticator has preempted this process by naming an entire
     century, before it begins.
<p>
     "During the past decade, the world's center of gravity has
     shifted," observes Jesse Helms. "And it will continue to move
     eastward away from Europe, toward Asia," says the senior Senator
     from North Carolina, "because, as the nations of Eastern Europe
     and the states of the former Soviet Union were struggling to
     break free of communism, Pacific Rim nations were busily taking
     care of business at home." This historic shift will usher in what
     Helms calls "The Pacific Century."
<p>
     How will this affect America? It should redound to our benefit.
     "The Asia-Pacific region currently accounts for more than 40
     percent of the world's trade and U.S.-Pacific Rim trade has
     outpaced trade across the Atlantic," says Helms. "Thankfully for
     the United States -- though the political and economic center of
     gravity may have shifted West to East, Europe to Asia -- we
     remain uniquely positioned . . . at the center. The United States
     thus remains the world's anchor."
<p>
     Senator Helms warns, however, that the United States "cannot be
     the best nation in the world unless we are willing to lead the
     world. We cannot lead by being the world's policeman, nor the
     world's babysitter, but by being what we have been for most of
     the 20th century -- the standard-bearer of moral, political, and
     military might and right, an example towards which all others
     aspire."
<p>
     Current U.S. leadership is not setting that example. "In just a
     few short years, the Clinton administration has managed to warp
     U.S.-Asia policy so badly that, at any one time, the United
     States is at odds with China, Japan, and the Korean peninsula.
     Right now, many Asian nations fear that we are propelling
     ourselves down the road to irrelevance," says Helms. "In China,
     the United States has neither a strategy, nor resolve, for
     dealing with areas of key interest to the United States. On the
     Korean peninsula, this administration has given lip service to
     our allies in South Korea while dealing directly with the North
     Koreans." Helms says the U.S. must preserve "its role in the
     dominant region of the 21st century. We must have priorities, and
     we must stand up for them."
<p>
     It is in America's best interests to "maintain open and peaceful
     shipping waters for trade" in the Pacific, says Helms. It is
     vitally important that we "maintain a strategic balance among
     China, Japan, the Korean peninsula, and Southeast Asia." It
     behooves us to "push for more open, less regulated markets for
     U.S. goods and services," and to "show the nations in the region
     that we are serious about their adherence to bilateral and
     multilateral agreements." Helms stresses that we should
     "strengthen the friendships we maintain with our true allies in
     the region -- Taiwan and South Korea, to name just two -- rather
     than coddle dictators because we fear that we might lose market
     share."

<h2>The U.N.'s Checkered Past</h2></center>
<P>

 
Before we get caught up in all the hoopla surrounding the 50th  
anniversary of the United Nations, let's review the checkered past of this  
would-be world government. 
                                                          <P>
The United Nations was designed to serve the interests of the Soviet  
Union. The principal author of the UN Charter, and its first Secretary  
General, was Communist spy Alger Hiss, and the only nation allotted  
three votes, rather than one, was the Soviet Union. The second UN  
Secretary General, Trygve Lie (PRONOUNCED: LEE), revealed in his  
book, called In the Cause of Peace, that U.S. Secretary of State Edward  
Stettinius made a deal with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov that the  
second most important position in the UN would always be held by a  
Communist. 
                                   <P>
From the beginning, the Soviet Union used the UN as a headquarters for  
espionage and terror. According to the 1956 Annual Report of the Senate  
Internal Security Subcommittee, "Accreditation to a diplomatic or  
semidiplomatic position frequently has been given to members of the  
Soviet secret police as a 'cover' for their real objectives in the United  
States.... Soviet agents have engaged, within the boundaries of the U.S.,  
in kidnapping and coercion of foreign nationals who are United States  
residents."                      <P>
 
The Soviet Union also used the UN as a platform in the heart of New  
York City from which to spread revolutionary and subversive  
propaganda. A UN delegate from Poland who defected to the United  
States testified that his Soviet masters considered the UN "one of the  
most important platforms for Soviet propaganda in the world." In 1952 a  
Senate investigation into the "Activities of United States Citizens  
Employed by the United Nations" produced voluminous evidence that  
"there is a Communist 'fifth column' operating within the UN  
Secretariat." 
                                                              <P>
The first war waged by the UN was the Korean War of 1950-53. Korea  
became a battlefield only because the Soviet Union was temporarily  
boycotting the UN and the Soviet delegate was not present to cast a veto  
the day the United States requested UN action. Thereafter, however, the  
Soviets used their position and influence in the UN to force a stalemate in  
Korea. The Soviets never made the mistake of boycotting again, and  
never again did the UN lend assistance to the victims of Communism --  
among them Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Estonia,  
Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Rumania, and Tibet. 
                                                <P>
The UN did take immediate action in the Congo, however, speedily  
dispatching a "peace force" to wage war against the anti-communists of  
Katanga. UN troops killed women and children, attacked schools,  
hospitals, and churches, and used every means at their disposal to force  
the anti-communist Katangans into a Communist coalition government  
dominated by Soviet-trained agents. 
                                                         <P>
This is the history the United Nations will be celebrating next week --  
fifty years of smearing the reputation of the United States and  
undermining our interests, fifty years of providing a propaganda forum  
and an espionage base for the Soviet Union, fifty years of ignoring the  
victims of Communist aggression and actively helping to extend the  
reach of the evil empire.                   <P>

<h2>
The Point of Punishment
</h2>



<P><blockquote><i>  
Most Americans believe that our criminal justice system works pretty well,  
and that punishments meted out to criminals generally fit the crime. Some  
liberal critics, however, hold a very different view of crime and  
punishment. 
</blockquote></i>
<P>


Some sophisticated liberals believe that "America is an oppressive, racist  
society, and prisons are a none-too-subtle way of subjugating the nation's  
poor and minority populations," say criminologists Charles Logan and  
John Dilulio. In an essay titled "Ten Deadly Myths About Crime and  
Punishment in the U.S.," published in a new book called Criminal Justice:  
The Legal System vs. Individual Responsibility, Logan and Dilulio insist  
that "there is simply no empirical evidence to support the view that  
African-Americans, or the members of other racial and ethnic minorities in  
the U.S., are far more likely than whites" to suffer the legal consequences  
of criminal actions. Differences in conviction rates and sentencing, they  
say, are determined by "such mundane factors as the amount of evidence  
against a defendant, and whether or not a credible eyewitness testified." 
 


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Logan and Ditulio also rebut the common misconception that our prisons  
are "prohibitively expensive." They contend that "it is morally myopic, and  
conceptually and empirically moronic, to argue that public money spent on  
prisons and prisoners is public money wasted." They concede that, "if the  
typical offender committed only one petty property crime per year, then  
paying thousands and thousands of dollars to keep him confined would be  
a bad social investment. But, if he committed a dozen serious property or  
violent crimes each year, then the social benefits of keeping him  
imprisoned might well exceed the social costs of not doing so." Logan and  
DiIulio cite one study that calculated a "social cost" of $430,000 per year  
for a felon left at large -- roughly twenty times what it costs to keep him  
incarcerated. That figure may be overstated, but the fact remains that it is  
far less expensive for society to imprison a felon than to let him roam free. 



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
  
The biggest myth or misconception of all, say Logan and DiIulio, is that  
"punishment itself is inherently wrong. It is largely because they are  
opposed to punishment generally and to imprisonment in particular that  
many people argue so strongly that we must address the root causes of  
crime, that our criminal justice system discriminates, that we are overly  
punitive and haven't considered alternatives, that prisons are too costly and  
overcrowded, and that we must look to the courts for reform." Logan and  
DiIulio see punishment as a positive good, however, one that "affirms  
important moral and cultural values. Legal punishment," they insist, "is a  
legitimate and . . . even a noble aspect of our culture." 
 


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
  

Logan and DiIulio reject "the false dichotomy between punishment and  
'humanitarianism."' They argue that punishment, properly and fairly  
applied, is essential to the treatment of people "as human beings, rather  
than as objects. Punishment," they say, "is an affirmation of the autonomy,  
responsibility, and dignity of the individual."

<h2>The Argument Against Gun Control</h2> </center><p>
  
America cannot remain the land of the free unless it continues to be the  
home of the brave. <p> 
 
  
Fueled by anti-gun hysteria, the drive to disarm America gathered  
momentum with the assassinations of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther  
King Jr. in 1968, the year that saw passage of the Gun Control Act. It   
neared its logical conclusion in 1981 when the Village Board of Morton  
Grove, Illinois banned the possession of all handguns and attempted to  
compel local citizens to surrender their weapons to the police. But, in the  
following year, the pendulum began to swing back the other way. In 1982  
the city council of Kennesaw. Georgia voted unanimously to require the  
head of every household to own a gun and ammunition. That year the  
incidence of burglary went down 73 percent in Kennesaw. Meanwhile, it  
was going up in Morton Grove.  <p>
  
Whether their motivation is a sincere desire to reduce the incidence of  
homicide, or a determination to render patriotic Americans defenseless,  
advocates of gun control have trouble advancing credible arguments on  
its behalf, relying instead on emotional appeals and exploiting every gun- 
related tragedy. What else can they do when FBI statistics show that most  
of the states with the highest murder rates have extensive gun control.  
while most of the states with the lowest murder rates have little or no gun  
control?  <p>
  
The pragmatic argument against gun control is simply that it doesn't  
work. Indeed, it seems to encourage crime to the extent that the  
criminally inclined are emboldened by the powerlessness of potential  
victims. But there is an even stronger moral argument, which will be  
heard more and more frequently as Americans in increasing numbers  
express their disenchantment with dependency and seek to reestablish  
their self-respect.  <p>
  
It is the argument of a brave people whose descendants very nearly  
succumbed to cowardice. As incorporated into the Declaration of  
Independence. it expresses the once self-evident truths that all people   
have the right to live, to be free, and to act in their own best interests; that  
these fights are given to us by God. not by other men; that governments  
have no other purpose than to protect these rights; and that a people can  
at any time discharge a government whose protection has burgeoned into  
oppression.  <p>
  
The possession of rights presupposes not only the responsibility for their  
proper use, but also the power to preserve them. Given the obvious  
inability of government to protect the rights of all people at all times, and   
the obvious inability of an unarmed citizenry to protect itself against a  
government that enjoys a monopoly on the use of force, it is abundantly  
clear that a free people must be armed to remain free. Americans are   
beginning to understand again that independence is a right, and bravery  
the virtue that preserves it. It's a good thing, too, because America will  
remain the land of the free only as long as it is also the home of the   
brave.  <p>

<title>Duplantier: Foreign Aid-- 6/12/96</title>

<h2>Foreign Aid</h2>
<i><blockquote>
<P>
The Clinton administration would have us believe that U.S.   
foreign aid promotes American interests around the globe,   
but this simply isn't so. Foreign aid is a luxury we can ill   
afford, especially when it has adverse consequences.
</I></Blockquote><P>
Believe it or not, most recipients of U.S. foreign aid vote   
against the United States in the United Nations most of the   
time. Roughly 64 percent did so in 1995, according to a   
recent report from the Heritage Foundation. Policy analyst   
Ryan Johnson offers several disturbing examples.  
  <p>
Nigeria voted against the U.S. 69 percent of the time in 1995,   
but we'll send Nigeria nearly $27 million this year despite its   
lack of support. The top ten countries voting against U.S.   
interests the most -- India, Laos, China, Lebanon, Seychelles,   
Pakistan, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Djibouti, and Burkina Faso -  
- will receive a combined total of nearly $212 million in   
foreign aid this year. Why are we rewarding these ingrates?  
  <p>
Of-the ten nations receiving the most American aid -- Israel,   
Egypt, Russia, Ukraine, India, Peru, Bolivia, Ethiopia, Haiti,   
and South Africa -- only Israel, Russia, and Ukraine voted   
with us more often than not. Egypt, for instance, will receive   
over $2 billion in aid this year despite voting against us 67   
percent of the time last year. India will collect more than   
$150 million in U.S. aid, after having voted against us 83   
percent of the time.  
  <p>
Russia, surprisingly enough, voted against the U.S. only 33   
percent of the time. It's worth noting, also, that nine of the   
U.S.'s ten strongest supporters in the U.N. are former Soviet   
bloc countries! They are: Tajikistan, Latvia, Georgia,   
Uzbekistan, Hungary, Estonia, Lithuania, Slovenia, and   
Macedonia. Israel, which will receive over $3 billion in aid   
this year, is our strongest supporter, voting with the U.S. 97   
percent of the time.  
  <p>
If the U.N. voting records of aid recipients accurately reflect   
their support for U.S. policies, "the U.S. is not getting its   
money's worth," says Johnson. "There may be many reasons   
why a country votes with or against the U.S. at the UN," he   
observes. "But it is clear from these data that foreign aid does   
not win friends where it counts: in supporting U.S.   
diplomatic initiatives at the United Nations. Clearly, the   
foreign aid program in general, and under the Clinton   
administration in particular, has done little to justify public   
confidence that tax dollars are being used wisely by   
America's foreign aid bureaucracy."  
  <p>
In short, foreign aid is not working. "Why, then, is the U.S.   
spending so much money on countries that obviously care   
little about America's interests abroad? And why is the   
Clinton administration fighting to save this program when   
most Americans are opposed to it?" asks- Bryan Johnson of   
the Heritage Foundation. "Last year, Congress tried to cut the   
U.S. foreign aid budget as part of its plan to reduce wasteful   
government spending and balance the federal budget deficit,"   
notes Johnson. "Because the Clinton administration fought   
these proposals, Congress was unable to make more   
significant cuts in foreign aid."

<h2>Feminists Ignore Successful Women </h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>More than six million American women own their own businesses. Yet, for 
some strange reason, you'll never hear a feminist trumpeting these 
triumphs. </i></blockquote>
<P> 
Feminists seem determined to "wave aside the achievements of the individual 
for the collectivist utopia of group success," says Elizabeth Larson in a 
recent issue of The Freeman, a monthly journal published by the Foundation 
for Economic Education. Larson argues that such feminist-supported policies 
as affirmative action are actually detrimental to women. "The American 
working woman pays a high price for the position or promotion she receives 
from affirmative action," says Larson, and that price is "the unspoken 
assumption that she was not the 'best man' for the job." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whether that assumption is warranted in a particular instance or not, the 
fact remains that affirmative action tends to make the qualifications of 
all women seem suspect -- with sad, but certain consequences. "Resentment 
against an individual case of hiring by quota ferments into resentment 
against all members of the privileged group," says Larson. Although 
affirmative action is supposed to remedy the effects of discrimination, in 
reality it only perpetuates it. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Supporters of affirmative action for women play fast and loose with their 
figures. The so-called wage gap between men and women is "neither as wide 
nor as unbridgeable as it is portrayed," notes Larson. "Once you stop 
lumping all women of all ages in all fields together and using that 
resulting dollar figure as representative of the average American working 
woman, the gap narrows. Comparing the wages of women and men of the same 
age, with similar experience, training, and years of uninterrupted time in 
their field yields a much more optimistic picture of how women fare today." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Larson says "the gaps that do still exist are likely due to the fewer 
continuous years women have been in the workforce. Women who have never 
interrupted their careers for any reason now earn at least 98 percent as 
much as their male counterparts." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Larson contends that "many feminists labor under assumptions about the 
workplace and the meaning of success that are both unreasonable and 
unrealistic. They seem to believe that making an attempt at her job in and 
of itself guarantees a woman success." It's not that easy, says Larson. 
"Just because a woman wants to be the first female CEO of her company does 
not mean she is entitled to the position, or that if she fails to make it 
that far up the corporate ladder it is someone else's fault. Luck, drive, 
brains, connections, education, and, yes, good looks, can all play a part 
in the promotions any worker -- male, or female -- receives." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
There are many women who have "genuine, free-market success stories to 
tell," but you won't hear about them from feminists, because that would 
undercut their campaign for government intervention. "An eagerness to rely 
on the government," says Elizabeth Larson, "betrays a lack of confidence in 
women's abilities to achieve financial and personal independence."

<h2>Terrorism</h2></center><P> 

[The threat to American security posed by Libyan and Iranian terrorists 
doesn't seem to loom as large today as it did in the early 1980s, but the 
threat remains.]
<p>
Former FBI agent Ray Wannall says that Iran and Libya have held 
grudges against the United States since at least the early 1980s. "Their 
terroristic threats against the U.S. were intensified following our raid on 
Tripoli and Benghazi, Libya in 1986, the accidental shooting down of an 
Iranian Airbus in the Persian Gulf in 1988, and the U.S. downing of two 
Libyan fighter jets over the Mediterranean the following year."
<p>
Wannall recalls that early in 1985 Muammar Qaddafi urged black 
American servicemen to leave the military and form a separate army 
because the United States "must be destroyed." In a 40-minute satellite 
address from Libya to a Nation of Islam convention in Chicago, Qaddafi 
declared: "This country must be destroyed. They refuse to accept you as 
American citizens. This means you are obliged to create a separate and 
independent state." Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of Islam, 
endorsed the Libyan dictator's remarks, saying, "Brother Qaddafi is a 
man the world does not understand."
<p>
In that 1985 speech, Qaddafi incited Farrakhan's followers to 
insurrection. "You have the force, you have the soldiers," said Qaddafi. 
"We are ready to give you arms, because your cause is just. We are with 
you. Don't worry. You have to trust us. We will fight together shoulder 
by shoulder. The final victory will be soon." Though claiming to have 
declined the offer of arms, Farrakhan did accept a $5 million interest-free 
loan from Qaddafi, ostensibly to underwrite a commercial enterprise to 
help black Americans create financial independence.
<p>
The Washington Times reported in 1985 that a radical Islamic 
infrastructure of terror has been established across the U.S., consisting of 
safehouses, weapons, ammunition, money, and systems to provide 
medical and legal aid, false identity papers, and transportation. Followers 
of Qaddafi and Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini man this network, ready to 
spring into action when the word comes. Appearing before Congress the 
following year, FBI Director William Webster warned that three-fourths 
of the 2,000 Libyan students in the U.S. were financed by the Libyan 
government and could constitute a terrorist threat.
<p>
Former FBI Executive Assistant Director Oliver Revell warned earlier 
this year that it is likely that a radical Islamic fundamentalist 
infrastructure has been firmly established in our country. The radical 
fundamentalists "support such organizations as Hezbollah, Hamas, and 
the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which are directly involved in terrorism and 
violently oppose the Israeli-PLO initiative," says Revell. "These 
organizations are aided and supported by Iran, including its diplomatic 
establishments and intelligence services, which makes them even more 
dangerous."<p>

Ray Wannall says the Iranians and the Libyans "have not tempered their 
threats in recent years. Nor has Louis Farrakhan given any sign of 
rejecting Qaddafi's avowed friendship and support. Jihad, the holy war 
waged on behalf of Islam as a religious duty, is still being fought."

<h2>Love Canal</h2>


<i><blockquote>
At a recent press conference announcing that the Occidental Chemical 
Corporation had agreed to pay $129 million to clean up toxic waste at 
Love Canal, Attorney General Janet Reno observed that it was only fair 
to expect people to clean up their own mess. She neglected to mention, 
however, that government played a major role in creating this particular 
mess.

</blockquote></i>

<P>
Everyone knows that Occidental's predecessor company, Hooker 
Chemicals & Plastics, buried toxic waste at Love Canal more than 40 
years ago. What they don't know, says Michael Fumento of the 
Competitive Enterprise Institute, is that "Hooker tried desperately to 
convince the city of Niagara Falls (where Love Canal is located) not to 
build on the site." Citing a 1981 article in Reason magazine, Furnento 
recounts how the Niagara Falls school board "applied massive pressure 
to obtain the land despite Hooker's repeated warnings of potential health 
hazards. Finally, Hooker gave in and sold the land for a symbolic dollar 
bill. It insisted, though, that the land . . . was under no circumstances to 
be excavated."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Niagara Falls ignored that stipulation. "Instead, the city decided to build 
a housing development on the site.... Then it sold the plots to 
unsuspecting home buyers." The fact is that Hooker did not endanger the 
public when it dumped its waste in an undeveloped area. "It was the 
city's choice to bring people" to that location, says Fumento. "The bad 
guy wasn't the big faceless corporation; it was your friendly city 
government."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Fumento notes that "nobody at Love Canal complained of any 
exceptional illnesses until a muckraking environmental reporter for the 
local paper began a series of articles telling the people that they were 
sitting on a toxic waste site." Then a feeding frenzy began. "The media 
descended on the town and relayed to the outside world every sneeze, 
every cough, and every ache and pain experienced by Love Canal 
residents, making it clear that they could only be caused by toxic waste." 
Bureaucrats and politicians saw an opportunity to grandstand. "The EPA 
and the governor of New York swaggered around, condemning the 
chemical company and promising to make everything better, no matter 
the cost. Ultimately, tens of millions of dollars were spent evacuating the 
residents."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Fumento reports that subsequent studies by state and federal agencies 
"found that Love Canal residents had no more illnesses than would be 
expected in any other area of similar size." Attorney General Janet Reno 
neglected to mention this at the news conference, possibly because more 
than $100 million of the Occidental settlement is going to be 
Environmental Protection Agency's Superfund, which was created in the 
wake of Love Canal hysteria. EPA Administrator Carol Browner used 
the occasion to warn that "Congress is attempting to roll back the 
environmental health protections that Superfund brought to Love Canal." 
That contention is easily refuted, says Fumento. "Since there was never 
any health threat at the Love Canal, obviously Superfund brought no 
protection there."

<h2>
Whole Language Supporter Recants
</h2>
<Blockquote><i>

If a child hasn't learned to read by the end of the first grade, he's been  
cheated, and the odds are that he'11 never achieve his true potential.</blockquote></i>

<P>   
Bill Honig was State Superintendent of Public Instruction for California  
from 1983 to 1993. During that decade, he presided over a school system  
that threw out many of the proven pedagogical approaches of the past. The  
test scores for California's public school students plummeted as a direct  
result of this ill-advised change in direction. That's the bad news. The good  
news is that Bill Honig learned from this needless disaster, and maybe his  
testimony will help keep other superintendents of education from making  
the same mistake. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Bill Honig has written a book called Teaching Our Children to Read. In it,  
he emphasizes that educators must ensure that all schoolchildren are  
"reading beginning books by mid-first grade" and be prepared to resort to  
"organized intervention" for those who aren't. Children who are not  
beginning to read by this point, says Honig, "almost never recover." To  
read successfully, children must learn how to break words into their  
smallest "sound chunks. " In other words, they must master phonics. Honig  
argues that "the amount of time a student is engaged in phonics instruction  
is highly predictive of subsequent reading achievement." 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The former state superintendent of education does not acknowledge his  
own mistake in allowing the destructive Whole Language method to  
become entrenched in state schools during his tenure. Nevertheless, he  
asserts emphatically that children will learn to read only if they are taught  
to sound out the syllables of the English language and put them together  
like building blocks -- not by using pictures to guess at words, as  
recommended by Whole Language advocates. Honig explains that "bad  
habits of guessing" make learning to read much more difficult, and argues  
that "beginning readers who rely too heavily on contextual clues, such as  
pictures or the connection of other words in the passage, are distracted  
from looking at the letters in a word and connecting those letter patterns to  
words in their minds."<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Honig's rejection of the Whole Language approach should have  
tremendous impact on his colleagues throughout the country because of the  
prestigious position Honig once held in California. Unfortunately, the  
ineffective Whole Language approach to reading has driven phonics out of  
most of our nation's school systems. Honig reports that "very few  
instructional programs currently in use provide children with materials  
designed specifically to connect with systematic and sequenced skills  
development. In some cases," he says, "state, county, district, or university  
leaders are overtly or subtly antagonistic to the skills components and  
discourage phonics teaching." Maybe Bill Honig's new book will persuade  
some of these ideologues to take an honest look at the damage they're  
doing with the Whole Language approach. Maybe some of them will  
resolve to teach America's schoolchildren how to read the right way --  
using the proven method of systematic phonics.

<h2>
Conservation Economics
</h2>



<P><blockquote><i>  
If environmental activists really cared about preserving endangered 
species, they wouldn't let an ideological commitment to socialism stand 
in the way.
</blockquote></i>

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Since 1970, conservationists have painted a dismal picture of an 
increasing struggle for survival of wildlife, with one species after another 
being pushed to the brink of extinction," says Robert J. Smith of the 
Competitive Enterprise Institute. "Why are some species disappearing 
and others thriving?" Smith argues that "the problem of overexploitation 
or overharvesting is a result of the resources being under public rather 
than private ownership." In the January issue of his organization's 
monthly newsletter, "UpDate," Smith distinguishes between "two totally 
different forms of property rights and ownership: public, communal, or 
open-access common property vs. private property. Wherever we have 
public ownership we find overuse, waste, and extinction; but private 
ownership results in sustained-yield use and preservation."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Wildlife problems resulting from public ownership have been "especially 
prevalent in America," says Smith, but less so in other parts of the world. 
"In Europe, native wildlife often belongs to private landowners or is 
managed under a combination of private and public property. Some 
European countries have fewer problems of overexploitation of wildlife, 
regardless of population pressures and economic and political systems." 
There's a lesson to be learned here, says Smith.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
An example of "how private ownership can successfully preserve wildlife 
is found on game ranches, hunting preserves, safari parks, and animal and 
bird farms." Smith contends that "these game ranches produce many 
positive results. Many of the animals they stock are rapidly disappearing 
in their native countries because of pressures resulting from a rapidly 
expanding human population. Indeed, some of the more spectacular and 
most sought-after big-game mammals may now have healthier and more 
stable populations on game ranches than in their native countries."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The reluctance of conservationists to embrace private ownership of 
wildlife is one of the biggest threats to the preservation of endangered 
species. "If the profits gained by giving hunters access to exotic game can 
provide the economic incentive for landowners to manage the animals on 
a sustained-yield basis, some species will be saved," says Smith. He notes 
that "the protection provided at some of the parks, preserves, and gardens 
has actually produced a glut of some animals. There have been well-
publicized efforts by some preserves to return their surplus animals to 
Africa." Smith predicts that "in the future the developing countries will 
be restocked with their native fauna from specimens now thriving on 
game ranches and preserves."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conservationists need to overcome their slavish devotion to big 
government. "The problems of environmental degradation, 
overexploitation of natural resources, and depletion of wildlife all derive 
from their existence as common property resources," says Robert J. 
Smith. "Wherever we have exclusive private ownership, whether it is 
organized around a profit-seeking or nonprofit undertaking, there are 
incentives for the private owners to preserve the resource. Self-interest 
drives private property owners to careful management of their resource."

<title>ABM Treaty -- Duplantier</title>
</head>

<h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES</h4>
<i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.<br>
 F.R. Duplantier<br>
 October 3, 1995</i><br><hr>

<h2>ABM Treaty</h2></center>

It looks as if our representatives in Washington may finally summon the 
courage to withdraw from the obsolete Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and 
renounce the doctrine of Mutual Assured Destruction that jeopardizes our 
nation's safety.<p>

In June the House of Representatives overwhelmingly rejected an 
amendment to a defense appropriations bill that would have endorsed 
continued adherence to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The 
amendment's defeat could foreshadow an end to the insane policy of 
Mutual Assured Destruction, which many people call the MAD doctrine. 
This vote of 221 Republicans and 21 Democrats "suggests that there is, at 
long last. a growing -- and bipartisan -- appreciation that America's 
present vulnerability to ballistic missile attack is as reckless as it is 
absurd." says Frank Gaffney Jr., director of the Center for Security 
Policy. "The tally also admirably reflected the House leadership's 
determination to correct this grievous deficiency."<p>

During an appearance on the Sunday morning TV show "This Week With 
David Brinkley," a few days before the vote. House Speaker Newt 
Gingrich argued that the United States should "proceed with defending 
itself against ballistic missiles from countries like Iran, North Korea or 
Syria or Libya." Noting that an anti-ballistic missile system could be 
functional "within two or three years . . . for a very low cost," Gingrich 
declared his strong support for "setting aside the ABM Treaty" so that the 
United States can defend itself.<p>

Some said that this House vote was "tantamount to a repudiation of the 
ABM Treaty." That's an exaggeration, but. according to Frank Gaffney, 
it's a good start. It shows that advocating abrogation of the ABM treaty is 
"no longer politically taboo." Gaffney predicts that "the new taboo will be 
the idea of perpetuating the American people's vulnerability to ballistic 
missile attack."<p>

Frank Gaffney explains the vote like this: "First, the public is largely 
unaware that it is unprotected against missile strikes," or that the ABM 
Treaty requires that our country remain defenseless. "When acquainted 
with that reality, [Americans] overwhelmingly favor putting [U.S.] 
defenses into place," Gaffney observes. "Second, notice was served on 
those legislators who persist in voting against providing such protection 
[that they] will be held responsible for voting to perpetuate U.S. 
vulnerability."<p>

The diehard supporters of the obsolete ABM Treaty were reduced to 
denying the threat of ballistic missile attacks from rogue nations, or 
insisting that maintaining a treaty with Russia is somehow more 
important than protecting ourselves against attacks from other quarters. 
Such arguments are clearly untenable. "The truth of the matter, of course, 
is that there is a growing threat -- both from indigenously developed 
[missile] systems and from those that can be bought on the world 
market," says Gaffney, noting that there are roughly 25 countries 
currently "working to acquire ballistic missiles and the chemical, 
biological and/or nuclear weapons they might carry." The old model of 
two superpowers facing each other no longer reflects the world we live 
in. The 1972 ABM Treaty cannot protect us from rogue nations that 
commit terrorist acts and now have the capability of nuclear mischief.<p>

<center><h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES </h4><i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/duplbio.html">F.R. Duplantier</a> <br>January 9, 1996<br></i><hr><h2> Dole on NAFTA</h2></center><P> 
 [The efforts of Senator Bob Dole to distance himself from the North 
American Free Trade Agreement could signal a historic shift in U.S. trade 
policy.] 
 <P>
"The callous behavior of Bill Clinton and his trade allies in Congress in 
bulldozing the GATT and NAFTA treaties through in the face of the 
overwhelming opposition of the American people set the stage for the 
current counterrevolution on the trade front," says William Gill of the 
American Coalition for Competitive Trade. The seeds of that 
counterrevolution "were first sewn in 1990," says Gill, with publication 
of a book called Trade Wars Against America. That book persuaded Pat 
Buchanan and other conservative leaders that so-called free trade is "a 
destructive aberration that goes against the Constitution -- and the 
protectionist policy of George Washington and the other Founders -- the 
policy that built America." 
 <P>
Gill's group, the American Coalition for Competitive Trade, intends to 
keep publicizing the defects of free trade "until public opinion finally 
forces the government to repudiate this insane policy that is strangling 
America." As casualties of our country's self-defeating trade policy, Gill 
cites the nearly 80,000 mid-level managers to be laid off by AT&T, the 
12,000 bank employees made redundant by the pending merger of 
Chemical Bank and Chase Manhattan, the 1800 millworkers left stranded 
by the shutdown of Bethlehem Steel, and the 3200 textile workers let 
loose by Fruit of the Loom. 
 <P>
"Nowhere has the frenzy to cut jobs been more apparent than in the 
nation's once invincible defense industries," says Gill, noting that 
1,300,000 defense workers have lost their jobs since 1988, and 700,000 
more will be let go in the next two years. "Although most of these two 
million jobs will have disappeared because of cuts in the federal budget, a 
significant number can be traced to trade," says Gill. "Billions of dollars 
have been spent by the armed services on foreign products, many of them 
high-tech items invented in America and once made here before 
production was shipped overseas." As if that weren't bad enough, "it has 
become fashionable for U.S. defense companies to enter into joint 
ventures with foreign firms and governments in the production of some 
of our most sophisticated weaponry." Venture partners such as Japan 
have sold the technology acquired in this manner to our enemies. 
 <P>
Pat Buchanan has made protectionism the cornerstone of his bid for the 
Republican presidential nomination, and the-public's favorable response 
to that theme has not escaped the notice of front-running Republican 
presidential candidate Bob Dole. Last November, Dole expressed 
"significant disappointment" with the results of NAFTA, warned his 
colleagues in the Senate that America is "choking on new agreements," 
and called for a "cooling-off period" on trade pacts. "If Bob Dole sticks to 
his new guns on trade, and if he gets the Republican nomination in 1996, 
he will outflank Bill Clinton on an issue that now has most Americans up 
in arms against it," says Gill.

<h2>Secular Humanism</h2></center><P>

[Paul Kurtz, president and editor-in-chief of Prometheus Books, 
explained once in an Associated Press interview exactly what it is that he 
and other "secular humanists" actually believe.]
<p>
"Secular humanists are committed to the use of reason and science to 
understand the world," said Paul Kurtz. "We also believe it's necessary to 
develop a new morality appropriate to the present needs. I believe in the 
use of reason to build a good life on this planet without the illusion of 
salvation or immortality." That good life and that new morality are the 
subjects of a number of written works bearing the emblem of Kurtz's 
publishing house, Prometheus Books. Here-are some of the titles: 
Atheism: The Case Against God,  Beneficent Euthanasia, The 
Encyclopedia of Unbelief, The New Sexual Revolution, Ethics Without 
God, and Religion Without God.
<p>
In an essay entitled "Humanism and the Moral Revolution," Kurtz 
contends that traditional morality has been made obsolete by "an 
explosive technology that has rapidly transformed our culture. A sharp 
disparity has emerged between the new technology and our inherited 
moral codes." Kurtz believes that "the good life is achieved when we 
realize the human potential. This means that we ought to reject all those 
creeds and dogmas that impede human fulfillment or impose external 
authoritarian rules upon human beings. The traditional supernaturalistic 
moral commandments are especially repressive of our human needs," 
says Kurtz. "They are immoral insofar as they foster illusions about 
human destiny and suppress vital inclinations."
<p>
In another essay, Kurtz confides that Humanism "is related to a doctrine 
of liberation and emancipation. It values the autonomy of free agents, not 
only in their intellectual beliefs but in their aesthetic experience, their 
romantic or sexual proclivities, their moral tastes and values." No subject 
is taboo to free-thinking secular humanists -- no subject, that is, except 
one: belief in God. The faithful will be outcast in the coming new order, 
and the measure of the "freedom" of what passes for thought will be the 
fervency of one's nonbelief. "Humanism cannot in any fair sense of the 
word apply to one who still believes in God as the source and creator of 
the universe," Kurtz comments.
<p>
Will free-thinking secular humanists suffer the faithful to exist as 
harmless anomalies and quaint anachronisms? No, our faith is a constant 
challenge to their infidelity; it makes them feel bad. Humanists cannot be 
truly free until all belief and all believers are exterminated. "For 
Humanism has always been opposed to any and all forms of tyranny over 
the mind of man," proclaims Kurtz. "This puts Humanism squarely in 
opposition to all authoritarian, religious or totalitarian ideologies that 
attempt to suppress, limit or censor human intelligence or to impose an 
orthodoxy of belief or morality." It's an unpleasant fact, but secular 
humanism and faith in God cannot coexist. One of the two must 
ultimately triumph. Rest assured that humanists, if they ever have the 
power, will not tolerate us as we have tolerated them.

    The United Nations Conference on Disarmament, meeting in Geneva
on September 3, concluded 23 years of negotiations and reached
agreement on a treaty that promises to ban the development,
production, and stockpiling of chemical weapons. This treaty
represents a high water mark for the art of self-deception in the
pursuit of arms control. While proponents will tout it as a means of
eliminating the threat of chemical warfare, the treaty will do no such
thing. Nothing compels countries to sign the treaty and the countries
that fail to do so are sure to be the ones most likely to resort to
chemical warfare.  Even those countries that sign the treaty face few
penalties if they violate it. There are vague promises of sanctions
against violators, including the suspension of a violator's treaty
rights and other undefined "collective measures" by the international
community. But if a country decides to violate the treaty, nothing
short of the threat of force by the U.S. and its allies -- which would
be highly unlikely -- would deter a country from illegally stockpiling
chemical weapons. Meanwhile, the U.S. would already have disarmed
itself by destroying its own chemical weapons.
<P>
    Although the treaty is flawed, the Bush Administration has
supported it vigorously and is all but certain to sign it next year if
the President is reelected. There is little doubt that a Clinton
Administration also would sign it. This being the case, it will be up
to the Senate to protect U.S. interests by refusing to consent to the
treaty's ratification.
<P>
    A Long and Tortured History. This is not the first time that the
world's nations have tried to control chemical weapons. After chemical
weapons had killed some 100,000 people in World War I, the victorious
allies established the Geneva Protocol of 1925, which banned the use,
but not the development, production, or stockpiling, of biological and
chemical weapons. Now acceded to by 140 countries, the protocol was
not ratified by the U.S. until 1975. This effort to outlaw chemical
attacks proved to be ineffective soon after it was adopted. Italy, for
example, signed the Protocol in 1928, but it used poison gas against
the Ethiopians in the 1930s.
<P>
    The next attempt to limit chemical weapons occurred in November
1969 when Richard Nixon announced that the U.S. would not resort to
the use of chemical weapons unless attacked with them first. Nixon
also renounced the use of biological weapons (those that infect people
with diseases like anthrax) under any circumstances. The Nixon
declaration led to negotiations at the U.N. Conference on Disarmament
that produced yet another international agreement: the 1972 Convention
on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of
Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their
Destruction. This document not only prohibited the use of biological
weapons in war, but prohibited their possession. 
<P>
    Meanwhile, the United Nations continued its work to ban chemical
weapons. In 1969, it formed the U.N. Conference on Disarmament, which
has involved all nations in negotiations to ban chemical weapons.
<P>
    The Bush Administration has shown a strong interest in concluding
the chemical weapons negotiations. Bush promised in his 1988
presidential campaign to ban chemical weapons. Later, on May 13, 1991,
the President declared that the U.S. would destroy all of its chemical
weapons unilaterally and foreswear their use under any circumstances. 
<P>
    Flawed Approach. While Bush's desire to rid the world of chemical
weapons is laudable, it is unrealistic. When the U.S. tried this
approach with biological weapons, the result was an agreement that the
Soviet Union signed, but subsequently violated with impunity. For
example, the Soviet government maintained a biological weapons
research facility in the city of Sverdlovsk in the Urals, which
accidentally released anthrax spores in 1979. The Bush
Administration's most recent report on Soviet compliance with arms
control treaties, released in March, asserts flatly that the Soviet
government up to the time it collapsed was in violation of the 1972
convention.
<P>
    While the Russian government has in general terms acknowledged
the violations perpetrated by its Soviet predecessor, it is unclear
whether even Boris Yeltsin's reformist government has halted all the
biological warfare research and development programs it inherited. The
U.S. and British governments, for example, are not yet completely
satisfied that the Russian government has given them the full list of
inherited Soviet biological weapons facilities located on its
territory. Other countries such as India, Iran, Iraq, and Pakistan
also are thought to be developing biological weapons.
<P>
    It is true that the chemical weapons ban will have stronger
verification measures than the biological weapons convention had. For
example, the chemical weapons treaty will allow inspectors to conduct
on-site inspections. But it will be impossible for inspectors to catch
violators if they are serious about concealing their activities. For
example, many of the lethal chemicals used in weapons also have
peaceful applications in the production of fertilizers and pesticides.
Those chemicals will not be banned no matter how vigilant the
inspectors are. The Bush Administration itself admitted last year that
an earlier U.S. proposal to allow international inspectors to go
anywhere, at any time to verify compliance by signatory countries was
unrealistic.
<P>
    Further, as with the biological weapons convention, it will
remain legal for countries that have not acceded to the chemical
weapons treaty to continue to develop, produce, and stockpile chemical
weapons. Even if 65 other countries sign the new chemical weapons
treaty, which is necessary to bring it into force, many countries,
such as China, Iran, and several radical Arab states, may not agree to
it. These countries are all but certain to continue their chemical
weapons programs.
<P>
    In short, the new chemical weapons treaty, like the biological
weapons convention before it, will strip the U.S. of its chemical
weapons capability, but it will not entirely eliminate the chemical
threat to U.S. troops. Only the threat of chemical retaliation and
protective clothing and gas masks can do that.
<P>
    Unintended Consequences. The chemical weapons ban is likely to
have other dangerous consequences. During the Persian Gulf War, U.S.
armed forces were vulnerable to attacks by biological weapons. For
example, the Pentagon's interim report on the conduct of the Persian
Gulf War, released in July 1991, stated that an Iraqi biological
attack could have resulted in enormous allied casualties and even have
overwhelmed the military's medical care system. One reason for this
was the biological weapons convention that created political pressure
to limit research, development, and deployment of defenses against
biological weapons. Such research was seen by arms control advocates
as bordering on a violation of the biological weapons convention, even
though such defensive programs are permitted under the convention.
Some advocates even recommend banning such defensive programs
outright. The chemical weapons treaty puts no restrictions on
defensive measures, but the same pressure to curtail chemical defense
programs is sure to arise. The result will be a dangerous situation in
which the U.S. will be stripped of its chemical deterrent, while its
defenses against chemical attacks progressively atrophy.
<P>
    A Better Approach. The Bush Administration made a mistake in
using the biological weapons convention as a precedent for the new
chemical weapons agreement. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of
1968 serves as a better model. Instead of banning nuclear weapons
altogether, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty banned the spread of
nuclear weapons beyond the five states that possessed them at the time
the treaty was signed: the United States, China, France, Great
Britain, and the Soviet Union. Under this kind of agreement, the U.S.
could retain a small stockpile of chemical weapons to serve as a
deterrent against chemical attack and not feel political pressure to
limit its program to improve defenses against chemical attack.
<P>
    No doubt there will be enthusiastic rhetoric from the
Administration and other proponents of the new chemical weapons
convention proclaiming that the scourge of chemical weapons has been
eliminated. There also will be an attempt to downplay the dangers
inherent in the agreement. Given the wishful thinking which has marred
this issue, only the Senate can stop U.S. participation in this ill-
considered and dangerous experiment in disarmament.

<h2>Truth in Learning</h2></center><P>                

[The failure of our educational system -- especially our colleges and 
universities -- can be traced, ultimately, to one human flaw, arrogance.]
<P>
The tremendous popularity of the television quiz show called Wheel of 
Fortune no doubt derives from the program's ingenious design, which 
encourages contestants to delay solution of the puzzle while racking up 
points for guessing the letters that compose it. Home viewers are thereby 
assured of knowing the answer long before it is officially acknowledged. 
What keeps Wheel of Fortune fans coming back is the pleasant feeling of 
superiority home viewers enjoy each time the answer is revealed, and 
they find out it's just what they thought it was.
<P>
A similar predictability may have accounted for the tremendous 
popularity of one of the best-selling books of the 1980s, Allan Bloom's 
The Closing of the American Mind. That's the book that started an 
impressive genre of writing critical of colleges and universities. After all, 
Allan Bloom didn't really tell us anything we didn't already know. We'd 
known for years that the colleges are filled with leftist and relativistic 
ideologues. We didn't need to spend $20 on a 400-page book to find that 
out, but many of us did, and were gratified that a university professor 
had finally said what we'd been saying all along.
<P>
A lesser-known scholar named James Schall also set out to expose the 
intellectual blight in our nation's universities. His book, entitled 
Another Sort of Learning, appeared almost simultaneously with the 
paperback  release of The Closing of the American Mind, but it did not 
enjoy similar success. Here's why: Rather than make us feel superior, 
even a bit smug, by confirming our bleak assessments of contemporary 
education, Schall's book made us feel uneasy. Schall insisted, for 
instance, that "most of the important things we do not in fact learn are 
not learned because we choose not to learn them." In other words, we 
expect too much from the universities, and we've only got ourselves to 
blame for our manifest deficiencies.
<P>
Schall went even further. He suggested that a university is "not really 
equipped" to provide the education we need. He said that the university 
is "designed, consciously or unconsciously, to prevent us from 
confronting in our own lives the ultimate questions of existence and 
essence." Needless to say, Schall's radical ideas didn't go over big in 
college towns. After all, it's one thing to say that the system isn't 
working: it's another thing entirely to say it isn't meant to work. But 
that's what Schall said, emphasizing that "we meet the more ultimate 
things in our churches, in our families, in our living, in our friendships."
<P>
Schall wasn't satisfied with condemning relativism. He had to talk about 
Truth. Allan Bloom had discussed Truth too, but somehow, in Schall's 
book, Truth seemed to mean something specific. Unlike Bloom, Schall 
dared to identify the source of Truth, and to declare that revelation 
makes it available to everyone, the humbler the better. James Schall's 
book, Another Sort of Learning, addresses the first causes of the 
decline of college campuses today.

<h2>
Origins of the Income Tax 
</h2>


<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>

We've heard a lot of talk in recent months 
about the many benefits of 
the flat-rate income tax, but we rarely hear anything about the marvelous 
federal income tax we used to have -- none at all!

</I></BLOCKQUOTE><p>



In 1862, the year preceding his famous Emancipation Proclamation, 
President Abraham Lincoln inaugurated America's first income tax law, 
styling it an "excise tax" to circumvent the prohibition against direct 
taxation found in Article I, Section 9 of the United States Constitution. 
Within two years he had opted for a graduated income tax, summarily 
rejecting the principle of equality under the law which had prevailed in 
America until that time. It was only as a temporary measure that 
Lincoln's income tax achieved passage. Despite efforts to extend it, the 
tax lapsed in 1872, two years after its prescribed expiration. But the 
appetite of politicians and their bosses for an unlimited source of revenue 
and power had been whetted, and the freedom that Americans had 
enjoyed for less than a century would soon be imperiled again.


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


In 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt sought unsuccessfully to have 
Congress enact an income tax law. In the first year of the administration 
that followed, however, President William Howard Taft acquiesced in 
the passage of a tariff bill with a rider providing for the taxation of 
corporation incomes. He also agreed to a resolution calling for a 
constitutional amendment to establish an income tax. On February 
3,1913, the State Department certified 38 states as having ratified the 
amendment. Only 36 of the 48 states then in the union were needed for 
ratification, but in recent years scholars have discovered evidence that no 
more than 27 states ratified the amendment in the prescribed manner. 
Properly ratified or not, the Sixteenth Amendment has had the full force 
of law for more than 80 years now. Indeed, this assault on the very 
liberties that the Constitution was designed to safeguard has been 
enforced more zealously than any law, constitutional or statutory, in all 
of American history.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The Sixteenth Amendment empowered the federal government "to lay 
and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without 
apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any 
census or enumeration." It also had the effect of diminishing at least 
three of the rights guaranteed by previous amendments to the 
Constitution: the right to due process in the Fifth Amendment; the right 
of the States and the people to retain all powers not expressly delegated 
to the Federal Government in the Tenth Amendment, and the right to be 
free from involuntary servitude, as protected by the Thirteenth 
Amendment.



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;



Flat tax advocates abound nowadays, but it's hard to find any supporters 
of the tax system our Founding Fathers devised. Why is that? Could it be 
that powerful groups in our society have a vested interest in maintaining 
the peculiar institution of the income tax?

Duplantier</a> <br>November 30, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>PC on Campus Hinders Pursuit of Truth</h2></center><P>
[The search for truth is getting to be a risky business.  Just ask any  
college student who's run afoul of the thought police on campus.]   
  <p>
There's no longer any use in denying it. The temples of learning have   
become indoctrination centers. Academic freedom has given way to mass   
hysteria. A bizarre misanthropic cult now reigns supreme on American   
college campuses. "Political correctness has been used to enforce   
conformity and to stifle debate," say Peter Duignan and L.H. Gann of the   
Hoover Institution. "Censorship is practiced in a variety of ways. through   
the planned disruption of meetings, the use of so-called speech codes, and   
the coercive use of sensitivity training or suspension from school.   
<p>Indirect censorship is also practiced through the selection of assigned   
reading and also through hiring practices."  
  <p>
The puppets of political correctness reject the European focus of   
American history, ignoring the fact that "the United States is, for the   
greater part, a demographic and cultural extension of Europe beyond the   
Atlantic. About four-fifths of the US population derives from European   
stock," say Duignan and Gann. "The United States owes a cultural debt to   
almost every land under the sun," they concede. "But no other country   
influenced the United States as much as Great Britain." Our language, our   
literature, our legal system, our system of government, our ethical system   
-- all have British origins.   
  <p>
The PC crowd insists on a growing array of ethnic studies programs to   
remedy the alleged racial bias of Western scholarship. They're unwilling   
to accept the fact that the United States is a product of Western   
civilization. with pronounced European characteristics -- characteristics   
that include a unique appreciation for cultures other than its own. <p>"Far   
from being one of the world's most oppressive societies, the United States   
is the most successful multiracial and multiethnic state in existence," say   
Duignan and Gann. "No other country attracts as many immigrants and   
bestows its citizenship on so many newcomers. No other country is   
ethnically more varied."  
  <p>
Purveyors of political correctness claim that the West has had a uniformly   
negative impact on lesser developed countries. On the contrary.   
"mainland has gained in the long run by the Western conquest of the New   
World and by the consequent emergence of new nations," say Duignan   
and Gann. "Modern industrial civilization allows not only higher   
economic productivity! than its early predecessors but also an infinitely   
larger population and higher material well-being and a longer life," not to   
mention "an infinitely larger number of choices."  
  <p>
In their eagerness to condemn the United States as a racist and sexist   
society. the PC partisans willingly ignore the numerous alternative   
explanations for economic inequities -- such as the median age of ethnic   
groups. cultural and genetic differences. and so on. They also maintain   
that America is not the free country we have all been "brainwashed" to   
believe it is. That they themselves are the ones who have been   
brainwashed. that the PC movement itself threatens the liberties of all   
Americans -- such ironies are lost on this humorless horde.

<h2>Property Rights Are Under Attack!</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>Do Americans really own anything anymore, or is everything we possess just 
on loan to us from the federal government? </i></blockquote>
<P> 
"Mass confiscation [of personal property] has become politically 
fashionable," reports James Bovard in a recent issue of The Freeman, the 
monthly journal of the Foundation for Economic Education. "Politicians and 
the courts have created an overwhelming presumption in favor of the 
government's right to seize control over private land, private homes, 
boats, and cars, and even the cash in people's wallets." Bovard warns that 
government's power to seize private property "directly subjugates citizens 
to the capricious will" of public officials. And those officials don't need 
much of a pretext to justify their actions. Bovard says, "Thousands of 
American citizens are being stripped of their property on the basis of 
rumors and unsubstantiated assertions made by the government's confidential 
informants." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Is this the American way? Whatever happened to personal property rights and 
the presumption of innocence? How did we get to this state of affairs? 
"Beginning in 1970, Congress enacted legislation to permit government to 
seize property of Mafia organizations and big-time drug smugglers," 
explains Bovard. More forfeiture laws were enacted as the years went on, 
with the result that "federal agents can now seize private property under 
more than 200 different statutes. From 1985 to 1991, the number of federal 
seizures of property under asset forfeiture laws increased by 1500 
percent." Federal officials lost interest in crime lords and drug kingpins. 
"Unfortunately, the more forfeiture laws legislatures enacted, the less 
attention police seem to pay to major criminals," says Bovard. Today, the 
vast majority of citizens forfeiting their property to the federal 
government under drug laws "are never formally charged with any crime." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Bovard asserts that nowadays "the mere suspicion of a government official 
is sufficient proof to nullify all claims that a citizen legitimately owns 
his property." He notes that "forfeiture laws are turning some federal 
agents into the modern-day equivalent of horse thieves. Ranchers are being 
victimized by seizures based on allegations of violations of environmental 
laws." By confiscating the vehicles that ranchers use to earn their 
livelihood, federal agents effectively put them out of business. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
According to the Justice Department's 1992 annual report on asset seizures, 
"No property may be seized unless the government has probable cause to 
believe that it is subject to forfeiture." That sounds good in theory, says 
Bovard, but that's not the way it works. "In reality, government officials 
are seizing people's property based solely on 'hearsay' -- rumor and gossip 
-- from anonymous informants." Bovard considers it more than likely that 
some policemen have "invented anonymous informants to give them a pretext 
to take private property they covet." The old double standard comes into 
play here with a vengeance. "While government agents can use hearsay 
evidence to justify a seizure," says Bovard, "property owners are usually 
prohibited from offering hearsay evidence to support their claims."

<h3>International Trade: America's Winning Formula</h3>
<p>
Delivered June 7, 1995 by Dexter F. Baker,<br>
Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.
<P>
In 1994, two-way trade across America's borders with the rest of the world represented a $1.6 trillion economic activity. This equals 28 percent of the total United States gross domestic economic activity. International commercial transactions by the United States with the rest of the world are growing at a compound rate of 7 percent per year. This growth rate is two-and-one-half times faster than the growth of our domestic economy. 
<P>
In the United States today, one job out of every five is directly related to either export or import of goods and services with the rest of the world. (When I use the term "goods," I mean manufactured, agricultural, and mineral products.) Future economic projections indicate that the United States' international trade in goods and services will double between now and the year 2005. That means that ten years from today, the international trade activities of the United States economy will approximate $3.2 trillion, or about 80 percent of the size of the entire U.S. domestic economy in 1995.
<P>
United States producers of goods and services have made tremendous progress since the mid-1980s. Today, U.S. manufacturers, service sector companies, and agricultural producers are the world's most competitive producers for most goods and services when compared to those of our international trading partners. The one major exception is the cost of piece-made garments produced throughout Asia. U.S.A. manufacturers are now also acknowl- edged to be the world's highest quality producers. Only high-value Japanese cars have a slight edge in terms of total quality when compared to their U.S. counterparts, and that quality differential is rapidly being eliminated.
<P>
In 1994, the U.S. market share of the world's total trade activity was the largest of all the industrialized nations in the world. Approximately 22 percent of the worldwide trade in goods and services is provided by the United States. In the mid-1980s, we were number 3. Today, we are number 1, having passed Japan and Germany as the premier producer of goods and services for the world markets.
<P>
U.S. industry, our agricultural producers, and service sector providers have the highest output per worker of all the major industrialized countries. U.S. manufacturers' worker productivity is 30 percent greater than that of Japan and Germany, and our rate of improve- ment is growing faster than either of those countries'. In 1994, manufacturing productivity in this country grew by 4 percent, or twice as fast of that of Germany and Japan. 
<P>
Our agricultural productivity is at least twice as efficient as that of Germany or France. In the service sector, our output per worker is nearly 50 percent greater than that of Germany. You may have seen the article in The Wall Street Journal last week comparing the productivity of our very competitive telephone and banking industries with those of Germany.
<P>
The only economic activity in the United States that does not compare favorably on world scales is the productivity of our "K through 12" education system and our federal and state governments' productivity.
<P>
Today, our agricultural industry has the lowest level of employment in its history and yet feeds our entire country and produces and sells an additional $20 billion worth of agricultural products abroad. Incidentally, I am advised that there is one government employee in the Agriculture Department for every farm in America. Indications are that U.S. agricultural exports in 1995 will be 25 percent greater than in 1994.
<P>
If the United States is to continue to be a world leader in international trade in the 21st century, if we are to double our international trade activity in the next ten years, then there are three policy initiatives that must be undertaken to preserve our growing successes in serving world markets.
<P>
First, we must be relentless in our pursuit to create open markets for our manufactured goods, agricultural products, and technical and entertainment services in every corner of the globe. This drive to keep and/or open markets for our products and services must be the foundation of our international foreign policy. United States goods and service producers cannot be compromised by foreign governments adopting protectionist policies which preserve their markets for their products while denying U.S. producers the right to sell into their markets.
<P>
With few exceptions, the U.S. market is an open market, and U.S. consumers have benefited from that policy; so, too, will the consumers of U.S.A. goods and services around the world benefit from an open market policy in their countries. Today, American industry can compete any place in the world on the basis of quality and price with the brightest and best of our international competitors if we are permitted to do so. But if artificial barriers are erected to keep U.S.A. producers out of selected markets, no amount of competitiveness will enable us to create jobs and enhance our nation's economic well-being by serving world markets.
<P>
Keep this point in mind:  Export-related jobs, because they are incorporated into successful enterprises, are the highest paid jobs that the United States possesses (maybe baseball players are higher). Furthermore, two-thirds of all the world's markets for manufactured products and technical or entertainment services lie beyond the borders of our nation. Those of you in Washington who are responsible for public policy initiatives must press to keep world markets open if U.S. industry is to have the opportunity to create wealth for our nation.
<P>
Secondly, our national taxation system must be modified from one that penalizes capital formation, discourages investment, and places excessive burdens on the hiring of incremental employees. Our federal government today collects 92 percent of its revenues by taxing personal wages and earned income. And in the case of earned corporate profits that are distributed to individuals, that combined rate is the highest in the industrialized world. The 92 percent ratio is also the highest in the industrialized world. Most of our international competitors in Europe and in Asia tax consumption while at the same time offering incentives for saving, investment, and employment.
<P>
The United States cannot long compete in world markets where its most efficient producers, who generate the highest wages and who pay for excellent results, are taxed at the highest rates by a government which has demonstrated no significant productivity improvement in over ten years. Our taxation system must be modified to stimulate extra invest- ment. As a nation, we need to increase the amount of capital stock that is behind each of our workers. We need to encourage a high productivity workforce. We must encourage personal savings, while at the same time improving the productivity of our government and eliminating its annual deficit.
<P>
In this regard, we must become more like Germany and Japan, where national savings rates are three to five times greater than those in the United States. Yes, they save between 15 and 20 percent of their gross income versus 4 to 5 percent here in the United States. As a result, the cost of capital for equity investment in Japan is nearly one-third less than that in the United States. No wonder it is so easy for Japan to invest in our country -- and in Europe and throughout Southeast Asia -- when their cost of equity capital is so low.
<P>
Thirdly, and most important, our federal government must become a partner on our international competitive teams. Since nearly half of the net benefit of our international trade activities flows to our government, and since nearly 50 percent of the wage dollars flow to government, it is absolutely essential that our federal, state, and local governments improve the quality of their services and improve their productivity in the same manner as have our agricultural, manufacturing, and service sectors.
<P>
We cannot win the battle for supremacy in world markets in the 21st century against Japan, Germany, China, or the Little Tigers of Asia if only half the U.S.A. team is pulling on its productivity oars. All members of Team USA must be competitive and must constantly be improving their efficiency. If Team USA is to win in world markets, all members of our team must be contributors so that our entire nation can be a winner.
<P>
We will never solve our social problems -- better housing, quality education, medical care for the needy, jobs for the unemployed -- if we continue to burden the productive side of the economy in order to redistribute our job-creating cash flows on the nonproductive, low productivity side of our economy. Industry, banking, medical care, and even private education are improving their output per dollar of intake. Shouldn't our federal government be held to the same standard?  We heard on ABC News last night that our Air Force maintains a fleet of 589 planes -- ten times the wartime regulated limit -- in order to transport its high-ranking officers around the globe. What is wrong with flying United, TWA, or American Airlines?
<P>
We will only solve our special social needs at home by expanding the size of the economic pie. This can best be achieved by encouraging the wealth-creating enterprises that effectively serve global markets. Then, and only then, can incremental revenues be generated and prudently allocated to our special social needs at home. 
<P>
But we must earn those extra revenues before we can spend them. We cannot spend our resources on solving social issues at home that we haven't yet earned abroad. Our practice of continuously borrowing from our future to solve social ills today will only debase our currency and lower the standard of living for all of our people.
<P>
The time for policy shifts is now -- the summer of 1995. You have been elected to lead that change and oversee its implementation. Let's make 1995 the most productive year in the history of our Congress. Let's together chart a course that will serve our nation well into the 21st century.
<p>
	As our friends at Nike would say--let's just do it!

<P>
President Reagan's Speech to the House of Commons, June 8, 1982.
<HR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We're approaching the end of a bloody century plagued by a terrible
political invention -- totalitarianism. Optimism comes less easily
today, not because democracy is less vigorous, but because democracy's
enemies have refined their instruments of repression. Yet optimism
is in order because day by day democracy is proving itself to
be a not at all fragile flower. From Stettin on the Baltic to
Varna on the Black Sea, the regimes planted by totalitarianism
have had more than thirty years to establish their legitimacy.
But none -- not one regime -- has yet been able to risk free elections.
Regimes planted by bayonets do not take root.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The strength of the Solidarity movement in Poland demonstrates
the truth told in an underground joke in the Soviet Union. It
is that the Soviet Union would remain a one-party nation even
if an opposition party were permitted because everyone would join
the opposition party....
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Historians looking back at our time will note the consistent restraint
and peaceful intentions of the West. They will note that it was
the democracies who refused to use the threat of their nuclear
monopoly in the forties and early fifties for territorial or imperial
gain. Had that nuclear monopoly been in the hands of the Communist
world, the map of Europe--indeed, the world--would look very different
today. And certainly they will note it was not the democracies
that invaded Afghanistan or suppressed Polish Solidarity or used
chemical and toxin warfare in Afghanistan and Southeast Asia.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
If history teaches anything, it teaches self-delusion in the face
of unpleasant facts is folly. We see around us today the marks
of our terrible dilemma--predictions of doomsday, antinuclear
demonstrations, an arms race in which the West must, for its own
protection, be an unwilling participant. At the same time we see
totalitarian forces in the world who seek subversion and conflict
around the globe to further their barbarous assault on the human
spirit. What, then, is our course? Must civilization perish in
a hail of fiery atoms? Must freedom wither in a quiet, deadening
accommodation with totalitarian evil?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Sir Winston Churchill refused to accept the inevitability of war
or even that it was imminent. He said, &quot;I do not believe
that Soviet Russia desires war. What they desire is the fruits
of war and the indefinite expansion of their power and doctrines.
But what we have to consider here today while time remains is
the permanent prevention of war and the establishment of conditions
of freedom and democracy as rapidly as possible in all countries.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, this is precisely our mission today: to preserve freedom
as well as peace. It may not be easy to see; but I believe we
live now at a turning point.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In an ironic sense Karl Marx was right. We are witnessing today
a great revolutionary crisis, a crisis where the demands of the
economic order are conflicting directly with those of the political
order. But the crisis is happening not in the free, non-Marxist
West but in the home of Marxism- Leninism, the Soviet Union. It
is the Soviet Union that runs against the tide of history by denying
human freedom and human dignity to its citizens. It also is in
deep economic difficulty. The rate of growth in the national product
has been steadily declining since the fifties and is less than
half of what it was then.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The dimensions of this failure are astounding: a country which
employs one-fifth of its population in agriculture is unable to
feed its own people. Were it not for the private sector, the tiny
private sector tolerated in Soviet agriculture, the country might
be on the brink of famine. These private plots occupy a bare 3
percent of the arable land but account for nearly one-quarter
of Soviet farm output and nearly one-third of meat products and
vegetables. Overcentralized, with little or no incentives, year
after year the Soviet system pours its best resources into the
making of instruments of destruction. The constant shrinkage of
economic growth combined with the growth of military production
is putting a heavy strain on the Soviet people. What we see here
is a political structure that no longer corresponds to its economic
base, a society where productive forced are hampered by political
ones.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The decay of the Soviet experiment should come as no surprise
to us. Wherever the comparisons have been made between free and
closed societies -- West Germany and East Germany, Austria and
Czechoslovakia, Malaysia and Vietnam -- it is the democratic countries
that are prosperous and responsive to the needs of their people.
And one of the simple but overwhelming facts of our time is this:
of all the millions of refugees we've seen in the modern world,
their flight is always away from, not toward the Communist world.
Today on the NATO line, our military forces face east to prevent
a possible invasion. On the other side of the line, the Soviet
forces also face east to prevent their people from leaving.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The hard evidence of totalitarian rule has caused in mankind an
uprising of the intellect and will. Whether it is the growth of
the new schools of economics in America or England or the appearance
of the so-called new philosophers in France, there is one unifying
thread running through the intellectual work of these groups --
rejection of the arbitrary power of the state, the refusal to
subordinate the rights of the individual to the superstate, the
realization that collectivism stifles all the best human impulses....
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Chairman Brezhnev repeatedly has stressed that the competition
of ideas and systems must continue and that this is entirely consistent
with relaxation of tensions and peace.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, we ask only that these systems begin by living up to their
own constitutions, abiding by their own laws, and complying with
the international obligations they have undertaken. We ask only
for a process, a direction, a basic code of decency, not for an
instant transformation.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We cannot ignore the fact that even without our encouragement
there has been and will continue to be repeated explosion against
repression and dictatorships. The Soviet Union itself is not immune
to this reality. Any system is inherently unstable that has no
peaceful means to legitimize its leaders. In such cases, the very
repressiveness of the state ultimately drives people to resist
it, if necessary, by force.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
While we must be cautious about forcing the pace of change, we
must not hesitate to declare our ultimate objectives and to take
concrete actions to move toward them. We must be staunch in our
conviction that freedom is not the sole prerogative of a lucky
few but the inalienable and universal right of all human beings.
So states the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
which, among other things, guarantees free elections.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The objective I propose is quite simple to state: to foster the
infrastructure of democracy, the system of a free press, unions,
political parties, universities, which allows a people to choose
their own way to develop their own culture, to reconcile their
own differences through peaceful means.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This is not cultural imperialism; it is providing the means for
genuine self-determination and protection for diversity. Democracy
already flourishes in countries with very different cultures and
historical experiences. It would be cultural condescension, or
worse, to say that any people prefer dictatorship to democracy.
Who would voluntarily choose not to have the right to vote, decide
to purchase government propaganda handouts instead of independent
newspapers, prefer government to worker-controlled unions, opt
for land to be owned by the state instead of those who till it,
want government repression of religious liberty, a single political
party instead of a free choice, a rigid cultural orthodoxy instead
of democratic tolerance and diversity.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Since 1917 the Soviet Union has given covert political training
and assistance to Marxist-Leninists in many countries. Of course,
it also has promoted the use of violence and subversion by these
same forces. Over the past several decades, West European and
other social democrats, Christian democrats, and leaders have
offered open assistance to fraternal, political, and social institutions
to bring about peaceful and democratic progress. Appropriately,
for a vigorous new democracy, the Federal Republic of Germany's
political foundations have become a major force in this effort.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We in America now intend to take additional steps, as many of
our allies have already done, toward realizing this same goal.
The chairmen and other leaders of the national Republican and
Democratic party organizations are initiating a study with the
bipartisan American Political Foundation to determine how the
United States can best contribute as a nation to the global campaign
for democracy now gathering force. They will have the cooperation
of congressional leaders of both parties, along with representatives
of business, labor, and other major institutions in our society.
I look forward to receiving their recommendations and to working
with these institutions and the Congress in the common task of
strengthening democracy throughout the world.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is time that we committed ourselves as a nation -- in both
the public and private sectors -- to assisting democratic development....
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
What I am describing now is a plan and a hope for the long term
-- the march of freedom and democracy which will leave Marxism-Leninism
on the ash heap of history as it has left other tyrannies which
stifle the freedom and muzzle the self-expression of the people.
And that's why we must continue our efforts to strengthen NATO
even as we move forward with our zero-option initiative in the
negotiations on intermediate-range forces and our proposal for
a one-third reduction in strategic ballistic missile warheads.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Our military strength is a prerequisite to peace, but let it be
clear we maintain this strength in the hope it will never be used,
for the ultimate determinant in the struggle that's now going
on in the world will not be bombs and rockets but a test of wills
and ideas, a trial of spiritual resolve, the values we hold, the
beliefs we cherish, the ideals to which we are dedicated.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The British people know that, given strong leadership, time, and
a little bit of hope, the forces of good ultimately rally and
triumph over evil. Here among you is the cradle of self-government,
the Mother of Parliaments. Here is the enduring greatness of the
British contribution to mankind, the great civilized ideas: individual
liberty, representative government, and the rule of law under
God.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I've often wondered about the shyness of some of us in the West
about standing for these ideals that have done so much to ease
the plight of man and the hardships of our imperfect world. This
reluctance to use those vast resources at our command reminds
me of the elderly lady whose home was bombed in the blitz. As
the rescuers moved about, they found a bottle of brandy she'd
stored behind the staircase, which was all that was left standing.
And since she was barely conscious, one of the workers pulled
the cork to give her a taste of it. She came around immediately
and said, &quot;Here now -- there now, put it back. That's for
emergencies.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, the emergency is upon us. Let us be shy no longer. Let us
go to our strength. Let us offer hope. Let us tell the world that
a new age is not only possible but probable.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
During the dark days of the Second World War, when this island
was incandescent with courage, Winston Churchill exclaimed about
Britain's adversaries, &quot;What kind of people do they think
we are?&quot; Well, Britain's adversaries found out what extraordinary
people the British are. But all the democracies paid a terrible
price for allowing the dictators to underestimate us. We dare
not make that mistake again. So, let us ask ourselves, &quot;What
kind of people do we think we are?&quot; And let us answer, &quot;Free
people, worthy of freedom and determined not only to remain so
but to help others gain their freedom as well.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Sir Winston led his people to great victory in war and then lost
an election just as the fruits of victory were about to be enjoyed.
But he left office honorably and, as it turned out, temporarily,
knowing that the liberty of his people was more important than
the fate of any single leader. History recalls his greatness in
ways no dictator will ever know. And he left us a message of hope
for the future, as timely now as when he first uttered it, as
opposition leader in the Commons nearly twenty-seven years ago,
when he said, &quot;When we look back on all the perils through
which we have passed and at the mighty foes that we have laid
low and all the dark and deadly designs that we have frustrated,
why should we fear for our future? We have,&quot; he said, &quot;come
safely through the worst.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, the task I've set forth will long outlive our own generation.
But together, we too have come through the worst. Let us now begin
a major effort to secure the best -- a crusade for freedom that
will engage the faith and fortitude of the next generation. For
the sake of peace and justice, let us move toward a world in which
all people are at last free to determine their own destiny.

<title>U.S. Soldier Refuses to Submit to U.N. Authority -- Duplantier</title></head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center><h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES </h4>
<i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.<br>
F.R. Duplantier <br>
 October 20, 1995 <br></i>
<hr>
<h2>U.S. Soldier Refuses to Submit to U.N. Authority</h2></center>
<P>

 
U.S. Army Specialist Michael New was scheduled to join a United  
Nations "peacekeeping" force in Bosnia early this month, but Specialist  
New decided to risk the possibility of court martial, dishonorable  
discharge, and a prison term rather than wear the UN insignia on his  
uniform. 
        <P>
When Michael New joined the U.S. Army and swore an oath to uphold  
the Constitution of the United States, no mention was made of the United  
Nations. No one said anything about swearing allegiance to a would-be  
world government. or being subject to service under its alien command.  
That's why Michael New balked when he was ordered to wear the UN  
insignia. Up to that point, he had been a typical American soldier, subject  
to the command of American military officers and possessed of all the  
rights of an American citizen -- and that's what he wanted to remain. 
                             <P>
Specialist New demanded to know how a UN emblem on his uniform  
would affect his status as a soldier in the U.S. Army. Would he still be in  
the service of the United States, or would he be considered to be in the  
service of the United Nations instead? If taken prisoner during the UN's  
"peacekeeping mission," would he be treated as an American POW or as  
a UN hostage? Michael New's superiors refused to answer those crucially  
important questions. 
                        <P>
The Army was in "a difficult position," remarks Dennis Cuddy, former  
professor of U.S. history at the University of North Carolina, and the  
author of a popular pamphlet on the New World Order. If the UN insignia  
on his uniform would have no effect on Michael New's status as an  
American soldier, then why was it so important for him to wear it? If the  
insignia merely identifies a UN operation, then why didn't American  
soldiers serving in Korea wear UN emblems on their uniforms? 
                                      <P>
Taking a pass on those prickly posers, the Army argued that President  
Clinton as commander-in-chief had lawfully ordered American soldiers  
to wear the UN insignia, and that's the end of that. The alleged lawfulness  
of the order presumably derives from a classified Presidential Directive  
of May 3, 1994, in which Clinton asserted his authority "to place U.S.  
forces under the operational control of a foreign commander." Cuddy  
says that "one reason New has asked for an explanation of how his status  
would change if he wore UN insignias is to determine if this order  
actually is lawful." Cuddy contends that it is unconstitutional, and that  
Army Specialist Michael New is "correct to refuse to wear UN insignia  
over his American uniform." 
                                                 <P>
Why all the fuss about a silly little emblem? Dennis Cuddy argues that  
obscuring the national identities of troops participating in a UN  
peacekeeping mission and forcing them all to sport UN insignia indicates  
"a change of command or authority." Once the United Nations has troops  
that it can truly call its own, it will have become what its founders wanted  
it to be -- "a de facto world government." 
 <p>                                                  <P>

[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
On January 4, 1995, the House of Representatives voted 430-1 for an internal audit to be 
performed by an outside accounting firm. It was a matter of bipartisan conventional wisdom that 
the management of the House had been permeated with "abuses and management inefficiencies," in the words of House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-MO) in 1992. Although a few 
House accounts had been audited by the General Accounting Office, it is likely that many have 
never been reviewed by an independent examiner. Since one such audit uncovered the House 
Bank scandal, a full accounting was long overdue.
<p>
The accounting practices of the 103rd Congress that the Price Waterhouse audit  revealed 
demonstrate that the Houses financial and operational controls are worse than even the Houses 
harshest critics had imagined. The fourteen material weaknesses that auditors uncovered would 
be troubling if they appeared in a medium-sized business. Their presence in the 13,000-employee 
House of Representatives is a national disgrace. Most disturbing are the conclusions that the 
House was:<br>
<ul>
<b><li>Wasting millions of dollars on inefficient purchasing practices and superfluous staff;
<li>Permitting employee theft through multiple reimbursements for the same purchase;
<li>Allowing the use of official resources for campaign purposes; and 
<li>Keeping such careless records that the magnitude of losses to the public will probably never be known.
</ul>
</b>
<p>
<a name="acct"><h4>THE HOUSES SUBSTANDARD ACCOUNTING METHODS</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
The Price Waterhouse audit reveals that the House Office of Finance did not use 
generally accepted accounting principles when recording financial transactions. Instead, it kept 
track of House operations almost exclusively on a cash basis, tracking inflows and outflows of 
money. Revenue and obligations went unrecorded. Such a system is roughly similar to keeping 
track of everything an individual owns solely by reference to his checkbook. Indeed, consumers 
who had computerized their checkbooks were more sophisticated than the House, since its Office 
of Finance kept track of $700 million in annual salaries and other expenditures on hand-written 
ledgers.
<p>
Since the Office of Finance failed to keep track of such items as accounts receivable, 
accounts payable, inventory, furniture and equipment, and budgetary authority, House managers 
lacked information to make decisions about purchasing, leasing, repairing, or warehousing of 
House property.  Furthermore, since the Office did not keep track of debts incurred by the House 
(as when, for example, individual offices received items they had ordered), there was little 
assurance that sufficient funds would be available to pay these debts.  For instance, at the end of 
the third quarter of 1994 the House had over $39 million of outstanding but unrecorded 
obligations.  The dearth of information on House financial liabilities hamstrung the Offices 
ability to plan for future expenditures.
<p>
Generally accepted accounting principles dictate that financial statements offer the reader 
a high degree of credibility, are dependable, and fairly reflect the institution's financial position, 
routine operations expenses, and expected cash flows. The House accounting system and 
financial statements lacked these basic elements. Any flaw in a financial system that could 
jeopardize the safeguarding of its assets or materially misstates finances is considered a "material weakness" and a humiliating indictment of the designers of the system. The House audit 
uncovered  fourteen material weaknesses, the hazards of which are discussed below. 
<p>
<a name="controls"><h4>LOOSE CONTROLS CREATED OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEFT</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
Numerous Members and staff were paid twice for travel costs.  Auditors found over 2,200 
pairs of disbursements where the House Office of Finance may have paid twice for the same 
travel voucher. A more extensive examination of the 50 largest payments found 43 cases (86 
percent of the sample) in which the House reimbursed a Member or staffer twice -- with those 
duplicate payments totaling nearly $10,000.  There is no evidence that any overpayment in these 
43 cases was ever refunded to the House.  All 43 of the double reimbursements were triggered by 
applications that violate Congressional Handbook rules about timely application or inclusion of 
travel receipts. All 43 were processed anyway.
<p>
Another opportunity for diversion of funds lay in the Houses computerized 
reimbursement system. Numerous computer clerks in the House Office of Finance who enter the 
data file used to produce reimbursement checks had the opportunity to divert funds to themselves 
or to a confederate simply by substituting a different name and address.  The only safeguard 
against this possible problem was the payments listing sent to the relevant Member or committee 
office for review each quarter.  However, the volume of payments issued by the House made this 
control ineffective.
<p>
Security in House Computer Systems was weak or nonexistent.  Access was not frozen 
when invalid passwords were used.  Users were not logged out after a period of inactivity.  The 
system did not record attempts at unauthorized access.  No procedures were in place to end 
access by ex-employees, leaving the House exposed to the risk of  ex-employees changing or 
eliminating proprietary data.
<p>
Finally, House charge cards were used to purchase some items that fall outside their 
purchase authority. Although these cards are not supposed to be used for non-travel expenses, 
auditors found nearly 350 charges for "retail" items totaling more than $31,000. Although it 
appears that the public may have been reimbursed for the purchase of personal items, Members 
and staff should not be using a government charge card to purchase personal items. 
<p>
<a name="money"><h4>MEMBERS SPENT MONEY THEY DIDNT HAVE</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
At the end of fiscal 1994, Members had overspent the sum of their appropriated expense 
allowance by over $14 million.  This was a result of the House practice that set appropriations for 
Members expense accounts significantly below the sum of those 435 allowances, since it was 
assumed that some Members would not spend up to their limit.
<p>
In FY 1994, however, total spending on Members office accounts exceeded their appropriations. This $14 million shortfall was covered by reprogramming roughly $11.6 million 
from other FY 1994 House appropriations and $2.6 million from unused appropriations left over 
from prior years (FY 1991 and 1992).
<p>
The necessity of reprogramming funds demonstrates that the House Office of Finance's 
inadequate monitoring failed to prevent Member allowance overspending.  The Office failed to 
extrapolate spending trends over the course of the fiscal year, focusing only on spending that 
already had taken place.  
<p>
Five Members overspent their official allowances in 1994.  Since the Handbook specifies 
that any overspending Member is personally liable for the overage, the auditors referred the 
names of the five Members to the House Office of Finance for followup.
<p>
This problem of Member overspending is only one illustration of a general problem: 
House managers routinely failed to check whether they had funds available before ordering 
goods and services or writing payroll checks, creating the risk of spending funds the House did 
not have.  Although the managers of the Houses financial system had the capability of checking 
to see whether there was money available to spend on goods and services, they did not do so.  
House managers therefore never knew how much already had been committed, or whether there 
was any danger that the House might lack funds to cover expenditures.  Because of the routine 
near-the-limit use of Members allowances, and their collective under-funding, there was a 
particular danger of overspending those accounts.
<p>
<a name="inad"><h4>INADEQUATE CONTROLS LED TO FRANKING ABUSES</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
The audit revealed that Members may have broken House franking rules. The use of the 
frank (taxpayer-funded congressional mail) is regulated by Congress to lessen the possibility of 
Members' use of official resources to strengthen their reelection prospects. Two types of mass 
mailing regulations -- Franking Commission approval (to ensure that the mailing is not 
inappropriately self-publicizing) and deadline rules (to ensure that the mailing does not appear in 
voters mailboxes too soon before elections) -- appear to have been violated. In the course of 
sampling several hundred mailings, auditors found three instances where the House paid for 
printing of mass mailings without Franking Commission approval, and six instances where mass 
mailings apparently were sent after preelection deadlines. These are serious improprieties, since 
they suggest end runs around rules designed to ensure a minimum standard of fairness in federal 
elections.
<p>
<a name="ineff"><h4>INEFFICIENT ADMINISTRATION AND CARELESS RECORD-KEEPING: A RECIPE FOR WASTE AND CONFUSION</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
The auditors highlighted numerous areas of waste by House administrators: for example, 
deciding not to use temporary or part-time workers during peak workload periods, choosing 
instead to keep high staff levels throughout the year. Hundreds of full-time support employees 
were paid essentially to sit idle during the 241 days the House was not in session in 1994. House 
Members' paychecks were processed at a cost of roughly $46 apiece, although private companies 
could have done the job at less than 2 percent of the cost. House administrators also spent over 
$5 million on a computer that did not meet House needs. 
<p>
Auditors also detected numerous flaws in the Houses system of internal records. A 
lackadaisical attitude towards record-keeping requirements can lead to numerous problems: in 
addition to waste, opportunity for fraud, and administrative incoherence, poor record-keeping 
also breeds a careless attitude about getting the job done right. House records were extremely 
deficient in many areas. 
<p>
The Houses payroll policy permitted payroll adjustments to be filed by Members even 
after payday deadlines. Late payroll adjustments produced 3,400 supplemental paychecks during 
the audit period, resulting in $299,000 in overpayments to employees. Although most of those 
overpayments were repaid, nearly $13,000 in 1994 overpayments remains uncollected. This 
unwieldy system of pay distribution caused the House routinely to run a supplemental payroll 
every payday and incur large system and labor costs to produce and reconcile extra checks 
manually.
<p>
The incomplete records of the catering service run by House Restaurant Systems (HRS) 
provided remarkable opportunities to cheat the public. When HRS was privatized in July of 
1994, it sent numerous letters to Members and non-Members notifying them that they still had 
outstanding bills. Many putative debtors replied by stating that they had already paid their bills, 
and HRS accepted all these replies at face value. Its debt-tracking system was in "disarray," according to auditors, and HRS multiplied this disarray by failing to keep copies of the debt 
collection letters, any responses to them, its pre-July 1994 receivable balance, or a cash ledger 
which matched inflows of money to creditors. The only records that HRS was able to show 
investigators were check stubs and deposit slips for catering services that had been intermingled 
with "records" for other HRS functions. 
<p>
The Office of Finance failed to keep accurate records of property that the House owned 
and leased. Not only did a records vacuum make it difficult for House managers to discover 
efficiencies in buying, leasing, and maintaining equipment, but it increased the risk of 
undiscovered loss or theft of House property. Responsibility for property records was dispersed 
over ten different offices, and none of the three offices responsible for recording the bulk of 
House property kept ledgers that met the requirements followed by executive branch agencies. 
Combined with the absence of any system in the House Finance Office to track lease or sale 
costs, these accounting weaknesses increased the possibility of the House entering into contracts 
with unfavorable terms. For instance, the $9,000 that the Office of Finance paid to lease an 
outdated laser printer could have been used to lease or buy several newer printers. Auditors 
estimate that the House spent at least $750,000 on leases and related services for outdated 
equipment or equipment that could have been purchased more cheaply.
<p>
The House frequently was late in paying its bills. Of the $279 million paid during the 15-
month audit period, over 25 percent of the payments were for goods and services received over 
four months before the payment date, and over 15 percent of the payments were over a year old. 
Additional tests of payments made during the 104th Congress revealed that over $1.5 million 
covered services received in 1991, and some payments were made for services dating as far back 
as 1986.
<p>
In many cases, no House office retained the required Certificates of Relationship/Non-
Relationship to Any Current Member of Congress that each employee must complete and file 
when hired. This form is designed to alert House administrators to the possibility of nepotism in 
hiring. Absence of these required forms cripples a system designed to raise a red flag at the 
possibility of nepotistic hiring. Furthermore, House administrators failed to retain accurate leave 
cards, which record the amount of overtime pay and accrued leave to which House employees are 
entitled. Auditors who investigated a representative sample of 181 employees found that nearly 
half of the cards were missing, and a quarter of the remainder were useless because they were 
incompletely filled out. 
<p>
<a name="members"><h4>MEMBERS GOT A FREE RIDE</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
The House routinely subsidized many services Members purchase through office 
accounts. These subsidies obscured any comparison of costs between Members, made purchasers 
unaware of the true cost of goods, and forced other parts of the House to bear burdens incurred 
by Members' personal offices.
<p>
For instance, the House Office of Telecommunications charged Members only a fraction 
of the price of the communications service they purchased.  Members clerk-hire allowance was 
charged for staff salaries, but not for staff benefits, thus obscuring the payroll  amount available 
for each Member by roughly 30 percent.  Members were not charged for the funds the House 
spent on calendars (more than $1 million alone), the use of the House Folding Room to process 
mass mailings, the cost of furnishing Capitol offices, or the expense of numerous House 
computer services.  Such costs ultimately were paid for with funds appropriated for non-Member 
accounts.
<p>
Members also were allowed to spread out the cost of systems purchased so as to obscure 
their expense and, in some cases, escape part of their cost.  For instance, Members were given the 
option of spreading the cost of capital purchases over three years.  If a Member purchasing the 
equipment retired or failed to be reelected to office, those costs would be written off and 
subsidized by another House account, thus allowing Members to escape a substantial portion of 
the debt.
<p>
This system of hidden subsidies failed to hold purchasers accountable for the expenses 
they incur and gave them little incentive to manage expenses efficiently.
<p>
<b><a name="congress">IS CONGRESS ABOVE THE LAW?</h4></a></b>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
Many of the Houses financial problems would likely have been curbed had Congress 
been subject to the same laws and regulations that apply to the executive branch and other federal 
agencies. Numerous laws that apply to the executive branch, such as the Chief Financial Officers 
Act of 1990 and the Federal Managers Financial Integrity Act of 1982, do not apply to the 
House. The Antideficiency Act, which forbids any federal office from incurring obligations and 
spending monies that total more than its yearly appropriation during that fiscal year, almost 
certainly does not apply to the House. The House did not follow guidelines for federal agencies 
provided by the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program. Only the rules the House 
makes for itself and the procedures in the Congressional Handbook control House procedure, 
and those are easily skirted. 
<p>
Indeed, the House granted exceptions to its own rules so frequently as to make those 
rules, in some cases, operationally non-binding. For instance, the House had produced an 
Approved List of office equipment and software, which was intended to ensure reasonable prices, 
eliminate the necessity for multiple quotes, and avoid a lengthy bid solicitation process. Over 30 
percent of the $18 million that the House spent on equipment and software in the 103rd 
Congress, however, was on unapproved material for which Members had requested exemptions. 
The Committee on House Administration routinely granted exemptions, denying only 3 percent 
of the 1,026 exemption requests. 
<p>
A liberal exemption policy created numerous opportunities for waste and corruption:
<ul>
<li>Routine approval of reimbursement for travel vouchers that were submitted late or incomplete created the possibility for double payment to careless or dishonest filers.
<li>Numerous House offices required three price quotes when making purchases, but auditors found that 72 percent of the purchases of the House Office of Special Services and 100 percent of the purchases of House information Services were made without benefit of these multiple quotes. The majority of these purchases were made without benefit of any competitive 
bidding whatsoever. 
<li>Nearly 400 retroactive pay raises were approved for Members staffs -- a practice prohibited by the Congressional Handbook, presumably because it permits large lump sums of public money to be deposited in staffers accounts as bonuses.
</ul>
<p>
<a name="silver"><h4>THE SILVER LINING</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
The good news is that the new Congress, under the leadership of Speaker Newt Gingrich 
(R-GA), House Oversight Committee Chairman Bill Thomas (R-CA), Representative Jim Nussle 
(R-IA), its administrative officers, and the management team they brought in, has taken 
aggressive action to correct the deficiencies identified by the audit. Many of the 226 
recommendations the auditors made already have been implemented, and the remainder are being 
implemented. The Democratic leadership has pledged to work for full implementation of the 
audits recommendations and to continue the practice of annual open audits of the House.
<p>
<a name="concl"><h4>CONCLUSION</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
The numerous opportunities for waste, fraud, and corruption that Price Waterhouse found 
in the Houses financial system constitute an indictment of House officers, members of the 
House Administration Committee, and the House leadership that permitted this financial disaster 
to happen. This system is so punctured by missing records and other gaps that its accounts are 
fundamentally not auditable. The audit paints a portrait of business conducted through rules that 
were routinely overridden by the House leadership, which contributed to partisan abuse 
reminiscent of a Soviet-style bureaucracy. Although the stories it tells are eye-opening, its 
greatest importance lies in the recommendations for actions it implies. The House has taken 
quick action to eliminate the auditing defects that Price Waterhouse detected, and investigate the 
administrative abuses that the auditors noted they lacked the resources to pursue fully, by 
referring auditors questions directly to the Inspector General for a forensic audit. These 
questions include whether:
<ul>
<b><li>Exceptions to House Rules were granted in a partisan fashion;
<li>The House Restaurant System was defrauded;
<li>Retroactive pay hikes were granted inappropriately; and
<li>Franking and mass mailing rules were broken.
</ul>
</b>
In sum, the audits reveal a House of Representatives so penetrated by sloppy management 
practices that the public will likely never know exactly how many millions of dollars it wasted. 
The House audit scandal is an unhappy but predictable consequence of a hidebound institution 
hidden from public scrutiny, protected from the laws that govern its public and private 
counterparts, and thought by too many for too long to be invulnerable to shifts in control 
determined by the electoral process.

<h2>
CHINA VS. CHILDREN
</h2>

<P><blockquote><i>  
Thousands of children will die in communist China's state-run 
orphanages this year, and it won't be any accident.

</blockquote></i>


<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A former research specialist with the U.S. Census Bureau reports that 
"Chinese orphans are given sleeping pills instead of food, tied to cribs 
and chairs, left unchanged when soiled, denied medical care, and allowed 
to die of neglect." John Aird, author of a new book called "Slaughter of 
the Innocents: Coercive Birth Control in China," charges that "as many as 
90 percent of the children admitted to some institutions die there." That's 
because "China's leaders consider these children 'surplus' population. 
They try to prevent their birth by forced abortion." Chinese mothers-to-be 
who refuse to submit to government-mandated abortions are fined, 
beaten, imprisoned, and deprived of their homes and property. Even if 
they manage to deliver their babies alive, the newborns are still in danger. 
Writing in the April issue of The American Enterprise magazine, Aird 
asserts that Chinese doctors "work under orders by the authorities to kill 
all babies born without government permission."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
More than 14 million abortions will be performed in communist China 
this year, and American taxpayers will pay for many of them. The U.S. 
Government contributes to the United Nations Fund for Population 
Activities, which supports China's coercive birth control program. "When 
the coercion in the program became undeniable in 1993, statements of 
protest were issued by the Clinton administration," notes Aird. "Yet 
President Clinton then went on to restore U.S. funding," which the 
Reagan administration had suspended in 1985.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Strong words followed by weak actions sending a contrary signal have 
become the standard response of the Clinton administration to human 
rights offenses in China," observes Aird. Why aren't Americans 
protesting our government's support for China's murderous methods of 
undermining maternity? Aird speculates that "the unsubstantiated but 
widely held belief in a world population crisis has dulled public outrage 
over violations of reproductive freedom in China." He also suggests that 
"business interests intent on seeking profits by investing in China's 
booming economy do not want to risk strained relations with China over 
its human rights violations."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Whatever the reason, the American people have not sufficiently 
publicized their repugnance for these policies, and the indifference of our 
government has been interpreted as a tacit endorsement of Chinese 
methods. "China's rulers apparently now feel free to expand tyrannical 
practices not only in birth control but also in the treatment of political 
dissidents," observes Aird, and we are in part to blame. "Although 
Chinese leaders say publicly that foreign criticism of China's human 
rights record . . . will not be accepted, China has in practice shown itself 
to be extremely sensitive to determined criticism backed by potential 
actions."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Aird argues that the U.S. should "amend our immigration laws to 
recognize persecution under compulsory family planning programs as a 
basis for granting asylum. And we should withhold all funding from the 
United Nations Fund for Population Activities, the International Planned 
Parenthood Federation, and any other organization that provides 
assistance to China's harsh birth control program."

<h2> LAW OF THE SEA TREATY</h2>   
<P>
<blockquote><I>
   
The Clinton administration is trying to persuade the United States    
Senate to ratify a United Nations Treaty that Ronald Reagan refused to    
sign, with good reason, fourteen years ago!</I>   
</blockquote>

   
Despite abundant resources, America nevertheless lacks certain essential    
minerals, such as cobalt, bauxite, chromium, manganese, and platinum.    
Cobalt is essential for jet engines, magnetic materials for electronics,    
metal cutting, and mineral tools. Bauxite is essential to aluminum, and is    
also important to refractories, chemicals, packaging, mechanical    
equipment, and abrasives. Chromium is essential to metallurgical,    
refractory, and chemical industries. Manganese is essential to steel, pig    
iron, dry cell batteries, and various chemical processes. Platinum-group    
metals are essential to automobiles, chemical processing, the electrical    
industry, and petroleum refining.
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
   
We import most of our manganese from Russia and South Africa. Yet,    
the ocean floor extending from our West Coast to Hawaii is rich in    
deposits of this mineral. U.S. security interests may depend on our access    
to such vital resources at the bottom of the sea, but the financial    
investment required to bring them to the surface is tremendous, because    
the minerals are scattered on the ocean floor at depths of as much as    
20,000 feet. Nevertheless, American mining concerns have the capital    
and the technology to take on this challenge, if they can be assured of    
realizing a profit in the venture.
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
   
The Law of the Sea Treaty, currently being pushed by the Clinton    
administration, would give Third World nations control over the    
development and use of the deep seabed mineral resources now being    
mined by American firms. The Treaty's international controls and    
regulations would hamper the efforts of U.S. ocean-mining companies to    
continue harvesting strategic ocean minerals essential to our industry    
and to our military defense.
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
   
The Law of the Sea Treaty would surrender major political and strategic    
advantages to Russia, which is self-sufficient in the minerals that    
America extracts from the ocean floor. The Treaty would deny U.S.    
ownership of ocean minerals, while forcing American companies to use    
their technology and capital to mine these minerals for the benefit of    
unfriendly, anti-American countries.
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
   
The Law of the Sea Treaty would establish an International Seabed    
Authority, which would set both general production controls and specific    
production limits for ocean mining sites. Any American corporation    
intent on making the tremendous investment involved in mining the    
ocean floor would first have to seek approval from the Executive Council    
of the International Seabed Authority. If its request is approved, the    
American corporation would begin operations with the understanding    
that one-half of the approved mining tract will be set aside so that an    
international mining operation (set up by the Seabed Authority) can use    
the American company's geological data, technology, and money to    
compete against it!
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
   
The United Nations Law of the Sea Treaty threatens the sovereignty and    
security of our nation. It also jeopardizes the legitimate financial    
interests of U.S. businesses and the health of our country's economy. Any    
American politician who supports this treaty has some explaining to do.

<h2> The Real McCarthy</h2>


<i><blockquote>



What exactly did Senator Joseph McCarthy do to provoke such a storm 
of protest in the early 1950s? Just his job, that's all!
</blockquote></i>
<P>
As chairman of the Senate Committee on Government Operations, 
Senator Joseph McCarthy was responsible for "watching this vast 
bureaucracy -- to spot graft, incompetence, extravagance, and disloyalty. 
As chairman of this committee [McCarthy was] merely carrying out his 
mandate in searching for cases of disloyalty inside the government." 
McCarthy did not wage his "war on communism any place but inside the 
government of the United States," asserted John T. Flynn in a nationally 
syndicated radio broadcast in 1954.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Of the slightly more than 200 witnesses who were examined publicly by 
the committee, more than a third refused to answer, most of whom 
invoked the Fifth Amendment. Flynn reminded his listeners that "almost 
all of these were government workers at various level of importance -- 
and in bureaus or agencies peculiarly subject to secrecy. The evil 
McCarthy [was] shooting at [was] treason. The people he [was] stalking 
[were] traitors -- most of them dedicated to the interest of our deadliest 
enemy at home and in the world, Communist Russia."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In addition to exposing the communist conspirators at the Institute of 
Pacific Relations (who had betrayed China and most of Asia to the 
Russians), McCarthy also uncovered agents in the Government Printing 
Office. "A great number of highly secret documents are printed in the 
Government Printing Office," Flynn observed. "The Senator found there 
persons with impressive records of Communist activity. The FBI had 
reported these persons repeatedly but nothing was done about it." Flynn 
noted that, as a result of McCarthy's investigations, "the entire security 
panel in the department was removed and all the security regulations 
overhauled. The penalty [for stealing secret documents] was changed 
from a few days suspension to dismissal." McCarthy's Committee also 
"conducted investigations at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, where highly 
secret radar equipment [was] developed. This resulted in the suspension 
of 33 security risks from this very sensitive U.S. Army spot."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The recently released Venona documents confirm what Flynn concluded 
in his 1954 broadcast: that "the most important objective of the 
Communist conspiracy has been to get Communists or Communist dupes 
inside our government departments. Their aim [was] to keep Russia 
advised of what the American government [was] doing and, even more 
important, to actually take part in shaping the decisions on policy of our 
government. The decisions to abandon Czechoslovakia, Poland, 
Hungary, Yugoslavia, Eastern Germany, and a part of Austria to Russia 
as World War II ended were all accomplished by Communists and pro-
Reds in our State Department."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Infiltration of our government was "the most important enterprise of the 
Communist conspiracy in America," said John T. Flynn. "It has cost 
millions of dollars, the lives of numerous men, and incredible labor and 
patience on the part of the Communist leaders." Flynn insisted that 
"McCarthy was not persecuting radicals or even Communists. His aim 
was only at Communists and spies inside the American government."

<h2>Defense Bill Veto</h2>
<blockquote>
<i>President Clinton has demonstrated his commitment to "peacemaking" 
in Bosnia. At the same time, however, he has rejected efforts to provide 
for the defense of the United States.</blockquote></i>

<P>
The federal government has no constitutional authority to intervene in 
the internal affairs of foreign nations. It does, however, have the 
constitutional responsibility to defend our own country against foreign 
attack. Nevertheless, as 1995 drew to a close, President Clinton 
committed our government to an unconstitutional intervention in Bosnia 
and then vetoed a bill that would have provided a much-needed missile 
defense for America.

<BR>

The federal government has no constitutional authority to intervene in 
the internal affairs of foreign nations. It does, however, have the 
constitutional responsibility to defend our own country against foreign 
attack. Nevertheless, as 1995 drew to a close, President Clinton 
committed our government to an unconstitutional intervention in Bosnia 
and then vetoed a bill that would have provided a much-needed missile 
defense for America.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The 1996 defense authorization bill vetoed by Clinton represented "a 
serious effort to end America's present, absolute vulnerability to missile 
attack," says Frank Gaffney of the Coalition to Defend America. The bill 
would have required that the entire United States be protected against 
missile attack by the year 2003. Clinton's objection to the bill was that it 
would have put American policy "on a collision course with the ABM 
Treaty." That's what it would have done, all right, and it's about time we 
abrogated an outmoded, ill-advised treaty with a country that no longer 
exists.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Bipartisan majorities on Capitol Hill recognize that the time has come 
for the American people to be protected against missile attacks from all 
quarters by deployed defensive systems," says Gaffney. "Mr. Clinton, on 
the other hand, believes the American people should not be protected by 
such systems, lest a 1972 treaty that effectively prohibits their 
deployment be jeopardized." This difference of opinion as to whether 
America should be defended or "deliberately left vulnerable, and perhaps 
exposed, to missile attack" could be a defining issue in the 1996 
presidential campaign.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Gaffney points out that vetoes of defense authorization bills helped 
decide two previous presidential contests. In 1978, President Jimmy 
Carter vetoed the Pentagon's fiscal 1979 authorization legislation 
because he thought it provided too much money for defense and because 
he objected to several of the projects it authorized. "Ronald Reagan was 
able to use this veto as a prime example of the differences between his 
determination to rebuild America's military and Mr. Carter's refusal to 
do so," recalls Gaffney. Giving that veto symbolic value contributed 
greatly to Reagan's election.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Then, in 1988, President Reagan vetoed the fiscal 1989 defense 
authorization bill on the grounds that it did not provide sufficient 
resources for defense and in particular for anti-missile systems," says 
Gaffney. "This action once again showcased differences between 
Democrats (who then controlled Congress) and Republicans on security 
policy, contributing to the sound drubbing Vice President George Bush 
gave Michael Dukakis in the '88 election."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Bill Clinton's veto of the 1996 defense authorization bill could help 
decide the outcome of the 1996 presidential election, says Gaffney, 
provided the Republican candidates "make the most of it by clearly 
establishing that, if elected, one of their first orders of business will be the prompt deployment of U.S. missile defenses."

<title>Duplantier "CAREERS" Bill -- 5/24/96	 </title>

<h2>"CAREERS" BILL</h2>
<P>
<blockquote><I>  
  
Americans are lucky to live in a society in which education is available   
to all and the individual is free to choose what he will make of himself.   
In totalitarian countries, the State determines who will get the benefit of   
education and what job opportunities a person will have.</BLOCKQUOTE></I>
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
  
There is no clamor in the heartland for radical restrictions on the   
freedom Americans enjoy to improve their minds and plot the course of   
their careers. There is no grassroots support for turning our public   
schools into vocational training centers for a docile national workforce.   
How, then, to explain the progress of the CAREERS bill and the   
Workforce Development Act?
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
  
Under these bipartisan education bills now moving through Congress,   
the Federal Government would collect taxes, issue educational   
regulations, and then pass the proceeds and the power to State   
Governors, circumventing their legislatures altogether. This massive   
legislation would restructure public schools throughout America,   
building on the Goals 2000 and School-to-Work Acts passed in 1994.   
H.R.1617 (known as the CAREERS bill) passed the House last   
September by a vote of 345 to 79, and its companion S. 143 (called the   
Workforce Development Act) passed the Senate in October by 95 to 2. 
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
  
More than 60 Republican members of the Missouri House of   
Representatives recently fired off a letter to House Speaker Newt   
Gingrich, objecting to the fact that H.R. 1617 "centralizes unprecedented   
powers at the federal level" and "supersedes state laws and further takes   
us, the local elected officials of the people of this state, out of the process   
of education." Noting that the CAREERS act "amends out the state   
legislature, replacing it with the Governor," the State Representatives   
assert that "this practice of avoiding the Legislature is unacceptable and   
flies in the face of the principle of local control of education." 
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
  
The Missouri Republicans also charge that unelected bureaucrats are   
attempting to grab power over school curricula though a grant   
application process. The grant applications that Governors now submit   
in a bid for federal funds bind the states to conform to "standards" and   
"assessments" written by federal or state bureaucrats insulated from the   
influence of local citizens and their elected representatives. The grant   
applications also bind the states to spend money not yet appropriated by   
their legislatures.
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
  
Fourteen California State Senators also dispatched a letter calling on   
Congress to "kill" H.R. 1617. They too objected to the transfer of   
legislative prerogative into the hands of the Governor, and opposed the   
establishment of a "National Electronic Data Base" to monitor the   
progress of students along predetermined career paths.
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
  
Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois voted for the CAREERS bill last year, but   
has since reversed himself. He is now urging the repeal of Goals 2000   
and the School to Work Act, as well as the defeat of H.R. 1617 and   
S.143. Such legislation, he contends, would turn schoolchildren into   
"guinea pigs who will become the human resources for the global labor   
market." Is that really what we want for our children?

<h2>MSAs</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
 A march to protest the inequities of managed health care is planned 
for our nation's capital this month. Opposition to the tactics of 
health maintenance organizations is bubbling over.
</i></blockquote>

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Health maintenance organizations (known as HMOs) suffer from a built-
in conflict of interest; the gatekeepers and the CEOs make more money 
when they deny their policyholders the right to see a specialist. 
Congressional Republicans have a good answer to the problem, however -
- one that would put extra money in the pockets of workers whose real 
wages have declined, and ease the strain of downsizing by allowing 
them to take some of their benefits with them when they leave a 
company.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The solution is Medical Savings Accounts (known as MSAs), which most 
House Republicans campaigned on in 1994. Congress passed Rep. Bill 
Archer's excellent MSA bill in the Balanced Budget Act, but Clinton 
vetoed the measure. Then the House passed it again in its health care 
reform bill, which is now pending. But President Clinton and the 
Washington press corps are trying to bamboozle the Dole-Gingrich 
Congress into passing the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill without MSAs, in an 
effort to resurrect the Hillary health-care plan resoundingly rejected 
in 1994.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Medical Savings Accounts are the best solution to all the problems 
connected with health care: the high cost, the choice of doctors, 
portability, pre-existing conditions, job lock, uninsured Americans, 
gatekeepers, capitation, deductibles, co-payments, paperwork, long-
term care, the looming insolvency of Medicare, and even the decline in 
real wages. Here is how MSAs work: An employer buys his employee a 
high-deductible policy and pre-pays the deductible (up to $2,000 per 
year for singles and $4,000 for families) by putting it each year into 
an individual Medical Savings Account. The employee can use this ready 
cash to visit the doctors, hospitals, and clinics of his choice, and 
the high-deductible policy covers any additional expenses. The 
employee owns his own MSA, and can take it with him when changing 
jobs, thus solving the problems of portability, pre-existing 
conditions, and job lock. MSA funds are available for many medical 
expenses often not covered by company plans or by Medicare. Best of 
all, any MSA funds that an employee does not spend will accumulate in 
his own tax-free, interest-bearing savings account. MSAs thus restore 
consumer discipline to the medical marketplace, providing incentives 
to save.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Archer bill would give MSAs pretty much the same tax-deductibility 
that is now enjoyed exclusively by company-paid plans. Our present 
system unfairly grants tax-deductibility only to plans owned by 
employers, but not to plans that allow individual employees to own 
their own health insurance, control their own health care spending, or 
set up their own plan. The officers of big corporations enjoy gold-
plated health insurance paid for with tax-deductible dollars, but the 
self-employed must buy health insurance with after-tax income. It's 
time for Congress to give us the solution to all these problems: 
Medical Savings Accounts.

<h2>
TAIWAN
</h2>

<P><blockquote><i>  
The missile tests and naval exercises that China conducted in March 
were meant to intimidate the people of Taiwan, and certainly 
accomplished that objective. But they may have had another, unintended 
impact: reminding the rest of the world that the People's Republic is not 
to be trusted.
</blockquote></i>


<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"On Taiwan, the people enjoy freedom of speech, freedom to choose their 
politicians, and the freedom to engage in a market economy," says Robert 
Morris, chairman and president of America's Future, the producer of this 
broadcast. "On the mainland, in the People's Republic of China, people 
are repressed politically and economically by a brutal communist 
dictatorship. Any dissension results in jail." The dramatically superior 
living conditions of the free Chinese on Taiwan are a daily affront to the 
mainland communists.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
China's missile testing exercise amounted to a de facto blockade of the 
sea and air lanes leading to Taiwan, which derives 40 percent of its gross 
domestic product from exports. Shipping had to be diverted from the 
country's two major ports, and air flights had to be re-routed. The 
psychological impact was even greater. The Taiwanese stock market has 
fallen 625 points since China's first series of threatening missile tests in 
July 1995, dropping 62 points in one day after the second series of tests 
was announced in March. "There have been shows of force before," says 
Morris, "but not in recent history has anything so directly affected 
Taiwan's commerce and its people."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Taiwan is an "unlikely success story," observes Morris. "Isolated off the 
south coast of China, the 19,000-square-mile island has blossomed into a 
free and vigorous country. It had become by 1990 the world's 13th-
largest trading nation. During the postwar period, its economy grew more 
rapidly than that of any other nation -- an annual average of over eight 
percent." Morris reports that Taiwan's west coast "is covered with all the 
trappings of a successful industrialized nation. Everywhere new suburbs 
have sprung up, linked by modern highways. Rice farms, dating back 
hundreds of years, now sit next to new, modern factories that ship 
products worldwide."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Morris says Taiwan's 21 million people "increasingly enjoy a lifestyle 
similar to those in the West. Its per capita annual income of $11,000 
ranks it among the world's top 25 nations, and stands in sharp contrast to 
the mainland average of $370." But the freedom and prosperity of 
Taiwan are "threatened by the hostile People's Republic of China, with a 
nuclear arsenal and the world's largest armed force. The communists 
maintain unbendingly that Taiwan is no more than a breakaway province, 
arguing that the free Chinese must acknowledge Beijing's sovereignty 
and submit to 'peaceful unification.'"
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Robert Morris of America's Future recommends that the United States 
"increase arms sales to Taiwan and help the free Chinese create a modern 
defense system." He says the United States "should also expand 
economic and trade cooperation, and encourage other nations to accept 
Taiwan into the world community."

<h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES</h4>  
 <i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.  <br>
 F.R. Duplantier <br>
 September 29, 1995  <br>
  </i><hr>

<h2>Educators Attack Family Values  </h2></center>
 
An education expert says that "challenges from conservative citizen  
groups objecting to particular instructional strategies and materials" are  
hampering efforts "to make fundamental changes in public schooling "  <p>
  
  
Writing in the September 1993 issue of Phi Delta Kappan, Indiana  
University professor of education Martha McCarthy tipped off her  
colleagues to a new trend in parental protests against teaching materials.   
"Until the late 1970s the targets were usually individual books," she  
observed. "While the list of individual books under attack continues to  
grow. recent protests -- often orchestrated by national conservative  
groups -- are more likely to focus on entire textbook series and  
components of the instructional program." <p> 
  
That means that pet theories and vested interests are at stake. Take, for  
instance the Whole Language approach to reading. McCarthy noted that  
"the most widely challenged textbook series" at that time was Harcourt  
Brace Jovanovich's 10-volume anthology Impressions, which uses the  
Whole language method. "Most of the challenges focus on the series'  
subject matter rather than on its pedagogical approach," she conceded.  
"but the controversy associated with Impressions may have implications  
for the future of Whole-Language instruction."  <p>
  
McCarthy reported that conservatives have also attacked the Quest  
curriculum for teaching relativism and disrespect for parental authority,  
the Tactics for Thinking program for teaching New Age beliefs, and   
Outcome Based Education for teaching hardly anything. She noted that  
"instruction pertaining to values clarification, self-esteem, multicultural  
education, evolution, AIDS education, and global education are being  
contested as anti-Christian, anti-American, or other vise inappropriate."  
But the meddling doesn't stop there, McCarthy continued. "Several  
instructional strategies currently touted in the education literature, such as  
collaborative learning and thematic instruction, are being challenged  
because they shift to students some of the responsibility that was formerly  
lodged with the teacher."<p>  
  
Such challenges, McCarthy warned her peers, "call into question some of  
the basic assumptions of school restructuring initiatives," thereby posing  
"far more serious threats to efforts to improve the public school program  
than do challenges to individual novels." What's more, she added, "the  
success rate of those initiating challenges has been rising." Even  
unsuccessful challenges sometimes delay construction of educational  
utopias, "for the controversy itself can disrupt school operations and  
interfere with implementation of the program." Then there's the dreaded  
ripple effect: "When materials or programs are attacked in one school  
district, the controversy often affects other districts."  <p>
  
In a fit of candor, McCarthy advised her colleagues to drop their pretense  
of impartiality and give up trying to appease parents. "Instead of arguing  
that the challenged instructional programs are value-neutral or trying to  
sanitize the curriculum so that no groups are offended, policymakers and  
educators need to take a stand," exhorted McCarthy. She thus confirmed  
what many conservative parents have suspected all along: that educators  
are fighting an undeclared war against families with traditional values.  
We should thank Martha McCarthy for letting parents know what they're  
up against.  <p>

<h2>
Troubled by the Issues
</h2>



<P><blockquote><i>  
When it comes to covering political campaigns, the members of the 
media have a way of focusing on the personalities of the candidates and 
ignoring the issues. Maybe it's because they don't want us to think about 
what's really at stake.
</blockquote></i>


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


What are the issues in the 1996 Presidential election? The deployment of 
American troops to Bosnia is one. The court-martial of Army Specialist 
Michael New for refusing to wear the United Nations uniform is another. 
The UN itself is a big issue -- the funding of it, its so-called peacemaking 
efforts, its impact on U.S. sovereignty. Serious voters want to know if our 
next President will acknowledge that America has no strategic interest in 
Bosnia and bring our troops home. Will he make amends to Michael New 
and take steps to ensure that no U.S. soldier is ever again subjected to 
foreign command? Will he oppose independent taxing authority for the 
UN? Will he oppose U.S. funding for UN military ventures? Will he 
oppose treaties -- like the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and the 
UN Convention on the Rights of the Child -- that threaten U.S. 
sovereignty?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What about NAFTA, GATT, and the World Trade Organization? The 
Mexican bailout? Illegal immigration and multilingualism? These are 
issues of major concern to many Americans. Will our next President 
acknowledge the real impact of so-called free-trade treaties on our 
economy? Will the jobs of American workers mean more to him than the 
bad investments of New York banks? Will he cut off all taxpayer benefits 
to illegal aliens and support a moratorium on legal immigration until the 
problem of illegals can be addressed? Will he endorse English as our 
official language and withdraw support for bilingual programs that retard 
the assimilation of immigrants?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What about education and crime-fighting? Presidential candidates like to 
talk about these issues, even though both are properly handled at the local 
level. Will our next President acknowledge state supremacy in these 
matters? Will he terminate the unconstitutional federal intervention in 
education by abolishing the Department of Education and repealing 
Goals 2000? Will he condemn the killings carried out by federal agents at 
Ruby Ridge and Waco, and make sure that Americans are never again 
terrorized by their own government? Will he oppose legislation -- like the 
so-called anti-terrorism bill -- that would authorize federal agents to 
violate the constitutionally-protected liberties of Americans? Will he 
oppose the government's taking of private lands for bogus environmental 
reasons?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Where does he stand on term limits, secret pay raises for Congressmen, 
and Congressional pensions? What's his position on taxpayer handouts to 
wealthy organizations such as Planned Parenthood and AARP? Does he 
support or reject affirmative action quotas and set-asides? These are just 
some of the issues that the press passes over as it plays up personalities, 
polls, and party platitudes. But serious voters know what the issues are, 
and they want a candidate who will address them.

<h2>
BIG GOVERNMENT THREATENS RIGHTS
</h2>

<P><blockquote><i>  
The Federal Government compels us to fork over fully one-third of our 
income, and it uses that money to infringe on the civil liberties protected 
by our Bill of Rights.
</blockquote></i>


<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects our right to 
practice our religious faith freely; and yet, the Supreme Court has often 
invoked this amendment to justify decisions restricting our freedom of 
religion. The nation's highest Court has prohibited the teaching of 
religion in public schools, as well as the recitation of prayers and the 
reading of the Bible.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Second Amendment protects the right of the individual to own and 
make use of guns. Liberal politicians view gun ownership as an 
interference with the expansion of federal power, which of course it is, 
for an armed citizenry is much more difficult to subjugate than one 
without weapons. Those who don't like the Second Amendment exploit 
every public tragedy involving firearms as propaganda for tighter 
restrictions on their use.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Our right to privacy, protected by the Third and Fourth Amendments, is 
also under attack. The Federal Government seems determined to increase 
its control over all of us by prying into our daily lives. Tax collectors and 
regulatory agents have been snooping on us for years; and now, in the 
name of combating terrorism, the President demands wiretapping 
privileges for federal agents to investigate any suspected felony. There 
are 1,300 federal felonies. You could be guilty of one right now without 
even knowing it.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Fifth Amendment not only protects us against double jeopardy and 
self-incrimination; it also prohibits the confiscation of our property by the 
Federal Government without proper compensation. Yet, today, 
Americans frequently find their property devalued by governmental 
edicts restricting the use of it -- or even taken from them altogether in the 
interest of some putative public good.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Sixth Amendment guarantees our right to a trial by jury in a criminal 
case. How juries are selected and instructed, however, often determines 
how effective they are. Unfortunately, jurors are routinely screened on 
the basis of their philosophical or religious beliefs, and those who show 
any propensity for questioning the evidence in the case or the validity of 
the law are usually dismissed posthaste. The Seventh Amendment 
protects our right to a trial by jury in a civil suit, but the growth of 
regulatory agencies has enabled unelected bureaucrats to bypass that 
safeguard -- and instead act as prosecutor, judge, and jury. There are over 
13 million federal bureaucrats meddling in the daily affairs of American 
citizens.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some federal judges and regulatory agents simply disregard the Eighth 
Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable fines and punishments. Some 
also ignore the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, which stipulate that the 
people and the States reserve to themselves all rights not expressly 
granted to the Federal Government. One thing is clear: If Americans want 
to retain the liberties protected by our Bill of Rights, we'd better make our 
voices heard.

Duplantier</a> <br>January 10, 1996
<br></i><hr><h2>Abolish the Department of Education</h2></center><P> 
[Abolishing the Department of Education would curb the federal 
government's baleful influence on public schools and save as much as 
$70 billion a year in taxpayers' money.] 
 
 <P>
Early in the 1976 presidential elections, the National Education 
Association threw its important support behind a relatively unknown 
candidate named Jimmy Carter. The NEA endorsement gave visibility to 
the obscure, one-term Georgia governor, adding momentum to his 
ultimately-successful campaign. The endorsement came with a price, 
however, one that President Carter gladly paid. The establishment of the 
federal Department of Education was the quid pro quo that the National 
Education Association received for the push it provided to the political 
presumptions of a pandering peanut farmer. 
 <P>
Of course, the federal government was meddling in education long before 
then, but the creation of a separate cabinet-level department has greatly 
exacerbated the problem. Congress now appropriates $70 billion per year 
for what it calls education. Roughly half of this amount goes to the 
administration of 244 separate programs in the Department of Education. 
The rest is spent by 30 other federal agencies on 308 overlapping 
programs. There are more than 90 separate federal preschool and child 
care programs, administered by eleven different agencies and 20 different 
offices. There are 86 separate federal teacher training programs, 
administered by nine different departments. There are at least 46 separate 
federal youth development programs, administered by eight different 
agencies. None of these programs is necessary, and most of them are 
redundant. 
 <P>
The Federal Government's 30-year experiment with education funding 
has failed miserably. Illiteracy has reached epidemic proportions, and 
Scholastic Aptitude Test scores have dropped so dramatically that the 
Educational Testing Service is now adding nearly 100 points to every 
score to conceal this embarrassing decline. Abolishing the Department of 
Education will not adversely affect our public schools, which flourished 
before the department was created and will survive its termination. 
Federal spending in public schools is only about six percent of their total 
budget, and precious little of it supports legitimate academic pursuits. 
Layoffs of superfluous administrative personnel could easily offset a six-
percent downsizing. 
 <P>
Establishing a federal Department of Education may have worked 
wonders for the National Education Association, but it has done nothing 
positive for America's public schools. In fact, it has had an entirely 
deleterious effect, further weakening local control and adding costly 
government regulations at the expense of academic curricula. The fact 
that it hasn't worked is a good judgment for abolishing the Department of 
Education, but the best argument of all is that the Department is simply 
unconstitutional. The U.S. Constitution  makes no mention of education, 
and provides no authority for the federal government to meddle in local 
schools. The federal government has inserted itself into numerous areas 
beyond its constitutional jurisdiction, and it's time for Americans to insist 
that it return to its proper concerns. Eliminating the Department of 
Education would be a good start.

<p>
<b>BARBARA FRANKLIN:</b> Good morning. I'm Barbara Franklin, and I want to welcome you on behalf of The Heritage Foundation and the American Trader Initiative Advisory Council, of which I am the chairman. This Council is a newly created entity here at Heritage. It is a group of business and public policy leaders who advise The Heritage Foundation about international trade issues and then work with Heritage to advance the free trade agenda in any way we can.

<p>Our topic today, "Expanding NAFTA to Include Chile: The Next Step for Free Trade," is one of the most important steps that we can take in this hemisphere. I will make a few introductory comments to set the stage, and then we will turn to our three panelists, each of whom is approaching the subject from a slightly different perspective.

<p>When I served as Secretary of Commerce, NAFTA and Chile was one of our most exciting initiatives. Enterprise for the Americas had been announced earlier by President Bush and was a visionary idea of linking the Western Hemisphere in free trade. This hemisphere includes 700 million people and has an annual output of more than $8 trillion.

<p>The first item on that agenda was the North American Free Trade Agreement, which linked the U.S., Canada, and Mexico and went into effect in 1994. While I was in office and NAFTA was under negotiation, there literally wasn't a week that went by that a foreign minister or economic minister from a Latin American country didn't call saying, "I want our country to be on the NAFTA list."  It was that important to our friends in this hemisphere.

<p>In the summer of 1992, then-President Aylwin of Chile came to the U.S. to meet with President Bush. One of the purposes of his trip was to ask that Chile be the next country on the NAFTA short list, after Mexico. I was present when President Bush gave him that commitment. President Clinton came into office in 1993 and reaffirmed that commitment at the Summit of the Americas in December 1994.

<p> A year has passed since the summit in Miami. The obvious questions are: Why hasn't this happened?  And what can we do about it?

<p>There is a great window of opportunity here. I believe that this hemisphere is more important to the U.S. than is generally realized -- and vice versa. Our friends in Latin America have done a superb job in reinventing their economies, bringing economic reforms into play, and also bringing democracy to the forefront, so much so that this hemisphere is turning out to be a great bulwark for both economic reform and democracy.

<p>Some countries in Latin America are among the fastest growing in the world. In fact, Latin America is the fastest-growing regional market for U.S. exports. Between 1988 and 1994, U.S. exports to Latin America and the Caribbean have more than doubled, from $46 billion in 1988 to $98 billion in 1994. And these exports are currently supporting two million American jobs. These are not insignificant numbers, and there is even greater potential than has been realized so far.

<p>Chile has done a remarkable job with its economy and its transition to democracy. Trade between our two countries has increased quite dramatically. Our exports to Chile in 1994 were $2.7 billion, and Chile shipped $1.8 billion in products to the U.S. Investment in Chile has grown dramatically over this period. It would seem that Chile is a natural partner for the U.S. and a natural member of NAFTA.

<p>Why, then, the slowdown in this process?  I will suggest a couple of reasons. First, NAFTA's image was tarnished by the devaluation of the Mexican peso in December 1994. Why the Mexican peso collapsed is a subject for another discussion: however, the devaluation was not caused, in any way, by NAFTA, although NAFTA's opponents are creating the perception that somehow there was a cause and effect.

<p>Second, the President needs fast-track negotiating authority to negotiate an agreement, have it voted up or down by the Congress and not nitpicked by hundreds of amendments. Then the next question is: Why can't we get fast-track authority renewed?  This requires passage by Congress because the current negotiating authority has expired.

<p>Here we get into politics, where there is a real difference of opinion. The Administration insists on the inclusion of environmental and labor provisions in the fast-track negotiating authority, and the Republican majority in Congress wants a so-called clean fast-track bill. Now we're moving into a presidential election year, and it appears that trade issues are not on the top of anybody's agenda. Perhaps this is because trade is thought to be too controversial, which is really unfortunate.

<p>Expanding free trade around the world is the way to grow the American economy and to grow the world's economy. In fact, it's the only way to do it. More trade among the nations of the world is the path to increased prosperity and job creation in the U.S. and all around the world. So we should do all we can to advance the free-trade agenda.

<p>What we propose to explore today is why this agenda -- at least with regard to NAFTA -- seems to have slowed down. We have three excellent panelists. Our first speaker is Stephen Lande.<sup1</sup>
<p>
<b>STEPHEN LANDE:</b> In Washington today, there's a lot of self-reinforcing going on about the success of NAFTA, and the truth is that NAFTA has been a success. The situation in Mexico would be much worse today if we did not have NAFTA. Try to picture what would have happened, in terms of the currency devaluation, without NAFTA. Certainly Mexico has not collapsed as occurred during the 1980s. It will take Mexico only a year or two to come out of its current problem.
<p>
The feeling in Washington trade circles is, "Let's just get on with business."  And I agree 100 percent with Secretary Franklin that the real objective is to figure out how to get fast track, and how to get this Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) negotiation underway, because it's really in everyone's interest.
<p>
The problem is that, outside the Beltway, there is a perception that NAFTA is not working. Whether you look at the polls, listen to radio talk shows (the new barometers of public opinion), read the local newspaper editorials, or listen to the speeches being made on the campaign trail, it is clear that NAFTA is not considered a success and that the idea of moving beyond NAFTA into more free-trade agreements is not on the immediate agenda.
<p>
If one talks about what the trade agenda will be next year, one talks China-Japan and Japan-China. Those are the two countries against which we can retaliate. There's a certain moral issue at stake in both of these countries, and it's not very painful to take a tough position on China or Japan.
<p>
So the problem that we are facing is that we do have an inside/outside-the-Beltway mentality, and during an election year, particularly, the outside-the-Beltway mentality plays a larger role than at other times.
<p>
I will not review why we should enter into an agreement with Chile, or why Chile, from any rational economic viewpoint, is a win/win situation. Chile was chosen as a negotiating target principally because it was easy to do, and because the Treasury Department -- not the Trade Department, but the Treasury Department -- a few years ago wanted to reward Chile because it had followed very responsible economic and financial policies. That's how the selection was made. If we can't do Chile, which is the least controversial country the U.S. can negotiate with in Latin America and which has fulfilled all of the requirements for NAFTA membership, then perhaps there are internal U.S. problems that should be considered.
<p>
Among them is the difference between election-year mentality and post-election mentality. Whoever is elected President will look at the situation differently in 1997 than he would during the 1996 election year. I suspect that the movement towards Latin American integration will intensify again in 1997, regardless of who is elected President. Should President Clinton be re-elected, the process may accelerate because second-term Presidents historically look more at the history books than first-term Presidents. Certainly President Clinton has a vision of what he would like to accomplish, and part of that vision includes becoming the chief architect of an FTAA by the year 2000.
<p>
One of the better USTRs -- and one I've had the pleasure of working for -- was Bob Strauss, who, in the best Yogi Berra style, used to always say, "If you ever come up to a wall, figure out a way to go around it."  We have spent too much time in this country focusing on this question of labor and the environment. There has not been a new thought on the issue in more than a year. Both sides definitely believe they are absolutely correct as to whether there is a relationship between labor and trade.
<p>
Recently, in that vein, a very good book was just published by Nora Lustig entitled <i>Coping with Austerity: Poverty and Inequality in Latin America.</i> In that book, Dr. Lustig focuses on a view shared generally by both Americans and Latin Americans: There can be no serious economic growth while maintaining large degrees of income inequality. That is because the size of the market is reduced.

<p>Dr. Lustig argues very persuasively in her book that the best way to eliminate economic inequality is through economic growth. A government role may or may not be helpful, but it is only through economic growth that real progress is possible. Perhaps an argument like this may succeed in changing the debate.

<p>The point is that if there is no activity over the next few months -- although that's a question mark, because sometimes issues unexpectedly pick up speed in Washington -- we should try to move away from labor and environmental linkages. The second point is that we should keep the momentum going in the Chile-NAFTA discussions by developing ideas among private sectors. Think tanks in Chile and the U.S. could begin to develop the outline of what an agreement should look like. 

 <p>Whether or not there will be unofficial government input in this process, I don't know. But that discussion could begin, based on the question "What would the really meaningful commitments be in a NAFTA-Chile agreement?"  There are a couple of tough issues in the negotiation with Chile. For example, how do you deal with perishable agriculture (because this is an area where Chile is fairly efficient) when there is some seasonal overlap with the U.S.?  How do you deal with capital investments or capital movement?  Chile has argued that one reason why it has avoided the problems faced by other countries is that it does have a limited form of capital control. Chile may say this is something the U.S. needs in the future, and it may be worth working on.

<p>A third way -- and this has been mentioned in what we always like to call the bible of Washington trade experts, <i>Inside U.S. Trade and Inside NAFTA</i> -- is through Mexico and Canada, who are beginning to discuss our negotiations with Chile. Another way to keep the process moving is to develop models. People love to develop models; now, I guess, the expression in the hemisphere is "paths."  We can have paths to NAFTA, the expansion of NAFTA, and Chilean acceptance of NAFTA.

<p>I can picture a scenario where Canada, which has no preferential agreement with Chile now, negotiates a free-trade agreement with Chile. Perhaps they aim to make it a NAFTA-level free-trade agreement. This would give Mexico the opportunity, at it does have a free-trade agree-ment with Chile, to negotiate without delving into all the areas of NAFTA. Perhaps Mexico might work with Canada, not on the duty reduction parts of the agreement, but in terms of bringing the agreement to the NAFTA level.

<p>Perhaps the U.S. will decide to work on a couple of chapters that do not require fast-track approval. The U.S. may negotiate intellectual property rights. I also do not believe that the U.S. has a bilateral investment treaty with Chile, and that too could be discussed.

<p>At least the U.S. may allow momentum to continue. This would provide for the U.S. to proceed further toward its goal. It would certainly have the advantage of serving as a counter-weight to Chile's negotiations with other South American countries. Originally, it was thought that Chile might actually negotiate a free trade agreement with Mercosur by the end of 1995. They did not make the deadline, but an agreement is expected by year end 1996. Further, they have committed that within fifteen years -- which is the normal time it takes to phase in a free trade agreement -- there will be free trade between Chile and the Mercosur countries. The objective now is to conclude the details for this agreement as soon as possible.
<p>
<b>BARBARA FRANKLIN:</b> Thank you, Steve. Our next speaker is Dr. Jerry Haar.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
<b>DR. JERRY HAAR:</b> Roy McClaren, the Minister of International Trade of Canada, in August 1995 gave a major policy address in Canada in which he said that it is a shame where things stand right now with regard to Chile's entry into NAFTA. This could be a serious setback for the entire movement toward free trade in the Americas, he said, and the achievement of a Free Trade Area of the Americas by the year 2005.
<p>
Symbolically, I think that's true. Chile is a country that is in the right place at the wrong time. Virtue is not its own reward. Chile has been caught up not in foreign trade and international concerns, but rather in purely domestic ones. A recent poll of American voters and their opinions about trade confirmed the worst. A majority of American voters feel that tariffs ought to be raised on those nations whose products are in surplus with the United States: If a country runs a significant surplus with the United States, tariffs on their exports ought to be increased. Another finding in the poll of American voters is that those countries whose workers receive low wages also ought to be subjected to tariff increases, since the low wage is deemed an unfair trade advantage. Finally, twice as many of the respondents to the poll blamed trade rather than technological advances as the main reason for the stagnation of American manufacturing wages.
<p>
Obviously, America's public and private school systems have failed to provide economic education in the classroom, and to explain to individuals what market capitalism is all about. When you combine the poll results with the very unhealthy trend in the United States now towards nativism, isolationism, and neo-protectionism, as espoused by a small but influential clique of Republican and Democratic elements in Congress, the climate clearly bodes ill for free trade.
<p>
I think we're facing a new crisis of confidence in the United States as to whether we're going to be a player in the world scene, and whether we believe in sharing the fruits of democratic capitalism with those who have played, fair and square, by the rules.
<p>
Let me say this about Chile: Chile is not Mexico. It doesn't share a common border with the United States. It doesn't have a human rights problem, and its labor, environmental, drug, and financial problems pale in comparison with Mexico. Foreign direct investment in Chile increased 70 percent from 1993 to 1994 and is supposed to double by the end of 1996. Moreover, the nature of Chile's manufactured export base is such that 40 percent of its exports are commodity products. Chile is not in any way, shape, or form a trade threat to the United States.
<p>
So the problem, basically, is one of extraordinarily bad timing, poor education, lack of education, and -- among certain legislators and constituents in the United States -- misunder-standing what this is all about.
<p>
To recap the amazing progress that Chile has made, we're talking about an annual average increase in gross national product of 6 percent in the last 10 years and 7.7 percent growth in 1995. That's uncanny. Inflation, less than 8 percent; unemployment, 5 percent; savings and domestic investment, 27 percent of GNP. 
<p>
 What Chile has done with its social security system and the privatization of its pension funds is what we ought to be following here in the United States. There are 22 different pension funds which Chileans can invest in, and what is the annual real return?  Thirteen percent, as opposed to the Social Security fund that a lot of us have the misfortune of being required to contribute to, that has a return of only 3 percent. You can't move out of that fund or fire your broker, because with the confiscatory nature and monopoly that the U.S. government has on Social Security, there's nothing we can do about it.
<p>
This enormous amount of money in the growth of Chile has enabled them to make an early payout on the country's external debt. They have paid their foreign debt in advance. They have trade surpluses of 1.8 percent of the GDP and the highest rating of Latin American countries in Standard and Poor's risk classification. On the World Competitiveness Council's index, Chile ranks number 20. Right behind it is Argentina.
<p>
Let's look at labor and environmental standards. In some ways, Chile's standards are more advanced than America's. However, Chile is a prisoner of our domestic politics. What we're talking about are Greenpeace groupies and their supporters, their lap dogs on the left, who do not want to see anything done with Chile that would undermine their own agenda.
<p>
Looking at environmental expenditures, the private sector in Chile contributed about $648 million in 1994 -- not required by the Chilean government -- to clean up the environment and act as good corporate citizens. 
<p>
 Labor standards?  The record is that real wages have increased in Chile, and the minimum wage increased 30 percent from 1990 to 1993. There is greater worker protection. There's paid maternity leave after delivery. There are significant severance pay and procedural safeguards against the deterioration of certain labor contracts. In fact, in the labor area, Chile has engaged in some things that many of us may well have considered excessive and that would warm the hearts of the left wing of the Democratic Party and the AFL-CIO.
<p>
Chile has reduced its tariff levels from 95 percent in 1985 to 11 percent today. There are not that many items where Chile has significant tariff and non-tariff barriers.
<p>
With or without Chile's accession to NAFTA, business will tend to view Chile as an attractive opportunity. Why?  First of all, it's open. Chile has followed the spirit of former President Bush's Enterprise for the Americas. That was really the champagne bottle against the ship that launched the trade integration movement. Rightfully, President Clinton acknowledged this as well.
<p>
Chile did not have to be told to open up its economy. Chileans understood the merits of an open-market system and of an equalized trading system long before any other countries in Latin America. They have a small population with low levels of income disparity. Their infant mortality dropped from 79 in 100,000 in 1983 to something close to 11 in 100,000. The social advances in Chile have also been phenomenal.
<p>
Even under the first year of the Pinochet government, for example, Chile was the only country in the hemisphere that spent more money than Cuba on social, education, and health projects as a percentage of the budget. Sixty percent of Chile's budget was spent on different types of projects in urban housing, on development, and on social issues. So Chile now is at the point where it is, in fact, progressing socially as well as economically.
<p>
There are few areas of contention in terms of Chile's trade relations with the world. The Chileans are poised as an export base to other areas in the Western Hemisphere, as well as to Asia. They are keen on, and active in, receiving the transfer of U.S. technology. They are exporting services, and they have a superb educational base. Chile is incorporating technology from all over the world. They're not situated with a population like Mexico that must find room for one million new entrants into the job market every year.
<p>
If you take a look at Chile's export base, 41 percent of Chilean exports are natural resources. They have been wise in diversifying the country's trading base, so that 24 percent of Chile's trade goes to the European Union, 21 percent to the United States, and 19 percent to Latin America and the Caribbean.
<p>
There is also a lot of posturing. Is Chile going to sign with the European Union because the United States is not going to admit Chile to NAFTA?  Well, the European Union has actually increased its trade with Chile significantly -- nearly 50 percent over the last six years -- while, at the same time, Chilean exports to the European Community have declined. So the European Union is more or less a one-way street for Chile.
<p>
The coin of the realm is still the U.S. market, and it's still a trade relationship that is going to proceed whether Chile accedes to NAFTA or not. I believe that's the point. American corporations are positioning themselves to take advantage of Chilean capital and technology for acquisition and expansion into related markets in South America and the Pacific Rim. U.S. multinationals are also poised to supply high value-added goods to Chilean consumers.
<p>
Is Chile a threat to the U.S. under NAFTA?  Not at all. Chile is a small economy, with a GDP one-eighth the size of Mexico's, and Chile's exports to the U.S. are more than 20 times smaller than Mexican exports to American consumers. The U.S. enjoys a favorable balance of trade with Chile, and that is going to increase. The bulk of Chilean exports are concentrated in commodities -- copper, metal, minerals, pulp, and paper. The most affected U.S. products are going to be those in the agribusiness sector, including wine, vegetables, grapes, tomatoes, and processed fruits.
<p>
On the import side, Chile increasingly is importing large amounts of capital goods, spare parts, and specialized agricultural products where the U.S. has a great competitive position. If Chile were admitted to NAFTA, the U.S. trade surplus with Chile would increase.
<p>
I would argue that there is a compelling case, by any measure, to admit Chile to NAFTA. Even if that doesn't happen, however, trade expansion will proceed, and Chile will diversify its economic base, providing the U.S. corporate sector incredible investment opportunities, while the Chilean private sector will see opportunities elsewhere, including in the United States. 
<p>
 The numbers of mergers and acquisitions, and Chilean acquisitions of U.S. companies that provide raw materials, will grow. In telecommunications, where Chile is especially strong, we are already seeing, in South Florida, Chilean investors taking equity interests in telecommunications firms and software companies. The spirit of NAFTA, at least, is alive and well in the private sectors of both Chile and the United States.
<p>
<b>BARBARA FRANKLIN:</b> Thank you, Jerry; you make a strong case as well. Our next speaker is Mr. William C. Lane.<sup>3</sup>
<p>
<b>WILLIAM C. LANE:</b> By way of introduction, I should confess that, by training, I'm an accountant. In fact, for 11 of the 20 years I've been with Caterpillar, I worked in that capacity. I believe that experience uniquely qualifies me to discuss trade legislation because, like arithmetic, trade is really quite simple. But somehow we have allowed lawyers and protectionists in Washington to make it exceedingly complicated. 
<p>
 I don't think there's a better example of this than what's going on with the effort to expand NAFTA to include Chile. As Mrs. Franklin pointed out, Chile-NAFTA has been the bridesmaid of trade agreements now for over four years. So one would think there must be a compelling issue which has stymied negotiations. 
<p>
 The first possibility is that perhaps there is something wrong with the suitor. In other words: Is there something about Chile that disqualified the country from membership in NAFTA?  But when you look at Chile, there's not a more qualified candidate. In fact, Chile practices what The Heritage Foundation preaches. I should point out that America doesn't always practice what it preaches, but Chile does. Its savings rate is the envy of the world. It has privatized its pension system. It has embraced trade liberalization and economic reform. In short, there's no better candidate for NAFTA membership. In fact, I think you could say that Chile is probably more qualified to join NAFTA than half a dozen U.S. states. 
<p>
 If the problem is not Chile, perhaps there is a U.S. interest that's so threatened by Chilean trade that negotiations must be delayed until after the presidential election. If you check your map, you'll find that Chile is a very long country, but it's also very narrow. True, with the Andes mountains, it is a rather tall country as well. But no matter how you measure it, Chile is not an economic superpower. 
<p>
Nevertheless, Chile is an important trading partner for some countries. Last year it was Caterpillar's second largest export market in Latin America. We exported over $100 million worth of U.S. products to Chile. Are there U.S. industries that are concerned about import competition from Chile?  Well, the only two groups, I believe, that have voiced concern are salmon and wine producers. I understand that USTR explained to the salmon industry that there are currently no U.S. trade restrictions on the importation of salmon, and that seemed to satisfy them.
<p>
As for wine, Chile produces high-quality wine. I've noticed that whenever Chilean wine is discussed, there is usually someone in the audience who raises his hand and says, "You say it's low cost and it's high quality -- not that I'd do it, but where do you buy this wine?"  Then someone points out the closest ABC store, and we lose half the audience.
<p>
In any event, current U.S. tariffs on wine are relatively small. Because Chilean wine qualifies for GSP status, the U.S. tariff is only a couple of percent. The U.S. industry has identified some trademark issues, but they were not considered showstoppers. The U.S. wine industry, after all, is highly competitive, and while there may be some concerns, I don't think the industry, in the end, will oppose an agreement. So, by process of elimination, if the problem isn't Chile or opposition from the U.S. wine industry, perhaps we can identify a fatal flaw in the proposed trade agreement.
<p>
Currently, Chile has an 11 percent duty on almost all imported products. By joining NAFTA, Chile would be obligated to eliminate its duty on all U.S. products. That's fair enough. What would America be required to do in return?  Not much!  With the new GATT agreement in place, U.S. tariffs are already being cut. For example, the U.S. tariff on construction equipment is already scheduled to be eliminated via GATT. Yet, while Chile would be obligated to eliminate its tariffs on our products, it would continue to apply its 11 percent duty on products made in Europe and Asia. Is that fair?  From where we stand, there's nothing fair about it; it's just a good deal. It would give us an 11 percent competitive advantage when we sell in Chile.
<p>
Why would anyone in the United States be against that?  It's a mystery to me. Sometimes I think people tend to forget that tariffs are more than just trade barriers. A tariff is a tax. What I don't understand is why some conservatives who truly believe in the merits of reducing taxes are reluctant to endorse trade agreements which in effect require other countries to reduce their taxes on American products. Expanding NAFTA to include Chile is so positive that you would think that even a Congressman would be able to understand that. Yet Chile is still the bridesmaid.
<p>
At Caterpillar, we've discussed the best way to describe this proposed trade pact. Is it a great deal?  Is it a historic agreement?  If we're not careful, we may give hyperbole a bad name. Expanding NAFTA to include Chile may not be historic, and it may not change the cosmic scheme of things. It's just a good deal, and in business, when a good deal comes along, you don't sit around and say, "Wait a second. This isn't historic. This isn't monumental. We better not do it."  In business, if it's a good deal, you take it.
<p>
We've established that the problem is not the suitor, not domestic opposition, and not a flaw in the proposed agreement. Out of desperation we are forced to entertain the idea that maybe the problem is the status quo. Perhaps there's something about the status quo that is so compelling that folks are reluctant to change.
<p>
This hasn't made headline news, but in Latin America, tariffs on U.S. products are currently increasing. There's a new trade alliance called Mercosur that includes Uruguay, Paraguay, Brazil, and Argentina. In an effort to establish free trade within the area, these countries are setting a common external tariff. As a result, some tariffs on American products are going up. If you work for a company that has some production in, say, Brazil, this development can be managed. All you have to do is move work from the United States to Brazil, but that is hardly something the U.S. government should want to encourage. This is no time to defend the status quo; it's time to change it. It's also time for the answer. 
<p>
 What is keeping Chile out of NAFTA is purely politics. On the surface, the debate centers on the issue of fast-track negotiating authority and whether trade liberalization should be formally linked to environmental and labor policies.
<p>
At Caterpillar, we believe cutting taxes on U.S. exports is a worthy goal in itself. Others disagree. But with Chile and its high standards, these issues could easily be finessed. That was true last summer, and it's true today. There's just one problem: Currently there's a lack of political will among both parties to take on the issue of free trade. Some Republicans are concerned that supporting an expanded NAFTA would offend the Buchanan wing of the party. Most Democrats are unwilling to take on organized labor. Until that changes, we have a stalemate.
<p>
This is not to say that everyone has given up. There are still House Republicans committed to seeing that process move forward. Phil Crane continues to make a U.S.-Chile agreement a top priority. And, quite frankly, I think the Administration will be willing to address the issue of labor and the environment in a positive way. I believe this because recently the Administration has come out with a proposal that would expand the U.S.-Israeli free-trade agreement to include the West Bank and Gaza. It's a worthy objective. But while the Administration seeks an expanded trade agreement with Israel, it is not insisting that environmental and labor side agreements be part of the pact. Given this, you could even make a strong case that maybe Chile is trying to join the wrong trade pact. Instead of trying to join NAFTA, perhaps they should try to join the U.S.-Israel free-trade agreement. After all, the agreement would be noncontroversial. The issue wouldn't be demagogued in Congress, and Chile's tariffs would still go to zero. On top of that, Israel is a major trading partner of Chile. 
<p>
 Of course, I am being somewhat facetious, but the point is true. If it makes sense to reduce trade barriers that apply to the West Bank, it certainly makes sense to reduce trade barriers that apply to the Western Hemisphere.
<p>
The Heritage Foundation has a unique role to play in the continuing battle for free trade. We live in a world where our leaders are embracing the politics of focus groups. Focus groups are setting the agenda. Focus groups are deciding what issues should be addressed this year, and which ones should be deferred until 1997. 
<p>
 Regrettably, politicians are increasingly getting elected based on their ability to read their audience instead of their ability to lead their audience. The Heritage Foundation has never been, and will never be, focus group-driven. I've noticed that Heritage sometimes takes the lead even when there's no one in the audience. In this fight, we need your continued vigilance. Some of our friends who have traditionally been for free trade are being tempted to politicize international commerce. I strongly believe that Heritage needs to redouble its efforts to remind both our friends and foes of the virtues of free trade and the evils of protectionism. If that means going against some of our core constituency, so be it. It is a price worth paying.<p>

<h2>UN Tax</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
The proposal for a global tax to finance the operations of the United   
Nations went over like a lead balloon among average Americans. Many   
of our so-called leaders support the idea, however, seeing it as a   
necessary step on the road to a New World Order.  
</i></blockquote>
<P>         
United Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali thinks the UN   
could be a lot more effective if the world body did not have to answer to   
any of its member nations. If it had its own means of support, and its own   
army, then Boutros-Ghali and his fellow internationalists could give   
orders instead of taking them. The idea makes perfect sense to power-  
hungry globalists, who simply can't understand why it doesn't appeal to   
the citizens of nations expected to sacrifice their sovereignty.  
<p>  
Boutros-Ghali wants to finance the nearly bankrupt United Nations by   
imposing a global tax on foreign exchange transactions. A mere half-of-  
one-percent tax on these transactions would generate an astounding $1.5   
trillion. The Secretary General is willing to consider alternative means of   
raising revenue, of course, such as taxes on international travel, fossil   
fuels, international arms sales, and so on. The important thing is to   
establish an independent revenue source. "It is time to seriously address   
the need for a United Nations that can operate on a secure and steady   
financial foundation," said Boutros-Ghali when he floated his unpopular   
proposal. "I'm sure we will win in the end, and that we will obtain from   
the international community [an understanding] that we need to have our   
own income."  
<p>  
The international community may understand Boutros-Ghali's objectives,   
but so does the average American citizen, and he wants no part of it. "The   
ability to control territory and command an army, like the ability to tax,   
represents the exercise of sovereign power," observes Thomas Sheehy of   
the Heritage Foundation. "The UN should never have this power; it   
would be a usurpation of the constitutional rights of the American people.   
These rights are protected by the U.S. government, not the UN. The UN   
does not represent the interests of Americans; it represents the interests of   
its 185 member states, many of which are undemocratic and repressive."  
<p>  
Sheehy denies that the UN suffers from "a lack of funding. In fact," he   
says, "UN spending has been mushrooming, and that is the real problem."   
Still, the UN wants more. "In September 1996, the UN Working Group   
on Finances will submit a report on financing to the UN General   
Assembly," observes Sheehy. "This report may very well recommend a   
UN tax scheme." Sheehy notes that legislation has been introduced in   
both houses of the U.S. Congress to prohibit U.S. compliance with UN   
efforts to implement a tax. He argues that "the last thing the UN needs is   
more money and less accountability." The real question, however, is what   
America needs: We need leaders who will respect and protect our nation's   
sovereignty. The best way to do that is by withdrawing from the United   
Nations and expelling this would-be world government from our shores.

<h2>Big Government Destined For Ashbin</h2>


     Containing the threat, refuting the notion that its triumph was
     inevitable, seizing the moral high ground, defunding the enemy --
     these tactics toppled the Soviet empire and won the Cold War.
     They could also put an end to Big Government in America.
<p>
     "The old Republican coalition of northerners, big business,
     farmers, and professionals has given way to a modern Republican
     coalition of individuals and groups who share a common goal: They
     all want to be left alone by the government," says Grover
     Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform in the May issue of
     Imprimis, the monthly publication of Hillsdale College. This
     "Leave Us Alone" coalition consists of taxpayers, property
     owners, small businessmen, gun owners, home schoolers, and other
     pro-family, traditional values conservatives -- all of whom want
     government out of their pockets and off their backs.
<p>
     "The Left as embodied in the Democratic Party is a 'Takings'
     coalition," says Norquist, "made up of groups that want the
     government to take things -- usually money -- from other
     Americans and give it to them. This coalition includes government
     workers, unions, government contractors, corrupt big-city
     machines, federal grant recipients, left-wing intellectuals, and
     both wings of the `dependency lobby' (those locked into welfare
     dependency and those who earn a handsome living managing that
     deliberately never-ending dependency)." This coalition is also
     home to "the radical utopians who wish to use the power of the
     state to restructure society. They include the radical leaders of
     the feminist, homosexual, environmentalist, and animal rights
     movements."
<p>
     The "Takings" coalition is shrinking. The "Leave Us Alone"
     coalition, on the other hand, continues to grow, built, as it is,
     "around a single political principle consistent with American
     history and tradition -- that government should be limited and
     the people free." Norquist says this coalition has "embarked
     consciously on a four-part strategy to defeat the Washington
     establishment and the old Democratic majority. It is the same
     strategy that successfully broke the back of the Soviet empire."
<p>
     As it applies to Big Government in America, containment means
     firm opposition to tax increases. Norquist notes that more and
     more of our elected representatives are getting on the tax-ban
     bandwagon. As for inevitability, it's not the triumph of
     socialism that looms before us, but "devolution of power to the
     states, a private Social Security system, school choice, and
     welfare reform." The Right succeeded in seizing the moral high
     ground with "principled opposition to the welfare state's
     destruction of lives." Defunding the enemy is all that remains.
     "Conservatives," Norquist observes, "are beginning to cut off the
     flow of tax-payer funds and coerced labor union dues to the
     Left."
<p>
     "Freedom is on the march around the globe," says Norquist. "There
     is a great deal of work to be done, but the imperial city of
     Washington will fall to the forces of freedom just as Moscow did.
     It is as hollow, as brittle, and as bereft of self-confidence.
     The 'Leave Us Alone' coalition is growing, and it is fighting on
     the winning side of history."

<h2>
Environmental Myths
</h2>



<P><blockquote><i>  
"Mainstream thinking asserts that we must sacrifice at least some of our 
prosperity in order to protect the environment, " observes a noted 
economist. "Fortunately, this mainstream thinking is wrong."
</blockquote></i>



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"We can have both a growing economy and an improving environment," 
declares John Semmens of the Laissez-Faire Institute in Chandler, 
Arizona. In an article entitled "Prosperity Without Pollution," in the 
March issue of "The Freeman," Semmens suggests that "a growing 
economy may well provide the very means needed to improve the 
environment. 'Sacrifice' may not only be unnecessary; it may be 
counterproductive."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Semmens cites several "erroneous premises" of mainstream 
environmental thinking that pose obstacles not only to prosperity but to 
environmental improvement as well. One false premise is the idea that 
anything "natural" is better than anything "artificial." Civilization itself is 
artificial, Semmens observes, but far superior to the state of nature. The 
"artificial" laws and technology of civilization allow us "to lead lives that 
are less violent, painful, and precarious than would be natural. 
'Environmentalism' itself is an artifact of civilization. The abundance 
generated by our technologically advanced civilization allows people to 
contemplate more than just survival."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The idea that resources are finite is another false premise. Things do not 
even become "resources" until humans find a use for them and thereby 
give them value. The scarcity of any given resource is simply a challenge 
to be overcome. "The high prices of scarce resources stimulate the search 
for better or cheaper alternatives for meeting the same human wants," 
says Semmens. "So, in the final analysis, it is not the 'finiteness' of any 
substance that is critical. The critical factor is the scope of the human 
imagination. This scope seems to be getting broader. The accelerating 
pace of technological advancement should give us confidence that, 
barring the implementation of oppressive government meddling, we are 
not likely to run short of intellectual resources in the foreseeable future."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The so-called population bomb is another fallacy. "It is not population, 
per se, that could pose a problem for humanity, but the political and 
social institutions that affect human behavior," says Semmens. "In this 
regard, the paternalistic welfare state is a serious problem. Government 
programs that entitle people to consume without their having to produce 
turns them into drones and parasites." The danger here is that "the burden 
of the parasitic portion of the population may overwhelm the output 
capacity of the productive portion."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The biggest fallacy of all is the idea that big government is the answer to 
environmental problems, real or imagined. "Government lacks adequate 
information on the subjective values of individuals, on the world's 
continuously changing circumstances, and on what the future might 
bring," says Semmens. "Further, government lacks sufficient incentives 
to avoid mistakes. The burdens of its errors fall on others. Its failures 
serve as a rationale for further meddling." Semmens insists that 
"prosperity and a cleaner environment" depend on "human creativity," 
which cannot flourish in a society stifled by government control.

<title>J. Edgar Hoover -- Duplantier</title>

<h2>J. Edgar Hoover</h2></center>

The reputation of J. Edgar Hoover has been greatly tarnished in the 23 
years since his death, but two new books about the longtime FBI director 
have set the record straight at last.<p>

Smearing the character of J. Edgar Hoover has been a popular pastime for 
two decades, but it's time now to put his ugly business behind us. Former 
FBI agent Ray Wannall says two new books offer a fresh. objective 
appraisal of the man who single-handedly transformed the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation "from a dumping ground for political hacks, ex-
convicts, and alcoholics into a world-renowned law-enforcement 
agency."<p>

Wannall says William Breuer's J. Edgar Hoover and his G-Men is an 
engrossing. exhaustively researched book that captures "Hoover's 
mystique and the sheer force of his will." Breuer himself declares that 
one of his motives for writing the book was to "counter the barrage of 
vilification and garbage that has been heaped on this great American." 
Just 99  years old when he was appointed FBI Director in 1924. Hoover 
quickly established a reputation as a disciplinarian, rooting out the rabble among his investigative staff and replacing them with skilled lawyers and accountants -- all subjected to rigorous background checks and intensive training courses, and thereafter held to a strict code of conduct. One high-level FBI man recalls that Hoover "had standards of perfection and he expected everybody in the Bureau to live up to them."<p>

With his awesome leadership and managerial ability, Hoover led the FBI 
in a successful assault on the notorious (Gangsters of the Prohibition and 
Depression eras. Ma Barker, John Dillinger, "Pretty Boy" Floyd, 
"Machine Gun" Kelly, "Baby Face" Nelson, and Bonnie and Clyde are 
just a few of the public enemies Hoover brought to justice. In 1936. 
President Franklin Roosevelt directed Hoover to develop intelligence 
regarding subversive activities by communists, fascists, and other anti-
American groups. Hoover's success in this mission explains the ferocity 
of the subsequent attacks on his character.<p>

Ray Wannall also recommends a book written by Cartha D. DeLoach, the 
Number Three man in the FBI. behind Hoover and his associate director. 
Wannall says Hoover's FBI: The Inside Story by Hoover's Trusted 
Lieutenant "shows the full spectrum of Hoover's character and 
personality and is laced with Hoover's humor and amusing incidents 
involving prominent people, members of Congress. and White House 
personnel." The book. Wannall insists, presents "an unbiased portrait of 
the man, warts and all. by one who knew him, worked closely with-him, 
put up with his idiosyncrasies, and admired him even to the point of 
declining to take over his job when it was offered to him."<p>

DeLoach acknowledges in his book that Hoover was "proud and vain . . . 
and not above abusing his power. He could be petty and vindictive. He 
stayed in office too long, and, in so doing, he helped damage the 
reputation of the FBI he had virtually invented and perfected." Hoover 
may not have known when to quit, but the accomplishments he achieved 
in his prime cannot be denied. He was a true patriot, and he deserves an 
honored place in American history.<p>

<title>Central Intelligence Agency -- Duplantier</title>

<h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES</h4>

<h2>Central Intelligence Agency</h2></center>

The major media chastised the CIA for taking so long to ferret out Soviet 
mole Aldrich Ames. But the media itself may be partly to blame for 
undermining the Agency's ability to protect itself:<p>

"The announcement of the arrest of Aldrich Ames early last year. and the 
details of his horrific work as a Soviet mole inside the CIA for nine years, touched off a firestorm of attacks on the CIA itself," says James Tyson, president of the Council for the Defense of Freedom, and a former OSS officer. Tyson says the major media criticized the CIA for its 
"negligence" in allowing Ames's dirtv work to go undetected for so long, 
attributing that negligence to the reluctance of the agency's "Old Boy 
Network" to suspect one of its own. At least four major books have been 
rushed into print to add fuel to the fire.<p>

"What has not been recognized," Tvson charges, "is that the media and 
some of the book authors are themselves greatly responsible for the 
weakness in the CIA's counterintelligence operations. which allowed 
Ames to operate freely." According to Tyson. it was "the media vendetta 
on the CIA and its counterintelligence that led to ag,itation in Congress 
and successive presidential administrations. resulting in the firing of the 
counterintelligence head. James J. Angleton, and a virtual dismantling of 
the CIA's counterintelligence staff. This in turn caused the Agency to be 
vulnerable to the operations of a Sos iet mole like Aldrich Ames."<p>

Undermining the counterintelligence capability of the CIA was a major 
communist objective. says Tyson. "In the 1 960s and '70s, the Soviet 
Union under Khrushchev and his successors mounted a massive 
propaganda campaign against the CIA, much more effective than the 
clumsy efforts of the Stalin regime. The Soviets," Tyson reminds us, 
"regarded the CIA as a major threat. the eyes and ears of their main 
enemv. the United States. In the '70s, the campaign reached a climax with 
increasingly strident attacks by ultra-liberals." CIA critics jumping on the bashers bandwagon included "communist front groups like the National 
Lawers Guild and farleft Soviet sympathizers like the Institute for 
Policy Studies." <p>

Tyson recalls that President Gerald Ford and CIA Director William Colby 
made "many well-meaning but naive attempts to cooperate with reform 
efforts." Colby eventually fired counterintelligence chief Jarnes Angleton 
and many of his top aides. and was himself later fired by Ford. 
"Angleton's competence and reputed paranoia about moles is still a matter 
of disagreement among experts," concedes Tyson. "but there is no doubt 
that, after firing him.Colby and his successors went too far in virtually 
dismantling the counterintelligence capability."<p>

Under President Carter, hundreds of counterintelligence agents were let 
go. Eventually, the top echelon in the Agency began to emphasize 
technical means of acquiring intelligence. such as satellite photographs, 
in preference to traditional espionage. Tyson says "the main lesson of the 
Ames disaster is not the need to reform the CIA's 'Old Boy Network' and 
out-of-date procedures, but to restore its capacity for human 
intelligencegathering, especially in the counterintelligence area."<p>

Duplantier</a> <br>November 23, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Thanksgiving Reflections</h2></center><P>


                           

[Today is a day to give thanks. But gratitude doesn't always come easily.]
<p>
It can be difficult to be grateful to someone who offers what is good for 
us when what is good for us is not what we want. Often we are grateful 
for the wrong things, the things that spoil us instead of the things that 
make us strong. As children we may appreciate the teacher who forgoes 
homework assignments. the parent who slips us cash without demanding 
any labor in return. and the aunt who plies us with candy. As ignorant. 
penniless adults with mouths full of cavities we ma! take the longer 
view.
<p>
Making a list of the gifts we have received can be a good way to develop 
our sense of gratitude and to sharpen our ability to recognize the hidden 
benefits in things that have not come gift-wrapped. We might begin our 
survey by listing those things that we recognize immediately as gifts: the 
presents we receive for birthdays. the year-end bonuses. the winning 
lottery tickets. Then w e might list those things we take for granted but 
would recognize as gifts if we thought about it: our health. our talents. 
the perfect weather for last weekend's picnic. Next, a list of rights. 
which. if we're honest. we will concede are not rights at all but privileges 
or gifts: life. liberty, property.
<p>
Last. we might list those burdens that -- if we think long and hard 
enough -- will be seen to provide some unexpected benefits and to 
constitute blessings in disguise: those long commutes that allow us time 
to plan and to reflect. the financial reverses that force us to draw closer 
to our families in a common struggle. the personal calamities that plumb 
the depth of our character.
<p>
Having prepared a comprehensive list of gifts received -- one that 
includes not only the obvious gifts. but also the ones we take for granted. 
the ones we think of as being rightfully ours. and even the ones we are 
accustomed to think of as burdens -- it remains only to determine the 
source of all these gifts and to select an appropriate response for 
communicating our appreciation. We will find that. just as the majority 
of our gifts have not come wrapped, so too have they arrived without 
labels identifying the giver. And yet. those of us who are not determined 
to be dense will readily acknowledge Who is the source. direct or indirect      
of all gifts.
<p>
But how will we show appreciation to Him? The best way is by putting 
the gifts He has given us to good use. The familiar parable of the talents 
suggests that it is not enough to reach the end of our journey merely with 
the gifts He has given us intact. We are meant to develop our aptitudes. 
invest our graces wisely!. make the most of our opportunities, and 
overcome the obstacles that confront us. That's what Thanksgiving is all 
about.

and intrusiveness of the federal government,'' says David Kopel of the    
Cato Institute. "These are the same Republicans sent to Congress to    
reduce the federal government's erosion of individual rights."    
Nevertheless, many of these avowed opponents of Big Government are    
supporting a bill that Kopel says would "turn Uncle Sam into Big    
Brother."   
 <p>  
The House version of the proposed legislation would authorize federal    
agents to pry into the personal affairs of any American citizen, says    
Kopel, "without first obtaining a court order, and without even a    
suspicion that the individual is involved in criminal activity." Such    
invasions of privacy would be just the beginning, for the bill also "gives    
the president the power to label a group a 'terrorist organization' and    
make it a federal felony to support the legal activities of that group." The    
Justice Department's unsuccessful effort to prove the existence of a    
criminal conspiracy among pro-life organizations is a clear indication of    
what sort of groups are likely to be targeted as "terrorists."   
<p>   
It gets worse. Kopel notes that "illegal wiretaps would be admissible in    
court, as long as the wiretapping federal official was acting in 'good    
faith.'" How can the victim of an inquisition prove that his persecutor    
acted in bad faith? He can't. That's the point. The bill also contains "gun    
control legislation that could never pass this Congress on its own merits,"    
says Kopel. "Currently it is illegal to sell someone a firearm if you know    
it will be used in a crime. This bill would apply a five-year sentence to    
cases in which the seller allegedly 'should' have known that the gun    
would be used in a crime." Standard background checks will no longer    
suffice, it seems. Will gun dealers now have to obtain psychological    
profiles of all potential customers? Will they be expected to detect that    
cliche of murder mysteries, the homicidal gleam in the eye?   
<p>   
Do you think that American legislators could never endorse warrantless    
searches, illegal wiretaps, presumption of guilt, detention without trial,    
unseen witnesses, or secret testimony? Alas, they already have, in the    
anti-terrorism bill pending in Congress. The Senate bill is worse; it    
demonstrates even less regard for our constitutionally-protected liberties.    
The Senate version of the bill, says David Kopel, "contains a number of    
seriously disturbing and dangerous provisions," including military    
involvement in local law enforcement, digital wiretapping capabilities,    
the reclassification of apolitical crimes as terrorism, and increased    
funding for the storm troopers at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and    
Firearms. Is the threat of terrorism really so great that we should give up    
many of our hard-won liberties to protect against it? Most Americans    
would not be happy with the result.

<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
<dd>The House of Representatives is considering a new "Truth in Testimony" rule requiring witnesses that receive federal funds through government contracts to disclose the amount and source of the funds when they testify before congressional committees.<sup>1</sup>  Many of the objections to this rule concern its implementation rather than the principle of disclosure. This paper answers some of the most frequently asked questions about the Truth in Testimony rule and how it would work in practice. 
<p>
<b>Q: What is Truth in Testimony?</b>
<p>
A: Truth in Testimony is an amendment to the Rules of the House of Representatives, introduced by Representative John Doolittle (R-CA), that would require witnesses before congressional committees to disclose the amount of funding they receive from the federal government through grants or contracts.
<p>
<b>
Q: What is the goal of Truth in Testimony? </b>
<p>
A: It aims to give Congress more information about the background of congressional witnesses. By requiring witnesses to disclose their federal grants and contracts, Congress can learn whether a witness may have a vested interest in the subject under a committee's examination. Further, since congressional hearings often are the focus of media reports, this rule would alert the media and the public to any testimony that may be financially self-serving.
<p>
<b>
Q: Is Truth in Testimony a "gag rule"?</b>
<p>
A: No. Truth in Testimony is a sunshine law designed to elicit more information about witnesses appearing before congressional committees. It would not impose restrictions on the testimony of any witness, nor would it restrict the activities pursued by federal grantees.
<p>
<b>
Q: Who supports Truth in Testimony? </b>
<p>
A: The proposal was part of the 1996 Republican platform and is now under consideration in the House of Representatives. In addition to Congressman Doolittle, the idea also has the support of Representative Bob Livingston (Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee), Representative Gerald Solomon (Chairman of the House Rules Committee), Representative Tom DeLay (House Republican Whip), Representative George Radanovich (president of the freshman class during the 104th Congress), and other committee chairmen. The proposed rules change has been endorsed by several outside organizations, such as Americans for Tax Reform, the Christian Coalition, 60 Plus, National Right to Work, and Eagle Forum, among others.
<p>
<b>
Q: How would it work? </b>
<p>
A: Truth in Testimony would amend the House Rules and affect all committees and subcommittees, including authorizing and appropriations committees. The chairman of the committee or subcommittee would notify witnesses in advance of hearings that their written statements must disclose the amount of federal grants or contracts that they receive. If the witness does not make a good faith disclosure, then his or her testimony will not be included in the hearing record.
<p>
<b>
Q: How many witnesses would be affected? </b>
<p>
A: A survey of witnesses testifying in 1995 reveals that at least one of every three "public" (non-federal government) witnesses was a grant recipient. This amounts to roughly 3,000 witnesses each year, only a tiny percentage of whom currently disclose their subsidized status.
<p>
<b>
Q: What exactly would have witnesses have to list? </b>
<p>
A: The proposal would require witnesses, in their written statements, to include the following information about the organizations they represent: "the amount and source (by agency and program) of any federal grants (including subgrants from other organizations or from a state pursuant to a federal block grant) received, and contracts entered into, during the current and previous two fiscal years."
<p>
<b>
Q: Who would be responsible for making sure witnesses comply with Truth in Testimony? </b>
<p>
A: It would be the responsibility of the committee or subcommittee chairman, presumably through the staff, to check for disclosure in written testimony. Any needed clarification could be requested at the hearing or during the process of preparing hearing transcripts for printing. In most cases, witnesses are called to testify either because of their experience with a program, agency, and issue or because Members and staff are familiar with their organizations. Accordingly, the rule would not substantially increase burdens on committee staff.
<p>
<b>
Q: What if a witness fails to disclose the information and no one says anything? </b>
<p>
A: If a witness's statement lacks a grant and contract disclosure, it would be the responsibility of the committee staff to inquire about it. If staff members notice during or after the hearing that a written statement of a grantee or contractor failed to include the required information, then the witness could be contacted for a revision during the time typically allowed for corrections. To avoid any difficulties, witnesses should consult their organization's IRS Form 990, which lists its sources of revenue. Form 990 is a public document that each non-profit organization must file annually; by law, it must be made available for public inspection during regular business hours.
<p>
<b>
Q: What if a witness gives incorrect figures? </b>
<p>
A: The rule requires that witnesses make a "good faith disclosure" of information. If witnesses err inadvertently or through lack of knowledge, they would not be penalized. But if a witness refuses to make disclosure or intentionally provides incorrect information, his statement would be stricken from the record. No other penalties would normally apply since Truth in Testimony is a congressional rule rather than a civil or criminal statute.
<p>
<b>
Q: Does the Truth in Testimony rule include farm subsidies, entitlements, pensions, or benefits? </b>
<p>
A: No. The rule would only deal with federal grants and contracts that produce goods or services for the public at large or specific federal agencies. Such grants and contracts are awarded on a competitive basis by federal agencies. Grant applicants and contract competitors normally file a complicated grant request, and later must complete progress and final reports and financial evaluations of their project. Benefits to individuals, including Social Security, agricultural subsidies, federal pensions, and other entitlement programs would not be covered by Truth in Testimony. Categorical loan programs, such as those for students, small businesses, and disaster victims likewise would not be covered. Individuals automatically receive these entitlements or benefits because they meet certain eligibility requirements as specified by law.
<p>
<b>
Q: Shouldn't Congress already know who receives federal funds? </b>
<p>
A: Grants and contracts typically are issued by executive and independent agencies; Congress appropriates the funds and plays an oversight role. Individual congressional committees, however, do not have the resources to monitor the each of the grants or contracts given out by federal agencies. In a typical year, more than 80 agencies make federal grants totaling $40 billion to over 39,000 different groups.
<p>
<b>Q: Instead of burdening congressional witnesses with a new regulation, why can't this be done on an ad hoc basis? </b>
<p>
A: Without a rule establishing a policy of disclosure, witnesses would not be prepared to answer a question on grants or contracts their organizations receive. By requiring disclosure for all witnesses who receive federal funds, this rule eliminates the perception that a particular witness is under increased scrutiny because of the content of his or her testimony. Because each committee deals with the same set of interest groups and federal administrators repeatedly, committee or subcommittee chairmen naturally would be hesitant to invoke this rule on a case-by-case basis in order to avoid making beneficiaries of the programs they supervise feel uncomfortable.
<p>
<b>
Q: Why can't committees impose this rule on their own? </b>
<p>
A: Committees could impose a Truth in Testimony rule on their own. However, the "iron triangle" phenomenon, the natural sympathy of committees for the interests they oversee, makes committees reluctant to do so on their own. Truth in Testimony is needed to prevent committees from overlooking, or failing to disclose to Congress and the public, the degree to which hearings are dominated by program beneficiaries.
<p>
<b>
Q: What good will this do if both conservative and liberal advocacy groups are affected? </b>
<p>
A: The goal of the rule is not to penalize or intimidate government grantees or contractors, liberals or conservatives. Truth in Testimony simply aims to give Congress more information about the organization that a witness represents, and to alert Members to potentially self-serving testimony.
<p>
<b>
Q: Could witnesses skirt the rule by claiming that they are not testifying on behalf of the organizations for which they work? </b>
<p>
A: Possibly, but if they later claim to have testified on behalf of the organization they work for, in its official publications or elsewhere, they risk having their testimony stricken from the record. Moreover, if a witness is invited to testify on behalf of an organization, he would be expected to provide disclosure for that organization.
<p>
<b>
Q: How would academic experts be affected? </b>
<p>
A: Academic experts (for example, university professors) would be required to disclose any grants they personally received: for instance, research grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities or the National Institutes of Health. Such experts would not have to disclose grants to their university unless they were representing that university in an official capacity, as opposed to presenting their own expert views. In contrast, an assistant dean testifying on federal financial aid programs obviously should disclose his institution's grant receipts. The final authority to decide if a witness has been called as a representative of a particular organization rests with the committee chairmen who administer the rule.
<p>
<b>
Q: Does this disclosure requirement include companies or individuals who receive tax incentives or tax credits? </b>
<p>
A: No. Only direct federal funding -- contracts and grants -- is included in the rule, because this information is readily available for witnesses and can be checked by staff members. Tax incentives normally benefit an entire class of groups or individuals, while a grant is given directly to a particular organization. In addition, organizations testifying regarding tax provisions or exemptions normally are very direct in addressing the status of organizations or individuals they represent.
<p>
<b>
Q: How would this proposal affect defense contractors? </b>
<p>
A: Witnesses from defense contractors would be required to disclose the amount and source of their contracts, in the same manner as contractors for the Department of Energy, or independent agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency or NASA. Such information is already regularly disclosed by federal defense contractors, often in their annual reports. 
<p>
<b>
Q: Would this include testimony by personnel from federal agencies or the White House?</b>
<p>A: No. In contrast to public witnesses, Congress already knows that witnesses from federal agencies are funded by tax dollars. Further, federal agencies themselves are not normally the beneficiaries of grant programs. 
<p>
<b>
Q: Would Truth in Testimony affect oral testimony? </b>
<p>
A: The Rules of the House currently require witnesses to submit written testimony when practicable. This rule change requires disclosure of federal funding in the written statement, and not in the witness's oral summation.
<p>
<b>
Q: Does it include letters to the committee or the chairman? </b>
<p>
A: This type of unsolicited lobbying would be affected only if a committee decided to print it in the hearing volume. In that event, staff members could contact an organization for information on grants or contracts.
<p>
<b>
Q: Would Truth in Testimony affect lobbying outside of a committee hearing? </b>
<p>
A: No. The rule would apply only to committee hearings and not to informal contacts at committee, Member, or other offices.
<p>
<b>
Q: What is the official form and language of the Truth in Testimony proposal? </b>
<p>

A: As introduced by Representative Doolittle, the proposal reads:

<p>
<blockquote>
	Clause 2(j) of the Rules of the House of Representatives is amended by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:

	"(3)(A) Whenever any hearing is to be conducted by any committee upon any measure or matter, the chairman shall notify all prospective witnesses that written statements submitted to the committee shall include the following information: the amount and source (by agency and program) of any Federal grant (including subgrants from other organizations or from a State pursuant to a Federal block grant) received, and contracts entered into, during the current and previous two fiscal years, by witnesses and any organizations they represent.

	(B) If any witness at a committee hearing fails to make a good faith disclosure of the information required by subdivision (A), then all testimony of that witness at that hearing shall be expunged from the hearing record."

<h2>Michael New </h2>
 
<P>
<blockquote><i>
The United Nations wants to be a truly autonomous world government,  
but first it needs to have its own authority, and its own military  
force. U.S. Army Specialist Michael New's refusal to don the UN  
uniform was a challenge that could not be ignored.
</i></blockquote>
<p> 
The court martial and conviction of U.S. Army Specialist Michael New  
for refusing to wear the UN uniform on a so-called "peacekeeping"  
mission to Macedonia was a necessary step on the road to the New World  
Order. Had New not been punished, the other 550 servicemen in his unit  
might have had second thoughts about donning UN helmets, trading their  
U.S. identification cards for UN I.D. cards, and marching off to  
Macedonia to serve as pawns in a conflict of no consequence to America.  
How would the UN ever put together an army of its own if every soldier  
in the world insisted on maintaining allegiance to his homeland? 
<p> 
To justify the order regarding the wearing of UN uniforms, Specialist  
New's commanding officer made vague references to the following  
phrases: "UN guidelines," "National Command Authority," "UN  
Charter," "Domestic Law," "Commander in Chief," and "UN Security  
Council Resolutions." But Specialist New was not convinced. He argued  
that the order to alter his uniform violated U.S. Army regulations against  
wearing any unauthorized insignia, decoration, medal, or uniform. "I am  
not a UN soldier," New protested. "I am an American soldier." 
<p> 
The Army was in "a difficult position," remarks Dennis Cuddy, former  
professor of U.S. history at the University of North Carolina, and the  
author of a popular pamphlet on the New World Order. If the UN insignia  
on his uniform would have no effect on Michael New's status as an  
American soldier, then why was it so important for him to wear it? If the  
insignia merely identifies a UN operation, then why didn't American  
soldiers serving in Korea wear UN emblems on their uniforms? Why all  
the fuss about a silly little emblem? Cuddy argues that obscuring the  
national identities of troops participating in a UN peacekeeping mission  
and forcing them all to sport UN insignia indicates "a change of  
command or authority." Once the United Nations has troops that it can  
truly call its own, it will have become what its founders wanted it to be --  
"a de facto world government." 
<p> 
"Michael New is an American hero," proclaims Congressman Roscoe  
Bartlett of Maryland. "A twice decorated soldier, Michael New took the  
extraordinary step of jeopardizing a brilliant military career to defend our  
Constitution." Now, if only our Congressmen will show such courage.  
Bartlett and more than 60 of his colleagues are co-sponsoring a bill that  
would make it unlawful to require a member of the U.S. Armed Services  
to wear insignia, indicia, or headgear affirming allegiance to, or  
affiliation with, the United Nations. But why stop there? Why not take  
the one step that really would prevent American soldiers from being  
transferred to the command of an international force? Why not withdraw  
from the United Nations altogether, while we still can?

 <H3><I> WHY ASPIN'S "BOTTOM-UP" DEFENSE REVIEW IS A CHARADE </I></H3>

Backgrounder Update #198<BR>
7/9/93<BR>
(published at 3 pages)

(Updating A Safe and Prosperous America: A U.S. Foreign and Defense
Policy Blueprint, The Heritage Foundation, May 1993.)
<P>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>

     Secretary of Defense Les Aspin on March 25 announced a
comprehensive, "bottom-up" review to determine the nation's post-Cold-
War defense needs. Indeed, the dramatic changes in the geopolitical
landscape over the last four years demand a thorough reassessment of
America's security strategy. However, the Aspin study will not be it.
The outcome of the review was already determined when the Clinton
Administration on February 17 announced its intention to reduce the
Bush Administration's five-year defense budget by more than $120
billion. Aspin's "bottom-up" review, therefore, is a charade. Given
budget cuts of this magnitude, it will be little more than a "top-
down" justification of Clinton's predetermined defense budget.
<P>
     A Flawed Review Process. Nowhere is the gap between rational and
systematic defense planning and the political realities of the Clinton
Administration defense budget more apparent than in assessments of the
conventional force structure. In a June 16 speech at the National
Defense University in Washington, Aspin hinted that the bottom-up
review would establish a conventional force structure based on a "win-
hold-win" strategy. The strategy calls for the military to retain
conventional forces that are large enough and strong enough to handle
two major regional contingencies. In one of the two, however, U.S.
forces would need only to hold defensive positions until the other
conflict was concluded, at which time they would be reinforced.
Specific force structure requirements to execute the strategy were
leaked to the press in conjunction with the speech.
<P>
     Perhaps because of the conceptual problems with the win-hold-win
strategy, Aspin reversed ground in a June 24 speech to flag officers
at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland and called for a "win-win"
strategy. This strategy calls for conventional forces capable of
conducting offensive operations in two major regional contingencies
simultaneously. But in this instance, no force structure numbers were
provided. Nevertheless, it is prudent to assume that the force
structure needed to support the win-win strategy must be significantly
larger than that leaked in the context of the win-hold-win strategy.
The problem is that the conventional force structure needed even for
the smaller win-hold-win force is unaffordable under the Clinton
budget, and Secretary Aspin has all but admitted so.
<P>
     As Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, then-
Representative Aspin in March 1992 studied the conventional force
implications of cutting defense budget authority by select amounts.
Aspin compared four options, referred to as Options A, B, C, and D,
with Option A being the lowest budget and the smallest force and
Option D the highest budget and largest force. During the campaign,
Bill Clinton proposed a defense program and budget that resembled
Aspin's relatively muscular Option C proposal. But now the Clinton
Administration proposes a defense budget that doubles the reductions
(for the period covering fiscal years 1993 through 1997) proposed
during the campaign and falls far short of Option C.
<P>

     In fact, the Clinton five-year defense budget, formally released
on April 8, more closely resembles Aspin's Option B. It proposes
cutting $176 billion in budget authority from the 1992 baseline, with
a target of $246 billion in budget authority for fiscal 1997. Option B
projects cutting $187 billion in budget authority from the 1992
baseline during the same period. It, too, has a fiscal 1997 target
figure for defense budget authority of $246 billion. 
<P>
     The Force Structure Problem. A comparison of the conventional
force structure required to execute the win-hold-win strategy and the
Option B force structure, which Aspin's analysis indicates is all the
Clinton budget can buy, reveals the scope of the Administration's
problem. Aspin's subsequent assertion that the armed forces should
execute a win-win strategy implies the need for an even larger force
than required by the original win-hold-win strategy. Thus, Aspin's new
strategy only enlarges the Administration's affordability gap. 
<P>
     Adding to the existing budget shortfall problem, Aspin is now
hinting that in order to meet outlay targets established by the
Clinton budget he will be forced to reduce 1994 budget authority by up
to $20 billion more than even the current budget allows. This could
mean reducing defense budget authority in fiscal 1994 by almost $30
billion, or over 10 percent, from the current 1993 level. And with
inflation factored in, the result could be a fiscal 1994 figure that
is 12 percent below the fiscal 1993 level.
<P>
     A budget reduction of this scope has enormous implications for
defense. Whereas the existing Clinton budget anticipates reducing
defense budget authority from $273 billion to $246 billion over a
five-year period, the adjustment could result in dropping to below
$246 billion in a single year. Instead of reducing the defense budget
over four years, a gradual reduction consistent with his campaign
pledges, Clinton actually may force a nearly $30 billion cut in a
single year. This would require cancellation of major weapons systems
and have an immediate impact on America's defense readiness.
<P>
     Aspin needs to end this charade. He can do so by declaring the
Clinton defense budget proposal, particularly for the fiscal years
beyond 1994, null and void. He should then establish a firm request
for fiscal 1994 and initiate an assessment of U.S. defense
requirements based not on predetermined budget guidelines, but on what
is needed to defend American interests against specific threats. He
should instruct the review committee to establish force structure
requirements outside the confines of existing budget directives and
pledge to support a defense budget request in the future that will
fund the force structure recommended by the review. Once this is done,
the nation will have a real bottom-up review, and not a top-down,
budget-driven charade.

<h2>Social Experimentation in Americas Armed Forces</h2> </center>
 
Here is a revolting irony for you: Daring young combat pilots feel more 
secure dodging anti-aircraft guns over enemy territory than they do when 
speaking their minds on American soil. <p>
 
 
The temperature can reach 125 degrees on the tarmac at Nellis Air Force 
Base in Nevada, reports Mindy Belz in a recent issue of World magazine. 
"Hotter still," she says, "is the situation of any officer who dares  
to question even in a private conversation, the Clinton administration's 
policies that are undermining the spirit of America's armed forces." Belz 
observes with dismay that the officers at the Air Force Weapons School 
"speak cautiously. even mechanically, about profound changes in the 
military" -- voicing pat approval for such controversial trends as women 
in combat, downsizing of the services, and murky missions under foreign 
command. When the men charged with defending our freedoms have to 
watch everything they say and be constantly on guard against betrayal, 
something is desperately wrong in America. <p>
 
It is true that soldiers must be trained not to question authority. "The 
militarys code of ethics -- taking orders -at its best preserves order and 
strength in the military," Belz concedes. "But the about-face of President 
Clinton (and President Bush before him) on fundamental issues -- such as 
keeping military policy insulated from the fluctuating pop-culture 
influences -- has trickled down without public debate." This is an  
unhealthy situation. It will lead to demoralization of the troops, their 
involvement in social experimentation. and reduced security for our 
country. "Stifling debate on matters that go to the heart of military 
readiness undermines the dutiful," Belz charges. "Political correctness 
turns loyalty into Newspeak." <p>
 
Orders may be orders, but every veteran can remember when giving and 
getting some guff was part of the equation. After all, the right to have his 
own opinion, the right to disagree, was partly what he fought for. Blind 
obedience went out with the Nuremberg trials. Or did it? Belz cites the 
case of Navy Lt. Commander Ken Carkhuff, a 17-year veteran who 
confided to his commanding officer that he had religious objections  
to women in combat. That comment led ultimately to a board of inquiry, 
which recommended separation from the service. Fortunately, public 
opinion persuaded the Secretary of the Navy to overrule the board and  
allow Carkhuff to remain. A high-ranking Air Force officer who prefers 
to remain nameless says that criticizing the concept of women in combat 
is "a career-ender." <p>
 
Belz points out that "the Senate continues to hold the power of conferring 
rank on all military officers,'' and that feminist senators "have attacked 
the retirement grade of three Navy admirals . . . who were accused of  
not promoting women." This is America? Men who spent their entire 
lives in service must now kowtow to these feminist bullies or risk 
jeopardizing the benefits they have earned. Can this be the country they  
fought for? <p>

<h2>
UNCHANGING TRUTHS
</h2>

<P><blockquote><i>  
The best protection against the designs of demagogues, do-gooders, and 
other self-styled reformers is a  firm grasp of eternal verities.
</blockquote></i>
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Greek philosopher Aristotle argued that the sovereignty of the law 
must supersede the sovereignty of the ruler. The law is a higher authority 
than the ruler because it; proceeds from a higher authority. "He who 
commands that law should rule [commands] that God and reason alone 
should rule," said Aristotle. Democracies inevitably decline when they 
cease to respect this higher authority and place the interests of any one 
group above the common good.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The English philosopher John Locke went to great lengths to distinguish 
liberty from license and to demonstrate that the law is the liberator, not 
the oppressor, of man: "Law, in its true notion, is not so much the 
limitation as the direction of a free and intelligent agent to his proper 
interest, and prescribes no farther than is for the general good of those 
under that law." Locke argued that "the end of the law is not to abolish or 
restrain but to preserve and enlarge freedom," though he emphasized that 
freedom is not "a liberty for every man to do what he [pleases]."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In order to live, legally, at someone else's expense, it is necessary to turn 
the law into "an instrument of plunder," observed the French economist 
Frederic Bastiat. No matter how noble the justification, once the premise 
is accepted that a government can expropriate the wealth of some of its 
citizens and dispense it to others, theft has been legalized, and the signal 
has been sent that nothing is secure. Bastiat considered this the greatest 
evil to which any society can be subjected, but recognized it as the 
ultimate goal of all greedy men and do-gooders.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
French social psychologist Gustave Le Bon argued that all forms of 
government enshrine one or the other of "two different and opposing 
fundamental principles -- individualism and collectivism. By 
individualism, man is left to himself; his initiative is carried to a 
maximum and that of the state to a minimum. By collectivism a man's 
least actions are directed by the state . . . the individual possesses no 
initiative; all the acts of his life are mapped out." Le Bon had no 
difficulty determining which of these two conflicting principles leads to 
greater results: "The peoples among whom individualism is most highly 
developed are by this fact alone at the head of civilization."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
American patriot John T. Flynn urged his countrymen to "stop 
apologizing for our capitalist society." We should take no more steps 
down the road to socialism, he said, and turn out of office any politician 
who tries to lead us in that direction. Flynn pointed out "that we are in a 
social war, and that we must fight it as such." He said we should "put an 
end to the orgy of spending that is rapidly bankrupting the nation," quit 
letting bureaucrats plan our economy, and instead let "our free system of 
private enterprise operate at its fullest capacity."

<title>Duplantier:  Idahoans Lead Health Care Reform  -- 2/4/96</title>

<h2>Idahoans Lead Health Care Reform</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>"Can you name the two most progressive communities in America? When it comes to innovative approaches to health care, Jersey City, New Jersey and Ada County, Idaho are true trailblazers. </i></blockquote>
<P> 
In 1994, Jersey City, New Jersey became the first local government in 
America to offer its employees the health insurance option of Medical 
Savings Accounts (MSAs). Fewer than 200 of the city's nearly 3,000 
employees signed on at the outset, but even that small number saved Jersey 
City $21,000 in insurance premiums in the first three months that the plan 
was in use. In 1995, Ada County, Idaho followed suit with an MSA-based 
health insurance plan that County Commissioner Gary Glenn says was 
"designed to provide Ada County employees significantly enhanced health 
insurance coverage at a significantly reduced cost to the taxpayer." 
Roughly 170 out of 900 Ada County employees agreed to switch to MSAs, 
saving taxpayers $87,000 a year. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Providing enhanced coverage at a reduced cost may sound like "voodoo 
economics," but the explanation is simple. MSA plans pay 100 percent of a 
policyholder's health care expenses, but rely on a high deductible to keep 
costs down. The high-deductible policies are much cheaper than traditional 
low-deductible plans. Part of the money saved goes into Medical Savings 
Accounts set up for employees. Workers use the MSAs to pay their minor 
medical bills until they reach the deductible. Because policyholders get to 
keep whatever funds are left in their MSAs at the end of the year, they 
have a strong incentive to dicker with their doctors, to take better care 
of themselves, and to forgo unnecessary tests and treatment. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
An editorial in the Idaho Statesmen last summer described Medical Savings 
Accounts as "a great way to save money, promote lower overall health-care 
costs, and make consumers a more active and equal partner in the health 
equation." An MSA plan "can save money because it encourages workers to 
shop around. Bargain hunters can motivate hospitals and doctors to 
compete," said the newspaper. "As long as medical providers and insurance 
companies are running the show, consumers have little control over cost and 
little incentive to worry about it." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Ada County Commissioner Gary Glenn thinks the Medical Savings Account is 
"the wave of the future" and takes pride in his county's status as "the 
second public employer in the nation to try this option." An MSA plan "puts 
the patient in charge," says Glenn, who insists that "Americans are as 
capable of making decisions about health care as they are about every other 
product and service they buy." Everyone's a winner with MSAs. "Taxpayers 
win because they will have to pay less to cover their public employees," 
says Glenn. "Employees win because they have the freedom to make their own 
healthcare decisions and maybe save some money in the process. And the 
country wins because it will bring down the cost of health care in 
general."

<title>Backgounder Update No. 258 - Defense Budget -- Heritage </title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><i><h3>BUDGET CUTS COULD SPELL END OF AMERICAN GLOBAL POWER</h3></i>
By Baker Spring<br>
Senior Policy Analyst<br>
Backgrounder Update #258<br>
August 1, 1995<br>
(Updating <i>Backgrounder</i> No. 1019, "A Game Plan for Restoring America's Defenses," February 3, 1995)</center>
<p>
<hr size=3 width =50%>
<p>
	Formulating a sound national security policy is no simple matter. It requires more than merely deciding how much to spend on defense. Vital national interests must be identified. A strategy for defending these vital interests must be fashioned. The forces to execute the strategy must be designed and explained to Congress and the American people. Only when all these steps in the process have been accomplished can the President and Congress determine how much money is needed to fund the nation's defense requirements.
<p>
	The budget policies of both the Clinton Administration and Congress, however, reverse the process of formulating national security policy. Both start by asking not how much defense capability the nation needs, but how much, given other priorities, they are willing to spend on national security. While affordability always enters into the process of deliberating on the defense budget, it should not be the starting point in making national security policy. The starting point should be a rational assessment of the country's defense needs.
<p>
	This "budget-driven" approach carries with it potentially severe implications for the nation's defense posture. If the President and Congress do not change course on defense budget policy, the result will be forces smaller than those needed to execute the national strategy, a collapse of the strategy itself, and ultimately the exposure of America's vital national interests to foreign threats. While there is still time to alter course, Congress needs to address this pressing problem during the next 18 months. If it fails, by early in the next decade the United States may find itself no longer a global military power capable of defending all of its vital interests.
<p>
	Changing the course of the defense budget was going to be the job of a special commission created by the National Security Revitalization Act (H.R. 7), adopted by the House of Representatives on February 16, 1995. But the Senate version of the Defense Authorization Bill includes no provision for a special commission. While the failure of the Senate Armed Services Committee to include this provision is regrettable, a study similar to the one that was to be undertaken by the special commission can still go forward. Congress could appoint a staff group similar to one that studied the requirements for reorganizing the military in 1985.
<p>

<b>Clinton and Congress: Different Paths to the Same Result
</B><p>
	Congress on June 29 adopted a budget resolution that establishes the nation's fiscal blueprint for fiscal years 1996-2002.1 This blueprint includes budgetary guidelines for defense spending. Anticipating Congress's action, President Bill Clinton submitted a new budget plan of his own on June 13. However, Clinton's spending on defense remained essentially the same as he had proposed in his original fiscal 1996 budget in February 1995. The congressional budget resolution would provide $1,904.2 billion in budget authority for defense over the next seven years, while the Clinton proposal would provide $1,894.6 billion.2 Thus, Congress added $9.6 billion to Clinton's request for defense -- an increase of only 0.5 percent. For all intents and purposes, Clinton's seven-year defense budget request and the congressional budget resolution on defense are roughly the same.
<p>
	While the amount spent on defense is about the same, the two budget proposals differ sharply as to how and when the funds would be distributed over time. The Clinton Administration would impose steep reductions in the early years, later holding the line on further cuts. The congressional budget resolution, by contrast, spreads out defense budget reductions evenly over the next seven years (see Chart 1). This is why the Defense Authorization Bill for fiscal 1996, which reflects the requirements of the budget resolution for the coming fiscal year alone, will provide almost $7 billion more in budget authority than requested by the Clinton Administration.3 The Clinton Administration would provide more for defense than the budget resolution in fiscal years 2000, 2001, and 2002. Ultimately, both proposals anticipate a defense budget in 2002 that is less than 60 percent of what it was in fiscal 1985.

<p>
<b>The Retreat of America as a Global Military Power
</b><p>
	Since the Clinton Administration's and Congress's defense budget proposals are similar, the ultimate outcome for defense likewise would be similar: a forced retreat of the U.S. from its position as a global military power able to defend its global interests. If enacted, these defense budget proposals would cause at least six results.
<p>
<b>RESULT #1:</b> Force structure levels would have to be reduced by roughly 20 percent from those recommended in Clinton's Bottom-Up Review (BUR). In September 1993, the Clinton Administration announced the findings of its comprehensive Bottom-Up Review of defense policy. The study called for the Army to field the equivalent of between 15 and 16 divisions, the Air Force to deploy 20 tactical fighter wings, the Navy to retain 346 ships (including 12 aircraft carriers), and the Marine Corps to maintain 174,000 active-duty personnel. However, the Clinton Administration is not providing nearly enough money to sustain its recommended force structure. Analysts at The Heritage Foundation estimate that the five-year (FY 1996-2000) funding shortfall will be around $110 billion.4	The defense funding levels envisioned in the congressional budget resolution will not make up this shortfall. In fact, Congress is moving in the same direction as the Clinton Administration, albeit at a slower pace.	Assuming a defense budget that balances the requirements for readiness and modernization, these funding levels will force the adoption of a smaller force structure.5 This smaller force structure would include the equivalent of 12 Army divisions (instead of the 15-16 envisioned by the BUR); 15 Air Force tactical fighter wings (instead of 20); 300 Navy ships (instead of 346); and 140,000 active-duty Marines (instead of 174,000) (see Chart 2).
<p>
<b>RESULT #2:</b> Military personnel levels would have to shrink by roughly 15 percent below those recommended in the Bottom-Up Review. The Bottom-Up Review recommended that military personnel levels be reduced to 2,366,000 positions (active and reserve components combined) by the end of the decade. However, as a result of the impending defense budget cuts, personnel levels will drop -- as will overall force structure levels -- by almost 15 percent from levels recommended by the BUR, to 2,050,000 positions.
<p>
<b>RESULT #3:</b> The U.S. will not have enough military forces to fight a major regional conflict on the scale of the Persian Gulf War without abandoning its security commitments in non-combat theaters. Given the smaller conventional forces mandated by defense budget cuts, the U.S. would be hard-pressed to field the force it assembled to fight and win the Persian Gulf War. The only way it could do so would be to take forces from other regions that were not immediately threatened. But this would mean possibly abandoning security commitments in other parts of the world.
<p>
	A couple of examples demonstrate this point. During the Persian Gulf War, the equivalent of ten Air Force fighter wings were deployed in the combat theater. But these ten equivalents were drawn from 20 established fighter wings.6 For every fighter wing engaged in combat, the Air Force needed the equivalent of another wing to provide backup for maintenance and replacement in case aircraft were shot down, and to train and rotate crews. Even using a more liberal three-to-two ratio, as some defense analysts do, the U.S. would be barely able to muster the tactical air forces needed to fight a single regional conflict with the smaller force. Deploying ten tactical fighter wings in a future regional war would tie up 15 wings. Thus, virtually everything would be absorbed by a single conflict. The likely result would be for the Air Force to pull all of its tactical aircraft from, say, Europe and Asia if the conflict occurred in the Persian Gulf. 
<p>
	 The situation would be no less grim for the U.S. Army. The Army deployed seven divisions in the Persian Gulf.7 All seven were active divisions. Given the time to bring reserve component units up to full combat readiness, a future major regional conflict would place a premium on active divisions to perform combat missions. However, Clinton's and Congress's budgets would support only eight active Army divisions and the equivalent of four divisions in the reserve component. If seven active divisions are needed for a regional conflict, as occurred during the Gulf War, virtually all of the Army's active divisions will be absorbed. The eighth active division will have to remain in the U.S. to train the reserve units that may be needed to reinforce active-duty troops engaged in combat.
<p>
	The implication is clear: If a war broke out in the Persian Gulf, the Army would be unable to meet its commitments to other U.S. allies in Europe and Asia if they were threatened at the same time. Of the eight active divisions the budget would allow the Army to retain, three would be deployed in Europe and Korea even though they were needed in the Persian Gulf. Like the Air Force, the Army would have to abandon these theaters to fight in the Persian Gulf.
<p>
	Finally, the budget plans of the Administration and Congress would leave the U.S. Navy very thin. The budget would allow the Navy to maintain eight active carriers and one training carrier. Typically, two or three of these would be unavailable at any one time because of necessary maintenance. Therefore, if two aircraft carriers were in port for maintenance, only six would remain for active duty. But during the Persian Gulf War the Navy deployed six carriers to the region.8 In other words, practically the entire U.S. Navy would be needed to fight and win a single regional conflict on the order of the Persian Gulf War, leaving only one training carrier to defend American interests in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Result #4: The regional-based national security strategy will collapse. Immediately following the end of the Cold War, there was a consensus that U.S. conventional forces must be prepared to confront aggression in regions of vital interest to the United States. This consensus was reflected in the Bush Administration's "Base Force" and the Clinton Administration's 1993 Bottom-Up Review force. Both Bush and Clinton agreed that America needed enough military power to fight and win more than one major regional war, whether in Europe, Asia, or the Persian Gulf.
<p>
	However, if current defense budget resolutions are maintained, this goal will not be achieved. The consensus established immediately after the Cold War will be shattered. There will not be enough military forces to win more than a single regional conflict at any one time.
<p>
<b>Result #5:</b> With the collapse of the regional-based strategy, the alliance structure will be gravely jeopardized. If the Persian Gulf War took place in 2002 under projected defense budgets, the U.S. would have to withdraw and use the forces that are in Asia and Europe. As this reality dawns on America's allies in Europe and Asia, the credibility of the U.S. security commitment will come into question. America's allies surely will ask: What is the value of a U.S. security guarantee when American forces, under some circumstances, will not be able to fulfill their obligations? As a result, these allies may seek other ways to meet their security needs.
<p>
	The most likely casualty is NATO. The Europeans already are uncertain about America's credibility and staying power. The more apparent it becomes that the U.S. will be unable to meet its NATO commitments, the more Europe will be inclined to try new, untested defense structures built on the European Union and not NATO. Under these circumstances, an independent European nuclear force, with Germany's direct involvement, is not out of the question.
<p>
	In Asia the consequences of declining American military credibility are equally disturbing. Japan has two options. It could re-arm and become a major regional military power in its own right, something that would cause concern throughout Asia, or it could accommodate stronger regional military powers such as China and Russia and play one against the other whenever possible. Without America's protection, South Korea would likely want to expand its military power rapidly, in hopes of deterring a North Korean attack, but this certainly would lead to instability on the Korean Peninsula. The implication is clear: If American military power in Asia wanes, the results will be a new arms race, greater instability, and the greater likelihood of war. 
<p>
	 The same adverse dynamic would arise toward U.S. friends and allies in the Middle East if a future regional conflict occured outside the Persian Gulf. The Gulf Arab states would likely expand their existing policy of playing their stronger and more radical neighbors, Iran and Iraq, against each other. This policy, however, failed when Iraq invaded Kuwait. Israel, being prepared to defend itself as long as the U.S. continues material assistance, should be able to provide for its security.
<p>
	The hard fact remains that while the level of threat has decreased with the end of the Cold War, U.S. commitments to maintaining the security of Europe, Asia, and other regions have not. If the U.S. allows these commitments to come into question, the alliances it still needs may fall apart. 
<p>
<b>RESULT #6:</b> U.S. vital interests would be threatened. Since the end of World War II, the U.S. has recognized that its security was linked inextricably to events in Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Persian Gulf. Thus, the U.S. has recognized the need not only to maintain a balance of power in these regions, but to protect access to resources located in them, such as oil. Moreover, U.S. strategy has assumed that American economic prosperity depends on a free and open system of international trade.
<p>
	However, the Clinton and congressional budget resolutions would threaten each of these vital interests. A budget-driven withdrawal of U.S. forces from Europe, Asia, or the Persian Gulf would be tantamount to writing off these regions as unworthy of defense. Two world wars in this century should have taught Americans that this is a dangerous thing to do. No less so than during the 1930s, America cannot put its head in the sand. In fact, the security of the United States is more intertwined with that of the rest of the world today than in any other time in history.
<p>
	A less apparent but no less important benefit of U.S. global military power is the security of the international economic and trade system. Some expect that the free trade system will survive even if the U.S. abandons its security commitments. This is overly optimistic. The global trade system is supported by a well-defined and strongly supported security structure. If this structure collapsed, the trade system could collapse with it. The result could be the emergence of hostile trading blocs, with trade used not as a means to prosperity, but as a weapon in political wars.
<p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<P>
	Congress cannot afford to ignore the emerging crisis in the defense budget. Urgent attention needs to be paid to ensuring that defense budgets reflect accurately the requirements of a sound national security strategy.
<P>
	The question of how best to resolve this crisis could be addressed by authorizing a congressional staff study on how to close the gap between defense budgets and national security requirements. The study could weigh the benefits of increasing the budget against the risks of reducing U.S. security commitments. The staff could be appointed by the chairmen of the House National Security Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee. This group would be similar to the one which produced a report in 1985 on military reorganization.9 The two chairmen should direct their staffs to pool their efforts and produce a report before the consideration of the budget resolution by Congress next year. The entire Senate could show its support by adopting a sense of the Senate resolution asking the two chairmen to appoint such a staff group as it considers the Defense Authorization Bill in the coming days.
<p>
	If current defense budget trends continue, America's days as a global military power capable of defending all its global interests will be numbered. No amount of rationalization can cover up this hard, cold fact. New technologies will not save America from this disastrous outcome. Nor will new strategies that downplay threats to American interests. Only a sound strategy that matches means and ends can ensure the survival of American freedom and prosperity through the next century.

<p>
Big Government was consolidated in America in the First Hundred Days of the presidency of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. By promising that the House would enact the Contract With America in the First Hundred Days of the 104th Congress, Speaker Newt Gingrich deliberately invited the history books to compare the work of the House Republican leadership with the New Deal of FDR.<p>
Policy Review asked nine students of American politics to assess the historic significance of Gingrich's First Hundred Days, and the principal achievements and errors of the House Republican leadership during this "rendezvous with destiny."<p>
<center><b>John J. Pitney, Jr.</center></b><p>
At first glance, it seems that the House GOP's First Hundred Days compare badly with FDR's. Although all the items in the Contract With America reached the House floor, only two of them (congressional compliance and unfunded mandates) became law before the hundredth day. By contrast, FDR signed bushels of bills during the Hundred Days of 1933. His emergency banking measure went through introduction, passage, and signature on the very first day of the congressional sessionand in less than eight hours.<p>
It is unfair, however, to judge today's House Republicans by the Roosevelt standard. Crisis is the great lubricant of the legislative process, and the economic calamities of FDR's early days briefly suspended Capitol Hill's normal friction. And odd as it may sound, many aspects of public life actually moved faster in 1933 than in 1995. Take justice, for instance. Shortly before FDR took office, a man named Giuseppe Zangara fired five shots at the president-elect, missing him but killing one person and wounding four others. Zangara was tried, convicted, and executed within 33 days. In the 1990s, jury selection alone can take longer than that, and capital offenders can stay out of the electric chair for years by filing endless habeas corpus petitions.<p>
Government has become tangled in its own red tapewhich is precisely why the Republicans put so much emphasis on procedural reform. They started with the House itself, recognizing that the institution would work more efficiently with fewer committees and smaller staffs. The best symbol of their commitment to renewing Congress came with the congressional-compliance bill, which cleared both chambers faster than any peacetime domestic legislation since Roosevelt's banking bill in 1933. In other ways, the Republicans strove to make government leaner and less cumbersome. Proposals such as block grants would eliminate layers of bureaucracy and miles of red tape. And the GOP crime bill would restore rationality to the appeals process in capital cases, thereby ensuring swift justice for the Zangaras of the future.<p>House Republicans are pushing the federal government to match the pace of 62 years ago. Ironically, that is high praise.<p>

<p>
The First Hundred Days of the new House Republican leaders will deserve that well-worn adjective "historic" even if relatively few of the measures listed in their Contract With America ever become law in a form they would recognize. For the central achievement of the First Hundred Days was to change the whole terrain and direction of American politics.<p>
Last year, the most that could be conceived, let alone hoped for, in the field of tax reform was a modest reduction in the rate of income taxation. Todaywhether or not major changes occur in the first session of the 104th Congressthe serious talk among congressional leaders is about imposing a flat tax, or even tearing up the tax code by the roots and replacing the income tax with a broad-based tax on consumption.<p>
Similarly, "welfare reform" in 1994 meant, at best, doing a little nipping and tucking on Aid to Families with Dependent Children. Today, the entire burden of administering most of the nation's huge welfare programs is on its way back to the 50 individual states, along with block grants to finance it.<p>
And so it went, in one field after another, from unfunded mandates to the line-item veto; this new House of Representatives has dared to think and act in ways that have simply transformed the paradigms of American politics. It remains true that "politics is the art of the possible," but a huge number of new possibilities has opened up.<p>
Whether the First Hundred Days of this House will ultimately deserve comparison to the First Hundred Days of Franklin Roosevelt's presidency depends upon how successful the Republicans are in setting their initiatives in concrete, as the New Dealers managed to set theirs. At this writing, and probably for several years to come, it is simply too early to tell. Much depends on how the voters react in November 1996, when they will, with their votes, make their first and perhaps most important comment on the Republican performance. Almost as crucial, however, will be the way in which future Republican presidents and Congresses follow up on the achievements of the 104th.<p>
Any major mistakes? Yes, one: The failure to anticipate and prepare for the Democrats' counterattack, based on the tired old charge that Republicans want to starve America's children and stuff the money into the pockets of the rich. Don't be fooled by the sheer implausibility of such an accusationa big enough lie will be believed, by a small but often crucial percentage of the voters, if it isn't nailed promptly and repeatedly by spokesmen whom the media cannot ignore. (Note how disastrously the Bush administration let the liberals rewrite the whole history of the 1980s.) We may yet pay dearly for the Republican party's sloth in this regard.<p>

<p>
The House Republican Leadership did most of what it said it would do in the Contract With America. The result was a remarkable legislative flurry that largely fulfilled the campaign promises that so many Republicans made during the 1994 elections.<p>
How do we compare this Republican onslaught in 1995 with FDR's First Hundred Days in 1933? Both were years of high legislative intensity; both years are likely to be described later as landmarks in 20th-century political history. And, in both years, the discussion of ideas dominated the media.<p>
The differences between the two events are more interesting, and in some cases more subtle. Obviously, the Republicans were critical of Big Government and skeptical of the idea that man can improve his condition through central planning. The Republicans had zeal, but no faith in the perfectibility of man. By contrast, FDR's New Deal promoted the idea that government could solve economic problemsthat individual liberty had to be sacrificed and power centralized in Washington to attack the Great Depression. FDR's spirits were high because he believed man to be capable of pulling the levers and turning the wheels to effectively control America's destiny.<p>
Another difference is often overlooked. The Republican Contract was a conscious, thoughtful, and usually coherent plan that went from campaign document to legislative writ. The New Deal was improvisational and contradictory right from the start. During the 1932 campaign, for example, FDR denounced Hoover for his "reckless spending" and budget deficits. The New Deal to come was never outlined. But in Roosevelt's First Hundred Days, he reversed himself. In just three months, he pushed and signed bills that authorized government to spend almost as much as Hoover did in his entire presidency. FDR wanted a government program for each constituency: AAA for farmers, FERA for the unemployed, TVA for the South, CCC for the young, and so on.<p>
His First Hundred Days were crucial because they shattered the notion that government worked best when it was limited. Government became a Mecca for interest groups that wanted to secure benefits from Washington, so much so that FDR, after his First Hundred Days, could not control the claimants. Cities flooded Congress with requests for road-building money; veterans won cash bonuses for past service; the silver lobby wangled from Washington more subsidy money than even the farmers could manage. American politics had crossed a threshold.<p>
The Republican Contract is a response to the rise of this welfare state and to the twofold protest that the New Deal/Great Society programs mostly haven't worked, and taxes to pay for them are too high. These two points are addressed in part by the Balanced Budget Amendment. If it had included Congressman Dick Armey's flat-tax proposalinstead of seeking to manipulate the current system of tax deductionsthe Contract could have challenged the New Deal more effectively. Special-interest politics, as Roosevelt learned, needs to extract money from some groups in order to support others. A progressive income tax is indispensable to a growing welfare state. In office, FDR soon hiked the top marginal tax rate to 79 percent; later he pushed it to 90 percent. A flat tax, by contrast, forces supporters of new government programs (and old ones, for that matter) to admit they will tax all to benefit a few. That admission alone might lead many to rethink the strong role of government in American society.<p>

<p><center><b>Jeff Jacoby</b></center><p>
Of course it wasn't the same as those Hundred Days. In March 1933, when FDR got Congress to enact a slew of government-aggrandizing lawsthus triggering the New Deal that vastly expanded Washington's control17 million citizens had lost their jobs, 5,000 banks had collapsed, and the nation was mired in the most frightening depression in its history. Amid mass desperation, a Democratic president with a fresh mandate was able to get a Democratic Congress to more or less pass anything he wanted.<p>
The national mood in January 1995, by contrast, was nowhere near as frantic. When Speaker Gingrich and the House Republicans uncorked their political revolution, they benefited from none of the panic-driven momentum that the Depression had lent Franklin Roosevelt and the Democrats 62 years earlier. Instead, they faced an enemy in the White House, a largely hostile press corps, a $1.6 trillion federal establishment more likely to munch ground glass than relinquish power without a death-struggle, and a Senate led by Bob Dole.So, no, in terms of legislation completed, Gingrich's First Hundred Days don't compare with FDR's. But measured against other yardsticks, the House Republicans' quick-march through the Contract With America was even more significant.<p>
The customary formula of federal politics is: The president proposes, Congress disposes. So thoroughly did Gingrich and his army upend that piece of conventional wisdom that by the end of a hundred days, Bill Clinton was reduced to insisting that he still mattered. "The president," he sniffled in a mid-April press conference, "is relevant here."<p>
The Republicans upended another piece of conventional wisdom: that platformsi.e., ideasdon't win or lose elections. The life cycles of modern party platforms are familiar. Party members meet. They brawl over a couple of planks. They vote for a platform everyone can live with. Then they print a few copies nobody will ever read or care about.<p>
In 1994, GOP House candidates followed a completely different path. They gathered to sign a brief "contract" whose details weren't yet drafted, but whose main promisedrastically reduced federal powerwas crystal-clear. The pundits promptly consigned it to oblivion. Tens of millions of copies appeared in print. And an intense ideological campaign was then waged between the party that wrote the Contract and the party that reviled it.<p>
Never in modern U.S. politics has a party platforma party's statement of principlesmattered more. Two years ago, they lost a White House they had virtually owned because their incumbent didn't grasp the power of "the vision thing"; in November, Republicans conquered a Congress thought to be permanently closed to them precisely because they did.<p>
Or did they?<p>
Right after the GOP won its astonishing victory, Gingrich articulated his Prime Directive: "Cooperate, yes. Compromise, no." Right after that, the compromising began.<p>
The provision for a three-fifths supermajority to approve tax increases was dropped from the Balanced Budget Amendment. The national-security bill was stripped of missile defense. The unfunded-mandates bill repealed precisely zero unfunded federal mandates. The GOP's crime bill wound up with the same price tag as the supposedly "pork-filled" Democratic version of last year. The bloated food-stamp program was exempted from welfare reform. Term limits were croaked.<p>
The Clinton tax increases that Republicans had unanimously opposed in 1993 were left virtually intact. Republicans talked of "zeroing out" government subsidies for the arts and public broadcastinguntil Garth Brooks came by to lobby, and the talk dried up. The House passed a legal-reform bill that federalized great swaths of tort law. Enthusiasm for eliminating entire Cabinet departments was limited to feisty freshmen with no clout and conservative think tanks with no vote. And to mark the completion of the First Hundred Days, Gingrich declared in a television address that his party was certainly not proposing to actually shrink the federal budget.<p>
In its First Hundred Days, the new GOP House majority ignited the conservative revolution it had been elected to achieve. Without question, it has changed the terms of debate on the Hill. But before their sprint through the Contract was done, the Republicans were once again showing the symptoms that had always doomed them in the past: weak knees and thin skin.<p>

<p><center><b>Alonzo L. Hamby</b></center>
<p>
Speaker Gingrich and his lieutenants fulfilled to the letter the Contract with America pledge that ten important issues would be taken to a vote in the House. Observers must be impressed, moreover, by the GOP's passage of nine of these, and by the party's ability to round up four-fifths of its members for the failed term-limits constitutional amendment. The new House leadership has established a remarkable working model of a disciplined, responsible party motivated by deeply-felt principleson one side of Capitol Hill.<p>
And when one looks for long-term significance, there's the rub. As of this writing, the Balanced Budget Amendment has already failed in the Senate, which is widely expected to reject or drastically modify other Contract items. In addition, President Clinton may muster the courage, conviction, or pragmatic judgment to wield a veto or two. What comes out of the Senate and White House legislative sausage-grinders will likely strike Contract devotees as inferior bratwurst rather than fine tenderloin. No, this will not be as significant as FDR's First Hundred Days.<p>
What major mistakes did the Republicans make? Clearly they still need to work on what George Bush might have called "the message thing." Admittedly, it is no easy task to get a conservative perspective past the filter of a predominantly liberal-leaning national media, but it can be done. The leadership was blindsided on the school-lunch issue, although the Democratic tactics were predictable. Thanks to Henry Hyde's impassioned defense of political careerism, network television played the term-limits debate as primarily an argument among Republicans rather than one between Republicans and Democrats. In the absence of a Jack Kemp able to explain in appealing terms the importance of preferences for capital gains and savings, the Democrats appear to have achieved an advantage on the tax-equity issue. Finally, the Speaker, for all his intramural leadership skills, oscillates wildly between flashes of brilliance and egregious gaffes. As a result, he enjoys less public esteem than he deserves.<p>
At the end of the hundred days, the Republicans remain locked in a continuing struggle with the Democrats for the soul of an angry, alienated "populistic" segment of the electoratesimilar to the swing constituency once called "Middle America" and these days attracted to Ross Perot. The GOP can prevail when it convincingly depicts the Democrats as the party of the special interests (affirmative-action beneficiaries, welfare bureaucrats, etc.), but the issue can be used by the Democrats when they depict the Republicans as advocates of tax breaks for "the rich" or abusers of mothers and children. The argument remains unsettled; the Republicans need to do a much better job of articulating their side of it.<p>
Corrosively cynical, this populistic electorate seems to see only business as usual in Washington and is unlikely to give the Republicans much credit for an imperfectly fulfilled Contract. It also still appears prone to believe the budget can be balanced simply by eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse while leaving entitlements and pork untouched. It remains uncertain whether this group, or America at large, is prepared for the consequences of a smaller federal establishment: greater local and individual self-reliance.<p>
One last thought: If conservatives want to be successful, they had better stop depicting themselves as involved in a sweeping effort to uproot the New Deal. Speaker Gingrich (perhaps consciously drawing on the example of Ronald Reagan) was right on target in professing admiration for Franklin D. Roosevelt and at least some of his accomplishments. The Republicans were elected to reverse the lingering excesses of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, not to take us back to the world of Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover.<p><I>

There are advantages as well as disadvantages to speed.<p>
The First Hundred Days of the Republican majority were like a laser showfull of color and sound, but so fast and furious that it was difficult for voters to single out the constituent parts.<p>
The Contract gave shape to the first months of Republican dominance on Capitol Hill, which might otherwise have been characterized by fits and starts. Though designed primarily as a vote-getter, the Contract also served extremely well to enforce party discipline. Everyone understood the promise, everyone was committed to the schedule, and factiousness among Republicans was kept to a minimum.<p>
That was the advantage of speed. The disadvantage is that the individual terms of the Contract, many of which deserved a greater hearing, more explanation, and more time before the public, were given short shrift. Few Americans really understand the benefits of tort reform, welfare reform, or regulatory reform.<p>
In a bravura performance over the First Hundred Days, the Republicans made only two errors. The first was the excessive attention to the question of whether or not to punish Senator Mark Hatfield for his vote on the Balanced Budget Amendment. In so doing, Republicans themselves (without help from the media) made Hatfield and, accordingly, internecine Republican quarrels, the story of the BBA's failure. In fact, the story ought to have been the six Democrats who switched their votes and defeated a bill they had supported only months before. Hatfield is a liberal Republican. He voted his conscience. Punishment would have been futile. Besides, his breed is dying out. He does not represent the future of the GOP. Effort spent trying to "fix" him would be better directed elsewhere.<p>
The other error was the failure to anticipate the reaction among liberals (especially in the press) to changes in the school-lunch program. Of course the liberals were dishonest, unscrupulous, and brazen in their depiction of the terms of debate ("starving children" indeed!), but it is the job of conservatives in America to prepare for that pitch and knock it out of the park. Ronald Reagan knew that Jimmy Carter was going to portray him as a mad bomber in the 1980 presidential debates, and he was ready with a riposte: "There you go again." But Republicans were caught flat-footed when Democrats accused them of trying to take food from the mouths of babes.<p>
Still, only two mistakes in three months is an enviable record. I wish I could match it.<p><I>

While the fulfillment of the House Republicans' Contract With America in just 92 days is largely worth rejoicing, this momentous occasion also illustrates how Americans have "defined democracy down" through the years. The House's single-minded passage of the Contract's provisions (with the unfortunate and sloppily-handled exception of term limits) was an exhilarating interval in recent political history. Still, the balloons and streamers flew over the U.S. Capitol after the Contract's completion precisely because the House GOP accomplished what Americans should normally expect of their representatives: They engaged them with ideas. They pledged to vote on them, then did so, as promised.<p>
Although this sort of innovation and accountability should be routine, they instead are refreshing departures from the recent national campaigns that have enflamed public cynicism. George Bush's abandoned "Read my lips: no new taxes" pledge and Bill Clinton's phantom "middle-class tax cut" illustrate this problem. The Contract's greatest legacy may be that it reversed the rising tide of antagonism that had severely eroded Washington's goodwill with the American public. Now that House Republicans have actually kept their word on the Contract, Congress today enjoys its highest approval rating in years.<p>
Assuming the Senate and President Clinton cooperate, the enactment of most Contract items, per se, will not influence American politics as profoundly as did FDR in his First Hundred Days. However, the paradigm shift that has accompanied the Contract likely will parallel the new thinking that FDR inspired 62 years ago. The Contract and the GOP's takeover of Congress have led Washington to discuss seriously the abolition of the income tax, the closing of at least four Cabinet departments, and a balanced budget by 2002. House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt has now embraced tax simplification, while Bill Clinton has placed federal affirmative-action policies under a microscope. These realities would have been mere hallucinations just nine months ago. By committing themselves to a coherent "vision thing," today's GOP has moved the entire plate of acceptable discourse tectonically to the right.<p>
Speaker Newt Gingrich and his allies, however, stumbled badly on the so-called "school-lunch" issue. Democrats stereotypically pummel GOP budget cuts and block grants with dusty rhetoric about "starving babies" and "at-risk infants." Republicans should have anticipated these attacks after seeing them haunt Ronald Reagan and George Bush for 12 years. Opening with a salvo against corporate welfaresuch as having Archer-Daniels-Midland tycoon Dwayne Andreas explain to a subcommittee why his multi-billion-dollar agroempire deserves federal subsidieswould have blunted Democratic charges about GOP "greed" and "meanness." So would have energetic reminders that vibrant economic growth especially lifts the poor and unemployed.<p>
The Contract also failed to address the coming entitlements meltdown. While Speaker Gingrich insists it is "off the table," Social Security, as well as Medicare, Medicaid, veterans benefits and other give-away programs, jeopardize America's future financial well-being. While a promise to vote on affluence-testing or privatization of these programs would have made the Contract far more controversial, it also would have shown the GOP exhibiting genuine courage. Now, without a mandate to do so, the Republican-led 104th Congress must show even greater bravery by confronting entitlements (try balancing the budget without doing so). Or, it simply can stand back and watch Social Security and Medicare eat us alive. <p>

Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and the new Republican House leadership deserve thanks and congratulations for the successful completion of the Contract With America. What a revolutionary (or more correctly, counterrevolutionary) series of events has taken place! With the Contract, a promise to the American people was made; in a little less than the promised hundred days, the promise was kept. Of what other Congress in this century can that be said?<p>
Certainly some needed changes were made to vexing and intolerable House rules; for the first time, national laws passed by Congress will apply to the House as well as ordinary Americans. Having to live by the rules made for the rest of us cannot but raise the consciousness of the rulemakers and dissuade them from their excesses.<p>
Certainly some important legislation was passed by the House in those historic hundred days. Congress agreed to stop imposing mandates on state and local jurisdictions without paying the bill; such progress was nearly undreamt of in our philosophy just a few months before the Contract was unveiled. Is this important? Indeed it is. Is it enough? Perhaps not. Our liberties have already been eroding for decades; what's worse, the cost of the erosion has been passed down the line. Far better for Congress to forswear dreaming up silly rules to begin with; agreeing to pay their cost only solves half the problem. But let us not quibble with progress in the right direction. The looming struggle to actually cut federal spending by billions of dollars may preclude any more erosions.<p>
Congratulations are also deserved for passing a tax cut and for stepping forth on welfare reform. Has the American public forgotten the promises made by then-Governor Bill Clinton when he campaigned for president? A middle-class tax cut? The end of welfare as we know it? The new House leadership promised both, and they, not Clinton, kept the promise.<p>
But a word of caution on the welfare-reform proposals: Just as limited congratulations are due for eliminating unfunded mandates, limited caution is due for proposing to send money to the states in the form of block grants with no strings attached. This will create, as someone has noted, "funded unmandates."<p>
For those of us in California, this is an interesting exercise in neofederalisma tasty bit of proper philosophy, or revolutionary devolution, if you will. The warning is this: The California legislature, perhaps more than any other state legislature, has suffered from Congress-envy for at least the last three decades. If California legislators suddenly find billions of dollars dropped in their allegedly bare general-fund cupboard, what mischief might they do? Conservatives and libertarians alike want major programs such as welfare brought closer to us, closer to our scrutiny, closer to our effective control. Will we get what we want, or will we get a more fearsome monster than the current federal system? In this case, sense may have been sacrificed for speed; again, the federal government would do far better to reduce taxes, forswearing the revenue, than collecting and then returning the money in skewed proportions.<p>
All in all, hearty congratulations to the House Republican leadership! Promises made, promises keptwho could ask for more? At least, who could ask for more in the First Hundred Days? May the next five hundred days go as well! Legislators keeping promisesit might catch on.<p><I>

The Contract With America committed the House Republicans to raising and voting on each of the Contract items. This was accomplished and should be considered a major shift from politics as usual.<p>
One major frustration that Americans have expressed in recent years is that they vote for change but get only lip service from political leaders. The significance in the Contract With America is that a group of politicians did what they said they would. The Contract raises the level of political debate to one of performance and effectiveness, rather than distortion, political expediency, and misrepresentation by political officials, candidates, and parties.<p>
The greatness of these hundred days is that they changed the political process. The substantive change is yet to be determined. It is still too early to tell whether the policies passed by the House in the First Hundred Days will become law, and if so, what effect they will ultimately have on American life and culture.<p>
Even now, however, we can see a shifting of attitude among the American people. Inherent in the policy and legislative changes proposed in the Republicans' First Hundred Days are the notions of individual responsibility and accountability for one's actions. Government appears to be seen as a catalyst and facilitator for change, but not the ultimate determinant of the individual lives of our citizens.<p>
Major mistakes during the First Hundred Days include the failure to support term limits as forcefully as other elements of the Contract. The leadership vacillated and approached this issue tentatively. They should have committed firmly to this issue, which was approved in all of the 22 states where it was considered by the voters.<p>
The leadership allowed the debate to deteriorate into "them vs. us" on issues such as the school-lunch program and the group-home concept for unwed teenage mothers without stable homes of their own. The leadership allowed these ideas and "those conservative Republicans" supporting them to be portrayed as insensitive or callous. They should instead have placed the true nature of these issues at the center of the debate.<p><I>

<h2>
 States Lead Reform, Part I
</h2>

<i>1994 was a watershed year for Republicans, but that dramatic 
Congressional election may have less impact than the changes made on 
the state level.</i>
<p>
"Since the Republican victories of November 8, 1994, the press has 
focused on the dramatic changes in Congress. With a net gain of 52 seats 
in the U.S. House of Representatives and eight seats in the U.S. Senate, 
the Republicans took control of both houses of Congress for the first time 
in 40 years," observes Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform. 
"Party-switching and special elections have since left the partisan balance 
in the House of Representatives at 236 Republicans to 198 Democrats 
(with one independent); in the Senate, it is 53 Republicans to 47 
Democrats."
<p>
Norquist acknowledges the tremendous impact on national politics of this 
party realignment, but insists, nevertheless, that Washington is not where 
the action is. Writing in the June issue of Policy Review, Norquist argues 
that "the intense focus on Washington DC has obscured the conservative 
revolution within the states. In some ways, the changes occurring in state 
capitals across the country are even more important than those inside the 
Beltway," he contends. "Conservative reforms at the state level make 
similar efforts in Washington both more likely and, oddly, less important. 
The states have led the way so far, and they are quite prepared to march 
ahead even if the revolution in Washington stalls."
<p>
Norquist contends that "the 1994 shift in partisan control was more 
pronounced at the state and local levels than in Washington. Republicans 
won 24 of 36 gubernatorial races to increase the number of statehouses in 
their column from 19 to 30," he reports. The vast majority of Americans 
"now live in states with Republican governors." This historic, 
comprehensive realignment "affects the content of the policy debate in at 
least two ways. First, it intensifies the pressure from the states for more 
autonomy," says Norquist. "Second, a Republican Congress is more 
likely to fulfill its commitment to 'devolution' knowing that ideologically 
sympathetic governors are at the helm in many key states."
<p>
The example of reform-minded Governors, who practice what they 
preach about cutting big government, may be just what our Congressmen 
need to help them stick to their guns. "In Washington, political reform 
has been frustrated by a recalcitrant Senate and Bill Clinton's veto pen," 
observes Grover Norquist. "Of the Contract with America's 10 specific 
items, Congress has passed only the line-item veto, procedural reforms in 
the House of Representatives, and the Congressional Accountability Act, 
which brings Congress somewhat under the same laws it imposes upon 
business. The House has passed the Balanced Budget Amendment, 
regulatory reform, and other legislation, only to see them watered down 
or stopped in the Senate. Bill Clinton has twice vetoed welfare reform, 
and a relatively narrow tort-reform bill was passed over his veto."
<p>
The states are having more success. "The new generation of Republican 
governors and state legislators is advancing the Republican reform 
agenda," says Norquist, "from tax cuts to tort reform."

<br></i>

<h2>Family vs. "Village"</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
First Lady Hillary Clinton and her friends tell us that it takes a village to    
raise a child, but to them "village" is just a code word for Big Brother    
government. 
</i></blockquote>
<P>  
It's a nice sounding proverb: It takes a village to raise a child. But what    
does it really mean? What does Hillary Clinton have in mind when she    
speaks of a "village"? How does she propose to "raise a child"? Do these    
terms mean the same thing to her that they do to the rest of us? Former    
Virginia Secretary of Health and Human Services Kay James contends    
that the First Lady's interpretation of this traditional African proverb is    
anything but traditional.    
<p>    
"Three fundamental problems arise with the use of this proverb," writes    
Mrs. James in the February issue of Imprimis, the monthly journal of    
Hillsdale College. "First, children do not belong to the village or to the    
community or to the government. They belong to parents, and the village    
exists as a resource for these families." The second problem is that the    
village -- the small, closely-knit community many of us grew up in -- "no    
longer exists." The third problem is that liberals think they can replace    
the village of days gone by with "big government."    
<p>    
Mrs. James considers it ironic that "the more our families disintegrate, the    
more violence explodes in our homes and on our streets, the more our    
schools fail the grade, the more this old proverb is repeated." Invoking    
proverbs like a mantra will not change the fact that the village "has been    
utterly and completely destroyed." Mrs. James argues that, "rather than    
work to rebuild the village, we have instead taken the broken bricks of    
families, the mortar of cultural institutions, and the steel of houses of    
worship and used them to build up Town Hall." This, of course, is the    
worst thing we could have done, for our growing dependence on big    
government "has robbed us of the drive so necessary to sustain and    
strengthen the institutions of the village."    
<p>    
Hillary Clinton and like-minded liberals can sing the praises of the    
village, but that doesn't alter the fact that it was their policies that    
destroyed it. "Liberal theology has undermined our faith and destroyed    
the traditional role of churches," declares Mrs. James. "Liberal education    
policies have ravaged our public schools. Liberal social policies have    
sabotaged our families. Liberal public policies have fostered welfare    
dependency encouraged promiscuous behavior, and empowered criminals    
instead of citizens."    
<p>    
Mrs. James contends that Americans today know "the full cost of ceding    
our responsibilities to the federal government." We know that "the    
government cannot be our parents, cannot teach our children about    
responsibility and character, cannot regulate individual behavior, and    
cannot create entrepreneurial opportunities." We know that "the real    
solutions are not political," and that "real change must still come from the    
transformed hearts and souls of individuals."

<title>Duplantier: Property Rights -- 7/9/96</title>

<h2>
Property Rights
</h2>

<i>"Property is power. If the government owned or controlled all the 
property, it would possess all the power."</i>
<p>
The League of Private Property Voters periodically releases an index 
recording Congressional votes relating to property rights and rating our 
elected representatives according to their respect for private property. 
"There was a major change in Congress in 1994 and private property 
rights continued to grow as a major political issue during the first half of 
the 104th Congress," reports the League. "Consequently, more and more 
politicians climbed on the bandwagon and proclaimed steadfast support 
of property rights." In their 1995-96 Private Property Vote Index, 
recording 15 House votes and 10 Senate votes, the League documents "a 
dramatic improvement in the House of Representatives, with a modest 
gain in the Senate in the 104th Congress. Private property rights were a 
significant part of the Contract With America in the House," the League 
explains. "However, the Senate slowed progress down significantly."
<p>
The change of party control in Congress brought "many more private 
property advocates into committee chairmanships and other positions of 
power. However, there was a powerful split between Western private 
property advocates and Eastern representatives, who generally have a 
lower awareness of the vital nature of private property rights." The 
League reports that the House and Senate passed bills restricting the use 
of unfunded mandates, thereby slowing "the massive increase in Federal 
regulations which invariably lead to 'taking' private property rights. But 
in the area of regulatory reform, risk assessment, private property rights, 
and wetlands compensation, fast House action was faced with a stonewall 
in the Senate." The League contends that there is "a groundswell of 
support to reform the Endangered Species Act and Section 404 wetlands 
regulations," but warns that "the Green advocacy groups have mounted a 
well-financed counter offensive with great success."
<p>
The League argues that "secure and enforceable property rights are 
necessary for civil order. When property ownership becomes vague and 
unsettled, strife and social breakdown soon follow." The League notes 
that "our free market economy is based on secure and enforceable 
property rights." They point out that "private property is what allows 
people to pursue their own goals, independent of the state or society." 
Contrary to what many people think, private property rights are also 
necessary for the protection of the environment. "When people own 
resources in common, they take as much as they can as quickly as they 
can," the League observes. "Many of the professional environmental 
pressure groups often deny the crucial role of property rights in 
protecting the environment. That is because political power means more 
to them than the health of the environment."
<p>
The League points out that "our system of limited government, including 
our constitutional rights, survives because of the widespread ownership 
of property." If it were not for this widespread ownership, "our 
constitutional rights would become mere paper rights, unenforceable 
against an all-powerful government. That is why the protection of private 
property rights should concern all Americans, whether they own property 
or not."

<h2>Pugwash Brainwash</h2></center><P> 

[This year's Nobel Peace Prize speaks volumes about the dubious politics 
of the Nobel Committee.]
<P>
This year's Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the Pugwash Conferences 
on Science and World Affairs, a long-inactive organization, and to one 
of its last remaining members, 86-year-old Polish-born Joseph Rotblat. 
Few Americans under the age of 50 even remember the Pugwash 
Conferences or have any idea who Joseph Rotblat is. They're not likely to 
understand the significance of this year's Peace Prize, or to realize what 
a travesty it is.
<P>
The Pugwash Conferences took their name from the location of the first 
conference, held in 1957 in Pugwash, Nova Scotia, the home of the 
organization's chief financial backer, multi-millionaire U.S. industrialist 
Cyrus Eaton. Eaton and other Pugwash members, such as British 
philosopher Bertrand Russell, were ardent socialists who sought, under 
the guise of scientific objectivity, to influence world affairs to the 
advantage of the Soviet Union and to the detriment of the United States.
<P>
The most important Pugwash Conference took place in Moscow in 1960. 
Among the more prominent U.S. scientists attending were Jerome 
Wiesner and Walt Rostow, who shortly after their return became leading 
policy planners in the next administration of President John F. Kennedy. 
At that Moscow conference, Wiesner outlined a comprehensive program 
for nuclear disarmament and for transferring our nation's military 
strength to an international agency. Rostow also addressed the 
conference, recommending a nuclear test ban treaty .
<P>
Rostow was well placed in the Kennedy Administration to promote this 
objective. In 1963, President Kennedy sent Averell Harriman to Moscow 
to sign the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, thereby perpetuating the 
tremendous advantage that the Soviets had gained from a recent series of 
giant nuclear tests. Rostow and his fellow Pugwash members were 
criticized for jeopardizing U.S. security with this treaty, but they 
continued to insist that "nuclear parity will promote peace." They 
argued, absurdly, that abandoning America's nuclear advantage in favor 
of equality between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. would make the Soviet 
Union feel more secure and thereby less likely to resort to war!
<P>
Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, who served in both the Kennedy 
and the Johnson Administrations, made "parity" a cornerstone of his 
strategy to abandon our strategic superiority. He argued that "nuclear 
parity" would give the world "a more stable balance of terror." It had, in 
fact, the very opposite effect, emboldening the Soviet Union to extend its 
evil empire, secure in the knowledge that the United States could no 
longer risk a nuclear showdown. The Soviets maintained their aggressive 
military posture until President Reagan rebuilt our military strength and 
demonstrated his determination to follow through on building the 
Strategic Defense Initiative. Unable to keep pace with our procurement, 
the evil empire self-destructed. In awarding this year's Peace Prize to the 
Pugwash Conferences, the Nobel Committee makes abundantly clear that 
its idea of "peace" is really pacifism.

<title>Duplantier:  Affirmative Action  -- 5/8/96</title>

<h2>Affirmative Action</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
More and more minority members are voicing their opposition to 
affirmative action, rejecting the patronizing racial preferences that 
are supposed to benefit them in college admissions and business 
employment.
</i></blockquote>
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In February, an initiative prohibiting preferential treatment on the 
state and local level qualified for the November ballot in California. 
In March, a federal appeals court rejected the use of racial 
preferences in determining admissions to the University of Texas law 
school. Even as we speak, legislation is pending in Congress that 
would prohibit the use of racial preferences in the hiring of federal 
employees and the awarding of federal contracts. What's going on in 
the state legislatures, the federal courts, and the Congress?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What's happening is that minority members themselves are becoming 
increasingly vocal in their opposition to racial preferences, 
recognizing these condescending concessions as the ultimate form of 
racial prejudice -- and rejecting the pandering posture of the self-
appointed minority leaders who promote them. With this groundswell of 
opposition among the supposed beneficiaries of racial preferences, it 
has now become politically feasible to denounce the injustice of 
affirmative action.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Terry Eastland is the author of a new book called<i> Ending Affirmative 
Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice.</i> In a recent editorial in the 
Wall Street Journal, Eastland observes that racial preferences "have 
never enjoyed majority support and are now in serious political 
trouble." For one thing, there's simply no denying that racial 
preferences are discriminatory. "Whatever might be said in support of 
preferences, they necessarily discriminate against those who lack the 
'right' race or sex. There is no getting around this fact," says 
Eastland, noting that the white female plaintiff denied admission to 
the University of Texas law school "had academic credentials superior 
to most of the black and Mexican-American students admitted under an 
affirmative action plan."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While encouraging what is called "reverse discrimination," preferences 
rarely provide any substantial remedy for actual discrimination 
against minorities. "Because preferences are often a response to 
presumed discrimination on the part of a company, a government, or 
society generally, they move the focus away from the real instances of 
discrimination," says Eastland. Not only that, but they tend to 
benefit the most gifted minority members, leaving the truly 
disadvantaged in some ways worse off than before.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Affirmative action has halted, and in fact reversed, progress toward 
the color-blind society that civil rights activists once claimed as 
their goal. "Preferences have made it harder to overcome the tendency 
. . . of judging people in terms of their racial and ethnic groups," 
says Eastland. The irrationality and injustice of affirmative action 
is apparent to any thinking person, and that is why "substantial 
numbers (sometimes large majorities) of those typically eligible for 
preferential treatment -- African-Americans, Hispanics, and Asian 
Americans -- tell pollsters they are opposed to preferences." Eastland 
concludes that "only law that neither advantages nor disadvantages on 
account of race or ethnicity is law that can equally protect everyone 
in our increasingly diverse nation."

<h2>
Conservative Clinton
</h2>

<P>  
<blockquote><i>"The era of big government is over. We know big government does not have all the answers. There is not a program for every problem."</i></blockquote> 
<P>
  
Who was that man who gave the 1996 State of the Union address? He  
looked like Bill Clinton, but he sounded like Ronald Reagan -- until he got  
down to particulars. Then the New Democrat turned back into an Old  
Democrat, and we found out that the era of big government isn't over after  
all, but just playing possum. President Clinton thinks that big government  
still has all the answers, and a program for every problem. Unfortunately,  
the answers are wrong, and the programs just make the problems worse. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;President Clinton still wants to socialize the health care industry -- the  
biggest big-government power grab in decades! In a fit of false  
compassion, he would force actuaries to ignore the hard reality of risk and  
insure the uninsurable, thereby bankrupting yet another vital American  
industry. The President wants to expand federal authority by calling for  
"community partnerships with local police forces" and the investigation of  
local gangs by federal agencies. He declared that "we must end the deadly  
scourge of domestic violence." But whom did he mean by we? Big  
government, of course. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The President insisted that "every classroom in America must be connected  
to the information superhighway, with computers, good software, and well- 
trained teachers." But who's going to do the connecting? And who's going  
to pay for this "technology initiative"? Why, a "national partnership," of  
course. That's another pretext for federal intervention in areas reserved to  
the states by our U.S. Constitution! Clinton wants local schools to adopt  
"national standards," but the federal government has neither the authority  
to establish such standards, nor the integrity to resist politicizing them.  
Clinton called for more federal spending for his national service program,  
cash grants to top high school graduates, expansion of the student loan  
program, and a so-called "GI Bill for America's Workers." That doesn't  
sound like cutting back big government. 
 

 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;



President Clinton also called for more taxpayer spending for "drug  
education," even though the $2 billion of federal funds squandered so far  
have had no measurable impact on drug abuse. He asserted that all schools  
should teach "character education: good values and good citizenship." Will  
the federal government establish national character standards, too? Will  
these standards be as far removed from right reason and reality as were the  
outrageous U.S. History Standards? Doesn't Bill Clinton know that the best  
way to teach values is by example? The President even went so far as to  
recommend uniforms for schoolchildren. The era of big government is  
clearly not over when the nation's chief executive officer is preoccupied  
with such local concerns. 
 

 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;



No, the era of big government is not over yet, but the era of defending it  
certainly is. Bill Clinton's desperate bid to recast himself as a conservative  
is a tacit admission that liberalism is philosophically bankrupt.

<h2>Medical Savings Accounts</h2></center><P> 

[The most important section of the Republicans' Medicare reform bill is 
Medical Savings Accounts.]
<P>
It is the inclusion of Medical Savings Accounts (known as MSAs) that 
makes the Republican Medicare bill a genuine, free-market-oriented 
reform. Without them, according to Peter Ferrara of Americans for Tax 
Reform, the Medicare plan could not be supported "by anyone who 
opposed the Clinton health plan last year." Ferrara argues that MSAs 
will allow "market incentives and competition [to] control costs 
consistent with patient preferences." Without MSAs, "the Medicare 
reform would only meet the budget targets through the same heavy-
handed rationing mechanisms included in the Clinton plan last year."
<P>
All fall, there has been tremendous pressure from the media and the 
liberal establishment to drop MSAs from the Medicare package, but that 
would be a tremendous mistake and jeopardize the future of Americans 
in their golden years. According to policy analyst Peter Ferrara, 
"reimbursements to doctors and hospitals would be cut so much that 
many would refuse to treat Medicare patients. In particular, the elderly 
would no longer have access to the latest, most advanced, most 
sophisticated care. They would suffer with essentially the same low-
quality care as imposed on Medicaid patients today." Or they would be 
shunted off into health maintenance organizations, "where they would 
have to give up control over their health care to a third-party 
bureaucracy."
<P>
Who gets control -- "each individual patient, or the government and its 
designated rationing bodies" -- is the central issue in health care reform. 
"MSAs give power to the people. Without MSAs, the Medicare reform 
plan would only take control over their health care away from retirees."
<P>
According to Ferrara, Medical Savings Accounts "provide complete 
catastrophic coverage for all expenses over the deductible in the plan. 
Medicare does not provide such coverage." MSAs put a reasonable cap 
on "out-of-pocket expenses for the elderly." Medicare, by contrast, has 
no cap on out-of-pocket expenses. Retirees can be liable for tens of 
thousands in expenses each year under the program, says Ferrara. "That 
is why 70 percent of the elderly buy private supplemental insurance to 
cover those gaps." MSAs can be used to "pay for health expenses not 
covered by Medicare, such as prescription drugs." MSAs also "allow 
broader freedom of choice of doctors and services than Medicare." As it 
stands now, many doctors refuse to treat Medicare patients because 
Medicare "underpays health providers so substantially." Ferrara says 
"that problem will only get worse in the future."
<P>
Widespread use of Medical Savings Accounts would reduce health care 
spending dramatically. Health care costs would be reduced by as much as 
30 percent if all Americans switched from traditional third-party 
insurance to Medical Savings Accounts. Those opposed to MSAs use 
false budget estimates, claiming that MSAs would increase Medicare 
spending. But Peter Ferrara insists that "MSAs do not increase out-of-
pocket costs for the sick. They reduce them," and, in fact, are better than 
what Medicare gives seniors now.

<h2>Medical Savings Accounts</h2></center><P> 

[Medical Savings Accounts are an idea whose time has come. By 
returning control over medical choices to the individual, MSAs should 
rein in the spiraling costs of health care.]
<p>
Peter Ferrara of the National Center for Policy Analysis says that "health 
care costs are out of control" because the wrong people are paying the 
bills. The patients, the ones receiving medical care, do not generally pay 
their own bills. The bills are paid, for the most part, by third parties -- 
employers, insurance companies, or the government. The average 
American pays only one-fifth of his own health care costs. "Someone else 
pays the rest," says Ferrara, and that third-party payment system is what 
is driving up health care costs. Americans simply have no personal 
incentive for monitoring the costs of their health care and shopping 
around for less expensive alternatives.
<p>
The solution is simple: Take control over health care away from third 
parties and give it back to the people who are using it. Give them a 
personal, financial incentive for keeping costs down. Ferrara says it is 
only human nature for people to be careless, even extravagant shoppers 
"if we are spending someone else's money." And it's only natural for 
doctors and other health care providers to encourage us to take advantage 
of extra tests and procedures -- just to be on the safe side -- "if they know 
that we are not paying the bills." But Americans spend their own money 
in every other marketplace, and they make wiser decisions when they do 
so. Why, then, is the marketplace of medical care different from all the 
others?
<p>
1996 looks to be the year that Congress begins restoring economic sanity 
to our health care system. The Archer-Jacobs bill will encourage 
individuals and their employers to make tax-free deposits into Medical 
Savings Accounts (MSAs), which employees can draw on to cover 
ordinary health expenses. MSAs will let Americans choose the care they 
want and spend their health care dollars as they see fit, thereby providing 
a huge incentive to keep health costs down.
<p>
With Medical Savings Accounts, employees would be spending their own 
money for non-catastrophic health care. As a result, Peter Ferrara says, 
"they would have excellent financial incentives to control the cost of such 
care. They would seek to avoid unnecessary care, look for quality plus 
value in doctors and hospitals, and consider whether the services were 
worth the prices." Medical Savings Accounts would have other benefits 
too, such as reduced administrative costs.
<p>
If Americans switch to Medical Savings Accounts in large numbers, 
health care spending will decline dramatically. MSAs will give 
consumers more choices and more control in health care decisions. These 
accounts will be portable too, not linked to continued employment at a 
specific location. MSA funds can be applied to any type of health care, 
and are not subject to the approval of insurers or health maintenance 
organizations. Medical Savings Accounts will harness the power of our 
remarkable free-enterprise system to make American medical care 
affordable again.<p>

<h2> Reading Experts Speak Out 
</h2>


<P><blockquote><i> When the Massachusetts Commissioner of Education invited public  
comment on proposed curriculum reforms for state schools, he did not  
anticipate a critique from 40 of the nation's top linguistic experts. 
</i></blockquote><P> 

Last July, Massachusetts Commissioner of Education Dr. Robert Antonucci  
received a letter signed by 40 linguistic experts, expressing their dismay  
that the state's new standards for the teaching of reading in public schools  
give an uncritical endorsement to the Whole Language method. In a cover  
letter, linguistics professor David Pesetsky and neurologist Dr. Janis  
Melvold identified themselves and their 38 co-signers as "experts on  
language and reading" hailing from "seven Massachusetts institutions,"  
their ranks including "three members of the National Academy of  
Sciences, four presidents of the Linguistic Society of America, three  
directors of major research training programs, and the authors of two of the  
leading books on language for the general public." 
 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Pesetsky and Melvold pointed out that the Whole Language approach is  
"widely blamed for serious declines in reading achievement" in other  
states, and speculated that "the recent decline in Massachusetts could be  
connected to the increased use of Whole Language methodology." They  
warned that the proposed new standards "point in exactly the wrong  
direction -- away from a curriculum that takes linguistic realities into  
account, and towards methods that have failed elsewhere." 
 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Pesetsky and Melvold offered Dr. Antonucci a brief introduction to reading  
theory. "Written language is a way of notating speech," they explained in  
their letter to the education commissioner. "To become a skilled reader, a  
learner must master this notation system, learning how the sounds and oral  
gestures of language correspond to letters and letter groups." In other  
words, a mastery of phonics is "fundamental to reading." The state's  
proposed new standards, however, downplay the importance of phonics,  
encourage unproven "strategies" such as guessing, and reject systematic  
instruction. In this respect, they "closely mirror the popular but  
increasingly criticized approach known as 'Whole Language.'"

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The accompanying letter, signed by all 40 linguistic experts, challenged  
the "scientifically unfounded views of language" that characterize the new  
standards for reading instruction. These nationally recognized "experts on  
language and reading" charged that "the common-sense view of reading as  
the decoding of notated speech" was being rejected in favor of "a surprising  
view of reading as directly 'constructing meaning." "The importance of  
'decoding' was being played down in favor of strategies such as contextual  
guessing." Such an approach ignores "the most important property of  
written English," the alphabet! 
 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;



 
The experts insisted that "the view of language research" manifested in the  
proposed reforms "is inaccurate." They expressed their dismay that the  
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, in setting school standards, would  
"presume to legislate an erroneous view of how human language works, a  
view that runs counter to most of the major scientific results of more than  
100 years of linguistics and psycholinguistics. We are even more  
concerned," they added, "that uninformed thinking about language should  
lie at the heart of a 'standards' document for Massachusetts schools."

Duplantier</a> <br>November 28, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Public Schools are a Dismal Failure</h2></center><P>
[It's time to face up to the failure of our nation's educational system. A 
Nobel Prize-winning economist argues that the only way to save the 
public schools is to privatize them.]
<p>
"Our elementary and secondary educational system needs to be radically 
reconstructed," says Nobel economist Milton Friedman of the Hoover 
Institution. The system is hopelessly defective, and the "technological 
and political revolutions of the past few decades" are only going to make 
it worse. Friedman predicts that "a widening gap between the incomes of 
the highly skilled . . . and the unskilled" will lead to "serious social 
conflict. "
<p>
Friedman points out that dramatic technological advances have "made it 
possible for a company located anywhere in the world to use resources 
located anywhere in the world, to produce a product anywhere in the 
world, to be sold anywhere in the world." Equally dramatic political 
changes in Eastern Europe and Latin America have led to the widespread 
rejection of central planning in favor of free markets and "added greatly 
to the pool of low-wage, yet not necessarily unskilled labor" with which 
U.S. workers must compete. These developments have put "downward 
pressure on the wages of low-skilled labor," widening the income gap in 
America. If this gap continues to widen, "it threatens to create within our 
own country a social problem of major proportions," warns Friedman. 
<p>"Such stratification is a recipe for social disaster." Only a dramatically 
improved school system can brighten the prospects of Americans at the 
bottom of the economic ladder.
<p>
Friedman argues that "radical reconstruction can be achieved only by 
privatizing a major segment of the educational system." To encourage "a 
gradual yet substantial transfer from government to private enterprise." 
<p>Friedman recommends "a voucher system that enables parents to choose 
freely the schools their children attend." He concedes, however, that "the 
political power of the school establishment" has been, and will continue 
to be, a major obstacle to this effort.
<p>
Central city residents suffer most from the poor quality of public 
schooling. "The reason is partly the deterioration of our central cities, 
partly the increased centralization of public schools." says Friedman. 
<p>"Power has moved from the local community to the school district to the 
state, and to the federal government. About 90 percent of our kids now go 
to so-called public schools. which are really not public at all but simply 
private fiefs primarily of the administrators and the union officials."
<p>
Friedman insists that everyone will benefit from a voucher system, 
"except a small group of vested interests." The big winners will be "the 
residents of central cities, who will have a real alternative to the wretched 
schools so many of their children are now forced to attend." That "small 
group of vested interests" has tremendous clout, however. <p>"The teachers' 
unions are bitterly opposed to any reform that lessens their own power," 
says Friedman, "and they have acquired enormous political and financial 
strength." They won't hesitate to use that strength to defeat "any attempt 
to adopt a voucher system."

<h2>Welfare Reform/CA & IL</h2>
<i><blockquote>
<P>
With Congress talking about bloc-granting welfare money    
back to the states, some good ideas are starting to circulate.
</I></Blockquote><P>

There are nearly three million Californians receiving Aid to    
Families with Dependent Children (known as AFDC),    
roughly two million of whom have been on the dole for more    
than two years. "To a large extent, California's history of high    
AFDC benefits is responsible for the entrenched cycle of    
poverty that many now decry," say Sally Pipes and Katherine    
Post of the Pacific Research Institute in San Francisco. A    
new proposal by the California Department of Social    
Services is designed to break that "cycle of poverty" by    
substantially reducing benefits.   
   <p>
"Benefit levels would be lowered and one standard payment    
set," say Pipes and Post in the May issue of Alternatives in    
Philanthropy, published by the Capital Research Center.    
"Welfare would not pay more than work." This "flat grant"    
would not be affected by "any increase in the number of    
adults or children in the household." Benefits would be    
available for a limited time only. "The grant would eliminate    
eligibility requirements that make aid available only when    
one parent is deceased, disabled, missing, or unemployed,"    
say Pipes and Post. "Eligibility would instead be based on a    
simple income and asset test, as well as on the presence of a    
child under 18 years of age."   
   <p>
In spite of these promising proposals, California has been    
"fundamentally unable to respond to the particularities of    
individual cases. Herein lies an opportunity for philanthropic    
alternatives," say Pipes and Post, who like to stress "the    
importance of private efforts that are successfully addressing    
the critical and massive problem of repairing the damage    
done by the welfare state. Private programs offer powerful,    
individual-oriented approaches that no government initiative    
can match."   
   <p>
Joseph Bast of the Heartland Institute in Palatine, Illinois    
argues that welfare reforms in his state don't go far enough,    
and consist mainly of "throwing good money after bad and    
reshuffling bureaucracies." .In 1994, the state's Governor    
proposed "a $5 billion-a-year state-run health maintenance    
organization." In 1996, the Governor proposed "creating a    
welfare super-agency by merging seven cabinet-level    
agencies and many other boards, commissions, and    
programs."   
   <p>
Bast argues that different reforms "could generate much    
greater benefits more quickly." He calls for "health-care    
vouchers that would give the needy a wider choice of medical    
providers and insurers." He proposes that the care of abused    
and neglected children be turned over "to private agencies    
that have a better track record of placing children into safe    
and stable homes." And he suggests that AFDC payments be    
limited to two years and that the state "remove from the rolls    
all those who fail to report to state offices when told to do so"    
for job training and referrals.   
   <p>
The great thing about America is that our 50 states give us    
the chance to address problems in different ways. Welfare is    
a big problem, and we need all the good ideas we can get.

<h2>
GAMBLING
</h2>

<P><blockquote><i>  
Gaming fever has been sweeping the country for nearly 10 years now -- 
long enough for its true impact to be measured.
</blockquote></i>


<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It starts with a state lottery, the proceeds pledged to education or some 
such worthy cause. Then the gambling boats roll up the river, supposedly 
regulated to lessen their mischief. At last, the land-based casinos appear, 
promising an economic renaissance for distressed communities. But it 
soon becomes apparent that legalized gambling is not the golden-egg-
laying goose it was claimed to be. The proceeds from the lottery are 
never as high as hoped for, and the worthy cause that was supposed to 
benefit often finds its annual appropriation from the state legislature 
reduced by a like amount. The riverboats, discovering all kinds of 
unanticipated navigational hazards, ultimately drop their anchors 
permanently. The land-based casinos usurp the patronage of local 
retailers and burden city coffers with the cost of vices generated by 
gaming.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Casino gambling has been sold as the answer to economic problems 
everywhere it has been tried. But casinos serve as a gigantic sump, 
sucking sales from surrounding businesses," asserts Blake Hurst in the 
April issue of The American Enterprise magazine. "People who spend 
money at a casino can't spend it at [local restaurants], or the ballpark, or 
the amusement park. Gambling cannibalizes existing businesses, and the 
overall economic benefit to the economy is nil."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The economic impact is actually negative, when the cost of social vices 
encouraged by gambling is factored in. One expert cited by Hurst 
"estimates that the average gambler with a problem has from $53,000 to 
$92,000 in gambling-related debt." Another authority on the subject 
reports that "the societal costs imposed by each problem gambler are over 
$13,000, with some estimates running as high as $52,000 annually." A 
survey of wanton wagerers "found that 75 percent of pathological 
gamblers have committed a felony to support their habit." According to 
Gamblers Anonymous, there are as many as 10 million problem gamblers 
in America.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"The economic case against gambling is clear," says Hurst. "Gambling 
doesn't create economic wealth, but rather transfers wealth from existing 
businesses to those lucky or influential enough to receive gambling 
monopolies from the state. Gambling increases political corruption and 
crime, and is a strikingly regressive means of raising revenue." That, 
believe it or not, is just the beginning of what's wrong with legalized 
gambling.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Perhaps most damaging is the misleading message that legalized 
gambling sends to the citizenry, especially the young. "When the state 
removes the stigma from gambling by promoting it as a way to help 
education, people who have never gambled develop the habit. 
Governments may not be able to control vice, but surely they ought not to 
encourage it," says Blake Hurst. "When governments present riverboat 
casinos as economic development, they diminish those who build farms 
and factories. When states spend millions urging their citizens to play the 
lottery, they devalue the efforts of those who work hard and invest 
wisely."

<a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a><br>
<hr>
	While the recent U.S. automotive trade settlement with Japan is a failure for President Clinton, it is nevertheless a victory for America. A trade war has been averted. For more than a year, the Clinton Administration tried to force the Japanese government to agree to enforceable numerical targets for U.S. exports. Arguing that quotas would be inconsistent with free trade principles, Japan flatly refused Clinton's demand. In the end, President Clinton backed down. The automotive trade dispute was settled without mandatory targets.<p>

	However, the President's failure to force Japan to consent to managed automotive trade is a win for the American people. Managed trade harms consumers through less choice and higher prices. Moreover, managed trade hurts workers in companies or industries that government bureaucrats do not favor. <p>


<a name="agreement"><h3><center>THE AGREEMENT</h3></a></center><br>
	The main result of the recent U.S.-Japan trade settlement is to avert American imposition of 100 percent punitive tariffs on 13 models of Japanese luxury auto imports. Other key provisions of the agreement are: <p>

Auto Parts Purchases by Japanese Automakers. For months the Clinton Administration insisted that the Japanese government be involved in the enforcement of Japanese private sector plans to increase the purchase of American-made auto parts. At Geneva, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor was forced to drop this demand and accept voluntary, non-binding purchasing plans tabled by Japan's five largest automakers. To underscore the non-binding nature of the plans, the Japanese government made it clear in a joint U.S.-Japan statement that "Ambassador Kantor's estimates [of Japanese purchases of U.S. auto parts] are his own and neither shared by the minister [Ryutaro Hashimoto] himself nor the government of Japan."<p>

Access to Japanese Dealers. Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) will send a letter to Japanese dealers reaffirming their right to carry foreign cars. Despite a letter Kantor issued forecasting that American automakers would establish 1,000 new dealership franchises by the year 2000, nothing is binding on the part of the Japanese government.<p>

Deregulation of the Replacement Parts Market. The Ministry of Transport (MOT) will conduct a one-year review of a "critical auto parts" list that limits the use of some foreign parts for safety reasons. The purpose of this review is to remove parts that are not central to safety concerns. As a first step, MOT agreed to remove struts, shocks, power steering, and trailer hitches from the list. Finally, MOT will allow specialized repair garages to establish businesses in Japan.<p>

	These developments come on the heels of two years of negotiations. From the inception of "The United States-Japan Framework for a New Economic Partnership," signed on July 10, 1993, President Clinton has demanded that Japan agree to enforceable "quantitative targets" to increase a variety of American exports. The Framework Agreement established five major areas, or "baskets," in which the U.S. and Japanese negotiators would seek individual binding agreements. The areas covered were telecommunications, medical technology, flat glass, insurance, and automobiles and auto parts. The U.S. and Japan reached a settlement in the first four areas on October 1, 1994, and an automotive accord was reached on June 28, 1995. In all of these agreements, Japan rejected numerical targets. Thus, what Kantor finally agreed to is at odds with what he sought in 1993 when he said that "We will measure the success of these agreements in qualitative and quantitative terms."<p>


<a name="failure"><center><h3>THE LESSONS FROM CLINTON'S FAILURE</h3></a></center><br>

	There are three lessons that the United States should learn from Clinton's failure:<br><ul>

<li>Enforceable trade targets or quotas are inconsistent with free trade and should never be an  object of American policy. Demands for quotas undermine U.S. prestige in the world trading community, isolate the U.S. from its allies, and violate American commitments in international trade agreements.<p>

<li>Industry-by-industry trade liberalization negotiations with Japan have seriously disrupted America's economic, political, and security partnership. While these negotiations have yielded some progress in opening the Japanese market to American exports, the costs are high, and the potential for bumbling into a destructive all-out trade war is great.<p>

<li>The root causes of the U.S. trade deficit with Japan are not protectionism, but factors that are beyond the control of governments. Japan is a country of 125 million people. America is a country of 250 million people. The average Japanese buys about the same amount of goods and services from Americans as Americans buy from Japanese. One reason the deficit exists is that there are twice as many Americans as there are Japanese.<p></ul>



<h3><a name="track"><center>PUTTING TRADE RELATIONS BACK ON TRACK</a></h3></center><br>

	Rather than threaten to impose unilateral trade sanctions on such countries as Japan, the Clinton Administration should look for ways to protect the interests of all Americans, not just those U.S. industries which spend millions lobbying in Washington. The Administration should:<p><ul>

<li>Negotiate a comprehensive free trade and investment agreement with Japan by the year 2000. President Clinton and Prime Minister Murayama have agreed to the goal of "free and open trade and  investment in the Asia Pacific no later than the year 2020."  This pledge was made at the Leaders' Meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Bogor, Indonesia, on November 15, 1994. President Clinton should join Congress to offer the Japanese a comprehensive free trade and investment agreement with the United States.<p>

<li>End the practice of using taxpayer dollars and the U.S. government as public relations for selected U.S. businesses. American taxpayers deserve more from their government than to have their hard-earned money spent to win contracts for specific U.S. companies. While Ford Motor Company, General Motors Corporation, and Chrysler Corporation might have benefited from a 100 percent tariff on imported luxury automobiles, the American people would have been harmed. For example, American manufacturers who supplied Japanese automakers with parts for the targeted luxury imports found their orders canceled. Garden State Tanning in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, recently laid off 550 workers when Toyota was forced to suspend its purchase of leather upholstery for Lexus cars. Had the sanctions taken effect, thousands more Americans who sell, maintain, and service these autos would have lost their jobs.<p>

<li>Refrain from using bilateral trade retaliation that isolates America from the international economy. Clinton's threat to impose unilateral trade sanctions against Japan does little to improve American living standards and America's reputation as a free trade leader. In fact, it does the opposite. For example, Japanese Minister Hashimoto skillfully rallied world public opinion against the U.S. when the Clinton Administration did not take its case against Japan to the World Trade Organization before threatening sanctions, a clear violation of international trade agreements. Hashimoto isolated the United States from its trading partners in Europe and Asia and painted Japan, not America, as the defender of free trade.<p>
</ul>

<h3><a name="conclusion"><center>CONCLUSION</a></h3></center><br>

	The Framework Agreement is a failure for Clinton. But Clinton's failure is America's victory. Forcing  Japan to purchase more American autos and auto parts would have run counter to American interests -- for example, by forcing the Japanese government to become a bigger player in Japan's private sector. It would not have reduced the influence of Japan's bureaucrats in making private sector economic decisions. And it would not have resulted in increased American exports to Japan.<p>

	President Clinton took America down the dangerous path of a trade war with its second largest trading partner and largest overseas market. His purpose presumably was to force the Japanese to buy more American goods. In the end, he failed to get this commitment. Instead, America's image abroad as a dedicated free trade partner has been tarnished. Fortunately, this loss for the Clinton Administration is victory for American consumers.<p>

Duplantier</a> <br>December 8, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Communists Still A Threat</h2></center><P> 
[Dramatic reforms in the once-captive nations of Eastern Europe and the 
Soviet Union signaled the end of the Cold War and ushered in an era of 
peace, right?  Not necessarily.  One former KGB agent says the whole 
thing's a charade -- part of a long-range Soviet strategy to conquer the 
West without firing a shot!]
<p>
Anatoliy Golitsyn was a KGB agent for 16 years prior to his defection to  
the United States in 1961. In 1984 he published a book called New Lies  
for Old in which he predicted unprecedented economic and political  
reforms behind the Iron Curtain. the legalization of Solidarity in Poland.  
and the fall of the Berlin Wall. His predictions were ignored or dismissed  
at the time, but all soon came to pass. Westerners were astounded by the  
turn of events, and in the euphoria that followed the significance of  
Golitsyn's predictions was lost. 
 <p>
But Golitsyn is sounding the alarm again. He's just published a new book  
called The Perestroika Deception in which he repeats the warnings he  
issued more than 10 years ago. Golitsyn says the purpose of perestroika is  
twofold: to elicit Western financial support for the revitalization of the  
socialist economies, and to facilitate the convergence of East and West.  <p>
The ultimate aim is "peaceful conquest of the United States and Western  
Europe from within." 
 <p>
The Communists have gone to great lengths to recreate the trappings of  
Western democracy, with opposition parties and free elections. But they  
are just imitations of the real thing. "Even so-called 'free' elections do not  
pose a problem for the Communist parties. Because of their secret  
partnership with the 'opposition.' the Communist Parties are invariably in  
a winning position. It is their candidates -- whether Communist or 'non- 
Communist' -- who always win, since all the non-Communist candidates  
and 'parties' are controlled," says Golitsyn. "The Communists have  
succeeded in concealing from the West that the 'non-Communist' parties  
are secret partners of the Communists, not alternatives or rivals to them." 
 <p>
The same thing goes for the so-called independent Republics. "The  
present Communist strategists are concealing that it is they who are now  
creating 'independent' Republics." says Golitsyn. "The strategists are  
concealing the secret coordination that exists, and will continue to exist,  
between Moscow and the 'nationalist' leaders of these newly 'independent'  
Republics." He says the apparently fragmented Soviet Empire can be  
reassembled at any time. 
 
Perestroika represents "a broad strategic assault on the Western mindset,"  
an assault that gives every indication of achieving spectacular success.  <p>
"The meaning of developments in the (formerly) Communist world is  
misunderstood," says Golitsyn, "and the intentions behind Communist  
initiatives have been misinterpreted. Enemies are accepted and treated as  
though they have suddenly overnight. become allies of the West."  
Golitsyn confesses himself saddened by "the contemporary jubilation of  
American and West European conservatives who are cheering  
'perestroika' without realizing that it is intended to bring about their own  
political and even physical demise."

<title>Duplantier:  Education Reform  -- 5/10/96</title>

<h2>Education Reform</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
During the recent government shutdown, the Department of Education 
determined that 89 percent of its workforce was "nonessential. " Why, 
then, are 4500 extra bureaucrats receiving $240 million a year in 
salaries?
</i></blockquote>



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Principles of federalism embodied in the Constitution of the United 
States entrust authority over issues of educational policy to the 
States and the people, and a Federal Department of Education is 
inconsistent with such principles," claim the sponsors of the "Back to 
Basics Education Reform Act" now being considered by Congress. 
"Tradition and experience dictate that the governance and management 
of schools in the United States are best performed by parents, 
teachers, and communities. The intrusion by the Department of 
Education into education policy has not benefited the quality of 
education in this nation."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The reform bill's numerous sponsors claim that the Department of 
Education has "weakened the ability of parents to make essential 
decisions about their children's education and has undermined the 
capacity of communities to govern their schools. In the 15 years of 
its existence," they report, "the Department of Education has grown 
from 130 programs and a budget of $14 billion to over 240 separately 
authorized programs which cost almost $32 billion annually. Meanwhile, 
education performance has stagnated or deteriorated."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The reformers in Congress argue that the Department of Education has 
"fostered overregulation, standardization, bureaucratization, and 
litigation in United States education. The Department of Education 
spends large amounts of money on its own maintenance and overhead. As 
an organization, it is inefficient, ill-managed, and wasteful." What's 
the solution? "Only through initiatives led by parents and local 
communities with the power to act can the United States elevate 
educational performance toward an acceptable level. The Department of 
Education," the Congressmen observe, "has been hostile to many 
promising reform ideas."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The stated purpose of the Back to Basics Education Reform Act is four-
fold: "to improve the quality of elementary and secondary and higher 
education programs in the nation; to return the responsibility and 
authority for education to parents, teachers, communities, students, 
and States, and provide them greater control over education spending; 
to ensure that the Federal Government does not overregulate and 
interfere in the decision-making of parents, local communities, 
teachers, and students regarding education; and to ensure that 
Americans are able to compete in the global economy of the 21st 
century."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Back to Basics Education Reform Act would repeal Goals 2000, the 
School-to-Work Opportunities Act, and the National Education 
Statistics Act. It would also abolish the Department of Education. In 
addition, the bill recommends "a review and evaluation as to the 
feasibility of further enhancing the ability of States and local 
communities to fund education by reducing the Federal tax burden and 
commensurately eliminating Federal Government involvement in providing 
grants for education programs." Isn't it time we put an end to Uncle 
Sam's unconstitutional meddling in education -- and give those 4500 
nonessential education bureaucrats a chance to do something productive 
with their lives?

<h2>Vincent Foster</h2></center><P> 

[More than two years after it occurred, the death of White House Counsel 
Vincent Foster continues to raise troubling questions.]
<p>
The body of White House Counsel Vincent Foster was discovered in Fort 
Marcy Park across the Potomac River from Washington DC, at 6 p.m. on 
July 20, 1993. The U.S. Park Police found a pistol in Foster's hand and 
quickly ruled the death a suicide. Nevertheless, a poll conducted by Time 
magazine and CNN two years later revealed that 65 percent of Americans 
do not accept the official verdict in the case.
<p>
Government investigators have ignored evidence suggesting that Foster's 
body was dumped in Fort Marcy Park, and that he may not have taken his 
own life. The suspicious nature of Foster's death, and his connection to 
the Whitewater and Travelgate scandals, make this one of the biggest 
news stories of the 1990s. Yet, only one reporter in America is 
investigating the Foster death on a full time basis. Christopher Ruddy 
began his probe as an investigative reporter for the New York Post in 
1993 . Now associated with the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, Ruddy 
continues his one-man crusade to find out what really happened to "the 
highest ranking federal official in more than 30 years [to die] under very 
suspicious circumstances."
<p>
Ruddy summarizes the many inconsistencies in the case in a new report 
available from the nonprofit Western Journalism Center entitled Vincent 
Foster: The Ruddy Investigation. Ruddy points out that a confidential 
Secret Service memo written on the night of Foster's death stated that 
"U.S. Park Police discovered the body of Vincent Foster in his car." He 
says a senior Park Police investigator admitted that she and her 
colleagues reached a verdict of suicide "prior to going up and looking at 
the body."
<p>
Three handwriting experts have declared Foster's so called suicide note a 
forgery. "A note torn into 28 pieces, leaving no fingerprints and said to 
have been written by Foster, was found almost a week after his death," 
says Ruddy, but it lacks the contents typical of a suicide note -- no 
mention of death, no farewell to loved ones, and so on. The lack of an 
accounting for Foster's whereabouts during the last five hours of his life 
is also problematic, says Ruddy, noting that "no one came forward to 
claim they had seen him alive at the park or even around Washington, 
that fateful afternoon."<p>

The suicide scene itself was atypical. Foster's body was neatly arranged. 
"The fired bullet was never found. No one heard the fatal shot," says 
Ruddy. "Trace analysis of Foster's shoes at the FBI lab found not a speck 
of soil on his shoes or clothing despite a 700-foot-plus trek through the 
heavily wooded park."
<p>
All Ruddy wants is straight answers to some simple questions. "If Foster 
didn't shoot himself . . . who did? Where? How did he really die? These 
are the questions investigators should have asked," says Ruddy. "Their 
answers lead to other, logical questions about the strong evidence that the 
body was moved to the park."

Duplantier</a> <br>November 29, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Legalized Gambling Destroying Communities</h2></center><P> 
 
[The social and economic havoc that legalized gambling is wreaking on  
communities throughout our country could have been avoided, if only  
Americans had learned the lessons of history.]  
  <p>
"On the whole, legalization of gambling in the United States has failed  
completely. Instead of eliminating abuses, it increased them . . .  
legalization attracted criminals." That's the conclusion of Virgil Peterson,  
onetime director of the Chicago Crime Commission. Mr. Peterson made  
those remarks in the 1950s, but they're even more appropriate today, now  
that state lotteries and gambling casinos have sprouted up all over the  
country.  
  <p>
"Commercialized vice and gambling have always been the principal  
props of the underworld," said Peterson, more than 40 years ago. "The  
intrinsic character of gambling naturally attracts the criminal element.  <p>
The kidnapper, the armed robber, the burglar, and the thief engage in  
their criminal enterprises for the purpose of obtaining money without  
working. Gambling establishments appeal to this type of individual."  
  <p>
In 1956 a New Orleans newspaper published a series of editorials  
reminding its readers of the many social ills that inevitably result when  
commercial gamblers are allowed to gain a foothold in a community.  
New Orleanians should have known better. After all, the city had had a  
long history of legal and illegal gambling and the dire consequences were  
a matter of public record. "Those who cannot remember the past are  
condemned to repeat it," said the philosopher George Santayana, and he  
might have added that there are always sharpies in the shadows waiting to  
cash in on our short memories.  
  <p>
The editorial writer for the New Orleans paper argued that "commercial  
gambling breeds official and political corruption. It is the incubator of the  
racketeer and the gangster." How do gambling interests gain a foothold?   <p>
What happened more than 40 years ago in Phenix City, Alabama typifies  
their methods: "The gamblers moved in, with the sanction of some  
officials. The bribe money looked good to them. They let more gamblers  
in. But the gambling profits looked even better. They moved in with the  
gamblers." Greed knows no limits, however. "Big, easy profits make big  
spenders. Big spenders seek bigger profits, and, eventually, some  
insurance that their profits will continue." Wherever the professional  
gambler operates, "he amasses a huge fortune which he eventually uses to  
influence government so as to insure not only his continued prosperity  
but an even greater one."  
  <p>
The newspaper warned that "the crime that gambling breeds is not  
confined to the professional gamblers. Infected also are hopeless  
gamblers. Like the dope addict, the gambling addict finds his fleeting  
thrills expensive. Money earned through lawful means rarely can support  
his pleasures. He turns to crime, to stickups, to burglary, to  
embezzlement, to white slavery, even to murder, for the fast buck that he  
needs to indulge himself."  
  <p>
Today's racketeers may have MBAs and designer suits, but they're still  
racketeers, and their activities are sucking the lifeblood out of our local  
economies and breeding vice. How much damage will they have to do  
before we send them packing?

<h2> Environmental Facts </h2><p>                           


<i>When it comes to environmentalism, the popular wisdom, more often than not, is wrong</i><p>



Pollution is a growing problem, right? Wrong! "The environment is cleaner than at any time in the past halfcentury," observes Joseph Bast of the Heartland Institute, co-author of a new book called Eco-Sanity, A CommonSense Guide to Environmentalism. "The average American [today] is exposed to fewer potentially harmful pollutants than at any time since the 1930s. Air and water pollution, which had risen during the 1940s and 1950s, have fallen consistently and considerably since that time. Today, pollution of all kinds is responsible for less than 1 percent of cancer deaths."<p>

Speaking of cancer, aren't cancer rates going up and up? Actually, they're not. "Cancer rates are falling, not rising," says Bast. "We've lived with pesticides, automobiles, and electromagnetic fields for nearly a century. During this period, overall cancer rates among the non-elderly population went down, not up. Cancer rates among the elderly appear to have increased, but this is due partly to better diagnosis and partly to the rapid decline of other causes of death."<p>

So, maybe we're healthier and we're living longer, but an environmental cataclysm is bound to occur eventually, right? Wrong again. "Predictions of impending global ecological disasters are untrue. There is no scientific validity to claims that acid rain, global warming, deforestation, or ozone depletion will cause global environmental disasters at any time in the future," says Bast. "Most environmental problems have been or are being solved. Automobile emissions, for example, have been reduced by 90 to 97 percent during the past twenty years. The threats of deforestation and resource depletion have been eliminated from the developed countries of the world, and remain problems only in Third World countries torn by civil war and acute poverty. Oil spills are less common and cause less ecological harm than in the past. Landfill technology has advanced 'dramatically' in the past decade."<p>

But aren't our resources running out? Won't we have to learn to live with less? No to both questions. "Innovation and the use of reason to solve problems, not any change in human nature or in the amount of natural resources, make us wealthier than our grandparents," says Bast. "The 'gloom and doom' school of thought within the environmental movement systematically overlooks the role of ideas in finding new resources, managing waste, and protecting human health and the environment. Their zero-sum solutions are unnecessary and often don't work."<p>

Prosperity is a mixed blessing, though, isn't it? Not at a 1. "Prosperity is good for the environment," says Joseph Bast. "The fear that prosperity leads to environmentat destruction saturates the literature of the environmental movement. But prosperity has made it possible for us to invest in parks and wildlife preserves, clean our air and water, and treat or store our wastes," says Bast. "Prosperity is not only compatible with a clean environment; it is environmental protection's necessary precondition."<p>

Nuclear Deal With Pyongyang: Roadmap to Progress or Dead End Street?"

May 4, 1995

<P>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>


       The Agreed Framework signed by the United States and communist 
North Korea last October aims to freeze and ultimately dismantle the 
Pyongyang regime's menacing nuclear weapons development program.  The 
Clinton Administration concedes that North Korea already may have 
constructed one or two nuclear weapons. A North Korean nuclear weapons 
program violates two major international agreements: the Nuclear Non-
Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which Pyongyang signed in 1985, and the 
Non-Nuclear Declaration inked with Seoul in 1992.  America's ally, 
South Korea, has complied faithfully with both agreements.
<P>
       Over the six months since the Framework was signed in Geneva in 
late October, the North on several occasions has acted in ways that 
call into question its commitment to the agreement and to easing 
tensions both with the U.S. and with South Korea. On December 17, 
1994, the North downed a U.S. helicopter that strayed into its 
territory, killing one U.S. serviceman and detaining another on false 
charges of espionage.  Fuel oil given to the North by the U.S. in 
February was diverted for military purposes in violation of the Geneva 
agreement.  On April 20, U.S.-North Korean talks broke down after 
Pyongyang refused to accept commitments it had made earlier to allow 
South Korean participation in implementing the Agreed Framework.
<P>
       Still, the North has lived up to its promise to "freeze" its 
nuclear program.  Thus, for now, the Administration's efforts deserve 
support and encouragement.  Further negotiations will confirm whether 
Pyongyang is willing to abide by the full scope of its obligations 
under the Geneva accord.  
<P>
A Generous Package for the North
<P>
       The U.S.-North Korea deal created the Korean Peninsula Economic 
Development Organization (KEDO), a consortium of nations led primarily 
by the U.S., South Korea, and Japan.  KEDO is responsible for 
constructing two light water reactors for the North that would be less 
capable of producing weapons-grade fuel than Pyongyang's existing 
technology.  The construction project's price tag is estimated 
conservatively at about $4.5 billion, with South Korea playing the 
"central" role in financing the project and Japan promising to make a 
"significant" contribution.  It generally is expected that Seoul will 
pay about half of this bill.
<P>
       The same consortium will assist North Korea's faltering economy 
by providing very large quantities of fuel oil. Moreover, Washington 
is easing its long-standing trade embargo on North Korea and will 
advance toward diplomatic relations with the North. The first step 
would be the exchange of "liaison offices." Japan also has resumed 
normalization talks with Pyongyang.
<P>
       In return, the North has agreed to "freeze" its nuclear program 
and to allow limited scrutiny by the United Nations' International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This prevents the North from taking 
additional steps to reprocess spent reactor fuel for bomb-making 
purposes. The North also has pledged to move its large cache of spent 
fuel rods out of the country and to permit the IAEA finally to perform 
"special inspections." These inspections would give the U.N. body a 
reliable estimate of the North's bomb-making capabilities. However, 
these pledges would not be fulfilled until delivery of key nuclear 
components to North Korea for completion of its first reactor. This 
could take five years.
<P>
        In the final stage of the deal, once both reactors have been 
completed, the North promises to dismantle all of its nuclear 
facilities that exist today. According to Clinton Administration 
estimates, this dismantling will not begin for at least ten years.
<P>
Pyongyang's Drive to Isolate Seoul
<P>
       Under the Geneva agreement, the U.S. and North Korea pledged to 
"make best efforts" to conclude negotiations on a reactor supply 
contract within six months. The contract was to outline the details of 
the massive construction project.  When Washington and Pyongyang 
signed the deal on October 21, 1994, the North's negotiators made a 
verbal commitment to accept South Korean-manufactured reactors. Since 
Seoul will be paying the lion's share of the project's bill, it 
understandably has been tapped by KEDO as the central player in the 
project.  Seoul expects to act as the prime contractor in the reactor 
construction.
<P>
       However, talks between the U.S. and the North in Berlin broke 
down on April 20, one day before the contract target date. Pyongyang 
reneged on its earlier commitment to accept South Korean reactors.  It 
also opposed Seoul's central role in KEDO.  Senior Republic of Korea 
government officials have made it clear that, if the North refuses 
Seoul's active involvement in the project, the South will not provide 
financial backing.  Since no other nation will come up woth several 
billion dollars in Seoul's stead, the project cannot proceed without 
South Korean participation.
<P>
       In response, the Clinton Administration has proposed that the 
U.S. and North Korea resume high-level political talks in Geneva in 
hopes of reaching an agreement on the important reactor project supply 
contract. This is a prudent signal to the North and the international 
community that Washington remains open to dialogue.  Still, the 
Administration should draw the line at offering any compromise on the 
key issue of South Korean participation. Clearly, Pyongyang seeks to 
isolate Seoul and strengthen its bilateral relations with the U.S.  
South Koreans have expressed their concern that the North has gained 
politically in its dealings with Washington while Seoul appears at 
times to be marginalized.  Seoul has no official place at the Agreed 
Framework bargaining table.
<P>
Policy Options for the Future
<P>
       Recent talks over the reactor supply contract represent an 
important milestone in the implementation of the Agreed Framework.  
The North's willingness to fulfill all of its commitments under the 
deal should be tested early on.  Pyongyang should be pressed to accept 
the requirements regarding South Korea's reactors and Seoul's central 
role in KEDO.  The U.S. must be prepared to stand firm and avoid 
further concessions to the North.  To its credit, the Clinton 
Administration did this in a united front with Seoul during the April 
Berlin talks when it resisted the North's demands.  This was a wise 
and prudent use of the leverage the U.S. now has with Pyongyang, for 
the North stands to reap generous political and economic benefits from 
the agreement. Looking to the future, a consistently strong show of 
American determination is in order.  Past experience indicates that 
the North will behave responsibly only to the extent that Washington 
follows a firm, steady course.
<P>
       If implementation of the framework is hampered by stalemated 
talks with Pyongyang, the U.S. should maintain a strong and principled 
posture until the North drops its unreasonable positions.  Progress 
toward the exchange of liaison offices should be slowed, as should the 
movement toward North Korea-Japan normalization that began in March.  
Similarly, trade benefits under the agreements should be curtailed.  
These actions will be painful for Pyongyang in view of its 
deteriorating economy and diplomatic isolation.  
<P>
       It is also important that the U.S. press the North to resume 
talks with Seoul. The nuclear program is but one threat to peace on 
the Korean Peninsula.  A high state of tension exists between the 
North and South.  Pyongyang maintains a massive military force, which 
includes chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles. The 
hostile North Korean regime threatens stability in Northeast Asia, and 
the 37,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea are in harm's way.  
American vital interests would be served by reducing inter-Korean 
tension. The Agreed Framework includes a commitment by Pyongyang to 
resume productive dialogue with Seoul, but it has refused to do so.  
The U.S., in close consultation with Seoul, must press Pyongyang to 
restart long-stalled North-South talks.  Ultimately, the path to 
Korean peace and reunification runs not between the U.S. and North 
Korea, but between Seoul and Pyongyang. 
<P>
U.S. Policy for the "Worst Case"
<P>
       The "worst case" scenario is one in which the North breaches 
the agreement by restarting its reactor or resuming fuel reprocessing.  
In this event, the Clinton Administration has made it clear that the 
Framework would be pronounced null and void by Washington. Steps then 
should be taken by the U.S., but not steps that would fuel a crisis 
atmosphere.  The North often has operated skillfully in the midst of  
crises, issuing war threats and pressing Washington to make 
concessions in order to break an impasse.  One mistake American policy 
makers have made in the past has been to stress that the choice is 
between an agreement or war.  Unless unnecessarily provoked, it is 
improbable that Pyongyang would embark on a war that eventually would 
end in its defeat and demise.  The combined U.S.-ROK military 
partnership has deterred the North since the end of the Korean War.  
This deterrence will continue to function whether or not the North has 
an active nuclear weapons program.
<P>
       Additional steps that should be taken in the event of a breach 
of the nuclear freeze include:
<P>
*  A U.N. vote of condemnation.  The international community can 
pressure the North through a strong show of displeasure and concern 
over the North's actions.
<P>
*  Economic pressure on the North though a U.S.-led multilateral 
coalition.  Pressing for U.N. sanctions against North Korea would not 
be productive. A sanctions bid would be a slow, tedious process that 
may be blocked in the Security Council by the North's ally, China. 
Beijing may be more cooperative if the U.S. and its allies avoid high-
profile U.N. action. Only a small number of nations trade with the 
North. Thus, Washington and Seoul should quietly seek the cooperation 
of China, Japan, and Russia in curtailing or ceasing trade and aid to 
the North.
<P>
*  Clear U.S. reaffirmation of its defense commitments to South Korea 
and Japan.  Significant upgrading of the U.S. military presence in the 
ROK in the foreseeable future is not necessary.  The current combined 
readiness is adequate.  Any provocative movements by the North should 
be answered, however, by appropriate U.S. counteractions.
<P>
       A breach of the North's freeze would be a setback, but one that 
would show that Pyongyang never intended to fulfill its obligations 
under the agreement in the first place.  Tension on the peninsula will 
continue, but war is not the inevitable outcome.  Instead, together 
with Seoul, the U.S. should make it clear that it will deter, contain, 
and isolate the North -- as it has for more than four decades. Only an 
end to its extreme international isolation, combined with the 
institution of domestic reforms, can protect the Pyongyang regime from 
eventual collapse.  Time is on the side of Seoul and Washington, and 
Washington must not lose sight of this fact.

<title>Duplantier: Implications Of The VMI Court Case -- 2/15/96</title>

<h2>Implications Of The VMI Court Case </h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>A Supreme Court decision favoring Attorney General Janet Reno's Justice 
Department in the VMI sex-discrimination case could open up a can of worms. </i></blockquote>
<P> 
For the past 20 years, the Supreme Court has treated sex-discrimination 
cases differently from race-discrimination cases. In race cases, the Court 
applies "strict scrutiny," under the assumption that racial classifications 
are inherently "suspect" and unconstitutional (except, of course, when 
affirmative action is involved). Up till now, the Court has not considered 
gender discrimination to be inherently suspect and has applied what it 
calls "intermediate scrutiny" to cases of this nature. This standard seems 
to have worked well, and there is no evidence that this approach is either 
unworkable or unjust. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As part of its effort to force the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) to 
open its doors to women, the Justice Department under Attorney General 
Janet Reno has asked the Supreme Court to add sex to its list of "suspect 
classes," thereby requiring the Court to apply "strict scrutiny" when 
considering cases involving charges of sex discrimination. Applying strict 
scrutiny to the VMI case would lead not only to the sexual integration of 
VMI, but to the sexual integration of all single-sex colleges. The fact 
that most single-sex colleges are women's colleges poses a dilemma for 
feminists and other politically-correct types. Many have no problem 
advocating the forced integration of men's colleges, but recognize that 
applying such a policy even-handedly would mean the elimination of 
women-only colleges as well. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
A Court ruling that strict scrutiny must be applied in gender cases would 
invite lawsuits against every public and private institution in America 
that makes distinctions between men and women. The effect on U.S. Armed 
Forces would be revolutionary. Our military services now provide separate 
facilities for men and women. This would be a no-no under strict scrutiny. 
The strength and endurance standards for men and women in the military are 
now substantially different. How could this be justified under strict 
scrutiny? Leave and discharge policies are different for men and women, 
recognizing pregnancy as a circumstance to be given special consideration. 
Military regulations regarding clothing and personal appearance are 
different for the two sexes. Such distinctions would not be tolerated in an 
irrational world of coercive uniformity. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
What about women's athletic programs at co-ed schools and colleges? Would 
they have to be merged with the men's programs? Would an equal number of 
boys and girls be required for every team? Would they have to share locker 
rooms and showers? Every such consideration raises the specter of a 
thousand lawsuits. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
If the Supreme Court decides to apply strict scrutiny in sex-discrimination 
cases, what will the impact be on homosexual issues such as military 
service, same-sex marriage, and adoption? Will prohibitions against 
government funding of abortion be considered sexist? We would not have to 
ask such questions if the Supreme Court could be trusted to resist the 
temptation of judicial activism.

INTRODUCTION
<P>
     With the end of the Cold War and collapse of the Soviet Union,
there has been a growing chorus of cries for the United States to lift the
economic embargo on Cuba. This chorus has included even such responsible
anti-communist voices as those of former President Richard Nixon and the
editorial page of The Wall Street Journal. Such calls are curious, coming as
they are just when it appears that the 32-year-old embargo may be bearing
fruit. Five years after losing the financial patronage of the former Soviet
Union, Fidel Castro's communist regime is facing severe shortages and
growing popular discontent. Cuba's economy has shrunk by more than half
since 1989, the black market is more dynamic than the formal command
economy controlled by the state, and Fidel Castro's efforts to build a huge
tourism industry and attract billions of dollars in new foreign investments
have proved dismal failures.
<P>
     This economic collapse has imperiled the stability of the Castro
regime. The Soviet Union's demise robbed Castro of his ideological base
and about $4.5 billion a year in direct subsidies, exposing the complete
failure of the communist revolution to improve the lives of the Cuban
people. Moreover, as the economy's collapse has accelerated, popular
discontent has increased to levels that threaten the survival of the regime.
That was made clear in August, when thousands of Cubans rioted in
Havana's Old Waterfront district, and by the subsequent flight to sea of
more than 30,000 Cubans of all ages. Another indication that Castro's grip
on power is slipping is the increased repression of organized dissident
groups by Cuban security forces.
<P>
     While the embargo may finally be working, Castro remains defiant.
He refuses to allow true free-market reforms and rejects democratic political
reforms. Instead, he is conducting an aggressive international campaign to
get the embargo lifted without making any economic or political concessions
in return. Castro is trying to force the United States to lift the embargo in
order to resuscitate his dying communist regime with billions of dollars in
trade, investment, and international aid.
<P>
     Although the United States today stands virtually alone in its
insistence on maintaining the embargo, it must stand firm. Thus far, the
Clinton Administration has resisted pressure to lift the embargo. To hasten
the transition to a post-Castro Cuba, the Administration should:
Maintain the embargo until irreversible economic and political reforms
leading to democratic capitalism take place.
<P>
Admit no more Cuban refugees into the U.S. beyond the 20,000 per year
agreed to during negotiations in September. The 32,000 Cuban refugees now
at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo and in Panama should gradually be
processed for admission to the United States.
<P>
Demand that U.S. allies in the Western Hemisphere, including Mexico and
Canada, stop coddling Castro and start calling for real change.
Link future free trade agreements between the United States and Latin
American/Caribbean nations to redoubled efforts by these countries to
persuade Castro to liberalize Cuba's economy and political system.
Prepare for the possibility that Castro's collapse could unleash a lengthy
period of social and political unrest, and perhaps even civil war, in Cuba.
Reinforce the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo in anticipation of attack by
pro-Castro forces.
<P>
Provide financial and other support to more than 150 dissident groups within
Cuba that are struggling to bring down Castro.
Increase the broadcasting activities of Radio Mart.
<P>

THE CUBAN CRISIS
<P>
     Cuba today is suffering its worst economic crisis since Fidel Castro
seized power in 1959. The island's gross social product (equivalent to gross
domestic product) has plunged nearly 60 percent, including this year's
projected contraction of 5 percent. Power blackouts occur daily in Havana
and other major cities. Over two-thirds of the island's industrial facilities are
shut down almost permanently due to a lack of raw materials. Gasoline is
very scarce, and automotive transportation is at a virtual standstill. Animal
power is used for heavy agricultural activities, and most Cubans get about
on bicycles or on foot. Over half of Cuba's work force is now unemployed,
although unemployment officially remains a crime punishable by
imprisonment.
<P>
     Since July 1993, when the Castro regime authorized the use of U.S.
dollars, Cuba's own currency has become worthless. Although the official
exchange rate between the peso and the U.S. dollar is one-to-one, the black
market rate in August was 130 pesos to the dollar. No one will work for
pesos, since the minimum wage is now equivalent to about three dollars a
month. Productivity has dropped 45 percent since 1990, according to Cuban
economists, and many state employees no longer bother to go to work.
Instead, they have joined the fast-swelling ranks of self-employed or black
market workers whose economic activities are marked by the struggle to
survive from one day to the next without earning too much income lest they
be charged with illegal enrichment and jailed.
<P>
     Many Cuban women have turned to prostitution in a desperate effort
to feed their children and families, since government rationing provides only
half of the average family's monthly nutrition needs. In May, Cuba's
minimum wage would buy "only a two-pound chicken, or a pound of pork,
or four liters of milk in unofficial markets." Many Cuban families now
survive on one daily meal consisting of rice, beans, soy, and water. For
months, Cubans have been deprived even of bath soap. Infectious diseases
once thought to be eradicated, such as tuberculosis and malaria, are
returning as Cuba's free health care system collapses. Hospitals lack even
the most basic supplies such as bandages and surgical thread for sutures.
There are not enough pencils and ruled paper to supply the country's school
system.
<P>
     Although some Cuban economists said the economy would "hit
bottom" in 1994, the poor performance of the critical sugar industry
indicates that the crisis actually will grow substantially worse during 1995.
Sugar production has dropped from an estimated 8.1 million metric tons in
1989 to barely 4.2 million metric tons last year. This year's crop will be
even lower; one reliable estimate forecasts 4 million metric tons for 1994
and 3.5 million metric tons for 1995.
<P>
     Before Castro took power in 1959, Cuba ranked third in per capita
income in Latin America, behind only Argentina and Venezuela. Today,
after 35 years of socialism and more than $75 billion in Soviet economic
and military aid, Cuba's per capita income is one of the lowest in the
Western Hemisphere, possibly even approaching the levels of such countries
as Haiti.[It is difficult to measure GSP per capita with any accuracy for
several reasons, including the broad differential between the official and
black market exchange rates (the official rate is one peso to one U.S. 
dollar, while the black market rate was 130 pesos to the dollar in August
1994); the fact that the black market or informal economy now accounts for
over half of Cuba's GSP, but its real dimensions are difficult to quantify;
and because none of the Cuban government's economic statistics are
considered reliable.  However, studies by independent economists such as
Dr.  Manuel Lasaga, director of the research and consulting firm Strategic
Information Analysis, Inc.  (StratInfo), confirm that the Cuban economy and
GSP per capita have plunged precipitously.  For example, in a May 1994
study on the Cuban economy, Dr.  Lasaga projected that GSP, measured in
1981 pesos, will contract 5.8 percent in 1994 to 13.77 billion pesos, which,
at the official exchange rate works out to a GSP per capita of US$ 1,252,
assuming a population of 11 million Cubans.  But measured at the August
1994 black market rate, GSP per capita would be an impossibly low US$
9.60.  The Heritage Foundation's forthcoming Index of Economic Freedom
uses an estimated GSP per capita of USD 750.]
<P>

The Embargo Didn't Cause Cuba's Misery 
<P>
     Fidel Castro blames the U.S. trade embargo for the collapse of the
Cuban economy. The truth, however, is that Cuba's economic destruction
was caused by the regime's ruinous economic policies. Specifically, Castro's
command economy, based on a 1976 constitution and laws which prohibit
private enterprise and ownership of property, completely destroyed the free
market in Cuba, hindering economic growth and prosperity.
<P>
     The United States first imposed a trade embargo on Cuba on
February 3, 1962, in response to Castro's confiscation of privately owned
properties and other productive assets, as well as his aggressive support for
violent communist revolution throughout the Western Hemisphere. The
original goals of the embargo were to compel Castro to open Cuba's
economy and establish democracy, to weaken Cuba's communist regime,
and to force Castro to relinquish power. From the beginning, however, many
industrialized countries have refused to cooperate with U.S. policy towards
communist Cuba and have continued to maintain diplomatic and trade
relations with the dictatorship. This includes such important U.S. partners
as Canada and Mexico.
<P>
     Soviet patronage and subsidies in excess of $4.5 billion a year
enabled Castro to resist the U.S. trade embargo until 1989, all the while
claiming a fictitious "success" for his Marxist revolution and building one
of the most repressive and murderous regimes in the annals of communist
totalitarianism. At least 13,000 Cuban citizens have been executed since
1959, and over 100,000 have been jailed for opposing the Castro regime,
including at least 28,000 still in prison today.
<P>
     The collapse of the Soviet Union deprived Castro not only of billions
of dollars in yearly subsidies, but also of the ideological bases which had
sustained his totalitarian regime ever since he came to power in 1959. Even
before the Soviet Union fell apart, however, Cuba's lengthy economic
decline already was accelerating. In 1989, Cuba reported a trade deficit of
$2.73 billion on exports of $5.39 billion and imports of $8.12 billion. By
1993, the trade deficit had dropped to an estimated $310 million, but exports
had fallen by over 70 percent to $1.53 billion while imports had contracted
nearly 80 percent to $1.84 billion. Moscow's refusal in 1990 to sign a new
five-year trade agreement with Cuba marked the end of the special
relationship between the two nations which had sustained Castro's tyranny
for thirty years.
<P>
     When Castro lost his Soviet support, many analysts forecast the swift
collapse of his dictatorship. In November of 1991, for example, Cuba
specialists at the Soviet Academy of Sciences predicted that the cutoff in
Soviet economic assistance would "fully paralyze" the Cuban economy
within a year. Yet Castro has survived. His endurance in the face of
economic devastation and resulting political instability has been aided by the
fact that Cuba's population totals about 11 million. This relatively small
population -- roughly similar to Ecuador's and about half the size of
Venezuela's -- has made it easier for the regime to use repressive measures
to contain the spread of dissident groups. At the same time, it has made it
easier for Castro to absorb the impact of the loss of Cuba's Soviet
patronage. Three years after the Soviet Union's collapse, however, Castro
is running out of time.
<P>
     Castro's Determination to Retain Power. Nevertheless, Castro
flatly rules out any possibility of compromise and reconciliation. In a
lengthy interview published September 25, 1994, by the Venezuelan daily
El Nacional, Castro repeated his oft-expressed demand that the U.S. lift the
embargo unilaterally without demanding any concessions in return.
Alternating between defiance and self-pity, Castro said:

    <UL> The U.S. plan is to starve Cuba into submission, but even if
     [the U.S.] were to hurl an atomic bomb at Cuba, nothing
     would change. There is no solution but to end the embargo....
     If [Cuba] had Venezuela's oil and other economic resources,
     we wouldn't even have developed tourism.... Lifting the
     embargo is fundamental.... The embargo is causing us terrible
     damage today when the socialist bloc no longer exists and we
     have lost 70 percent of our trade and imports.... What country
     in the world would have resisted the five years that Cuba has
     resisted?...  The suffering hurts all of us, but we won't
     exchange the independence of this nation for a plate of
     beans.... [U]nder no concept can lifting the embargo be
     conditioned to issues that affect our independence. The
     Cuban position is a worthy one: Lift the embargo without
     any conditions. It's the only honorable course.</UL>
     
     <P>
     

Growing Signs of Trouble 
<P>
     Cuba's economic collapse has accelerated in 1994, and social unrest
has increased dramatically. On July 13, at least 30 Cubans trying to flee the
island on a hijacked tugboat drowned at sea when four Cuban government
ships swept the decks of the fleeing tugboat with high-pressure water hoses
and rammed the aged wooden vessel until it broke up and sank. Of the 72
people believed to be aboard, only half survived. Over a ten-day period
between the last week of July and the first week of August, three passenger
ferries were hijacked in Havana harbor by Cubans desperate to flee their
country. On August 5, thousands of Cubans rioted in the Old Waterfront
district of Havana, throwing rocks at police and trashing dollar-only stores
after the police dispersed a crowd drawn to the harbor by rumors that boats
were waiting to carry them to freedom in the United States. At one point,
hundreds of Cubans tried to board Chinese and Canadian freighters in the
port. The rioting, which lasted over four hours and involved up to 15,000
people, was the worst Cuba has experienced in more than three decades.
<P>
     Castro responded predictably by blaming the riots on the U.S.
embargo and threatening to permit the wholesale flight of Cubans from the
island unless the embargo was lifted. A week after the August 5 riots, he
ordered his security forces to halt all activities aimed at preventing the
departure from Cuba of anyone wishing to leave. This decision triggered the
flight over a one-month period of tens of thousands of Cubans who set sail
in rickety home-built rafts in a desperate attempt to reach the U.S. Dozens
of U.S. Coast Guard and Navy ships were sent to the Florida Straits, where
over 32,000 refugees were rescued and transported to the U.S. military base
at Guantanamo on the southeastern tip of Cuba.
<P>

A New U.S. Policy 
<P>
     In response to the refugee crisis, the Clinton Administration tightened
economic sanctions on Cuba and sought negotiations with the Castro regime
to end the flight of refugees. On August 19, President Clinton announced
that Cuban refugees would not be permitted unrestricted access to the United
States, reversing a 28-year-old U.S. immigration policy. Previously, all
Cuban refugees that reached U.S. shores or were rescued at sea by the U.S.
Coast Guard were granted political asylum and permanent resident status
one year after entry into the U.S. under the provisions of the 1966 Cuban
Adjustment Act.
<P>
     On August 23, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno also announced
that Cuban citizens fleeing the island illegally would be denied the
opportunity to apply for political asylum in the United States. In addition,
the Clinton Administration turned up the heat by banning some $400 million
a year in cash transfers by Cuban-Americans to their relatives in Cuba, by
cutting back U.S. charter flights to Cuba, and by increasing Radio Mart and
TV Mart broadcasts to Cuba.
<P>
     Following a week of negotiations in New York City, U.S. and Cuban
officials announced on September 9 that an agreement had been reached to
end the refugee crisis. The Castro regime agreed to prevent any more
refugees from setting out to sea, while the United States agreed to increase
the number of visas issued annually to Cubans to at least 20,000. Although
Castro had insisted that any talks with the United states must deal with the
embargo, the agreement was limited to immigration. U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher left open the possibility that future talks could be
expanded to other issues if the Castro regime agrees to comply with
longstanding U.S. demands for economic and democratic reforms in Cuba.
"If [Cuba] take[s] steps toward democracy, if they take steps toward the free
market, if they take steps to ease the human rights situation, the United
States will respond in a carefully calibrated way," said Christopher.

<P>
A GROWING MOVEMENT TO LIFT THE EMBARGO 
<P>
     The Secretary of State's remarks were not an isolated development.
They reflected growing sentiment among many U.S. policymakers, and
Americans in general, who favor lifting the trade embargo on Cuba. Now
that the Cold War is over, many Americans appear to believe that the time
has come for the United States to remove the embargo against Cuba
unilaterally without demanding any political or economic concessions from
Fidel Castro. For example, former President Jimmy Carter has noted that
"It's time for [the United States] to begin discussions on how we can
alleviate this embargo which has caused tremendous suffering among the
people of Cuba and has distorted this hemisphere's concept of freedom and
democracy."
<P>
     The list of those who favor lifting the embargo goes beyond the
United States, though. NAFTA partners Mexico and Canada, two of Cuba's
largest trading partners, also are among the most forceful proponents of
ending the embargo. Practically every country in Latin America and the
Caribbean wants it lifted. Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and
Russia openly oppose it. In October, the U.N. General Assembly, for the
third consecutive year, passed a non-binding resolution calling on
Washington to end the embargo. Among the 184 delegations at the U.N.,
only Israel backed the United States, where a growing chorus of liberals and
conservatives, ranging from Jesse Jackson to William F. Buckley and The
Wall Street Journal, also are saying that it is time to end the embargo.
<P>

"Exporting Capitalism": The Comparison with China
<P>
     Those who favor lifting the embargo often point to the examples of
Vietnam and China to justify their position, claiming that eliminating the
embargo will encourage the growth of a free-market economy which will
undermine the communist regime. Such comparisons are not valid.
Capitalism is destroying communism in China, but the driving force is not
international trade. It is a strong domestic market economy tolerated by the
communist government. China's market economy is dominated by many
millions of small entrepreneurs who are devouring the communist command
economy. Moreover, China's market economy has been growing in depth
and diversity since the mid-1980s. Free trade is promoting faster market
growth and expanding the personal freedom of millions of Chinese,
encouraged by entrepreneurs and investors from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and
elsewhere who are providing the capital, entrepreneurial skills, and
international trade contacts which are compelling China to transform its
economy. In the process, a vast and prosperous middle class is being
created.
<P>
     In Cuba, however, the Castro regime is not willing to liberalize the
economy and create a free market. Cuban exile communities in the United
States, Latin America, and Europe are not willing to work with Castro, and
market initiatives by the Castro regime to encourage them to do so are very
recent, dating from 1993 for the most part. The basic orientation of the
hard-liners surrounding Castro is to contain and restrict all initiatives that
unleash individual entrepreneurship and creativity. For example, the
government has arrested people for earning "too much" money in the
dollarized informal economy, the variety of legally permitted "family
businesses" has been restricted, and tax rates on the income of self-
employed Cubans have been increased. Moreover, Cuba's constitution and
legislation specifically prohibit all private initiative, notwithstanding recent
reforms allowing self-employment by Cubans in approximately 140
categories of economic activity from which all professionals (the core of any
middle class) are expressly barred. For over three decades, the regime has
operated on the basis of divide and rule. Castro's bitter enmity toward the
Cuban exile community precludes the possibility of replicating in the
Caribbean what China's exile community has accomplished in China.
<P>
     None of the alleged "market reforms" undertaken to date in Cuba are
true free-market initiatives. Free enterprise remains highly restricted. Foreign
investors doing business in Cuba today deal mainly with Castro's regime.
Cuban partners in joint ventures and mixed companies are approved by
Castro as "safe." Moreover, unlike China, Cuba has barely started to open
up its economy, and what little has been done to date has been permitted
with great official reluctance and with the objective of assuring the
communist government's political survival. China's economic transformation
has been under way since 1978, when important agricultural reforms were
introduced, including the right of peasant farmers to grow the crops they
wished and retain some of their profit. Moreover, the government of China
has encouraged the marketization of the country's coastal provinces, and
since 1992 the Chinese constitution has incorporated the concept of the
"socialist market economy." Although China remains a communist nation
where political freedoms are sharply restricted, the ruling regime has
permitted vigorous development of the private sector, thus laying the seeds
for its eventual demise and potential replacement by a politically pluralist,
more open society.
<P>
     The Myth of Lost Opportunities for Americans. Many of those
wishing to see the embargo lifted also argue that American businesses will
lose out to competition from other countries whose governments do not
restrict trade and investment in Cuba. But this argument is weak. Before the
communist revolution, the United States was Cuba's largest trading partner:
nearly 80 percent of Cuba's two-way volume of trade involved the U.S.
Regardless of when the embargo is lifted, the United States will quickly
regain its prominent role in the Cuban economy. Moreover, the Cuban-
American community, totaling over 1.8 million people, will be an important
source of investment capital and management experience.
<P>

CREATING THE CONDITIONS FOR CHANGE IN CUBA
<P>
     Castro's recent comments and actions make it clear how fruitless it
would be for the United States to make concessions now. Even without
access to U.S. markets and investments, there are many steps Castro could
take to improve economic and political conditions within his country, but he
refuses to do so. These include:
<P>
Adopting free-market policies that include a reform of Cuba's constitution
and passage of laws to abolish all legal prohibition of private enterprise and
property ownership.
<P>
Holding democratic elections in the context of a politically pluralist society
in which the Communist Party is compelled to compete with democratic
organizations and political parties.
<P>
Freeing all political prisoners currently in Cuban jails.
<P>
Disbanding the Interior Ministry's security police and the Committees for
the Defense of the Revolution, which function as thought-control police and
as spies in every neighborhood in Cuba.
<P>
Eliminating the Marxist political indoctrination, which is a central feature
of Cuba's education system.
<P>
Restoring all confiscated assets and properties to their rightful owners, or
agreeing to pay appropriate compensation for what the regime has stolen
from them.
<P>
     Without these steps, lifting the embargo would only assure Castro's
continuing repression of the Cuban people. Those who advocate doing so
are violating their own professed commitment to hemispheric democracy and
the individual's right to self-determination. Castro is a ruthless, charismatic
dictator and is a potential danger to all democratic, freedom-loving nations.
He is an anachronism, but a dangerous one. The embargo, however, is not
an anachronism; it is a legitimate instrument for achieving the goal of a free
and democratic Cuba.
<P>
     Thus far, the Clinton Administration has been steadfast in refusing
to discuss the economic embargo. It is correct in doing so. To hasten the
collapse of the Castro regime and communism in Cuba, the Administration
should also:
<P>
Maintain the embargo until irreversible economic and political reforms
leading to democratic capitalism are in place. Tightening the economic
screws may lead to more disturbances and riots, as well as increased
repression as Castro struggles to remain in power. However, the embargo
remains the only effective instrument available to the U.S. government in
trying to force the economic and democratic concessions it has been
demanding of Castro for over three decades. Maintaining the embargo will
help to end the Castro regime more quickly.
<P>
Admit no more Cuban refugees into the U.S. beyond the 20,000 per year
agreed to during negotiations in September. Allowing the unrestricted entry
of Cuban refugees during the Cold War was valid and necessary while
Castro's regime was still powerful and its political control of the island was
undisputed. But circumstances have changed in the past five years, as the
Clinton Administration realized when it changed U.S. policy toward Cuba
during the August refugee crisis. Continuing to allow Cuban refugees
unrestricted entry to the United States serves only to prolong Castro's rule
by providing him a much-needed safety valve to relieve the pressure of
growing social discontent.
<P>
     However, the 24,000 refugees now at the U.S. Naval Base at
Guantanamo and the 8,000 more in Panama should be processed for
admission to the United States as soon as possible. The near-concentration
camp conditions in which they are being kept are unsustainable, and the cost
of maintaining them is high. The Clinton Administration agreed in
September to process and admit up to 20,000 Cubans a year. To clear out
the bases in Guantanamo and Panama, the Administration may be able to
process the refugees there for early admission but reduce the total number
of refugees admitted in the next three to five years by a proportional
number.
<P>
     The Cuban people must understand that it is up to them to solve the
social, economic, and political crisis caused by the Castro regime. U.S.
taxpayers should no longer be compelled to finance the costs of Castro's
unremitting tyranny. The Cuban people have the power to determine their
own government. The energy and courage invested in braving the shark-
filled Florida Straits would be spent better in Cuba, working to bring down
Castro.
<P>
Demand that U.S. allies in the Western Hemisphere, including Mexico and
Canada, stop coddling Castro and start calling for real changes. The Clinton
Administration was successful in getting the United Nations to condemn the
military regime in Haiti. There is no reason it cannot exert equally
persuasive diplomatic pressure to get similar resolutions regarding Cuba
through that body. The Administration should strive to convince the
international community not to do business with Cuba until the jails are
emptied of all political prisoners, until Castro's repressive security forces are
disbanded, all illegally confiscated properties and assets are returned to their
rightful owners or appropriate compensation is paid, the constitution and
laws of Cuba are reformed to legalize free enterprise and private ownership
of property, free-market policies are adopted, and democratic elections are
held in a pluralist political context which allows the Cuban people to elect
the leaders they choose.
<P>
Link future free trade agreements between the United States and Latin
American/Caribbean nations to redoubled efforts by these countries to
persuade Castro to liberalize Cuba's economy and political system. In recent
years, many of the region's elected leaders have tried unsuccessfully to
persuade Castro to open Cuba's economy and democratize its political
system. Castro has rejected all of these overtures while gaining the support
of these Latin American and Caribbean nations in pressuring the U.S. to lift
the embargo.
<P>
     At the same time, Castro's intransigence has not slowed efforts by
many of these countries, including NAFTA partners Mexico and Canada, to
expand trade relations with Cuba. In June 1994, Mexico surpassed Spain as
the largest foreign investor in Cuba when a Monterrey firm paid $1.5 billion
for a 49 percent stake in the state telephone company, Empresas
Telecomunicaciones de Cuba (ETEC).[The investment by Grupo Domos
forms part of an arrangement between the Cuban and Mexican governments,
brokered by Mexico's Export Bank (Bancomext), to swap $340 million in
Cuban debts for stakes in Cuban industries, including Varadero's Hotel
Tuxpan and the transfer of the island's largest cement plant to Cemex.  In
September 1994, Mexpetrol, a consortium of private Mexican oil companies
and state-owned Pemex, announced a $200 million joint venture with Cuba's
state oil company to operate the Cienfuegos refinery, one of three on the
island, which at full capacity can process 65,000 barrels a day of crude oil. 
Glassmaker Grupo Vitro, which owns U.S.  glassmaker Anchor Glass and
reported total world sales of $3.5 billion in 1993, also confirmed in
September that it may acquire a glass bottling plant in Cuba.  On September
13, 1994, UPI reported from Mexico City that Mexican construction,
transportation, and tourism firms "are poised to increase trade and
investment" in Cuba if the U.S.  lifts its trade embargo, with "much of the
increase in trade probably channelled through Miami."] Spain is Cuba's
second-largest trading partner, dominating the island's tourism industry, but
Canadian companies are aggressively courting Castro's regime, particularly
in the mining and energy sectors. The U.S. should use its leverage as the
most important trading nation in the hemisphere to correct this. For
example, the NAFTA trade relationship carries an implicit agreement with
the shared goal of building a trade zone in the Western Hemisphere based
on free markets and respect for democracy. Those principles apply to all
other countries in the Americas seeking closer trade relations with the U.S.
and U.S. investment to help develop their economies. The Clinton
Administration should not be timid in pressing its case in this regard.
Prepare for the possibility that Castro's collapse could unleash a lengthy
period of social and political unrest, and perhaps even civil war, in Cuba.
U.S. policy toward Castro long has idealized an outcome in which Cuba
makes a peaceful transition to a free-market democracy. With Castro's
collapse more likely in the near term than ever before, however, the U.S.
government does not appear to have a policy for dealing with the likelihood
that it will take place amid bloodshed, armed conflict, and chaos. A recent
Rand study argues that the Departments of Defense and State must conceive
such a strategy "according to three general tasks: Containment of the crisis,
with the aim of damage limitation for both the United States and Cuba.
Alleviation of the crisis, for the purpose of reducing human suffering among
refugees and noncombatants on the island. Resolution of the crisis,
unilaterally or multilaterally, by diplomatic or other nonmilitary means.... "
The study's most important conclusion is that the end of Castro's regime
could come at any time during the next 12 to 36 months, and that the U.S.
government should seek to develop flexible responses for Castro's demise,
depending on whether it takes place in a climate of violence or peaceful
transition. The Clinton Administration should prepare now for the transition
that could begin without significant warning.
<P>
Reinforce the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo in anticipation of attack by
pro-Castro forces. The Clinton Administration should consider the possibility
that a desperate Castro might attempt to provoke a violent U.S. military
response which could galvanize Cuban support for the regime based on old
fears, nurtured for decades by Castro's propaganda machine, of "Yanqui"
imperialism and colonialism. In this context, Cuban refugees now at
Guantanamo should be admitted to the U.S. or transported to other safe
havens. Once that is done, the Administration should reinforce the base with
tactical aircraft and at least a brigade-sized combat unit capable of holding
off a surprise attack.
<P>
Provide financial and other support to more than 150 dissident groups
within Cuba that are struggling to bring down Castro. Such groups
include the Catholic Church, which is dedicated to peaceful change. No
support should be provided to dissident groups intent on triggering violent
change, for the United States must avoid inflaming anti-American sentiment
at all costs. Dissident groups dedicated to peaceful change will be the basis
on which a civil society will be created in a post-Castro Cuba, and their
growth should be encouraged and supported in much the same way the
Reagan Administration clandestinely supported Lech Walesa's Solidarity
labor movement in Poland after martial law was imposed in late 1981. Such
support would include financing of publications and income subsidies to
permit dissidents to support themselves and their families.
<P>
Increase the broadcasting activities of Radio Mart. These broadcasts should
urge the Cuban people to bring down Castro peacefully and should specify
that under no circumstances will the U.S. interfere militarily in Cuba's
domestic affairs. They should also stress that what the U.S. wants is a
stable, friendly relationship with a democratic, free-market Cuba and that the
U.S. is willing to negotiate with the Cuban government as long as Castro
implements the comprehensive political and economic reforms he needs to
revive his stalled economy.
<P>

CONCLUSION
<P>
     The 32-year-old trade embargo against Cuba may finally be
producing its intended results of destabilizing the island's communist
government and weakening Fidel Castro's control of the Cuban people.
Castro has resisted change for over five years since losing the Soviet
Union's financial support, but his final collapse may be closer than ever
before. Nevertheless, he continues his visceral loathing of democracy and
the free market, all the while demanding the embargo be lifted without
condition. It seems clear that Castro believes his survival hinges on the
embargo's elimination.

     Paradoxically, just as Castro's communist government may be close
to falling, a chorus of voices in the U.S. has risen to call for the lifting of
the embargo. They cite several reasons: to ease the suffering of the Cuban
people, to capitalize on the trade and investment opportunities other
countries allegedly are enjoying in Cuba, and to establish the bases of a
free-market economy that in time will compel democratic reforms as well.
But the greatest beneficiary would be Fidel Castro, whose 35-year-old
communist dictatorship would be fortified overnight if he were allowed
access to the billions of dollars in financial aid from multilateral agencies,
credit guarantees, and investment that would start flowing into Cuba.
<P>
      The United States must not abandon the Cuban people by relaxing
or lifting the trade embargo against the communist regime. Instead, the U.S.
government must reject all pressures to ease the embargo until all of the
objectives for which it was imposed are achieved. Anything less would
constitute an unacceptable breach of faith with the Cuban people, who today
are among the very few people left in the world who still suffer the brutality
of a communist dictatorship.

<h2>Charity</h2>
<i><blockquote>
<P>
Man does not live by bread alone. Why, then, does our   
welfare system offer nothing more? 
</I></Blockquote><P>

In the March issue of Philanthropy, Culture & Society,   
Marvin Olasky argues that "we must go beyond   
sentimentality and learn how to fight poverty the right way,   
the biblical way, the way that was practiced in America until   
recent decades." Olasky says "the reason why government   
welfare programs must be transformed is not that they are too   
expensive. The real problem is that they are too stingy about   
doing what is truly important: treating people as human   
beings made in God's image, not as animals to be fed, caged,   
and occasionally petted." He asserts that "private programs   
can do a better job if they are challenging, personal, and   
spiritual."  
  <p>
So, what did our forebears do differently? "During the l9th   
century, before the federal government ever got involved, a   
war on poverty much more successful than our own was   
waged by tens of thousands of local, private charitable   
agencies and religious groups around the country," observes   
Olasky. He concedes that "poverty fighters a century ago did   
not abolish poverty," but insists that "they witnessed a   
movement out of poverty by millions of people." Attitudes   
were different in those days, among beneficiaries as well as   
benefactors. "The optimism prevalent then contrasts sharply   
with the demoralization among the poor and the cynicism   
among the better-off that is so common now," says Olasky.   
Our forebears "knew that the literal meaning of compassion   
is not just writing a check, but having personal involvement   
with the needy, suffering with them, not just giving money to   
them."  
  <p>
Olasky contends that 19th-century Americans "knew that   
people should be challenged. When an able-bodied man came   
to a homeless shelter, he often was asked to chop wood for   
two hours or to whitewash a building. In that way he could   
provide part of his own support and also help those unable to   
chop. They knew . . . that even the most rundown person is   
not just a taker; he can also be a giver. They knew that   
everyone is made in God's image and is capable of helping."  
  <p>
America has paid a terrible toll for its forgetfulness. "We've   
forgotten America's past successes in poverty-fighting," says   
Olasky. "The result has been not just the waste of billions of   
dollars each year, but the death of part of the American   
dream." Welfare, says Olasky, "kills dreams." Not only "the   
dreams of poor individuals who gradually become used to   
dependency," but also "the dreams of children who grow up   
without fathers," and countless other dreams that coercive   
measures cannot fulfill.  
  <p>
Olasky reports that "across America people of many faiths,   
income levels, and races are refusing to give up on the dream   
of effective compassion. More people are capturing the   
understanding that the major flaw of the modern welfare state   
is not that it is extravagant, but that it is too stingy. It gives   
the needy bread and tells them to be content with that alone."

Backgrounder Update #240<br>

Foundation Backgrounder No. 1005, October 6, 1994)
<br>
February 22, 1995

<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>

The February 7 arrest of Ramzi Yousef, suspected mastermind of the
February 1993 World Trade Center bombing, has underscored the global
reach of terrorist networks and the need for stepped-up international
cooperation in combating terrorism. Yousef, who fled the United States only
hours after the most devastating terrorist attack ever perpetrated on
American soil, had been extremely active prior to his arrest. The mysterious
27-year-old was implicated in a terrorist bombing of an airliner in the
Philippines in December, a plot to assassinate Pope John Paul II in January,
and an aborted attempt to bomb an American airliner in Thailand earlier this
month. 
<P>
     Yousef's ability to escape arrest and cross international borders
undetected repeatedly for two years indicates that he had extensive help in
many different countries. His considerable financial resources, large supply
of false documents, and access to safe houses, explosives, local assistance,
and information about his planned targets in far-flung regions of the world
suggest that he enjoyed the backing of a well-organized network, and
possibly a state sponsor. Significantly, the U.S. government now is
reexamining the possibility that a terrorist state was behind the World Trade
Center bombing.
<P>
     President Bill Clinton has hailed Yousef's arrest as an important
victory in the war against terrorism. But the President deserves little credit.
In fact, Yousef's arrest occurred in spite of the efforts of the Clinton
Administration. For example, Yousef's arrest in Pakistan was made possible
by an informant motivated by a $2 million reward offered by the U.S.
government for information leading to Yousef's capture. Yet the
Administration initially refused to offer a reward in the case of the World
Trade Center bombing, arguing that it was an act of domestic terrorism and
therefore not eligible for the International Terrorist Information Reward
program. The Administration eventually relented under considerable
congressional pressure and offered the reward in July 1993, almost five
months after the bombing.
<P>
     Yousef's apprehension and rapid extradition from Pakistan can be
attributed to close coordination among the State Department, Justice
Department, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Central Intelligence
Agency. This coordination and the close cooperation between the U.S. and
Pakistan were mainly a function of the State Department's Office of
Counterterrorism. However, the Clinton Administration had planned to
downgrade this office and fold it into a new Bureau for Narcotics,
Terrorism, and Crime. In addition, the Coordinator for Counterterrorism was
to be reduced in rank from the current equivalent status of an Assistant
Secretary of State to the level of a Deputy Assistant Secretary. Congress
temporarily blocked this reorganization scheme in April 1994 by passing an
amendment to the State Department authorization bill sponsored by
Representative Benjamin Gilman (R-NY). 
<P>
     Trying to reassert leadership on terrorism issues, the Administration
introduced legislation on February 10 to bolster U.S. deterrence of terrorism
and to punish those who aid and abet terrorists. The Omnibus
Counterterrorism Act of 1995 will outlaw fundraising in the United States
in support of terrorist activities overseas, expedite the deportation of alien
terrorists, and make international terrorism committed in the U.S. a federal
crime. This legislation is a long-overdue step in the right direction. But it
focuses primarily on domestic and legal aspects of the war against terrorism.
Ramzi Yousef's arrest is an important reminder that international efforts are
a key ingredient in fighting terrorism.
<P>
     The critical challenge facing U.S. counterterrorism policy is putting
relentless pressure on the states that sponsor terrorism -- Cuba, Iraq, Libya,
North Korea, Syria, Sudan, and particularly Iran, the chief supporter of
international terrorism in the world today. This is an opportune time to
ratchet up the pressure because Iran and other state sponsors of terrorism are
economically weak and diplomatically isolated. But the Administration has
not followed through on its tough rhetoric on terrorism. It has not given up
on plans to downgrade the State Department's Office of Counterterrorism,
for example, and continues to woo Syria despite Syria's continued support
of more than a dozen terrorist groups.
<P>
     Congress has an opportunity to strengthen U.S. counterterrorism
policy above and beyond the legislative proposals the Administration is
pushing. To do so, Congress should:
<P>
Press the Administration to make counterterrorism a higher priority in
American foreign policy. Congress should force the Administration to drop
its short-sighted plan to downgrade the State Department's Office of
Counterterrorism, which spearheads international efforts in combating
terrorism. The Gilman amendment, which bars the Administration from
downgrading the office, expires on April 30, 1995. Representative Gilman
has introduced H.R. 22, a bill to preserve the office on a permanent basis
and elevate the Coordinator of Counterterrorism to the status of an
Ambassador at Large, as was the case in the Reagan Administration. Senator
Alfonse D'Amato (R-NY) introduced a similar bill in the Senate. Congress
also should press the Administration to raise the issue of terrorism in every
appropriate bilateral and multilateral diplomatic contact, including the annual
G-7 summits. A series of congressional hearings on new trends in
international terrorism would help to highlight the threat of terrorism and the
urgency of fighting it. Another vital topic for congressional hearings is
investigating strategies for blocking the efforts of terrorist states such as
Iran, Iraq, and Libya to obtain weapons of mass destruction. A nuclear-
armed Iran or Iraq could pose the ultimate terrorist threat.
<P>
Reform immigration laws to improve internal security. Congress should pass
legislation that enables the U.S. government to deny visas to foreigners
because of their membership in terrorist groups. Right now, would-be
terrorists are denied entry only if the government can prove that they
already have committed terrorist acts or that they intend to commit such
acts. These rules are too lax and should be strengthened. Moreover, tougher
penalties should be imposed on the production or use of fraudulent passports
and visas, including giving the government the power to seize the assets of
criminals convicted of creating or using false documents for terrorism or
drug smuggling. Nine of the original 35 indictable counts in the 1993 New
York bombing plots involved visa or passport offenses.
<P>
Punish states that support terrorism on as many fronts as possible. The U.S.
must work with its allies to raise the diplomatic, economic, political, and
military costs of supporting terrorism so high that they outweigh the
strategic benefits. Although the Administration has singled out Iran as the
world's most dangerous state sponsor of terrorism, it has not succeeded in
persuading its allies, particularly Japan and Germany, to levy economic
sanctions against Tehran. In part, this is because American oil companies
have become Iran's biggest customers, buying about $4.2 billion dollars of
Iranian oil annually to supply their overseas markets. Although imports of
Iranian oil into the U.S. are prohibited, the Clinton Administration has
declined to ban U.S. companies from purchasing Iranian oil for their
overseas markets. This business-as-usual approach undermines American
diplomatic efforts to isolate Iran and to raise the cost of its continued
support of terrorism. Congress should consider passing legislation banning
American oil companies from purchasing Iranian oil and should call upon
U.S. allies to do the same as long as Iran supports Hezbollah, Hamas, and
other terrorist organizations.
 <P>
 Ensure that impending budget cuts do not undermine the war against
terrorism. Congressional appropriations committees must take care to avoid
weakening the organizations crucial to America's defenses against terrorism
-- particularly the counterterrorism efforts of the intelligence community, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, the State Department's Office of
Counterterrorism, and the Defense Department's Special Operations
Command. The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control,
which is responsible for implementing the U.S. government's freeze on the
financial assets of terrorist groups, also should receive a high priority in
budget deliberations. It also is important to reverse the decline in the budget
of the Counterterrorism Research and Development program, which helps
develop new means of detecting explosives, among other things. Cutting
such programs not only would jeopardize the nation's security, but would
be penny-wise and pound-foolish. The World Trade Center bombing, which
resulted in six deaths and over 1,000 casualties, triggered over $600 million
in economic losses. 
<P>
 Assist the governments of Lebanon and Afghanistan to restore order and
expel international terrorists. Civil wars exacerbated by foreign interventions
have enabled terrorist groups to operate with impunity from bases in both
of these countries. Ramzi Yousef and several other terrorists involved in the
World Trade Center bombing had extensive contacts with radical Afghan
Islamic groups. Congress should hold hearings to determine ways in which
the U.S. can assist the weak central governments in both countries to
dismantle and expel terrorist groups.
<P>
     The war against terrorism requires concerted international efforts
which only the U.S. can lead. But the Clinton Administration does not
appear willing or able to exercise the leadership necessary to mobilize the
international community decisively against terrorism. This makes it all the
more important that Congress take steps to combat international terrorism,
which looms as one of the greatest challenges to U.S. security in the 1990s.

<h3><center><a name="introduction">INTRODUCTION</a></h3></center><br>

	For weeks now the Clinton Administration has been trying to change the subject in foreign affairs. After two and a half years of the poorest foreign policy performance since Jimmy Carter's presidency, the Clinton Administration now claims that it is the new majority in Congress that is damaging America's place and image in the world. Congressional efforts to reorganize the State Department, curb wasteful development assistance, and prevent the United States from participating in failure-prone United Nations peacekeeping missions have been portrayed by the President as a "frontal assault" on presidential authority and as the "most isolationist proposals in 50 years."<p>

	The American people should not be fooled by either Bill Clinton's internationalist rhetoric or by his accusations against the congressional majority. His rhetoric masks actions that are potentially far more isolationist in their consequences than anything proposed by Members of Congress. Clinton's foreign, defense, and trade policies reflect both a dangerous inconsistency and the lack of any coherent national strategy. They are dramatically weakening America's capability to project military power overseas, undermining U.S. alliances, inflaming protectionist sentiments at home and abroad, and squandering America's credibility. If present trends continue, America's influence in the world will shrink, and U.S. friends and allies will be faced with the slow-motion disengagement of the United States from its overseas commitments -- isolationism not by design, but by default. In the words of National Security Advisor Anthony Lake, this is a policy of "back-door isolationism."<p>


<h3><center><a name="isolationists">CLINTON VS. CONGRESS:<br> THE PRESIDENT'S "BACK-DOOR ISOLATIONISTS"</a></h3><br></center>

	The Clinton Administration's charges of congressional isolationism began a few weeks ago in response to a bid by House and Senate Republicans to reorganize the State Department and trim foreign aid. A bill proposed by Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC) would abolish the Agency for International Development (AID), the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA), and other foreign policy agencies. A House bill, the American Overseas Interests Act, which has passed the International Affairs Committee but awaits a floor vote, would eliminate these agencies and cut $2.8 billion from the $21.6 billion foreign affairs budget proposed by the Administration. This amounts to a 13 percent reduction. Another House bill, the National Security Revitalization Act, would restrict U.S. participation in U.N. peacekeeping operations. Part of the GOP's Contract with America, this bill has been approved by the House.<p>

	Lake professes alarm. He warned in a speech on April 27 at the National Press Club that "The United States could be on the brink of unilateral disarmament."  America's success in the world, Lake charges, "is under attack by new isolationists from both the left and the right.... Our policy of engagement in world affairs is under siege and American leadership is in peril."  People who hold these views are "back-door isolationists" who refuse to provide the tools for engagement, which to Lake means primarily foreign aid and joining U.N. peacekeeping operations. Apparently persuaded by these views, President Clinton has threatened to veto the House foreign affairs bills. A vote scheduled for May 24 was postponed until after the Memorial Day recess primarily because the House leadership did not have enough time to stage votes on the over 100 amendments that were proposed.<p>

	Congressional Republicans have many motivations, but not "back-door" isolationism. First, they want to adjust America's foreign policy apparatus to a new era. The Arms Control and Disarmament Agency is a creature of U.S.-Soviet arms control agreements and should be abolished. So, too, should the Agency for International Development, which purports to help developing nations but in reality has failed abysmally in promoting economic growth and development. There is no place for these agencies in an era in which the Soviet Union no longer exists and the free market and trade, not foreign aid, are the engines of economic development.<p>

	Second, congressional Republicans are trying to balance the budget. At a time when the American people are being asked to tighten their belts, why should foreign aid programs be spared from cuts?  Why should AID be spending $2 million to study ecotourism in Central America while senior citizens are asked to accept cutbacks in Medicare?  Why should AID be spending $12 million to develop the "sustainable growth" of Oman's fishing industry?  And why should AID have a contract with a group called Development Associates, Inc., to study AID's own project evaluation studies?  Former Secretary of State James Baker is right when he says that "AID's only useful purpose is to serve as a standard for inefficiency for other agencies to avoid."<p>

	By themselves, Congress's proposed reductions in foreign aid should have no affect on U.S. credibility or commitments abroad. Most foreign aid, in fact, is spared from the budget ax. The most valuable part of the U.S. foreign aid program -- the part that demonstrates America's commitment to its most important interests -- will not be touched. This includes aid to Egypt and Israel, plus U.S. security assistance. Only demonstrated failures -- such as bilateral development assistance and contributions to the wasteful and inefficient World Bank and International Monetary Fund -- will be affected. These congressional proposals can damage U.S. credibility only if the President presents an alarmist and misleading interpretation of them to the world. <p>

	Thirdly, House and Senate Republicans are trying to prevent some of the worst foreign policy mistakes of the Clinton Administration from repeating themselves. This, too, has nothing to do with promoting isolationism but everything to do with trying to preserve U.S. credibility abroad. The desire to curb U.S. participation in U.N. peacekeeping operations flows directly from congressional dissatisfaction with the Clinton Administration's inept handling of the operation in Somalia. This failure and the flip-flops in Bosnia, Haiti, and elsewhere, have embarrassed the U.S. and cast doubt on America's credibility as a world leader. Preventing a recurrence of such mistakes would go a long way toward restoring some of the credibility lost during the Clinton presidency.<p>


<h3><center><a name="retreat">CLINTON'S STRATEGIC RETREAT: <br>THE DECLINE OF AMERICAN MILITARY POWER</a>
</h3></center><br>
	Lake is alarmed that America may be on the "brink of unilateral disarmament."  This alarm is fully justified, but the reason is the Clinton Administration's military policies, not plans by Congress to cut foreign aid or restrict U.N. peacekeeping operations.<p>

	On the heels of cuts that have reduced defense budget authority by about 40 percent in real terms since 1985, Clinton's fiscal 1996 defense request would impose an additional 9 percent through Fiscal Year 1999. The results will be lower troop morale, weaker combat readiness, inadequate weapons modernization, and less research on high-tech weaponry. However, the most serious problem with Clinton's defense policy is that his proposed budget will not fund the force he says the country needs to defend itself. The planned Clinton force will be underfunded over five years by around $110 billion. Therefore, without additional funding, the U.S. will not possess a force capable of meeting even the Administration's own relatively low requirements. <p>

	If these defense budget trends continue, the U.S. eventually will be forced to write off either Europe or Asia as a region it is able to defend. Under the Clinton budget, the U.S. would be hard pressed to win even one major regional conflict. Under no circumstances could it win two regional conflicts "nearly simultaneously," as promised in the Administration's Bottom-Up Review of defense requirements.<p>

	In short, Clinton's defense budget will lead not only to "unilateral disarmament," to use Lake's phrase, but to a strategic retreat from military commitments overseas as well. Unable to make good on these commitments, the U.S. will be forced to withdraw many of its forces from overseas. Unable to rely on the U.S., America's allies in turn will have to establish new security arrangements, in some cases accommodating themselves to enemies of the United States. Allies also may have to rearm, possibly with nuclear weapons. Vast regions of the world will be abandoned to the spheres of influence of other powers such as China or Russia. American influence and power in the world will wane. The American Century will be over.<p>

	Nothing -- not foreign aid, not participating in U.N. peacekeeping operations -- demonstrates seriousness about international affairs more clearly and convincingly than commitment to remaining a global military power. As Malcolm Wallop so aptly says, "A foreign policy without a military capability is but a prayer."  Without a global military capability, the U.S. inevitably must fall back to a more isolationist foreign policy. Unable to protect its allies and serve as a force for peace and stability, the U.S. will lose its ability to exert influence. As a result, it will find its allies less cooperative and more untrustworthy, its enemies more assertive, and the world more inhospitable to U.S. interests and values. <p>


<h3><center><a name="protectionism">CLINTON FANS THE FIRES OF PROTECTIONISM</a></h3></center>

	The Clinton Administration also ignores the isolationist implications of its international trade policies. It has threatened to impose unilateral trade sanctions against Japan unless Japan agrees to purchasing quotas for U.S. automobiles and auto parts. The Japanese have vowed to take their case to the World Trade Organization if Washington proceeds with sanctions. The U.S. and Japan, two long-time allies and the keys to peace and security in Asia, are on the verge of a trade war.<p>

	Until now, the Clinton Administration has had a mixed but relatively good record in supporting free trade. Its support for the North American Free Trade Agreement was exemplary. However, the Administration's trade policy has been schizophrenic. Toward Latin America and with respect to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Clinton has been a free trader; toward Japan, he has consistently pursued a managed trade policy. The recent U.S. threats of trade sanctions merely represent an escalation in a policy that has existed from the very beginning.<p>

	However, this is an escalation with a difference. The rhetoric from United States Trade Representative Mickey Kantor has become very heated, causing Japanese Trade Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to remark that "Mr. Kantor is even more scary than my wife when I get home under the influence of alcohol."<p>

	A trade war could have devastating consequences. Anti-Japanese feelings already are fairly strong in the United States. A recent poll taken by the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations indicates that 62 percent of Americans believe economic competition from Japan represents a "critical threat" to the United States. A trade war would add fuel to the fire, drowning out more sensible voices calling attention to the strategic importance of the U.S.-Japanese alliance to the peace and security of Asia. Moreover, if Japan were to win its case against the U.S. in the WTO, isolationists and protectionists like Pat Buchanan and Ross Perot would be emboldened to broaden their attacks on free trade policies. The expansion of NAFTA could be stopped in its tracks, and the World Trade Organization could go the way of the League of Nations in the 1920s.<p>

	Another tragic consequence of Clinton's trade policy toward Japan could be the destruction of the U.S.-Japanese military alliance. Some Americans would question the value of a military alliance with an ally that sues the U.S. in an international trade court. Some Japanese already are questioning the need to continue the alliance with the U.S. If the U.S.-Japan alliance fell apart, a critically important strategic anchor in Asia would be lost. It would very likely be the first step in the retreat from U.S. commitments in Asia.<p>


<h3><center><a name="waning">THE FRUITS OF CLINTON'S POLICY:<br> THE WANING OF AMERICAN CREDIBILITY ABROAD</a></h3></center>

	The perception is growing abroad that America is retreating from the world stage. But the main cause is to be found not in the halls of Congress, however, but in the White House. America's friends and allies are alarmed by the ineptitude and incoherence of Bill Clinton's foreign and defense policies. <p>

	The list of diplomatic inconsistencies and mistakes is a long one:<p>

BOSNIA. Knowing that the Serbs take U.N. hostages when hit with NATO air strikes, the President pressed NATO to launch air strikes -- and he did so without any backup plan. As expected, the Serbs began taking hostages and escalated the conflict. Compounding the problem, the President pledged to consider using U.S. ground troops in Bosnia, a break with past policy that caused a storm of criticism from Congress. Whatever the outcome, these actions follow repeated instances in which the President has promised greater U.S. action than is prudent or than can be sustained politically. The result: The credibility of NATO and U.S. leadership in Europe has plummeted.<p>

IRAN. The President announced a tightening of the oil embargo against Iran without first trying to line up the support of U.S. allies, a mistake which condemns the move to failure. The result: proof that America cannot lead its allies in an important diplomatic initiative.<p>

NORTH KOREA. Unable to maintain a coherent and fixed negotiating position, the Clinton Administration has been buffeted and manipulated by the North Koreans in their bid to retain their nuclear weapons program. The results: greater credibility for North Korea, more time for Pyongyang to work on its nuclear program, and doubts about U.S. leadership and credibility in Seoul and other capitals of Asia.

CHINA. The Clinton Administration came into office promising to punish Chinese human rights violations with trade sanctions. When Beijing remained intransigent, the Administration backed off by offering to continue China's Most Favored Nation trading status. The results: a growing Asian perception of weak U.S. leadership and a tougher Chinese posture.<p>

RUSSIA. The Administration has vacillated between accommodation and toughness, sending mixed signals in the process. On the one hand, Clinton went to Moscow despite the bloody war in Chechnya (while snubbing London) and he looked the other way as Russia threatens to circumvent the European conventional arms treaty. On the other hand, he has threatened to cut off aid to Russia unless Moscow stops assisting the Iranians with their nuclear program. The result: doubts in Europe and Russia about American consistency and purpose.<p>

JAPAN. The entire U.S.-Japanese relationship has been reduced to the issue of trade. The overriding importance of the U.S.-Japanese military alliance in maintaining peace and stability in Asia has been obscured by the Administration's campaign to force purchasing quotas of automobile parts on Japan.<p>

	Clinton's vacillation, inconstancy, and strategic myopia have drained U.S. foreign policy of much of its credibility. They have done more than anything else to raise doubts about U.S. leadership in the world. Because President Clinton refuses to lead, American influence in the world is now more marginal than at any other time in the last 50 years. This declining influence, if continued, is a recipe for the "back door" isolationism which Clinton's own National Security Advisor seems to fear.<p>


<h3><center><a name="foreign">CLINTON'S IDEA OF U.S. LEADERSHIP:<br> PROMOTING FOREIGN AID AND THE UNITED NATIONS</a></h3></center>

	The Administration's accusations of back-door isolationism rest primarily on two assumptions. The first is that foreign aid, as a major barometer of America's commitment to internationalism and engagement, is critical to U.S. leadership. The second is that criticism of the United Nations either is motivated by isolationist sentiments or could lead to isolationist consequences. According to this viewpoint, it is impossible for the U.S. to "go it alone," as some U.N. critics supposedly want, and America should work more closely with the United Nations to prevent crises from occurring. <p>

	Both of these assumptions are mistaken. Consider foreign aid. America spends about $14 billion a year on foreign aid. In a trillion dollar economy, this is not very much. Critics cannot have it both ways, arguing on the one hand that it is "only one percent" of the federal budget, and thus should be spared from cuts, while asserting on the other that even the slightest reduction in so relatively small an amount will cast doubt on American credibility.<p>

	American credibility depends on many things: on America's military capability, its military commitments to allies, and the health of its economy. Far down the list is foreign aid. To be sure, foreign aid can be a useful tool in exercising influence abroad, but it is a very thin reed upon which to base U.S. credibility. Few countries in the world continue to demand or want foreign aid from the U.S. <p>

	Instead, most countries want more trade from the U.S. American trade and investments are far more important than foreign aid in spreading American influence. In 1992, U.S. trade with the developing world amounted to $233 billion in imports and $171 billion in exports. In 1993 U.S. direct investment in the developing world reached a record $45.5 billion. These figures pale when compared with the annual foreign aid budget of $14 billion. U.S. trade and investments do far more than AID to promote economic development and growth in the Third World. They also do far more to spread American values and promote U.S. interests.<p>

	The most important barometer in measuring the seriousness of U.S. engagement abroad is U.S. defense capabilities. The U.S. spends around $50 billion a year on NATO alone. No other country in the world spends more to defend its allies and maintain international peace than does the U.S. These amounts are tangible investments in peace and stability, as well as unequivocal demonstrations of the American commitment to remain involved in international affairs. U.S. defense capabilities are far more important than anything AID or the World Bank do. In fact, U.S. military power and commitments are the best foreign aid programs in the world. 

	Far from slashing and burning the foreign aid budget, as some aid proponents have argued, the proposals by Senator Jesse Helms and other Members of Congress are designed to make foreign aid more effective by eliminating that which has failed and keeping that which has worked. The Helms proposal would ensure that foreign aid serves the national interest, promotes economic growth, and ensures that countries "graduate" from dependency on aid. Much of the aid to be cut by Congress is development assistance that has failed to promote economic growth as promised. Since security-related aid to such countries as Israel, Egypt, and Turkey is retained, it is spurious to charge that proposed aid cutoffs will damage U.S. security or America's relations with its most important friends and allies.<p>

	The second assumption -- that U.N. critics are isolationists -- is equally spurious. Most conservative critics of the Clinton Administration's U.N. policies are motivated not by some dream of returning to a fortress America, but rather by a desire to return America's U.N. policy to what it was during the Administrations of Ronald Reagan and George Bush. Reagan and Bush viewed the U.N. as a useful tool of U.S. foreign policy and supported traditional U.N. peacekeeping efforts in such places as the Middle East, Cambodia, and El Salvador. However, by expanding the U.N. mission in Somalia, the Clinton Administration drifted away from these traditional approaches. The Clinton team wanted to get the U.S. involved in U.N. "nation-building."  This entirely new approach was very different from that pursued by the Bush Administration, which had shown how useful the U.N. could be in establishing military coalitions.<p>

	When not used properly, however, the United Nations inevitably fails. It is this failure -- a failure caused mainly by the Clinton Administration's efforts to expand the missions and activities of the U.N. in places like Somalia and Bosnia -- that is undermining the U.N.'s credibility at home and abroad. In Somalia, for example, the Clinton Administration changed the Bush Administration's limited mission of feeding starving people to "nation-building" in the middle of a bloody civil war. These efforts have done more to discredit the U.N. in the eyes of the American public than anything the congressional majority has done.<p>

	Surely there is something strange about the idea that a healthy skepticism toward a flawed institution is tantamount to isolationism. In fact, the opposite is true: Skepticism is necessary to demonstrate U.S. leadership. The U.S. should not retreat from the U.N., but lead it. Washington should look upon the U.N. as one of many tools in foreign policy, working with and through the U.N. to the extent that it serves the national interest. This is how internationalists such as Ronald Reagan and George Bush thought of the U.N. It is how the way the Clinton Administration should think of it as well.<p>
<h3><center>

<a name="presidential">WHO IS ASSAULTING PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITY?</a></h3></center>

	In his response to the House foreign policy bill, the President accused Members of the House and Senate of launching a "frontal assault on presidential authority" by trying to limit U.S. participation in U.N. peacekeeping operations. Their bills would require that the Administration explain not only how U.S. participation would serve the national interest, but how the U.S. would pay for it. <p>

	At the same time, however, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas has introduced the Peace Powers Act, which would repeal the War Powers Resolution. Representative Henry Hyde of Illinois has proposed an amendment that would do essentially the same. Both efforts are intended to reverse congressional encroachment on the authority of the President to conduct foreign policy and to perform his duties as Commander in Chief.<p>

	These plans to restore presidential authority in foreign policy at the expense of Congress fly in the face of President Clinton's charge of "assaults" on his authority. Why would Congress try to repeal the War Powers Resolution if it is so intent on denying the President his authority to conduct foreign policy?  And why is the Clinton Administration silent on repealing the War Powers Resolution if it is so concerned about presidential prerogatives?  Could it be that the Administration is far more concerned about the impact of congressional actions on the United Nations than it is about presidential prerogatives in foreign policy?<p>

	There is a huge difference between the restrictions imposed by the War Powers Resolution and those found in proposed legislation on the U.N. The War Powers Resolution requires, among other things, that the President withdraw U.S. military forces with sixty days of their deployment if Congress has not voted its approval. This amounts to a congressional fiat and an improper infringement on the prerogatives of the President as Commander in Chief. The President should consult with Congress on force deployments and ask for a declaration of war to fight a major conflict, but he should also have the right to deploy forces in a national emergency to protect American lives and interests. He should not have Congress second-guessing his decision in the middle of a national crisis.<p>

	The situation is -- and should be -- different with respect to the "peace powers" proposed in the House and Senate bills on the United Nations. The House bill would deny funds for U.S. forces placed under U.N. command unless the President can certify that it serves the national interest. Once the President has issued an executive order certifying that it is, he can send the troops on a U.N. mission. If he cannot prove a national interest, he has no business sending U.S. troops. In addition, the President must report on the purpose of the mission, the expected size and composition of the force, the costs of the operation, and the timetable for complete withdrawal of U.S. forces involved. <p>

	Congressional measures with respect to the War Powers Resolution and the United Nations distinguish properly between the commitment of American troops in defense of vital national interests -- which Congress tried to address in the War Powers Resolution -- and their participation in vaguely defined operations at the behest of a global body not subject to the U.S. Constitution. Since peacekeeping deployments are rarely urgent, it is appropriate that the decision to send U.S. troops be made only after the President consults officially with Congress. In more serious national emergencies which risk American lives and vital interests -- i.e., non-peacekeeping contingencies -- the President should have more leeway. Under all circumstances, the President should consult with Congress when deploying troops, and for major conflicts he should ask for a declaration of war, but his hands should not be tied by the War Powers Resolution when deploying troops in non-peacekeeping operations.<p>


<h3><center><a name="conclusion">CONCLUSION</a></h3></center>

	The Clinton Administration's rhetoric about the "isolationist proposals" from Congress is a red herring. The real danger of America's withdrawal from the world comes not from congressional cutbacks in foreign aid or restrictions on U.S. participation in the United Nations, but from the drift and weakness of Clinton's foreign and defense policies. America's credibility has plummeted over the past two years because this Administration lacks a coherent national strategy to deal with the many problems facing the U.S. abroad.  <p>
	The very people the President is tarring with the brush of isolationism are the ones who kept liberal neo-isolationists at bay in the aftermath of the Vietnam War and during the Persian Gulf War. These conservatives were internationalists then, and they remain internationalists to this day. They are ardent supporters of NATO expansion and a strong national defense. Many of them are strong advocates of an open and free international trade system. It is not they, but their critics from the left who will lead America to the back door of isolationism.<p><br>

<h2>RITALIN</h2>
<P>
<blockquote><I>
  
  
The Chuck E Cheese pizza chain bills itself as the place "where a kid   
can be a kid. " Elementary school used to be such a place, but not   
anymore. Nowadays, when a kid acts like a kid, the public schools   
diagnose him as having an attention deficit or hyperactivity disorder.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
  
Remember, when you were a kid, how you never ran out of energy? How   
you could never sit still for more than a few minutes at a time? How your   
mind would race from one subject to the next? How you loved to   
daydream? You had no idea you were suffering from a disease, did you?
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
  
As many as two million children have been diagnosed as having   
Attention Deficit Disorder or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.   
The preferred form of treatment for these alleged disorders is a powerful   
drug called Ritalin -- a Schedule II controlled substance, as are cocaine   
and methadone. The U.S. Department of Education formally recognized   
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder as a handicap in 1991 and made   
federal funds available for local school districts to provide special   
educational and psychological services for children afflicted with the   
normal characteristics of childhood. 
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
  
Needless to say, many school systems liked having extra cash to play   
with, and were perfectly willing to add special physical and mental   
health programs to their ever-growing menu of services if that was what   
would keep the funds flowing from Washington. Goals 2000 has   
provided a convenient umbrella for new programs in which school health   
officials test children for emotional, social, mental, and physical   
disorders -- and, when they deem it necessary, prescribe and administer   
medications such as Ritalin, Valium, and Prozac. New rules allow nurse   
practitioners and physician assistants to prescribe drugs. Goals 2000   
proposals receive funding from the Department of Education, Medicaid,   
Maternal and Child Health block grants, state programs, and private   
foundations. 
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160; 
  
In 1994, the U.S. Department of Education gave the Chesapeake   
Institute of Washington, D.C. the funding to produce two videos called   
Facing the Challenges of Attention Deficit Disorder and One Child in   
Every Classroom. The completed videos included enthusiastic   
endorsements of Ritalin from parents whose children take the drug. A   
PBS documentary subsequently revealed, however, that these same   
parents were board members of a group called Children and Adults with   
Attention Deficit Disorder, which has received cash grants of $900,000   
plus in-kind services from the manufacturer of Ritalin. John Merrow,   
executive producer of the PBS documentary, reported that Ritalin is now   
so plentiful that a black market has developed on the school playground.   
At many junior high schools, Ritalin is the first drug a child experiments   
with. 
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
  
It's bad enough that the public schools have intentionally dumbed down   
their curricula in order to turn our children into intellectual zombies.   
Now they're pinpointing the kids with energy and spunk and drugging   
them into a state of lethargy. Parents of a child who has been diagnosed   
by school personnel as having Attention Deficit Disorder or Attention   
Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder should seek a second opinion.

<title>The Problems With Health Maintenance Organizations -- Duplantier</title>

<h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES</h4>

<i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.<br>

October 2, 1995</i><br><hr>


<h2>The Problems With Health Maintenance Organizations</h2></center><p>

Health maintenance organizations (called HMOs) are growing rapidly. 
And so is the evidence that the managed care they provide is not all it's 
cracked up to be! <p>

According to the September issue of Consumers' Research, "the main 
difficulty with HMOs is the financial arrangement made with doctors." 
That arrangement may include "a fixed amount of money per covered 
patient," as well as "bonuses for delivering care on a frugal basis." Such 
incentives "reward physicians for deferring or withholding care that is 
seen as being too expensive -- in essence pitting the financial interest of 
the doctor against the medical interest of the patient."<p>

Consumers' Research reports that, with HMOs, "the less your doctor 
does for you. the more money he gets to keep." That means that HMOs 
have built-in incentives "against referring you to a specialist authorizing a high-tech procedure. or approving a costly operation. In some HMOs. there may be a review board empowered to deny you such treatment even when your doctor says you need it."<p>

Consumers' Research offers a sampling of "the mounting number of 
press accounts and official studies" indicating that, once you join an 
HMO, "you may receive inadequate care. or be denied some procedure 
that could improve your health or even save your life." A Washington 
Post story from August of last year reports that some doctors believe the 
managed care system "changes the way physicians think about patients 
for the worse and may encourage them to shun patients with high risks or 
expensive health problems." This past August, the Washington Post 
reported on the situation at a San Francisco medical center, where "organ 
transplant specialists have turned down patients who might have been 
given transplants in the past even though they had poor prospects for 
recovery." Without transplants, of course, such patients are doomed.<p>

Last November American Medical News reported the comments of an 
emergency physician in Sacramento regarding "dangerous interference by 
managed care plans" lobbying the state legislature to restrict the scope of 
their coverage. He cited the case of a patient with a possible spine 
fracture whose plan denied authorization for care, and a patient with "an 
externalizing arterial hemorrhage" who was ushered out of an emergency 
room and sent off to a plan physician's office. "There has been a great 
deal of gatekeeper misbehavior and failure to understand emergency 
medical procedures," said the doctor. "That puts patients in a position of 
choosing between their lives and their pocketbooks, even though they are 
insured and these services should be covered."<p>

According to the July 9th New York Times, "hospitals across the country 
report that HMOs are increasingly denying claims for care provided in 
hospital emergency rooms." Early this year, the Department of Health 
and Human Services revealed that up to 25 percent of former HMO 
participants surveyed "said they failed to receive primary care, referrals 
to specialists, and HMO coverage of emergency care they believed they 
needed." The Department found that "chronically ill and disabled 
patients" have expressed "an alarmingly high level of dissatisfaction with 
the care provided by HMOs."<p>

<P>
     President Bill Clinton's decision last week to grant most-
favored-nation (MFN) trading status for China has ended, many hope,
the very difficult debate that the President has had with himself over
the future of U.S.-China relations. Clinton began his term believing
that trade sanctions could pressure China to improve human rights
conditions. But after a year of debilitating debate, he was forced to
reverse his policy of linking trade to human rights.<P>
     He was right to do so. By continuing to grant MFN to China,
Clinton will help advance the $38 billion trading relationship which
the U.S. now enjoys with the world's fastest growing economy.
Moreover, by increasing prosperity in China through greater trade, the
U.S. can help to create the economic freedoms that are the foundation
upon which political freedom will someday emerge.

<P>
THE DAMAGE DONE
<P>
     The main task for President Clinton now is to undo the damage
caused by his confused China policy. Clinton's human rights crusade
against China, and then its reversal, has seriously eroded U.S.
influence in Asia. The problem was summed up neatly in a memo by
Assistant Secretary of State for Asia Winston Lord, who wrote that
Clinton's Asia policy is characterized by an "emerging malaise." Lord
observed that Asians view the U.S. as adopting "tactics that
destabilize relationships which are central to the region's peace and
prosperity." The danger, Lord warned, was that, because of its
confused policies, the U.S. "could subvert our influence and our
interests."<P>
     The roots of Clinton's confusion over China date to the 1992
presidential campaign. At that time he accused then-President George
Bush of "coddling" the tyrants in Beijing, hinting that he might
withdraw MFN status for China. But as President Clinton approached the
annual congressional battle over MFN, he discovered the complexities
of the issue. He created a contradictory policy that was designed to
please human rights advocates while he was approving MFN. In an
Executive Order issued on May 28, 1993, Clinton stipulated that China
had to improve its human rights record in the areas of immigration,
the manufacture and export of prisoner-made goods, the treatment of
prisoners, protecting Tibet, and allowing foreign radio broadcasts in
order to qualify for renewal of MFN in 1994. 
<P>
     Instead of ending the debate, Clinton's decision only inflamed
it. His vaguely worded Executive Order allowed human rights advocates
in Congress to demand a larger share of Clinton's China policy, even
after the July 1993 decision to push for delinking trade and human
rights. The debate even raged inside the Administration, with
embarrassing results for U.S. prestige and credibility in Asia.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher traveled to Beijing in March to
warn Chinese leaders to improve their human rights record. Only two
months before, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen had come to China with
a completely different message, suggesting that cooperation and
communication between the U.S. and China would improve the overall
relationship.
<P>

CLINTON COMES AROUND
<P>
     Clinton began to end this spectacle of confusion last week when
he decided to renew MFN almost without condition. Perhaps the most
important aspect of his decision is philosophical; the President has
now adopted the view that trade relations must be separated from U.S.
political goals with China. Moreover, he has endorsed the view that
increased U.S.-China trade can promote economic freedoms, which in the
long run will spur the growth of political freedoms in China. In
addition, by stating that he wants to end the annual debilitating
congressional debate over MFN, Clinton is strengthening the
President's authority over foreign policy. This step alone will help
to reassure Asian friends and adversaries that Clinton plans to get a
better grip on foreign policy. 

<P>
UNDOING THE DAMAGE
<P>
     But granting MFN status to China alone is not enough to undo the
damage caused to U.S. leadership, prestige, and credibility in Asia.
The Administration should construct a new China policy that serves the
totality of American interests. Now that Clinton has reversed his
policy, he should move quickly to exact a price of Beijing's
cooperation in two areas of critical concern to the U.S. They are: 
<P>
Ending North Korea's nuclear threat. Clinton should now press Beijing
    to cooperate fully with Washington, Seoul, and Tokyo to end North
    Korea's nuclear weapons program. North Korea's nuclear program is
    now the greatest threat to peace in Asia, and so far, Beijing has
    been reluctant to pressure its ally in Pyongyang. One reason for
    this reluctance has been Clinton's MFN policy. Now that this
    irritant in U.S.-Chinese relations has been removed, Beijing
    should be more cooperative on North Korea.
<P>
Better treatment for Hong Kong and Taiwan. Clinton also should press
    Beijing to allow the citizens of Hong Kong to establish democratic
    institutions that help protect Hong Kong's freedoms. Clinton
    should explain to the Chinese that failure to do so will undermine
    international confidence in Hong Kong as a business center, and
    thus will jeopardize China's economic growth. In addition, the
    President should press Beijing to drop its objections to allowing
    Taiwan to join international organization like the General
    Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the International Monetary Fund,
    the World Bank, and the United Nations. Clinton should explain
    that Taiwan can make an important contribution to these
    organizations that China cannot.

<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
     The spectacle of Clinton's confused and incoherent China policy
should never be repeated. America cannot afford to allow such policy
confusion to undermine its leadership in Asia or in other regions. 
<P>
     There is an important lesson to learn from Clinton's flip-flop on
China policy: There is no substitute for presidential leadership.
Being President entails making politically difficult choices to insure
that all of America's interests in Asia are protected. On critical
issues such as relations with China, the President must constantly
navigate among competing demands such as human rights, trade, and
potential regional conflicts. Clinton's failure to decide on a
balanced China policy last year was the principal cause of this year's
embarrassing policy reversal.
<P>
     Now that he has admitted his failure, the President can begin
restoring some of the credibility which he -- and the country -- have
lost over the past year.

<h2>Student Rights</h2>
<i><blockquote>
<P>
The education establishment is kicking up a ruckus over a bill   
that received nearly unanimous support in the House of   
Representatives. They're determined to make sure that this   
sensible legislation doesn't get past the Senate.
</I></Blockquote><P>


The Family Privacy Protection Act would prohibit schools   
from questioning minors about political or religious   
affiliations or beliefs, mental or psychological problems,   
sexual behavior or attitudes, illegal or self-incriminating   
behavior, or their opinions of other family members --   
without first obtaining the permission of their parents. The   
need for such a law is clear when schools make a practice of   
bypassing the informed consent of parents to distribute   
condoms to adolescents and subject even younger children to   
coercive physical exams.  
 <p> 
The widespread use of intrusive surveys and questionnaires   
in the public school classroom started in the mid-l 970s and   
led to the passage of the first Protection of Pupil Rights   
Amendment in 1978, sponsored by former university   
president and Senator Sam Hayakawa. The public school   
establishment was powerful enough to prevent regulations   
from being written until President Ronald Reagan demanded   
them in 1984. National Education Association agents in the   
Department of Education and public school administrators   
nationwide still managed to thwart the enforcement of this   
law.  
  <p>
Take, for example, the infamous 149-question survey which   
has been given, despite parental objections, to nearly all 6th,   
9th and 12th grade Minnesota pupils. Parents protested the   
survey's invasion of privacy, as well as its underlying   
assumption that illegal drug use, promiscuity, and suicidal   
tendencies are normal teenage behavior. They also objected   
to way in which the survey encouraged pupils to inform on   
their parents.  
  <p>
Among other things, the survey inquired about the drinking   
habits of family members, to ascertain if their use of alcohol   
had "repeatedly caused family, health, job or legal problems."   
Many questions conveyed the notion that the majority of   
teenagers are using illegal drugs. Some questions interrogated   
the child about his religion. Certain questions -- particularly   
those relating to severe depression and attempted suicide --   
were undoubtedly traumatic for some children. The survey   
also sought to determine the sexual experience and practices   
of the students. It shouldn't need to be said -- though it   
obviously does -- that public schools have no business   
requiring children to answer any of these nosy questions   
without prior written parental consent.  
  <p>
The purpose of the Family Privacy Protection Act is to   
extend the scope of the law to all surveys and questionnaires   
that are federally funded, not merely those funded by the   
Department of Education, and also to remove some vague   
language that has enabled the public schools to circumvent   
the law for the past ten years. The Senate will no doubt be   
besieged by self-styled researchers whose prurient interest in   
the sexuality of children is facilitated by unfettered access to   
our nation's schools. Let's hope our Senators recognize that   
these schools exist only to educate our children -- not to   
provide a steady supply of guinea pigs for behavioral   
scientists.

<title>Duplantier: UNION TACTICS -- 2/27/96</title>

<h2>Union Tactics</h2>


<i><blockquote>
"The purpose of all cartels is to raise prices above competitive levels and 
to redistribute income from consumers to cartel members. When unions 
successfully raise the price of labor above free-market levels, much of the 
employers' higher labor costs are passed on to consumers."
</blockquote></i>

<P>
Trade unions have often been described as "cartels of workers which 
collude to push their wages above free-market levels," observes Thomas 
DiLorenzo in a recent issue of The Freeman, the monthly journal of the 
Foundation for Economic Education. "Competition and the entry of new 
(and lower-priced) competitors are the bane of all cartels." That's why 
unions strive "to block competition from nonunion workers through 
special-interest legislation and regulation, and by committing acts of 
violence and intimidation against nonunion workers."


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Warehouse clubs, hypermarkets, and nonunion chains make grocery 
union organizers see red. The avowed objective of these organizers is "to 
either raise the prices of nonunion grocery stores or drive those stores 
into bankruptcy." DiLorenzo observes that "driving one's competitors out 
of business may be good for aspiring monopolists, but is bad for 
consumers and those workers" whose companies are targeted for 
destruction. "Low-income Americans will be hurt the most, as they 
always are when prices rise." With their typically low profit margins, 
grocery chains are especially vulnerable to "union harassment 
campaigns."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The preferred tactic among grocery union organizers is pressuring a 
company "to accept a union without ever permitting its employees to vote 
on whether or not they want a union," says DiLorenzo. "This is a stark 
admission that, at least in the grocery industry, unionization cannot 
succeed if employees are allowed to vote on whether or not they want a 
union. Extortion has replaced organizing." Unable to win a fair election, 
union organizers "intimidate and threaten to extort employers until they 
sign a contract with the union without holding a union certification 
election."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
DiLorenzo contends that the "flexible labor relations" essential to a 
company's efficiency are "rarely -- if ever -- found in unionized firms. 
Rigid job descriptions and restrictive work practices ratchet up costs and 
prices at unionized grocery chains, all to the detriment of the consumer. 
These higher costs and prices also threaten the job security of unionized 
employees who work for uncompetitive businesses."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The American workplace is "awash in regulations, most of which are 
impossible for mere humans to understand, let alone comply with." 
Unions have "taken advantage of this fact to impose regulatory costs on 
nonunion firms." DiLorenzo says that "regulation is so out of control that 
any business person in America, at any one time, is most certainly 
'guilty' of noncompliance with at least some regulations." He charges 
that unions "use regulation as a tool for extorting 'concessions' from 
nonunion employers, [including] recognition of the union without a 
representation election." DiLorenzo concludes that "deregulation of labor 
relations -- and of the economy in general -- is sorely needed if the 
American economy is to prosper."

<h2>Americorps: Voluntarism?</h2> <br></center>
 
When Congress tried to defund Americorps last year, Democrats accused  
Republicans of wanting to destroy "voluntarism." But what kind of  
voluntarism is it when the volunteer gets paid, and handsomely?  <p>
  
  
High school graduates who defer college for a year and enroll in  
Americorps instead "receive a healthy stipend and a $4,700 voucher for  
college education," reports Robert Sirico, president of the Acton Institute   
for the Study of Religion and Liberty, in a recent newspaper editorial. He  
cites an audit by the General Accounting Office that pegged the cost of  
the 20,000 Americorps "volunteers" at nearly $31.500 each, "which  
works out to be pretty good pay at taxpayers' expense."  <p>
  
Sirico suggests that "voluntarism" may not be the right word for such  
activity. "One view of voluntarism is that it is uncompensated labor," he  
observes. "People volunteer at a soup kitchen or in local service clubs.   
Well, by that definition, Americorps is not voluntary. Eliminate the  
incentives of the stipend and the education voucher and then we'll  
discover just how 'voluntary' the program is." <p> 
  
Sirico is willing to consider other definitions. He notes that voluntarism  
may be construed to mean "doing something because of benevolent  
personal desire," and concedes that Americorps workers may be   
motivated by good intentions. "But this does not set them apart from  
other workers." he insists. "Most entrepreneurs love their work. They also  
desire the happiness of others. They try to give people something they  
want, whether it is a good meal, quality clothing, sturdy housing, or  
reliable letter delivery. Somehow, though, capitalist acts are not supposed  
to qualify as 'voluntary' in this sense."  <p>
  
Suppose "voluntarism" simply means "anything that is not coerced." Still,  
we have a problem. "In a market economy, the jobs of just about  
everyone pass this test. No one is forced to take a job," says Sirico. "Most   
people face an array of alternatives of how to use their talents in the  
market." Sirico insists that "the very existence of our social safety net  
means workers in America volunteer to be responsible people, to earn a   
living by the sweat of their brows."  <p>
  
No, none of these definitions will do. "The only trait of Americorps that  
distinguishes it from charity, jobs, or entrepreneurship in the private  
sector," Sirico concludes, "is that it is sponsored and run by government.   
This seems to be the message of Americorps: You're not really working  
for the social good unless you are working under government guidance."  
Sirico finds this message disturbing. "It teaches young people a false  
notion about trade," he says, the notion being that "working for a  
business, for profit. is somehow ignoble." Americorps "forcibly siphons  
money from the public through taxation" and pays its volunteers "a   
hefty sum" while vaunting its moral superiority. <p> 
  
Sirico has some sage advice for the idealistic youth: "If serving others is  
what you desire, don't be bought off by a government program. Try  
something voluntary that is personally challenging, socially beneficial,   
and doesn't cost the taxpayers one dime."  <p>

<title>Duplantier: Colorado's Amendment 2 -- 7/8/96</title>

<h2>Colorado's Amendment 2</h2>

<i>The Constitution of the United States says nothing about homosexuality. 
Under the 10th Amendment, therefore, any efforts to regulate 
manifestations of this conduct should be within the province of the states 
and the people.</i>
<p>
In his vigorous dissent from the Supreme Court's recent decision 
overturning Colorado's Amendment 2, Justice Antonin Scalia described 
the statewide ban on laws providing special treatment for homosexuals as 
"a modest attempt . . . to preserve traditional sexual mores against the 
efforts of a politically powerful minority." Scalia argued that the Court's 
ruling contradicts its own 1986 decision upholding Georgia's anti-
sodomy law "and places the prestige of this institution behind the 
proposition that opposition to homosexuality is as reprehensible as racial 
or religious bias."
<p>
The High Court ignored the question of "whether there was a legitimate 
rational basis for the substance of the constitutional amendment -- for the 
prohibition of special protection for homosexuals. It is unsurprising that 
the Court avoids discussion of this question," says Scalia, "since the 
answer is so obviously yes. The case most relevant to the issue," he says, 
"is not even mentioned in the court's opinion: In Bowers v. Hardwick, we 
held that the Constitution does not prohibit what virtually all states had 
done from the founding of the Republic until very recent years -- making 
homosexual conduct a crime." Scalia points out the obvious 
contradiction: "If it is constitutionally permissible for a state to make 
homosexual conduct criminal, surely it is constitutionally permissible for 
a state to enact other laws merely disfavoring homosexual conduct."
<p>
Scalia argues that nothing in the Constitution "prohibits what Colorado 
has done here. But the case for Colorado is much stronger than that. What 
it has done is not only unprohibited, but eminently reasonable." He 
recalls how three Colorado cities "enacted ordinances that listed 'sexual 
orientation' as an impermissible ground for discrimination, equating the 
moral disapproval of homosexual conduct with racial and religious 
bigotry." Conceding that "homosexuals are as entitled to use the legal 
system for reinforcement of their moral sentiments as are the rest of 
society," Scalia insists nevertheless that "they are subject to being 
countered by lawful, democratic countermeasures as well. That is where 
Amendment 2 came in. It put directly, to all the citizens of the state, the 
question: Should homosexuality be given special protection? They 
answered no."
<p>
Scalia contends that the Supreme Court decision overturning Colorado's 
Amendment 2 "has no foundation in American constitutional law, and 
barely pretends to. The people of Colorado have adopted an entirely 
reasonable provision which does not even disfavor homosexuals in any 
substantive sense, but merely denies them preferential treatment. 
Amendment 2 is designed to prevent piecemeal deterioration of the 
sexual morality favored by a majority of Coloradans, and is not only an 
appropriate means to that legitimate end, but a means that Americans 
have employed before. Striking it down is an act not of judicial judgment, 
but of political will."

<h2>Moscow Bound</h2>


<i><blockquote>


 
With over 1000 pages, including notes and index, Moscow Bound, by  
Vietnam veteran John M.G. Brown, is the most thoroughly documented  
and comprehensive book ever written about American soldiers who  
disappeared in Soviet captivity from 1918 onward. It's not available in  
bookstores, however, we offer the following excerpt. 
 </blockquote></i>
<P>
"American and Allied war prisoners of 1918-1920 were treated [by the  
Soviets] as potential political assets to be exploited for use in a  
worldwide propaganda war. For the first time, the United States was  
confronted with an ideological enemy that held certain American  
prisoners of war secretly, to gain the use of their minds in understanding  
the enemies of Bolshevism, and which also held other U.S. prisoners of  
war and civilians openly, for use as hostages to gain diplomatic  
concessions and ransom. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"The official American response to this situation in 1919 was to 'classify'  
all information about the existence of such prisoners of war, or missing  
men suspected of being held prisoner, as a state secret. The public was  
not allowed to know this fact, which resulted in many misconceptions  
about Soviet methods and intentions. Admission of their existence would  
have revealed the impossibility of recovering the prisoners without  
resorting to another major war, less than a year after the 1918  
Armistice.... 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"At the end of World War II, as the Red Army overran eastern Europe,  
hundreds of thousands of western Allied and American prisoners of war  
and interned civilians were liberated by the Soviets, but many thousands  
disappeared while under Russian control. Faced once again with  
impossible Soviet demands for diplomatic concessions, financial aid and  
other conditions for the release of prisoners they publicly denied holding,  
President Harry Truman chose once again to avoid a military  
confrontation so soon after the Second World War. The entire body of  
information concerning U.S. POWs and MIAs, who had been in eastern  
European German POW camps when the Soviets took control, was again  
'classified' in the name of national security, and remained secret for more  
than four decades to come. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"The emboldened Soviets, under dictator Josef Stalin and his successors,  
thenceforth kidnapped American military and civilian personnel,  
including aircrews from U.S. Cold War reconnaissance missions, almost  
with impunity, secure in the knowledge that an unspoken 'wink and nod  
diplomacy' existed between the superpowers: that prisoners thus captured  
would remain secret, and unless publicly acknowledged, were 'gone  
forever.' The results of the Korean War further indicated the United  
States was willing to abandon U.S. prisoners of war known to have been  
alive in Soviet, Chinese and North Korean control, rather than submit to  
blackmail demands that would establish a precedent that the United  
States was willing to 'trade in human lives.' President Dwight D.  
Eisenhower, the former U.S. commander in Europe during World War  
II, this time made the decision that the families of POWs and MIAs held  
in China and Russia should not be informed about the fate of their loved  
ones, since it was then believed that the KGB would never release  
them...."

<h2>
 States Lead Reform, Part II
</h2>

<i>Don't be frustrated by the slow pace of political reform in our nation 's 
capital. Take heart in the dramatic progress being made by our sovereign 
states.</i>
<p>
"In 1995, while Republicans in Congress were debating a $500-per-child 
tax credit and cutting the capital-gains tax in half, 17 states with 
Republican governors cut taxes," reports Grover Norquist of Americans 
for Tax Reform. Writing in the June issue of Policy Review, Norquist 
notes that, last year, "12 Republican governors took on one of the fiercest 
Democratic special-interest groups -- the trial lawyers -- and won. While 
Congress was only able to enact a very limited reform of frivolous 
stockholder lawsuits, Republican governors made significant strides."
<p>
Tax reform and tort reform are just two of the many historic changes now 
occurring throughout these United States. "The latest Republican anti-
crime agenda has made little headway in Washington, where the Senate 
has failed to act on a package of bills passed by the House," says 
Norquist. "Meanwhile, Republican governors led the way in enacting 
'truth-in-sentencing' laws that require violent criminals to serve at least 85 
percent of their sentences. " A majority of states have also passed 
legislation allowing for the carrying of concealed handguns.
<p>
The states are not waiting for Washington to reform welfare and health 
care, either. "Although Bill Clinton has vetoed the Republican welfare-
reform bill," says Norquist, "Republican governors continue to 
experiment with efforts to free individuals from the dependency of 
welfare." Clinton may have vetoed Medicare reform and Medical Savings 
Accounts, but five Republican governors "shepherded Medical Savings 
Accounts through their state legislatures. These forays into market-based 
health care will have a significant effect on overall medical costs and 
insurance premiums," says Norquist, "contributing substantially to the 
debate in Washington, and perhaps eventually ending the impasse. And, 
when Congress does finally enact reforms in Medicare, the states will 
already have in place the mechanisms to take full advantage of it."
<p>
The states are also outpacing Congress in providing protection for 
property rights. "In March 1995, the U.S. House of Representatives 
passed legislation recognizing that the Takings Clause of the Constitution 
is invoked when government actions destroy or reduce the value of 
private property, not just when the property is physically occupied by 
government. That legislation has not seen final action, of course," notes 
Norquist, but that hasn't stopped the states from pushing ahead. 
"Beginning in 1992, the states began passing legislation protecting the 
property rights of their citizens. To date, 23 states have enacted 
legislation of varying strength, and more efforts are under way."
<p>
Our sovereign states seem to be asserting themselves once again. This 
bodes well for America. "All the Republican governors are traveling in 
the same direction and showing real courage in tackling the special 
interests of the old establishment order," says Grover Norquist. They've 
declared war on the welfare state, and they're not taking any prisoners.

<h2>Privatizing Prisons</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
Privately run correctional facilities are cheaper, and better 
managed, than public prisons. There's only one reason there aren't 
more of them in America: politics.
</i></blockquote>

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Privately owned or operated prisons "are widespread throughout the 
United States," observes Steven Loux, a policy analyst for the 
Pennsylvania House of Representatives. In a report published by the 
Key State's Commonwealth Foundation, Loux presents evidence showing 
that "such private facilities are advantageous to governments because 
they save a great deal of money, perhaps more than 10 percent per year 
in operating costs as compared to equivalent public facilities." Not 
only that, but "private prisons meet, if not surpass, the quality of 
services for prisoners and the protection to the general public 
provided by public prisons."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Loux argues that "government is simply not capable of delivering, 
running, and regulating services either as efficiently or as 
effectively as are private firms." For one thing, government does not 
have the benefit of the price system to help guide its decisions. 
Conversely, the private sector is not subject to the political 
considerations that often militate against cost-effective decisions in 
state bureaucracies. "Since political actors do not suffer economic 
pain from operating inefficient businesses, unlike private actors, the 
temptation to substitute the goals of politically influential players 
for cost-effectiveness is overwhelming," says Loux. "The authorities, 
the executive and the legislature, use their monopoly power over the 
delivery of prison services to assist certain ends -- those of 
politicians, bureaucrats, and prison employees."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Even though government itself does not respond automatically to profit 
considerations, it can take advantage of the profit-orientation of 
private-sector suppliers. "Profit can be used to discipline private 
firms in ways that it cannot discipline public bureaucracies," says 
Loux. "In fact, market competition can push private firms to not only 
meet government guidelines, but even exceed them." Such are the 
wonders of renewable contracts. "State bureaucracies cannot be fired," 
Loux laments, "but private firms that contract with the state can."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The reason that private prisons are more economical to operate than 
public facilities is not because they pay their employees less. In 
fact, the evidence indicates that "private prison firms generally do 
offer equivalent salaries and benefits for individual employees." Loux 
cites "significantly different benefit programs" and "lower absentee 
rates among private employees" as two of the cost advantages of 
private prisons. "Economies of scale," he adds, "can play a role in 
reducing the cost of private prisons. Private firms can purchase in 
bulk for their entire operation, and can do so with less bureaucratic 
involvement in comparison to public agencies."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There are other reasons, as well. Loux notes that "government 
agencies, in their desire to maintain their level of functioning in 
the upcoming year, want to prevent any decrease in their funding. 
Consequently, any surplus funding at the end of the year must be spent 
in some way." Also, "private firms, because they can be terminated and 
because they face competition, have the incentive to cater their 
operations to government cost standards."

<h2> Welfare Reform/MI & MA</h2>


<i><blockquote>


Why does private charity work so much better than public assistance? 
It's because the private benefactor expects to see results from his 
almsgiving. .</blockquote></i>

Private poverty-relief programs emphasize "character-building, one-on-
one mentoring, and a spiritual dimension," says Lawrence Reed of the 
Mackinac Center for Public Policy in Midland, Michigan. Government 
relief programs, on the other hand, generally promote the personal 
imperfections that perpetuate poverty. In the April issue of "Alternatives 
in Philanthropy," published by the Capital Research Center, Reed reports 
that his home state has drastically revamped its welfare program. 
"Michigan abruptly ended the General Assistance program for able-
bodied, childless adults in October 1991 and adopted a 'social contract,' 
whereby welfare recipients are expected to seek work, go to school, or 
perform community service in exchange for benefits," says Reed. "Nearly 
25 percent of Michigan's AFDC recipients are now working. This is 
three times the national average."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Reed thinks the Governor of Michigan is committed to "further reducing 
the role of government and making welfare a largely private initiative." 
He notes that "a growing number of private initiatives to help the poor 
are already underway, some of which sprouted in direct response to the 
state's abolition of General Assistance." Welfare as it currently operates 
"has produced such disastrous consequences that it's hard to imagine 
how a radical overhaul could make things worse," says Larry Reed. "If 
we revitalize the American ideals of charity and self-help, we might end 
up spending less for success than the government now spends for 
failure."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the same issue of "Alternatives in Philanthropy," David Tuerck of the 
Beacon Hill Institute in Boston reports that Massachusetts began its own 
welfare overhaul in 1995. "Able-bodied welfare recipients whose 
youngest children have entered school must work at least 20 hours per 
week in a job or community service program," notes Tuerck. "Parents 
under age 18 must live with a responsible adult or in a supervised group 
home. They must stay in school or in a GED program." They receive no 
additional benefits for children born after August 1996.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Though supportive of these reforms, Tuerck insists that the main 
problem with welfare is the way it is funded. "Under the existing system, 
taxpayers send their money to Washington, where most flows into a 
welfare bureaucracy and only a fraction eventually reaches the pockets of 
the poor." Tuerck would retain taxpayer funding of welfare, but make it 
taxpayer-controlled as well. He proposes that "individual taxpayers, both 
itemizers and non-itemizers, receive a 100 percent federal tax credit for 
contributions to eligible charities for up to 25 percent of their federal tax 
liability." David Tuerck argues that such a tax credit would not only 
increase private charitable giving beyond the level of the current public 
dole, but would also guarantee that a far greater percentage of those alms 
actually reach the intended recipients.

<H3><I> DEFENSE FREEZE WOULD HARM NATIONAL SECURITY </I></H3>

Backgrounder Update #244<br>
March 31, 1995<br>
(Updating Backgrounder Update No.  242, "Clinton's Defense Budget Falls Far Short Again," March 7, 1995)<br>

</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>

     On March 19, the Chairman of the House Budget Committee,
Representative John Kasich of Ohio, appeared on NBC News' Sunday talk
show "Meet the Press."  When asked about defense spending, he suggested
that he might be willing to support a freeze on defense budget outlays over
the next five years.  This would mean that defense spending would not be
adjusted for inflation, which would result in around a 15 percent real
reduction in spending over five years.  Such a freeze, if it were to become
the official proposal of the Budget Committee, would be alarming.  It
would, in fact, harm U.S.  national security.  A defense freeze would not
even fund President Bill Clinton's proposed military force, which most
experts agree will not be able to win two regional wars "nearly
simultaneously" as advertised in the Pentagon's "bottom-up" review.  The
inevitable result of a defense freeze would be the reduction of U.S.  military
commitments overseas and the inability to defend U.S.  national security
interests. 
<P>
      It becomes clear, upon examination of the facts about the defense
budget and national security, that a defense freeze that fails to account for
inflation is based on erroneous assumptions.  Policymakers need to be
apprised of these facts in order to make sound judgments about the level of
defense spending this nation needs.
<P>
     FACT #1:  The currently estimated budget authority for defense
in fiscal year 1995, in real terms, will be 35 percent below what it was
ten years ago.
<P>
     When it comes to contributing toward deficit reduction, the defense
program gave at the office.  No other broad category of spending can make
this claim.  Under proposed Clinton budgets, entitlement spending will
increase by 38 percent and domestic discretionary spending by 12 percent
in real terms, while defense will decline by 35 percent during the 1990s. 
Proponents of a defense freeze apparently think that the Clinton approach
is on target because a defense freeze would result in an outlay level for
defense in fiscal year 2000 that is only one percent higher than the
Administration's.  While advocates of a defense freeze would spend more
than Clinton on defense in the next five years, they may settle for Clinton
levels in the years after the five-year period.  The implication is inescapable: 
If a defense freeze were approved, the Republican majority in Congress will
have settled for a long-range national defense strategy defined by a
Democratic President.
<P>

FACT #2:  The Clinton Administration's defense budget underfunds its
own defense program by over $100 billion.
<P>
     The General Accounting Office (GAO) released a study last year
estimating that the Clinton Administration's defense program for fiscal years
1995-1999 is underfunded by $150 billion in budget authority.  Several
months earlier, The Heritage Foundation estimated the shortfall at roughly
$100 billion.  Estimates for fiscal years 1996-2000 reveal the same general
level of shortfall.  Since a defense freeze would not make up for these
shortfalls, its proponents must accept Clinton's Bottom-Up Review at its
word or admit that the defense freeze is not enough.  But no reputable
defense analyst believes the Bottom-Up Review program is fully funded. 
Therefore, the only available course will be to cut weapons, force structure,
and readiness in the outyears as it becomes clear that there is not enough
money to pay for the force. 
<P>
      What programs are proponents of a defense freeze willing to cut
from the Bottom-Up Review program?  How far down are they willing to
go to accommodate a defense freeze?  Will they reduce the Army to fewer
than the equivalent of 15 divisions the Clinton Administration says is
needed?  Will they reduce the Air Force to fewer than the 20 tactical fighter
wings recommended in the Bottom-Up Review?  Do they favor a Navy with
fewer than the 346 ships recommended by the Bottom-Up Review?  These
are the practical implications of the defense freeze ideal, as they are of the
Clinton Administration's proposal.  Given the Clinton defense budget's $100
billion shortfall, force structure is certain to be scaled back if the budget
remains at current levels.  The defense freeze ultimately will lead a
Republican Congress to accept a smaller and weaker military than even the
Clinton Administration claims it wants.
<P>
FACT #3:  The Department of Defense has cut over one million
personnel in the last ten years.
<P>
     The Pentagon has reduced its personnel by about 25 percent since
1985.  This includes both civilian and military employees.  Active-duty
military personnel alone have been reduced by an average of over 5,000
persons per month over the last ten years.  No other federal government
agency has shed its employees at such a rate.  Often ridiculed as a bloated
bureaucracy, the Pentagon actually has been shrinking rapidly, and this has
led to the very efficiencies Kasich and others charge need to be instituted
at the Department of Defense.  The result:  25 percent fewer people now are
performing national security tasks in a world where the threat has changed
but America's global commitments remain undiminished.
<P>
FACT #4:  By the end of the current fiscal year, the military force
structure will be reduced by 30 percent from 1988 levels.
<P>
     Just as military personnel levels have been reduced, so has the size
of the armed forces.  The Army fielded 28 divisions at the end of fiscal
1988; by the end of fiscal 1995, it will retain only 20 division equivalents. 
Whereas the Air Force possessed almost 38 tactical fighter wings in 1988,
it now is down to around 20 wings.  The Navy had a fleet of 566 ships at
the end of fiscal 1988; by the end of fiscal 1995, it will have only 373
ships. 
<P>
      To be sure, the end of the Cold War required reductions of force
levels, but to go any farther is to deny this nation the ability to win the wars
of the post-Cold War era.  The shrinkage has been so severe that many even
doubt the planned force can fulfill the Clinton Administration's assigned
mission of fighting and winning two overlapping major regional conflicts. 
Lawmakers and Administration officials alike should declare officially that
the post-Cold War demobilization is over and that America needs to think
more seriously about the kinds of military forces it needs to maintain its
strength and military commitments abroad.
<P>
FACT #5:  A defense freeze could result in a 15 percent loss of buying
power by military personnel at the end of the decade.
<P>
     Since a defense freeze would bar adjustments for inflation, the
Pentagon would be faced with a choice:  Either cut military pay, which will
not be adjusted for inflation, or pay for salary increases out of other
accounts, such as readiness or procurement.  If pay were not adjusted for
inflation for five years, the nation's soldiers and sailors would lose 15
percent of their purchasing power.  The Clinton Administration tried to
forego a military pay adjustment in 1994, but Congress refused.  The same
thing would happen again if the Pentagon, trying to accommodate a defense
budget freeze, froze military pay.  Faced with congressional opposition, the
Pentagon simply would raid other accounts for money.
<P>
FACT #6:  Procurement funding has been reduced by over 70 percent
in real terms since 1985.
<P>
     Proponents of a defense freeze may believe that they can increase
military pay by cutting procurement funding.  Indeed, Chairman Kasich
talked about procurement reform in the context of possible savings during
his "Meet the Press" interview.  While the Chairman is correct in asserting
that there is a need for procurement reform, it is not wise to pay for salary
increases by taking funding away from procurement accounts.  Put simply,
the turnip of procurement already has been bled dry.  Procurement funding
has been reduced by 70 percent since 1985; another 10 percent would
sentence the military to continuing to buy new weapons in extremely limited
numbers throughout the next five years.  For example, the Navy procured
29 ships in 1985; in fiscal 1996, it will procure only seven.  A defense
freeze means the Navy will purchase no more than this number of ships
annually.
<P>
FACT #7:  A defense freeze would deny any new defense initiatives.
<P>
     Many in Congress do not consider the Clinton defense program the
last word on national security.  They wish to support new initiatives that the
Clinton Administration either has not proposed or has opposed.  One such
initiative is the development and deployment of a national missile defense
system.  A defense freeze would leave no room for such initiatives.  If the
defense budget were frozen at current levels, the nation would not be able
to build an effective defense against ballistic missile attack.
<P>
Conclusion
<P>
     The Department of Defense should not be criticized for contributing
to the budget crisis.  In fact, it should be hailed as a model for deficit
reduction.  If only the Department of Housing and Urban Development or
the Department of Health and Human Services were reducing its personnel
by 25 percent.  The nation need not spend more than is necessary on
national security, but it must at least spend the minimum.  To do otherwise
is an abdication of the single most important constitutional duty of the
federal government -- to provide for the national defense.

<a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a><br>
<hr>

<P>




A year ago, the United States had a clear vision of where it was going in Latin America. The U.S. 
was dedicated to spreading free trade throughout the Western Hemisphere by expanding the North 
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). This vision has all but disappeared in the eyes of the 
Clinton Administration. Bent on cluttering trade bills with environmental and labor restrictions, the 
President has thrown up obstacles to the rapid accession of Chile to NAFTA, contrary to his own 
repeated promises. The result:  NAFTA expansion has stalled.
<p>
Some in Congress want to approve a "fast-track" trade bill this year, but they do not want the 
environmental and labor restrictions demanded by Clinton.   On September 21, 1995, the House 
Ways and Means Committee reported out a measure that would renew fast-track negotiating 
authority for five years.   The Clinton Administration immediately announced that it would not 
support the bill, effectively blocking its approval by Congress. Without the President's support, no 
Democrats will vote for fast track, and Republican leaders in the House and Senate will not bring 
fast track to a floor vote if the bill does not enjoy solid bipartisan support. Making matters even 
more difficult, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-KS) has come out against extending fast track 
authority, arguing that President Clinton has failed "to explain to the American people why we need 
yet another trade agreement at this time."   A two-year delay in extending NAFTA to Chile would 
hurt U.S. economic interests in South America and diminish America's stature in Latin America.
<p>
If fast track is not renewed, and Chile's accession to NAFTA is pushed back two years, the biggest 
loser will be the United States. Without fast track legislation, the U.S. has nothing to offer Latin 
America. Without fast track, the U.S. cannot negotiate any agreements to expand NAFTA. In this 
vacuum, others such as Brazil will take the lead in shaping the future course of trade liberalization 
in South America, the U.S. will lose its trade privileges in the region, and the dream of a 
hemispheric free trade zone will be dead.   With fast track legislation, however, Chile's accession to 
NAFTA in 1996 will be practically assured, and the U.S. will retain its competitive edge in South 
America's trade liberalization, benefiting U.S. exports and jobs. To ensure that the U.S. continues to 
lead the process of hemispheric trade expansion, the U.S. should:
<p><ul>
<LI>Renew fast-track negotiating authority in 1995. 1997 is too long to wait to acquire this 
indispensable tool to expand NAFTA.
<p>
<li> Extend NAFTA to Chile in 1996. Chile's membership in NAFTA would be a reaffirmation of 
U.S. leadership in creating a Free Trade Area of the Americas. Other Latin American countries are 
following the situation carefully. If the U.S. fails to honor its pledge to Chile, these countries may 
lose faith in America's commitment to hemispheric trade expansion. 
<p>
<li> Avoid trade sanctions. The use of trade sanctions to pressure America's trading partners to open 
up their markets to U.S. exports rarely succeeds. Trade disputes between the U.S. and other 
countries should be settled by the World Trade Organization (WTO) of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
<p>
<li> Deal separately with issues extraneous to free trade. When policies and practices relating to labor, 
the environment, corruption, and bribery reduce market opportunities for U.S. exports, separate 
agreements may be negotiated and included with trade agreements whose implementation qualifies 
for fast track. However, trade sanctions should never form part of the enforcement mechanisms for 
such agreements.
<p>
<li> Spread the benefits of free trade to the Caribbean Basin. A congressional bill, the Caribbean Basin 
Trade Security Act, would grant the small countries of the Caribbean Basin the same access to the 
American market that Mexico has under NAFTA.
</ul><p><a name="chile">
ADMIT CHILE TO NAFTA NOW 
<p>
Chile is the benchmark against which the rest of Latin America will measure U.S. commitment to 
hemispheric trade expansion. If Chile's entry into NAFTA is pushed back to 1997, NAFTA will 
lose credibility. American policymakers should realize that postponing Chile's admission to 
NAFTA until 1997 could sideline the United States from playing a leading role in South American 
trade liberalization for as long as two years.
<p>
Chile has long been ready to join NAFTA. It has the strongest economy in Latin America. For the 
past 11 years, the Chilean economy has grown at an average annual rate of 6.3 percent. Inflation has 
been reduced to as low as 7.5 percent, and unemployment has been brought down to 5.5 percent. 
Chile has been reducing its tariffs unilaterally since the mid-1970s. The average tariff is now 11 
percent. Chile's tax structure is efficient and provides a stable income flow to the treasury, as well 
as a positive incentive to increase domestic savings, which were equivalent to about 25 percent of 
GDP in 1994. These savings underpin investment levels equivalent to 27 percent of GDP and are an 
important factor in the country's economic and financial stability. 
<p>
As ready and willing as Chile is to join NAFTA, nothing can be done unless Congress gives the 
President "fast-track" authority to negotiate a trade agreement without the encumbrance of 
congressional amendments. Without fast track, Chile will give up its bid to join NAFTA and look 
elsewhere. Free trade in South America is very competitive. The U.S. is an important player in 
South America, but so are Brazil, Chile, the European Union, and Japan. Brazil plans to consolidate 
Mercosur  before giving serious consideration to joining NAFTA. Mercosur already has signed a 
framework trade agreement with the European Union. Meanwhile, Chile is negotiating an associate 
status with Mercosur and by 1997 is likely to sign an agreement with the European Union, upgrade 
its existing bilateral trade agreement with Mexico, and wrap up an agreement with Canada, which 
is keenly interested in Chile's enormous mining potential. Moreover, as a member of the forum for 
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), Chile is also exploring opportunities for free trade 
agreements with Asian countries, including Japan. Argentina wants to join NAFTA, but if Chile is 
spurned, Argentine President Carlos Menem may start looking elsewhere as well. In South 
America, no one will wait for the U.S. to catch up with the Latin American train of free trade.
<p>
<a name="trade"></a>
PUTTING NAFTA EXPANSION BACK ON TRACK
<p>
For want of a nail, goes the old adage, a kingdom was lost. The failure to renew fast track quickly 
will deprive the United States of its most effective foreign policy instrument for promoting the 
economic and democratic transformation of Latin America and the Caribbean. Moreover, the pace 
of economic and democratic reform could slow in many Latin American countries where there still 
is much popular and political resistance to capitalist democracy.
<p>
Over the past decade, Latin America has been one of the fastest-growing regions in the world, and 
the United States has been one of the principal beneficiaries of this growth. U.S. exports to other 
countries in the Western Hemisphere have increased over 50 percent since 1990 -- from $137 
billion in 1990 to nearly $207 billion in 1994 -- creating a total of 1.4 million new jobs in the U.S. 
in only five years. Of the total exported to Western Hemisphere markets in 1994, the U.S. exported 
nearly $98 billion to Latin America, directly supporting 1.96 million U.S. jobs. Total U.S. exports 
to Latin America now represent 19 percent of all U.S. exports, and Latin America is the fourth-
largest market for U.S. goods. 
<p>
Many Americans and policymakers believe mistakenly that NAFTA caused the Mexican crisis. 
This is not true. NAFTA did not cause the Mexican peso crisis. Mexico's currency collapsed 
because Mexico's economy is unfree and its political system is undemocratic. Investors fled Mexico 
not because they feared NAFTA, but because Mexico's weak economic and political institutions 
failed to inspire confidence in the country's long-term stability. The truth is that NAFTA kept the 
Mexican crisis from becoming much worse. NAFTA prevented investor confidence in Mexico 
from evaporating completely and also provided Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo the institutional 
strength he needed to resist domestic political pressures to abandon its free market policies and 
raise tariff barriers.
<p>
The emerging capitalist democracies of Latin America and the Caribbean have embraced free trade 
and NAFTA without reservation. This is an historic opportunity for the United States. It would be a 
pity if the Clinton Administration allowed short-term concerns and ideology to stand in the way of 
expanding trade relations in the Western Hemisphere. To put NAFTA's expansion back on track, 
and to promote greater prosperity and more jobs in America, the U.S. should:
<p><ul>
<li> Extend fast-track negotiating authority in 1995. Representative Phil Crane (R-IL), Chairman of 
the House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee, hopes to put together a package of trade 
measures before the end of November 1995. This package would include:
<ul>
	<li> Renewal of a "clean" fast-track negotiating authority that excludes environmental, labor, 
and other restrictions not directly related to trade;
<P>
<li>Expansion of trade benefits for Caribbean Basin countries;  and
<P>
<li>Implementation of an international agreement to curb shipbuilding subsidies.  
</ul><P>
If President Clinton is serious about free trade and NAFTA's expansion, he will support this 
package. If the President refuses to compromise with Congress on fast track, American workers and 
businesses will lose.
<p>
Moreover, Senate Majority Leader Dole should rethink his opposition to extending fast-track 
authority this year. The Senator has been a defender of free trade in the past. His leadership will be 
no less needed in the future.
<p>
<li> Extend NAFTA to Chile in 1996. If Chile is not admitted to NAFTA in 1996, President Clinton 
will have reneged on a promise that he made at the Summit of the Americas. This will badly 
damage U.S. credibility in the region and cede the initiative for expanding hemispheric free trade to 
Brazil, the European Union, and other countries that may want to exclude the U.S. from Latin 
American markets.
<p>
<li> Avoid trade sanctions. The use of trade sanctions to pressure America's trading partners to open 
up their markets does not create jobs for Americans or benefit U.S. exports. Most of the time, trade 
sanctions imposed unilaterally by the U.S. have backfired. The principal U.S. law used to threaten 
trade retaliation is Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act, which grants the President the authority to 
impose punitive trade restrictions on imports. Of the nearly 80 Section 301 cases initiated by the 
U.S. since 1974, only about 15 were successful. Even in these cases, American consumers were 
saddled with billions of dollars in higher prices caused by higher tariffs and special duties. In the 
end, all Americans lose when trade sanctions are utilized. 
<p>
Instead of resorting to such counterproductive tactics, the U.S. should rely on multilateral trade 
organizations such as the World Trade Organization to settle disputes between the U.S. and its 
trading partners.
<p>
<li> Deal separately with issues extraneous to free trade. Issues related to labor, the environment, 
corruption, and bribery should never be included in any free trade agreements. For example, the 
Congress should not pass fast track legislation that forces the President to require that Latin 
American trading partners meet U.S.-style environmental standards. Under certain circumstances, 
such extraneous issues may reduce market opportunities for U.S. exports and imports in countries 
with which the U.S. is seeking a trade agreement. In such cases, however, and only after the 
Administration consults with Congress and American industry, separate agreements should be 
negotiated and attached to a legislative package of free trade agreements whose implementation 
qualifies for fast track. Any agreements covering issues extraneous to free trade should include 
specific settlement procedures, such as those contained in the NAFTA side agreements on labor and 
the environment, but trade sanction provisions should never be part of such agreements. 
<p>
<li> Spread the benefits of free trade to the Caribbean Basin. The Caribbean Basin Trade Security Act 
(H.R. 553 and S. 529), introduced in January by Representative Crane and Senator Bob Graham (D-
FL), would grant the small countries of the Caribbean Basin the same access to the American 
market that Mexico has under NAFTA. This measure preserves the Reagan Administration's 
initiative to build up the economy of the Caribbean Basin and continues the U.S. commitment to 
free trade and economic development through free-market incentives.
<p></ul><a name="conclusion"></a>
CONCLUSION
<p>
The Clinton Administration has forgotten that its greatest foreign policy achievements have 
involved the expansion of free trade. The approval of NAFTA in 1993, the approval of the GATT 
agreement that created the WTO in 1994, and the Summit of the Americas in Miami at the end of 
1994 were the high points of this Administration's foreign policy. In every other area -- in Somalia, 
Haiti, Cuba, and now Bosnia -- the Administration's foreign policy has been confused and feckless. 
If the U.S. expects to be viewed in Latin America as the region's leader and foremost champion of 
free trade, President Clinton must meet Congress in the middle, as he promised he would do 
immediately following the mid-term elections of November 1994.
<p>
Meeting Congress halfway means accepting a "clean" fast-track negotiating authority that keeps 
labor, environmental, and other extraneous issues separate from free trade. It also means not 
allowing the Administration to include trade sanction provisions in any agreements covering free 
trade or other issues. Without a "clean" fast track bill, Chile will not be joining NAFTA any time 
soon. If NAFTA is not expanded to include Chile in 1996, the United States will be pushed to last 
place in the race to liberalize trade in the Western Hemisphere and create a Free Trade Area of the 
Americas. If President Clinton and Congress fail to put NAFTA back on a fast track, U.S. 
leadership and influence over the process of hemispheric trade expansion will be diminished for 
years to come.<p><hr>

INTRODUCTION
<P>
For the first time since 1986, when the U.S.  started passing judgment on
the counternarcotics efforts of 29 major drug-producing and drug-transit
countries, Colombia this year received a failing grade.  However, on
February 28, President Clinton issued a "national interest waiver"
exempting it from this failing grade.  As a result, Colombia will be eligible
for continued U.S.  aid even though it is not doing enough to stop the illegal
drug trade.
<P>
     This policy is deeply misguided.  The threat to U.S.  and
hemispheric security posed by Colombia's narco-democracy cannot be
overestimated.  The U.S.  may be the world's largest consumer of drugs, but
Colombia ranks third in the world in per capita consumption.  Literally
every country in the Americas has a serious domestic drug crisis.  The drug
cartels are well-positioned to influence Latin America's economic reforms
and manipulate the region's weak political and judicial institutions.  In
Colombia, they have penetrated the regulatory and lawmaking processes to
the point that they can influence constitutional and financial reform.  They
also have been financing election campaigns for many years, and at least
three Colombian presidents have knowingly taken money from drug
traffickers.
<P>
          Congress should demand an explanation from the Clinton
Administration.  Why should the U.S.  provide aid to stop the drug trade
and support Colombia's economic development when Colombia's
government is not serious about ending the production and trafficking of
narcotics?  The Clinton Administration's counternarcotics policy clearly is
not working.  It should be reviewed with two objectives in mind:  to
establish tougher standards for Colombia and to increase pressure on the
Colombian government to eradicate the drug cartels.  Specifically, the U.S. 
should:
<P>
Decertify Colombia for its lack of cooperation with the U.S.  Decertification
would block Colombia's access to financial and technical aid from the
multilateral development banks and should trigger the suspension of all
counternarcotics aid to Colombia as well.  The U.S.  should not consider
granting even a "national interest" recertification until President Ernesto
Samper dispels, with actions instead of words, international perceptions that
he has been compromised by the Cali cartel.
<P>
Insist that Colombia sign an extradition treaty with the U.S.  This would
allow Colombian citizens under indictment in the U.S.  for drug trafficking,
money laundering, and other drug-related crimes to be extradited to the U.S.
<P>
Urge Colombia to sign a bilateral law enforcement treaty with the U.S. 
Colombia would agree to enact tough money-laundering and sentencing laws
for narcotics traffickers and to confiscate all commercial, real estate, and
personal assets owned by convicted traffickers. 
<P>
 Develop specific performance benchmarks for Colombia as a condition for
any renewed bilateral assistance.
<P>
Hold extensive congressional hearings to review Colombia's counter-drug
cooperation and performance.  These hearings should focus on narco-politics
and narco-corruption in both Colombia and Mexico, since drug cartels in
both countries are working together to flood the United States with drugs
and weapons. 
<P>
 Impose visa prohibitions on Colombian officials, regardless of rank, who
are implicated in narco-corruption or any drug-related offenses.
End Colombia's participation in the Andean Trade Preferences Act (ATPA). 
This would mean that Colombian products would lose preferential tariff
access to U.S.  markets, potentially costing the Colombian economy
hundreds of millions of dollars in reduced export earnings.
<P>
THE WORLD'S FIRST NARCO-DEMOCRACY
<P>
     U.S.  counternarcotics experts believe that Colombia is the world's
first narco-democracy, a country whose economy, political system, and
society have been profoundly compromised and distorted by the wealth and
power of the drug cartels.  Former President Misael Pastrana, who governed
Colombia from 1974-1978, asserts:  "El Tiempo [Bogota's leading daily
newspaper] talks about a 'narco-project.'  People talk about 'narco-crimes,'
they talk about 'narco-money,' and if you add that up, logically it implies
general contamination." 
<P>
           Joe Toft, former head of the U.S.  Drug Enforcement Agency
(DEA) in Bogota, claims that Colombia is "already at the abyss."  Narco-
democracy "really is here [in Colombia]," he said during a live interview
with Colombian television.  "I can't think of a single institution in Colombia
that I know of, with any judicial, legal or political influence, which does not
have problems of penetration by the narcotics traffickers.  The Attorney
General's office has serious problems.  Congress is also very infiltrated by
narco-traffickers.... Everything favors [the] Cali [drug cartel].  They got rid
of extradition, which was the only thing they truly feared.  And now the
situation is very favorable [for the drug kingpins]."
<P>
          Colombian drug traffickers repatriate between $3 billion and
$7 billion a year in laundered drug-related earnings from the United States
and Europe, according to U.S.  counter-drug analysts.  Drug money has
created a construction frenzy in Colombia's main cities -- Bogota, Medellin,
Cali, and Barranquilla -- and has pushed up the prices of land and housing
drastically.  In a country where the minimum wage is 31 cents an hour,
four-bedroom apartments are selling for up to $400,000 in cash.  U.S.  and
government authorities have evidence that drug proceeds have been
deposited in every major bank in Colombia.
<P>
          Every resident of Cali or Medellin is affected directly or
indirectly by drug-tainted money.  For example, a $10 million deposit of
drug money in a Cali or Medellin bank may be loaned out to build a new
apartment complex.  This money eventually trickles down to the local
economy for the purchase of everyday goods and services.  Drug trafficking
proceeds have been a primary source of revenue for the cities of Cali and
Medellin since the mid-1980s, and more recently for Barranquilla, according
to U.S.  anti-drug analysts.
<P>
          The DEA believes that "the revenue generated by the influx
of drug proceeds into the economy has provided the Colombian Government
with funds for debt payments and national infrastructure development....
[T]hrough the purchase of government-issued securities, Colombian drug
kingpins are investing in their country's future development.  The immense
resources of the drug cartels afford them a cushion of security in Colombia. 
Their influence within the banking industry, government, and law
enforcement agencies already has impeded attempts to prosecute them. 
Through bribery and intimidation, they have altered and reversed undesired
policy decisions by the country's government and banking regulators."
<P>
          The Colombian drug cartels have expanded their operations
around the world significantly since the early 1990s.  U.S.  counternarcotics
intelligence agencies have identified at least 14 "core" Colombian cartels in
business with 19 Mexican cartels to transport Colombian-produced cocaine
and heroin into the United States.  Since the 1980s, the Colombian cartels
have opened new consumer markets for cocaine in practically every Latin
American country.  Venezuela has become a major drug-transit country;
Panama retains its historical position as a key drug-transit and money-
laundering country; and Guatemala has emerged as an important
"warehousing" country, used by Colombian and Mexican cartels running
loosely integrated drug trafficking operations.
<P>
          In Europe, the Colombian drug barons are doing business
with the Sicilian Mafia and other criminal groups in Italy, Germany, France,
and Britain.  They also are penetrating Eastern Europe and opening new
markets in Russia in association with Russia's thriving criminal underworld. 
Although the production and international distribution of cocaine and heroin
is their primary business, Colombian cartels also trade in weapons, icons,
raw materials, radioactive materials, and counterfeit U.S.  dollars.
<P>
          The Official Position. The Colombian government and many
Colombians express outrage at the word "narco-democracy," rejecting the
argument that drug cartels have thoroughly penetrated every aspect of
Colombian society.  The official government line on the Colombian drug
problem is that the drug traffickers comprise a very small minority and that
Colombians have battled the drug traffickers much longer, and have died in
far greater numbers, than anyone else.  The drug problem is described by
the Colombian government as an international issue that requires
international solutions. 
<P>
           But Colombians tend to overlook the global reach and power
of their country's drug cartels.  Colombia's five-year-old constitution bans
the extradition of Colombian citizens wanted for crimes committed in other
countries, and the courts rarely punish drug traffickers.  In fact, 38 percent
of the drug traffickers who turn themselves in through the plea bargain
system never spend a single day in jail, and not one major trafficker has
been jailed in more than a year. 
<P>
           The Samper Administration's response to President Clinton's
decision to downgrade Colombia with a "national interest" certification was
a mixture of rejection and defiance.  Officials close to Samper suggested
that Colombia might choose to reject all future U.S.  assistance in the
counternarcotics war rather than subject their country to a review by the
U.S.  government which many Colombians consider to be both unfair and
biased against them.
<P>
          The Samper Administration's view was summed up in its
official response to the DEA's report on the impact of money laundering in
the Colombian economy.  In this document, the Samper government
defended Colombia's financial controls as adequate, denied that drug
traffickers have a significant impact on the Colombian economy, and
charged that the DEA is opposed to a free-market economy with a strong
and vigorous private sector:  "The document circulated by the DEA shows
profound ignorance on how the Colombian economy operates.... Due to its
lack of methodology or scientific accuracy and to its bias against the
country, the [DEA] document constitutes not only an insult to Colombians,
but an insult to intelligence."
<P>
PRESSURING COLOMBIA TO GET TOUGH ON DRUGS
<P>
     The Clinton Administration's current counternarcotics policy is not
working in the case of Colombia.  Something must be done to stem the flow
of drugs from the world's most powerful cocaine cartels.  The U.S.  should
consider every possible avenue for compelling the Colombian government
to crack down on these criminal cartels.  The staff report issued on February
27, 1995, by the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations calls for stronger
oversight of Colombia's counternarcotics performance and decertification of
Colombia for its failure to combat the illegal drug trade.  This approach
should be welcomed.  Specifically, the U.S.  should:
<P>
Decertify Colombia for its lack of cooperation with the U.S.  Decertification
would block Colombia's access to financial and technical aid from
multilateral development banks such as the Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB) and World Bank.  All U.S.  counternarcotics aid to Colombia
also should be suspended.  The U.S.  should not grant "national interest" re-
certification until the Samper Administration demonstrates with strong
actions its commitment to eliminating the drug cartels.  Thus, President
Samper not only must increase the volume of cocaine and heroin seizures
in Colombia, but also must dismantle the Cali cartel and prosecute all of its
leaders, including the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers, Ivan Urdinola, Jose
Santacruz Londono, and Pacho Herrera.  A credible plan for attacking the
cocaine and heroin traffic also should encompass an effective strategy for
reducing the coca and opium poppy crops by 10 percent annually and 50
percent within five years.  Until Colombia meets these conditions, the U.S. 
should withhold recertification.
<P>
Insist that Colombia sign an extradition treaty with the U.S.  This
would allow for the extradition of Colombian citizens under indictment
in the U.S.  for drug trafficking, money laundering, and other drug-
related crimes.  It would require Colombia's political leaders to amend
a five-year-old constitution which banned extradition in a deliberate
concession to the drug cartels.  Colombia's constitution and laws
should not be customized to accommodate the interests of these
criminals.
<P>
Urge Colombia to sign a bilateral law enforcement treaty with the U.S. 
In this treaty, Colombia would agree to enact tougher sentencing laws
for narcotics traffickers and to enforce other measures, such as
confiscation of all commercial, real estate, and other assets owned
directly or indirectly by convicted traffickers.  Dangerous traffickers
believed responsible for dozens of murders now are jailed for only a few
years or even months, and the Colombian government makes no effort
to confiscate their assets and properties.
<P>
Develop specific performance benchmarks for Colombia as a condition
for any renewed bilateral assistance.  These benchmarks should take the
form of specific targets or quotas relating to the eradication of coca and
opium poppy crops, the seizure of cocaine and heroin shipments, the
destruction of precursor chemicals and processing labs, and the capture
of anyone identified in Colombia, the U.S., or anywhere else in the
world as a drug trafficker or money launderer.  Because Colombia is
a "core" drug producing country and the headquarters of the world's
cocaine industry, it should be subject to standards appreciably tougher
than those applied to other countries.
<P>
Hold extensive congressional hearings to review Colombia's counter-
drug cooperation and performance.  These hearings should focus on
narco-trafficking, narco-corruption, and narco-politics in both Colombia
and Mexico.  U.S.  counternarcotics officials believe that President
Samper's election campaign was partly financed with Cali cartel money
and that Samper has been accepting money from the Medellin and Cali
cartels, either for himself or for other presidential candidates in whose
campaigns he has worked, at least since 1982.  When the DEA ran the
names of Colombia's 263-member Congress into Naddis (the DEA's
computerized list of suspects), more than a fourth showed up on the
list.  While that alone may not prove guilt, it does indicate that DEA
informants and others have linked these people to drug cases.  Seven of
Colombia's 32 governors also appeared on the list. 
<P>
      As Congress examines Colombia's role in the drug trade, it also
should take a hard look at Mexico.  A total of 33 "core" Colombian and
Mexican cartels are working together to produce cocaine and heroin in
Colombia.  They transport these drugs by air and sea, and overland
through Central America.  The drugs are warehoused in Guatemala
with the connivance of corrupt members of the Guatemalan armed
forces.  From Guatemala, the drugs are shipped across Mexico to U.S. 
border crossing points in California, Arizona, and Texas.
<P>
     Mexico plays an increasing role in the Western Hemisphere's
cocaine trade.  Yet, the U.S.  has no extradition treaty with Mexico, and
corruption within Mexican law enforcement agencies is endemic.  More
than 80 percent of the drug gangs in Texas come from Mexico, and
street gangs in Dallas, Fort Worth, and Houston are supplied by
Mexican cartels.  Throughout the Southwest U.S., Mexican drug
gangs, most of whom are in the U.S.  illegally, operate significant drug
trafficking operations and provide street gangs with drugs and guns,
thereby increasing the level of violent crime in many American cities.
<P>
Impose visa prohibitions on Colombian officials, regardless of rank, who
are implicated in narco-corruption or any drug-related offenses.  These
should include any suspected member of the Colombian executive,
judiciary, and Congress, plus all members of their immediate families,
until such time as an investigation deemed satisfactory by the U.S. 
establishes their guilt or innocence.
<P>
End Colombia's participation in the Andean Trade Preferences Act
(ATPA).  The ATPA was enacted by the U.S.  government to help drug-
producing and drug-transit countries in the Andean region reduce
the production and trafficking of narcotics and to promote the
cultivation of legal agricultural products and other goods by reducing
U.S.  tariffs on imports from these countries.  ATPA was meant to be
a quid pro quo for effective efforts to curb drug trafficking.  Moreover,
two key conditions for inclusion in ATPA are signing an extradition
treaty with the U.S.  and achieving quantitative progress in reducing
illegal drug production and trafficking.  However, Colombia's five-year-
old constitution specifically bans the extradition of Colombian citizens
to other countries, and President Clinton's use of a "national interest
waiver" to recertify Colombia clearly proves that Colombia is not
meeting the requirements of U.S.  law for inclusion in the ATPA. 
Colombia's preferential access to U.S.  markets under ATPA should be
suspended immediately because Colombia does not meet its key
conditions.
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
     By any standard, Colombia is no longer a reliable ally in the U.S. 
war on drugs.  The time has come to begin treating the Colombian
government as part of the American drug problem rather than part of the
solution.  Recognizing this with presidential decertification is an important
first step.  This will help to prevent Colombia from obtaining assistance
from multilateral financial institutions, which in effect are helping to
subsidize the production of Colombia's poisonous narcotics exports.
<P>
          Beyond this, the U.S.  should take the lead in isolating
Colombia internationally.  This will involve denying visas to known drug
operatives in the Colombian government and even withdrawing trade
preferences for Colombian exports as permitted by the Andean Trade
Preferences Act (ATPA).  While trade is a blunt and usually
inappropriate tool for governments, in this case it will send the clear signal
that Colombia no longer deserves the preferential treatment provided by the
ATPA.
<P>
     Finally, the Clinton Administration must reaffirm its commitment to
the war on drugs, which had begun to show substantial progress by 1992.
Unfortunately, most of the earlier gains have been reversed because of
President Clinton's benign neglect of the problem. Colombia's national
interest recertification is only the most recent example of this. Although
much ridiculed as an insufficient response at the time, the Reagan
Administration's "Just Say No" effort was more successful than many want
to admit. It is time to just say no to Colombia.

Preserving America's Military Strength," December 28, 1992.)

<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>

     The Clinton Administration's first-year performance in national
security policy was poor by any objective measure. In every area of
performance as Commander in Chief, the President failed to live up to
expectations or to his own rhetoric.
<P>
     Bill Clinton's record in the employment of American might around
the world is indefensible. Over two dozen soldiers were killed in
Somalia after the President and his advisers expanded the mission
there from feeding the hungry to building a nation and disarming a
tribal warlord's army. No conceivable national interest was advanced
by this change of policy. In Haiti, the decision to send in military
peacekeepers to enforce a United Nations cease-fire agreement was
rescinded when a United States warship was prevented from docking and
humiliated by a gang of armed thugs on the pier. In the former
Yugoslavia, where the President himself raised the stakes during the
1992 presidential campaign, the Administration's empty and ill-advised
threats of military action to stop the bloodshed have infuriated
America's European allies and very likely emboldened potential
adversaries. (For a full discussion on the options available to the
Clinton Administration when it took office, see Baker Spring,
"Assessing America's Military Options In Bosnia," Heritage Foundation
Backgrounder No. 939, May 7, 1993.) 
<P>
     In national security planning, the President claimed credit
throughout the year for having developed the first comprehensive post-
Cold War review of America's defense requirements. But his decision to
fire the author of the plan, then-Secretary of Defense Les Aspin,
calls into question his Administration's commitment to that so-called
Bottom-Up Review. (For a full discussion of the Bottom-Up Review, see
Lawrence T. Di Rita, et al., "Thumbs Down To The Bottom-Up Review,"
Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 957, September 22, 1993.)
<P>
     Moreover, Clinton's budget proposals during his first year make
it clear that he places a low priority on the quality of America's
armed forces. If enacted, his proposed defense budget cuts will be
more than double the reductions he promised while campaigning for the
presidency, and there is ample evidence that those cuts already are
having an impact on combat readiness. (For a full discussion of
military readiness, see John F. Luddy, "Stop The Slide Toward a Hollow
Military," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder Update No. 209, January
14, 1994.) 
<P>
     The best way to measure the President's performance is to compare
his actions to his promises. It is clear in doing so that he has
learned little from the events of 1993. In his State of the Union
address on January 25, for example, Clinton made several claims about
his commitment to a strong defense or regarding the state of America's
defenses today. However, these assertions do not match reality. 
<P>
ASSERTION #1:  "The budget I [will] send to Congress draws the line
               against further defense cuts."
<P>
     This statement apparently means that the President does not
intend to cut the defense budget any more than already planned. So far
he has decided to slash the budget by twice the amount he promised
during the 1992 presidential campaign. Having pledged to trim only $60
billion beyond the Bush cuts through 1997, Clinton actually has
reduced the defense budget by $120 billion. Further, his current
budget plans signal that he is prepared to cut force structure levels
even below those proposed in the Bottom-Up Review, which will only
invite even more budget reductions later in his term.
<P>
ASSERTION #2:  "[N]othing -- nothing -- is more important to our
               security than our nation's armed forces."
<P>
     The President has made no secret of the fact that he prefers to
concentrate on domestic issues. As reported by The Washington Post
during the search for the Administration's third defense secretary in
less than a year, one unnamed advisor noted that "[the Administration]
really just wanted to get the Pentagon off the screen. Every time it
was on, it was trouble that interfered with the President's agenda.
Their attitude was, if they could subcontract out the Pentagon, they
would." (Ann Devroy and Barton Gellman, "How Search Finally Led to
Perry," The Washington Post, January 24, 1994, p. A1.)
<P>
     As much as he may wish to do so, the President cannot
"subcontract out" his responsibilities as Commander in Chief -- not to
his National Security Adviser, not to his Secretary of Defense, and
not to the United Nations Secretary General, as he tried to do in
Somalia and Haiti. The tragic events of 1993, including the deaths of
over two dozen Americans in Somalia, suggest the President is trying
to do just that. Instead of using rhetoric to create the impression of
being committed to America's national security, the President should
simply commit the resources required to ensure a strong military.
<P>
ASSERTION #3:  "Last year, I proposed a defense plan that maintains
               our post-Cold War security.... "
<P>
     True, but the President no longer supports this plan, known as
the Bottom-Up Review. The Bottom-Up Review is collapsing and starved
for funds that could fall short of requirements by $95 billion.
Reports are already emerging that the military services are
formulating plans to reduce their forces to levels below those
recommended in the Bottom-Up Review. (David A. Fulghum, "USAF May Cut
Forces By Additional 10-15%," Aviation Week and Space Technology,
January 3, 1994, pp. 25-26.)
<P>
     By his budget recommendations, the President is making it clear
that even he does not support the findings of the Bottom-Up Review.
The budget he has proposed covering fiscal 1995 through 1999 will
support an Army force structure 20 percent smaller than that
envisioned in the Bottom-Up Review. In addition it allows for 16
percent fewer Navy ships, only 77 percent of the Marine Corps troop
strength, and an Air Force 70 percent the size of that outlined in the
study.
<P>
     But the best indication that the President no longer supports the
plan is his decision in December 1993 to fire its author, Secretary of
Defense Les Aspin. In the week before his departure was announced,
Aspin had begun to challenge in public Budget Director Leon Panetta's
assertion that an additional $50 billion in defense cuts would be
needed to meet the Administration's spending targets over five years.
<P>
ASSERTION #4:  "We honor [the armed forces'] contributions.... "
<P>
     Clinton's actions speak louder than his words. He tried last year
to force the military to accept acknowledged homosexuals in the ranks,
a highly unpopular move contrary to good order and combat readiness
that was forestalled by Congress. Moreover, his first budget
submission included a freeze on military pay, a move also overridden
by Congress. Given the President's youthful and brash comments about
"loving [the] country but loathing the military... ," (William J.
Clinton letter to LTC Eugene Holmes, Director of the Reserve Officer
Training Corps program at the University of Arkansas, December 3,
1969.) these initiatives do not suggest the actions of a President who
honors the armed forces. Nor have they done anything to raise the low
esteem in which he was held by members of the armed services when he
assumed office.
<P>
     Easing his strained relationship with the military is among the
most pressing problems the President faces. To be sure, the U.S. armed
services are made up of professionals who understand the Constitution
and the inviolability of civilian control over the military. But while
respect for the office is inviolate, respect for the office holder
must often be earned. President Clinton will not earn that respect
with platitudes that ignore his unfortunate performance as Commander
in Chief during his first year. He should instead acknowledge his
mistakes and develop a national security strategy based on strong
defense and global leadership.
<P>
ASSERTION #5:  "Our forces are the finest military our nation has ever
               had.... "
<P>
     This statement is simply untrue. Had it been made in 1991, it
would have been true. But who can argue that a Navy which has 413
ships in 1994 is stronger than one that had 528 ships in 1991?
Likewise, who believes that an Army of 20 active and reserve divisions
in 1994 is stronger than one which had 26 total divisions in 1991? The
Air Force is no better off, having lost 10 tactical air wings since
1991.
<P>
     Defense spending has been on a downward spiral since its peak in
1985; it has been reduced by nearly 40 percent since that time. But
the Clinton defense budget implies that further cuts are possible and
even desirable.
<P>
     Worse, the quality of military personnel has begun to decline.
Secretary Aspin on June 2, 1993, acknowledged that the percentage of
new military recruits with high school diplomas had dropped from 97
percent in 1991 to 94 percent in 1993 and that enlistment test scores
also declined during the same period. (John Lancaster, "Aspin Voices
Concern About Slight Decline in Quality of Recruits," The Washington
Post, June 3, 1993, p. A7.) Concerns about military readiness
generally prompted Aspin to form a blue-ribbon commission of retired
generals and admirals to examine these questions. It is well past time
for Clinton to recognize that the armed forces are weaker than they
were in 1991 and as a result of his defense program will be far weaker
yet in the future.

<P>
ASSERTION #6:  " . .. .. [A]s long as I am President, [the armed
               forces] will remain the best trained, best equipped,
               and best prepared fighting force on the face of the
               earth."
<P>
     The President is wrong on all counts. The Clinton cuts already
have begun to have a negative impact on training, equipment
procurement, and combat readiness. Funding for the purchase of new
equipment and research and development of future weapons systems has
been slashed by Clinton, while equipment modernization accounts are
also suffering.
<P>
     There will be a 17 percent reduction in procurement spending in
1994. As a result, less new equipment and weapons will be purchased.
Research and development also will drop by 10 percent, limiting future
Presidents from having the wide range of modern weapons Clinton
enjoyed as a result of defense build-up in the 1980s.
<P>
     Clinton's defense reductions are across the board. Several
critical weapons programs, including the Air Force's Multi-Role
Fighter aircraft, and the Navy's A/F-X fighter-attack aircraft have
been cancelled without replacements. Meanwhile, funding for the
nation's premier high technology defense program, ballistic missile
defense, has been halved.
<P>
     Routine maintenance levels are also in decline. For the first
time in a decade, for example, less than 90 percent of Marine Corps
equipment is ready to go to war. (General Carl E. Mundy, Jr.,
Commandant of the Marine Corps, Statement for the Record Before the
Senate Armed Services Committee, May 19, 1993.) The Marine Corps'
backlog in maintenance has gone from zero to $160 million in two
years. (Margo McFarland, "Nunn Warns That Outlay Problem in '95 Could
Be Even Worse Than '94," Inside the Navy, June 21, 1993, p. 17.) The
Navy has 150 aircraft and 250 aircraft engines overdue for maintenance
because of budget shortfalls. (Admiral Frank B. Kelso II, Statement
For the Record Before the Senate Armed Services Committee, May 19,
1993.) Meanwhile, the Army's budget for modernizing its forces is
under-funded by $1 billion. ($1 Billion of Army Modernization Plans
Unfunded," Inside the Pentagon, July 22, 1993, p. 5.)
<P>
     Clinton may claim to support a modern, well-equipped, and well-
trained military for the future, but his actions do not reflect this
priority. America's ability to develop and field high-tech weapons of
the future is withering, while training and readiness have already
been affected by the military's inability to keep its equipment in
good repair. Today's military can continue operating the weapons
developed and built in the 1980s, but Clinton's successors will
inherit armed forces greatly weakened by his short-sighted military
investment policies.

<P>CONCLUSION
<P>
     Now that Clinton has a new Secretary of Defense, he has the
opportunity to try again to develop a coherent national security
strategy. A responsible first step would be to scrap Aspin's Bottom-Up
Review and develop a plan that addresses America's global interests
and for which the Administration is prepared to pay. (For a full slate
of recommendations for the new Secretary of Defense, see John Luddy,
"A National Security Agenda for the New Secretary of Defense,"
Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 214, February 10, 1994.)
<P>
     
     President Clinton's first year in office will not be remembered
for its foreign and defense policy successes. The low point was in
early October, when 18 Americans died at the hands of a Somali tribal
chieftain and an American warship was prevented from docking by a gang
of Haitian thugs. Such humiliation demands a sober reassessment of
priorities and objectives, and not the braggadocio of the President's
first State of the Union Address.

<h2>Medical Savings Accounts</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
Health care spending today is more than twenty times what it was in    
1965. The primary reason for that dramatic increase is the third-party    
payment system. 
</i></blockquote>
<p>   
Research analyst Peter Barwick of the Commonwealth Foundation in    
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania argues that "people are never as careful in    
spending someone else's money as they are in spending their own." This    
simple fact of human nature is what's behind the spiraling cost of health    
care in America. "Between 1965 and 1995, total annual spending on    
health care in the U.S. rose from $41.6 billion to $938.3 billion in    
constant dollars," reports Barwick. "This dramatic increase in health care    
spending coincided with a sharp rise in third-party payment." The    
Pennsylvania researcher estimates that "79 cents of every dollar used to    
purchase health care is paid by someone other than the person receiving    
treatment."   
<p>   
Barwick sees a direct link "between rising health care costs and the    
increase in third-party payment." He argues that there is little incentive    
for economizing "when people only have to pay 21 cents to get a dollar's    
worth of coverage." When patients don't care how much a particular    
medicine or treatment will cost, "physicians and other medical    
professionals will have little reason to seek the most cost-effective ways    
to provide quality care."   
<p>   
The solution, Barwick believes, is Medical Savings Accounts (known as    
an MSAs), which provide "the individual consumer with the resources    
needed to pay directly for ordinary health care expenditures, together    
with the incentive to do so responsibly." Barwick describes MSAs as    
"tax-free accounts into which individuals may deposit money to be used    
to pay for everyday health care needs. Typically," he says, "MSAs are    
combined with a catastrophic insurance policy which covers all health    
care expenses beyond a high fixed deductible."   
<p>   
Barwick argues that "MSAs provide health care consumers with a strong    
incentive to conserve resources, since the consumer gets to keep whatever    
cost-savings he is able to achieve. By encouraging frugality among    
consumers, MSAs would also provide incentive to physicians and other    
health care professionals to utilize the most costeffective means of    
providing quality care." Barwick notes that other proposed health care    
reforms "seek to regulate patients, physicians, and hospitals more heavily,    
resulting in restrictions on the freedom of the patient to choose a    
physician and [the freedom] of the physician to select the type of    
treatment to be used. In contrast, MSAs leave these choices where they    
belong: in the hands of individual health care recipients and their    
physicians."   
<p>   
In addition to providing patients and doctors with an incentive to save,    
MSAs would reduce administrative costs, which account for as much as    
25 percent of health care spending. They would also reduce out-of-pocket    
expenses for "the vast majority of health care recipients." And they would    
solve the portability problem by allowing employees to "take any unspent    
MSA funds with them when leaving a job."

<h2> Environmental Economics </h2><p>


<i>The free market can protect the environment far better than any government can, so why not take advantage of it?<i><p>



People will take care of the environment voluntarily if they have sufficient incentive for doing so. Property rights provide that incentive. "A property rights strategy works through incentives; government intervention relies on commands," says Joseph Bast of the Heartland Institute, co-author of a new book called Eco-Sanity, A CommonSense Guide to Environmentalism. "Ownership leads to better stewardship. We tend to take better care of things we own than of things we only rent or borrow," says Bast. "Natural resources, therefore, are better cared for if they are owned by the people who use them." Not surprisingly, governments tend to prefer a coercive approach, which requires a monitoring system and "an apparatus to punish those who attempt to evade the commands."<p>

For governments, of course, coercion can be an end in itself. The sincere environmentalist, however, has no excuse for succumbing to the totalitarian temptation, once he realizes that compulsion is counterproductive. "Pollution problems occur where rights are not defined and enforced," says Bast. "When things are privately owned, the civil justice system keeps us from invading or damaging them. But, when they are owned in common . . . we are often driven by competition with others to exploit them quickly and with little regard for their future value. The result is often pollution, unsustainable rates of development, and endangerment of wildlife."<p>

The free exchange of the free market "can help solve environmental problems," says Bast. "Transferable property rights enable those who value a resource most highly to bid it away from those who value it less. Potential buyers -for example, nonprofit organizations and clubs devoted to conservation -- can use their property rights to purchase or lease land, reward good stewardship, or purchase covenants that restrict allowable uses of land. Such exchanges reveal the true cost of protecting the environment and ensure that this cost is shared by those who value the environment most."<p>

Because they do not operate according to free-market principles, governments inevitably harm the environment. "Government officials seeks to expand their budgets and authority by delivering short-term benefits to special interest groups," says Bast. "Because they do not own the resources they manage, these officials are unlikely to manage them for maximum asset value." Government' i monopoly status prevents it from comparing "its own efficiency to that of competing organizations. As a result, government agents cannot know how good a job they are doing -- or how much harm they are causing."<p>

The free market encourages efficiency, and that's good for the environment. ''Efficiency means producing the most output with the least input," says Joseph Bast. "Over time, a system that rewards efficiency will also tend to produce less pollution than one that tolerates inefficiency.'' Governments, on the other hand, are notoriously inefficient, and their inefficiency leads to waste and pollution. Environmentalists without hidden agendas should recognize the superiority of the free-market approach.<p>

The World Trade Organization's recent ruling against the United States     
is a taste of things to come -- unless American voters can persuade their     
Congressmen to abrogate the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade     
and say no to the New World Order.    
<p>    
The jig is up. The internationalists have jumped the gun. They've shown     
their hand too soon. And now their legislative lackeys in the U.S.     
Congress are obliged, in the middle of an election year, to defend the     
indefensible. Having sworn to uphold the Constitution and protect the     
sovereignty of the United States, they must now figure out a way to     
justify their support for a treaty that undermines both -- or resign     
themselves to humiliating defeats in November.    
<p>    
Congress ratified the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (known as     
GATT) during its lame-duck session in December 1994. That treaty     
established the World Trade Organization ( known as WTO) and gave it     
the power to settle trade disputes among signatory nations. Well, lo and     
behold, the WTO, in its first major decision, has ruled against the United     
States! The Members of Congress who ratified the treaty knew that such     
an outcome was a distinct possibility. It was widely predicted at the time.     
Nevertheless, they willingly voted to subject the economic, social, and     
legislative decisions of American citizens to the whims of an international     
tribunal.    
<p>    
What that international tribunal did was to order the United States to     
change its rules on the quality of imported gasoline or face sanctions     
against U.S. industries. The governments of Venezuela and Brazil had     
appealed to the World Trade Organization to compel the U.S. to accept     
their gasoline, which does not meet U.S. environmental standards.     
Congress will now have to revise our Clean Air Act regulations regarding     
gasoline emissions or U.S. industries will face "cross-retaliation" trade     
sanctions. Since the United States does not export gasoline to Venezuela     
or Brazil, there is no direct way to exact revenge on U.S. petroleum     
interests. So, in the name of "free trade," the WTO will probably order     
trade sanctions against other U.S. industries that are wholly unrelated to     
the gasoline industry or the EPA regulations.    
<p> 
Now, Democrats and Republicans both have egg on their faces. President     
Clinton promised his liberal supporters in 1994 that the WTO would     
never undercut our environmental regulations. The Republican leadership     
in Congress promised their conservative backers that American     
sovereignty would not be endangered by the agreement. Well, it turns out     
they were both mistaken, or less than candid.    
<p>    
William Gill of the American Coalition for Competitive Trade considers     
the recent WTO ruling truly ominous. Gill and his group tried to warn     
Members of Congress that the North American Free Trade Agreement     
and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade "were the first big steps     
toward a world government that would rob America of our cherished     
independence as a nation." But our elected representatives just wouldn't     
listen. By the time November 5th rolls around, they may wish they had.

<h2>Spiritual Renewal</h2></center><P> 

[Today's the first day of the new year -- the perfect time to examine our 
personal weaknesses and the shortcomings of our society, and resolve to 
fix what needs fixing.]
<p>
In an essay published in the November issue of Hillsdale College's 
monthly journal, Imprimis, former Education Secretary William Bennett 
says that the last 30 years have been a period of cultural decline for 
America. During the last three decades, he says, "there was a 560 percent 
increase in violent crime; more than a 400 percent increase in illegitimate 
births; a quadrupling in divorces; a tripling of the percentage of children 
living in single-parent homes: more than a 200 percent increase in the 
teenage suicide rate; and a drop of 75 points in the average SAT scores of 
high school students." When it comes to social pathology, America sets 
the global pace. "We are at, or near, the top in rates of abortions, 
divorces, and unwed births," says Bennett. "We lead the industrialized 
world in murder, rape, and violent crime. And in elementary and 
secondary education, we are at, or near, the bottom in achievement 
scores."<p>

There are other, harder-to-measure "signs of decay." Bennett suggests 
that "there is a coarseness, a callousness, a cynicism. a banality, and a 
vulgarity to our time" and laments in particular the deleterious effect on 
children. "We live in a culture which at times seems almost dedicated to 
the corruption of the young, to assuring the loss of their innocence before 
their time," he says. Where are the protesters? Why doesn't anyone do 
anything? "We have become inured to the cultural rot that is setting in," 
concludes Bennett. "People are experiencing atrocity overload, losing 
their capacity for shock, disgust, and outrage."
<p>
Bennett insists that "the real crisis of our time is spiritual." He says that 
"our desires are turned toward the wrong things. And only when we turn 
them toward the right things -- toward enduring, noble, spiritual things -- 
will things get better." That's going to be rather difficult as long as there 
persists "a disturbing reluctance in our time to talk seriously about 
matters spiritual and religious." Bennett says that, "when millions of 
people stop believing in God, or when their belief is so attenuated as to 
be belief in name only, enormous public consequences follow. And when 
this is accompanied by an aversion to spiritual language by the political 
and intellectual class, the public consequences are even greater."
<p>
William Bennett recommends four steps toward "spiritual renewal." The 
first is to recognize the "intrinsic limits to what the state can do, 
particularly when it comes to imparting virtue, and forming and forging 
character, and providing peace to souls." The second is to reinvest public 
policy with "our deepest beliefs." The third is to "recover a sense of the 
fundamental purpose of education," which is moral instruction. Last, says 
Bennett, "we need to return religion to its proper place" in society -- no 
matter how much it may disconcert those who flee from faith.

<h2>Founding Fathers</h2></center><P> 
[The Declaration of Independence and our U.S. Constitution incorporate 
the wisdom of the ages. They are a gift to us from our Founding 
Fathers.]
<P>
The Christian theologian Thomas Aquinas affirmed the right of subjects 
to depose a king "if, becoming a tyrant, he abuses the royal power." In 
this he anticipated the thinking of the 17th century English philosopher 
John Locke and of the American patriots who declared their 
independence from the British crown in 1776.
<P>
According to John Locke's Second Treatise of Civil Government, the 
authority of political power derives from a social contract agreed to 
voluntarily by free, equal, and independent men. That power loses its 
authority when, by violating this contract, it loses the consent of the 
parties thereto. Locke conceded that the people are generally reluctant to 
exercise this power to dissolve ineffective or oppressive governments: 
"Great mistakes in the ruling part, many wrong and inconvenient laws, 
and all the slips of human frailty will be borne by the people without 
mutiny or murmur. But if a long train of abuses, prevarications, and 
artifices, all tending the same way, make the design visible to the people, 
and they cannot but feel what they lie under and see whither they are 
going, it is not to be wondered that they should then rouse themselves 
and endeavor to put the rule into such hands which may secure to them 
the ends for which government was at first erected."
<P>
Locke went to great lengths to distinguish liberty from license and to 
demonstrate that law is the liberator, not the oppressor of man. "Law, in 
its true notion, is not so much the limitation as the direction of a free and 
intelligent agent to his proper interest, and prescribes no farther than is 
for the general good of those under that law," said Locke. He argued that 
"the end of law is not to abolish or restrain but to preserve and enlarge 
freedom," emphasizing that freedom is not, however, "a liberty for every 
man to do what he [pleases]."
<P>
The Declaration of Independence enumerated the abuses of royal power 
that the founding fathers considered sufficient to justify their 
renunciation of the king's sovereignty. There, and in the Preamble to the 
Constitution of the United States, they spelled out the principles that 
formed the foundation of their  vision of a better world. Echoes of 
Aristotle, Cicero, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, and John Locke can be 
heard in both documents. The Constitution with its Bill of Rights 
incorporates the wisdom of the ages. By protecting our God-given rights 
from the encroachment of government we expand our freedom to pursue 
true happiness.
<P>
In this season of gift-giving, let us be grateful not only for the gifts that 
God has given us directly but also for those that have come to us through 
the wisdom of our Founding Fathers. Let us pass these gifts on to our 
descendants in the hope that they too will share our vision of a better 
world.
<p>                           <P>

<h2> Welfare Reform/WA</h2>


<i><blockquote>
 

Demagogues may dismiss welfare reform as "discrimination against 
families, " but the truth is quite the opposite. </blockquote></i>
<P>
It isn't welfare reform that discriminates against families, but welfare 
itself, says John Carlson of the Washington Institute for Policy Studies in 
Seattle. "A young mother can receive a welfare check only if she doesn't 
marry the father, doesn't live at home, doesn't find a job, and doesn't save 
any money. You can't get much more anti-family than that," says 
Carlson. "Young men who father children out of wedlock don't have to 
take responsibility for their actions. The welfare system does it for them. 
And the mother isn't required to identify the father of the child. Again, 
you can't get much more anti-family than that."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the April issue of "Alternatives in Philanthropy," published by the 
Capital Research Center, Carlson argues that "we should apply the same 
kind of common sense to welfare reform that we would use if someone in 
our own family experienced trouble." A welfare reform bill now under 
consideration by the Washington State House of Representatives "would 
limit welfare benefits and include an additional period of reduced 
benefits for welfare recipients who are working. Recipients who don't 
look for work would have their benefits reduced. They could save money 
without being penalized, but cash benefits would not be increased for 
recipients who have more children."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the same issue of "Alternatives in Philanthropy," Lynn Harsh and Bob 
Williams of the Evergreen Freedom Foundation in Olympia, Washington 
agree that the welfare reform proposed in the State House "moves in the 
right direction." It provides for "a maximum of 36 months on 
assistance," requiring recipients to "sign contracts outlining their 
responsibilities" and to "participate in a job-training and job-search 
program." The legislation would require unwed mothers to identify "the 
fathers of their children," while denying cash payments to unmarried 
mothers who are minors. Harsh and Williams recommend that the 
reforms also include stringent enforcement of child support laws, the 
easing of restrictions on adoption, "greater tax incentives for charitable 
contributions," and the changing of program incentives "so that state 
welfare agencies redefine success as the number of people removed from 
welfare rolls and placed in long-term employment." The two policy 
analysts note that "the mere talk of tough welfare reform seems to be 
having an effect. Fewer people are applying for welfare in Washington 
State than last year despite no significant changes in the law or the 
economy."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Why not support what works? "Hundreds of charities, nonprofit 
organizations, and private-sector job-training and placement programs 
already serve the needy," observe Harsh and Williams. "Many of them 
have a proven record of operating efficiently and with a high degree of 
accountability. In the long run we advocate abolishing government-run 
welfare entirely. Far from being a cruel or reckless approach, this change 
would help renew our families, neighborhoods, churches, and 
communities -- the institutions best able to serve the needy."

<P>


     The Clinton Administration's Korea policy, focused as it is on
North Korea's nuclear weapons programs, falls short of dealing with the
larger question of North-South conflict on the Korean Peninsula. Over
two months ago, the Clinton Administration inked an "Agreed
Framework" with North Korea to freeze Pyongyang's maverick nuclear
program. Despite this agreement, North Korea downed a U.S. helicopter
on December 17, 1994, killing one U.S. airman and detaining another
on false charges of American espionage. These are grim reminders that
Cold War tensions continue on the Korean Peninsula and that the
37,000 U.S. soldiers stationed there remain in harm's way. Nearly two
million troops face off across a heavily fortified demilitarized zone.
Three decades of on-again, off-again talks between Pyongyang and Seoul
have produced no significant progress in reducing tensions. Although a
cease-fire ending the Korean War was signed in 1953, the two sides
technically remain at war. The Clinton nuclear deal with North Korea
does not deal with the totality of this threat. Nor does it address the
underlying tensions between North and South which are at the heart of
the conflict on the Korean Peninsula.

  <P>   The Clinton deal with North Korea is heavily "front-loaded" in favor
of Pyongyang and makes generous political and financial concessions to the
North. While enhancing its international status through direct dialogue with
the U.S., Pyongyang is allowed substantial delays in fulfilling past promises
to check its nuclear weapons program. For example, the North will keep
intact for ten years or more the nuclear fuel enrichment facility that it
pledged not to possess under a 1992 agreement with the Republic of Korea
(ROK). Under the Clinton agreement, therefore, full nuclear transparency in
the North will not be realized for a decade or longer.
 <P>
     However, the nuclear issue is by no means the only threat to vital
U.S. interests on the peninsula. A key flaw in the Administration's Korea
policy is its excessive focus on the nuclear problem. Left inadequately
addressed is the continuing high state of tensions between North and South
Korea and the immediate danger posed by the North's massive military
force, which includes chemical and biological weapons and long-range
missiles. The death of yet another American soldier at the hands of the
world's most volatile communist regime should remind Americans that, on
the Korean Peninsula, serious threats to U.S. interests linger. The
Administration should be pressed to rethink its short-sighted policy and
vigorously pursue progress in North-South tension reduction.
<P>
     The October 21 agreement between the U.S. and North Korea needs
to be strengthened. In particular, its clauses to reduce tensions between the
North and South, if handled appropriately, could serve important mutual
U.S. and ROK interests. The Clinton Administration, however, does not
appear adequately prepared or even willing to apply appropriate pressure on
Pyongyang to abide by these clauses. The State Department, for example,
which brokered the deal with Pyongyang, has not expressed its intention to
link steps toward reducing tensions with the benefits offered to the North
under the agreement.
<P>
<B> Congress Should Intervene</B>
<P>     To get U.S.-Korea policy on track, Congress needs to take a more
active role. While limited in its ability to make foreign policy, Congress
does have the mechanism of a Joint Resolution to express its will. Thus,
through a Joint Resolution, it should now construct precise policy guidelines
to improve the protection of America's interests and those of its South
Korean ally. 
<P>
     A framework already exists for reducing North-South tensions: the
Reconciliation and Denuclearization Agreements ratified by Seoul and
Pyongyang in 1992. The many ambitious commitments made in these pacts,
such as opening the border to citizen exchanges, have never been
implemented, and the Clinton Administration, for all intents and purposes,
has ignored them, preferring a direct approach to Pyongyang.
<P>
     Recent statements by State Department officials indicate that the
Clinton Administration chooses not to get directly or systematically involved
in promoting the North-South dialogue. The process is the responsibility
primarily of the Koreans themselves, these officials say. Yet, without
appropriate and consistent pressure, North Koreans will continue to avoid
contact with the South in hopes of isolating the ROK and driving a wedge
between Seoul and Washington.
 <P>
     The time is right for Congress to press the Clinton Administration
for improved North-South relations. With a large U.S. troop presence in the
South and a resulting defense burden costing American taxpayers more than
$2 billion per year, it clearly is in the vital national security interest of the
U.S. to promote substantive inter-Korean political, economic, social, and
military confidence-building measures and tension reduction. Such progress
not only would ease the threat of conflict, but also would begin to pry the
lid off North Korea's closed society and open the way for eventual reform
there. It also would assuage an increasingly nervous South Korean
government and populace who believe they have been sold short by
Washington.
<P>
<B> Use America's Considerable Leverage</B>
   <P>  The North Koreans likely will resist such actions and complain
loudly and bitterly. However, they desperately want the new agreement to
survive so they can reap significant gains. They are eager for a massive aid
package -- conservatively estimated at more than $4 billion -- that will be
funded mainly by Seoul and Tokyo. Also eagerly anticipated in Pyongyang
are diplomatic recognition by the Clinton Administration and an end to the
U.S. trade embargo. Finally, Pyongyang is obliged to pursue tension
reduction under Section III of the October 21 agreement with the U.S.,
under which North Korea agreed that it will "engage in North-South
dialogue" and "take steps to implement the North-South Joint Declaration
on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."
 <P>
     Since the North reaps great benefits from its deal with the U.S.,
America has some leverage over Pyongyang. Thus, a strong show of U.S.
determination is in order. It was a lack of political will that led the
Administration to make too many concessions to Pyongyang on October 21.
Past experience indicates that the North will be compelled to behave
responsibly only when Washington follows a steady, strong course. America
also should look for support in these endeavors from China, North Korea's
largest trading partner, and Japan, which eventually is expected to offer
Pyongyang a generous assistance package after normalization of relations
with the South. If Pyongyang balks at a dialogue with Seoul, this should
trigger trade pressure on the North by Beijing and Tokyo and the delay of
Japanese-North Korean diplomatic normalization.
<P>
<B> A Joint Resolution</B>
   <P>  To strengthen the standing of the U.S. and its allies under the
agreement, Congress should consider a Joint Resolution recommending that
the Clinton Administration:
<P>
Press for immediate resumption of long-stalled North-South talks and link
implementation of the October 21 U.S.-North Korea agreement with
substantive and rapid progress in reducing tensions. This position is
consistent with the spirit and letter of the agreement. Section III of the pact
calls for improvements in North-South relations.
<P>
Revive the Reconciliation and Denuclearization Agreements between Seoul
and Pyongyang. These agreements were ratified but never implemented.
 <P>
Appoint a seasoned negotiator as a presidential envoy to communicate
directly with Pyongyang regarding this new policy and to coordinate with
South Korea and other concerned nations.
<P>
     In concert with Seoul, the Administration should identify timetables
for reducing North-South tensions through:
<P>
Dismantling promptly the North's nuclear reprocessing facility.
Exchanging North-South liaison offices.
<P>
Expanding North-South trade relations.
<P>
Opening the border to free travel and communication by citizens of each
side.
<P>
Providing for mutual notification of major troop movements and major
military exercises.
<P>
Pulling back troops from both sides of the demilitarized zone.
Introducing phased reductions of armaments and troops.
<P>
Replacing the current cease-fire with a North-South peace treaty.
<P>
     Congress should require that, within three months of the resolution's
passage, the Administration report to Congress on the progress it has made
in implementing both the October 21 agreement and these recommendations.
If Congress is not satisfied, it should consider using its budgetary authority
to curtail or block altogether the generous benefits bestowed upon
Pyongyang by the October 21 U.S.-North Korea agreement.

<TITLE>THE REAL THREAT TO U.S. SOVEREIGNTY -- Heritage </TITLE>

<H3>The Real Threat To U.S. Sovereignty</H3>
Joe Cobb Speaking in Heritage's Van Andel Center, August 1, 1994
<P>
<br>
     The new GATT agreement and the proposed World Trade Organization
(WTO) has sparked a vigorous debate among conservatives in this
country, and in some cases the argument has taken on an ugly tone.
Last year H.Ross Perot was so visible during the NAFTA debate that I
think some conservatives look upon his populist-oriented followers as
potentially natural recruits for the conservative constituency. The
unpopularity of President Clinton in general, and among conservatives
in particular, makes it simply incomprehensible to some that a
conservative institution like The Heritage Foundation could support
the proposed World Trade Organization.
   <P>  When I was growing up in Kansas, as a teenage Goldwater
supporter, we used to speak contemptuously about the "Liberal Eastern
Establishment." Now I find my populist conservative friends think that
I am one of them, because I support GATT and the WTO. But what I do
think is quite funny is that all of the conservatives who oppose the
WTO are making the same arguments against it that Ralph Nader has been
making. Both Ralph Nader and Pat Buchanan call the WTO "world
government." Nader testified before the House Ways and Means Committee
on February 1, 1994, that
<P>
     <UL>The Uruguay Round negotiations would strengthen and
     formalize a world economic government dominated by giant
     corporations, without a correlative democratic rule of law
     to hold this economic government accountable. .. .. .. The
     provisions of trade agreements, if approved by Congress,
     could undermine existing U.S. domestic law, not only in the
     direct regulation of commerce, but in areas ranging from
     food and auto safety to natural resource conservation.</UL>
     <P>
By implication, Nader is saying a world government would dominate the
United States just as the federal government today dominates our state
legislatures.
    <P> There are two questions we need to answer in reply to Ralph Nader
and others who also fear "world government." The first is the factual
question about U.S. domestic law and whether the World Trade
Organization has any authority to change it. Second is how our
political relationship with other nations might change, as a member of
the WTO, which could powerfully influence the U.S. Congress to "go
along," and adopt or repeal laws that regulate trade.
   <P>  Before we address those two issues, however, I think we need to
digress into an inquiry in political theory. The concept of
"sovereignty" is at the center of this debate, but I haven't seen
anyone really define the term very well, much less to look at what it
means to us in the United States. Let me turn first to that question.
<P>
United States Sovereignty: We the People<P>
     What is a threat to United States sovereignty? We need to have a
clear idea what sovereignty is before we can answer the question. In
general terms, we understand sovereignty to mean a nation's
independence from other governments, and its freedom of choice to act
politically. In history, there are many examples of sovereignty
concentrated in a single ruler like the tsar-autocrats of Russia, or
the French King Louis XIV, who declared, "I am the state." But states
today have elaborate procedures that decentralize their sovereignty,
for example, through periodic elections, independent courts, etc. For
a constitutional republic like the United States, our sovereignty also
includes an important central element described in the phrase,
"Congress shall make no law.... "
    <P> We reject the idea that a king is sovereign, and we reject the
idea that a few hundred congressmen in Washington are sovereign, even
if we do have a right to vote for some of them. We say "the people are
sovereign," and in a society based on individual rights this is more
than a slogan. The U.S. Constitution makes its clearest general
statement of popular sovereignty in the Bill of Rights, Amendment IX:
"The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be
construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people."
   <P>  Sovereignty includes not only our right to feel safe against a
foreign army's invasion and to vote for those who make our laws, but
it also touches a family's daily economic life, the right to own
property, and to work and invest in private businesses. A large part
of our sovereign "independence from government and freedom of choice
to act politically" comes from the decentralized power of a free
market economy. Popular political movements rely on fundraising and
volunteers, who need the economic independence only a competitive
capitalist economy provides. Democracy depends on a free market
economic system, which in turn is based on consumer sovereignty, which
is really "voting with dollars" for our favorite products and
services. American political sovereignty is necessarily tied to the
people's right to sell or buy whatever they find useful.
    <P> The claim that our sovereignty is threatened by the new GATT
agreement has a false premise. U.S. sovereignty isn't threatened by
fair trade rules that make it harder for lobbyists in Washington to
get special favors and trade protections from Congress, at the expense
of the average American family. The real threat to U.S. sovereignty is
from the "nationalization" of it -- the concerted effort by special
interests and lobbyists to focus all power over the American economic
system in the hands of Congress and the bureaucrats in Washington who
regulate us.
<P>
GATT and the Principle of Equal Rules<P>
     The GATT, and the WTO, are based on a series of "executive
agreements" going back to 1948. Congress authorized the President --
starting with F.D.R. and every President since -- to negotiate and
sign new GATT agreements, and Congress subsequently passed the laws to
implement those agreements, which cut tariffs, repealed quotas, and
made U.S. statutes reflect the GATT rules that other countries were
also adopting. The GATT started in 1948 to draw up rules for fair
international trade, to define certain equal rights under which all
governments agree to permit non-citizens to do business with their own
people.
    <P> The Uruguay Round of negotiations that produced the new GATT
agreement was initiated by the United States at a conference in
Uruguay in 1986. In 1988, Congress instructed the U.S. negotiators to
ask for new, stronger powers to resolve trade disputes, because other
countries often violate the GATT rules and deny equal rights to
Americans. These new powers to insist that governments follow the GATT
rules are now the most controversial issue about the WTO.
   <P>  What is most remarkable about the GATT, during its almost 50
years of existence, is the purely voluntary nature of it. A
government's membership in GATT is like membership in a chess club: if
you join, you agree to play by the rules, but nobody can arrest you if
you break a rule. The penalty is that others will then refuse to play
with you. The essential nature of a "trade sanction" is that it
represents the partial withdrawal of the equal rights that member
governments in GATT extend to each other's citizens. If one government
is found to be violating the rules, other GATT members reciprocally
"violate" the rules against it in turn by imposing a tariff, which
would otherwise be against the rules, on some imports from the
violating country.
  <P>   But the GATT rules are not self-enforcing on the government of
the United States. The nations that negotiate GATT rules, and the U.S.
executive branch, have to wait for Congress to pass specific laws to
give those rules any authority over U.S. citizens. The legal status of
GATT is technically a "non-self-executing Executive Agreement." To
implement it, Congress has to adopt whatever legal changes the
agreement calls for. A treaty with a foreign nation is an example of a
self-executing agreement, which has the status of law in U.S. courts
when ratified. The GATT agreement has less legal weight than a treaty,
which is executed by Senate ratification.
 <P>    A lot of hot air has been blown over the issue that the United
States would have only one vote among about 120 members, but this fact
misses the point that the WTO is not a legislature and a new GATT rule
is not U.S. law. The "voting" argument is a distraction. Future
amendments to GATT are not the issue. The real objections that
opponents have to the WTO and GATT are already printed in the text of
the Uruguay Round agreement. Market opening reforms will force some
protected industries to make unwelcome adjustments to a global
economy. Any future amendment proposals would still be "non-self-
executing" under U.S. law and if Congress refused to adopt them, they
wouldn't have much impact on the world's largest free market economy.
<P>
A "Supreme Court" of Trade?<P>
   <P>  Pat Buchanan likes to call the World Trade Organization a
"supreme court of trade," which echoes ominously in conservative ears,
particularly for those who are angered by Roe v. Wade and other
sweeping judicial decisions that have centralized the American
government over two centuries. The opposition of Pat Buchanan and
Ralph Nader, to the WTO dispute settlement procedures is a more
substantive objection, but a dispute settlement ruling cannot be
likened to a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court because it simply would
not have the force of law.
  <P>   As part of the 1988 Trade Act, Congress instructed the U.S. Trade
Representative to negotiate "for more effective and expeditious...
resolution of disputes and... better enforcement of United States
rights." Since 1948, the United States has been the most active user
of the dispute settlement process. As the world's largest exporter,
U.S. business people are continually running up against discrimination
in foreign countries.<P>
     Under the GATT's old dispute settlement procedures, governments
always reserved the right to walk away from the arbitration if they
were about to lose. A dispute panel could be blocked from reporting
violations of the GATT rules. Under the new procedures, a dispute
settlement report cannot be blocked; in each case, it will be
finished. If a government is found to be discriminating against the
citizens of another country, in violation of the GATT rules, the
plaintiff can ask for "compensation." This might take the form of
"sanctions," new tariffs imposed on imports from the violating
country, or anything else both sides might agree on.
   <P>  Opponents of the World Trade Organization have tried to make
"sanctions" sound like a tax on America, imposed by a world government
in which the United States would be vastly outvoted. But a trade
sanction is a tariff on imports. The country that "won" a dispute
settlement case would get the right to put a tax on its own people who
import goods from the country that the WTO panel found to be violating
the GATT rules.
  <P>   The real power of a dispute settlement decision is to embarrass a
country that loses an arbitration, because it will have been shown to
be "cheating" on the rules it agreed to, and that every other
government has agreed to respect. Other governments thereafter can
respond to its proposals for trade concessions with questions about
hypocrisy, double standards, faithlessness, and unreliability.
<P>The "Nationalization" of Sovereignty<P>
     The second concern of opponents to the World Trade Organization
is how much our relationship with other nations would change. Other
nations can accuse the United States of violating the GATT rules. If
dispute settlement decisions ruled in favor of foreign governments,
there is a good chance that Congress would make further changes in
U.S. law. This is where activists like Ralph Nader, as well as other
special interests and corporate lobbyists become very concerned about
the influence of the WTO over U.S. "sovereignty." It would compete
directly with the influence they worked so hard to earn, or have paid
so much to buy.
   <P> The political process in Washington is famously described as a
game of special interest lobbying for tax loopholes, pork barrel
spending, laws and regulations that make some giant corporations rich
and restrict competition. The lobbying by some American industries for
trade protection is no different from what they do for other causes.
The most important difference is the "us" versus "them" rhetoric.
Whenever a special interest gets a subsidy or a congressional district
gets a federal government project, we can understand how millions of
other taxpayers are paying for it. Some Americans are better off, and
some are worse off. In the debate over trade policy, however, the
rhetoric takes on the color of foreign policy, sovereignty, and an
implied common interest of all Americans.
    <P> This is what I call the nationalization of sovereignty, where
individual rights no longer count and popular sovereignty disappears,
replaced by some statist idea of the government's sovereignty.
Congress has the power to legislate tariffs and to restrict
international trade in a thousand ways. A domestic industry that faces
foreign competition -- which simply means that some other Americans
have a greater freedom of choice among larger numbers of products and
suppliers -- might lobby Congress to get restrictions imposed on
foreign producers. When the government grants this special favor to
the lobbyists and their clients, it hurts other Americans, and reduces
their choices of available products. Our government tells them they
have to pay higher prices or accept lower quality, at the mercy of the
protected domestic industry.
     <P>
Denying Equal Rights to Other Americans<P>
     The example of steel producers and steel users is a classic case
of trade restrictions that actually hurt more Americans than they
benefit. There was an article in the Journal of Commerce last March
about the problems of steel users. The U.S. steel industry is one of
the most politically active in restricting trade, but the precision
metalforming industry is far larger than the steel industry. It
consumes more than 25 percent of the nation's steel production. There
are more than 1,200 companies in 38 states, with more than 300,000
employees. This is twice as many workers as in the steel industry
itself.
 <P>    The president of one company, Raymond Hopp of the H.K. Metalcraft
Manufacturing Corp. of Lodi, N.J., which makes gaskets and other
automotive products, is quoted saying, "If we can't buy steel at world
prices, everything could come apart; it could make the difference
between a profit and a loss." Another specialized auto parts producer,
A.J. Rose Manufacturing Co. of Cleveland, requires particular
tolerances, the honing of the metal for a specific purpose, that
domestic steel suppliers will not guarantee. It has to bring in
imported steel, at a premium price, to satisfy its customers,
according to its president, Robert D. Pritchard. Nevertheless, U.S.
domestic steel producers lobby Congress very actively for trade
restrictions and file actions with the U.S. Department of Commerce to
impose tariffs on the imported steel these companies need.
    <P> Under the rules of GATT, some trade restrictions that industry
lobbyists obtain from Congress could be challenged by other countries.
They could file dispute settlement cases and ask the World Trade
Organization to determine if the United States were violating the GATT
rules. Although the dispute actions would be filed by other
governments, on behalf of their own citizens who believe they are
being unfairly discriminated against by U.S. trade restrictions, there
would actually be many American citizens represented in those actions,
with interests directly opposite the official position of the U.S.
law, as the precision metalforming companies prove. For every foreign
producer who sells goods in the United States there are Americans who
make the choice to buy those goods. It is wrong to pretend those
Americans have no rights, or no share as citizens in U.S. sovereignty
just because Congress has attempted to nationalize it.
<P>
Opening Up the Democratic Process<P>
     As a conservative advocate of the free market system, I believe
the World Trade Organization will actually open up more issues for
democratic debate about economic regulation in the United States, and
around the world. Every country has a wide diversity of economic
interests, both as producers and consumers. The fact that governments
have traditionally been protectionist and mercantilist is a sad
commentary on the unequal influence in the political process that
lobbyists have. During the great age of American protectionism, we
should remember, the U.S. Senate was so corrupted by bribery and
influence-selling that it led to the 17th Amendment and the anti-trust
laws, which might have been unnecessary if we could have simply
repealed the tariffs those trusts and monopolies depended on.
   <P>  Popular sovereignty, as conceived in the Bill of Rights, is
actually strengthened by GATT's dispute settlement procedures. The
more powerful industrial lobbyists have an advantage in Washington,
but the general rules of fair trade are in the broader interest of
more Americans, who are not as powerful or don't spend as much on
lawyers and politicians to gain influence. If a WTO dispute settlement
decision reported that the United States had violated the GATT rules,
and Congress acted to amend U.S. laws to follow the rules, clearly the
"sovereign" interests of many more Americans would be honored, not
violated, by that congressional response to an embarrassment like
violating an agreement to treat others fairly, with equal rights.
    <P> The real threat to U.S. sovereignty is the drive to "nationalize"
it -- the concerted effort by special interests and lobbyists to focus
all power over the American economic system in the hands of the
bureaucrats in Washington who regulate us. I don't think the opponents
of GATT really understand what popular sovereignty and the free market
are all about. The most populist and democratic institution ever to
evolve in human society is the free market, with strong protections
for private property rights, and the freedom of average people to buy
whatever they think is best for their families -- regardless of the
economic nostrums of protectionists. The bottom line is whether you
believe in nationalizing our sovereignty and making the power of the
federal government stronger. As a conservative, I believe in the form
of constitutional "limited government" our Founders established. The
World Trade Organization is no threat to limited, constitutional
government.

Duplantier</a> <br>
January 11, 1996<br></i><hr><h2> MSAs Could Save Medicare</h2></center><P> 
[Employees at the Golden Rule Insurance Company in Indianapolis are 
staunch supporters of the proposed Medicare reform called the Medical 
Savings Account. That's because all 1200 employees already have MSAs] 
 
 <P>
The Golden Rule Insurance Company is America's leading writer of 
individual health policies, with 800,000 policyholders and nearly $800 
million in annual revenue. Golden Rule is also the nation's number-one 
promoter of Medical Savings Accounts (known as MSAs), having signed 
up nearly 1000 companies for its MSA group plan. The company is so 
keen on Medical Savings Accounts that it even established an MSA 
group plan for its own employees two years ago, says reporter Bob Jones 
in a recent issue of World magazine. "Golden Rule Chairman Pat Rooney 
has made it his mission to show that MSAs actually work." 
 <P>
Jones explains the logic behind MSAs: "Health care costs will be 
controlled only when people start spending their own money instead of 
the insurance company's. To accomplish this, Medicare would offer 
seniors a new, high-deductible policy. The higher deductible means lower 
premiums; the savings are deposited to an account from which 
individuals can pay- for medical bills that fall below the deductible. 
When expenses in any year exceed the deductible," Jones continues, "the 
catastrophic insurance kicks in, paying 100 percent of remaining bills 
(instead of the 80 percent now covered by Medicare)." 
 <P>
If an individual spends less than his deductible, whatever remains in his 
MSA is "rolled over into a tax-free annuity that can be used to pay future 
medical bills or provide long-term care. This system," Jones says, 
"provides an incentive for seniors to become smart health care 
consumers, costs them no more than the current system, and at the same 
time offers more flexibility and greater benefits." 
 <P>
Under proposed Medicare reforms, "MSAs would be tax deductible like 
IRAs, making them enormously attractive not only to private businesses, 
but also to the millions of self-employed. Even without that tax 
exemption," says Jones, "MSAs have been hugely successful at a few 
pioneering companies like Golden Rule [where] health care costs 
dropped 40 percent the first year that MSAs were implemented." Medical 
Savings Accounts are even more popular among employees, says Jones, 
citing a 1994 study that found a satisfaction level of 98 percent. MSAs 
have even encouraged Golden Rule employees to take better care of 
themselves. "More than a quarter of employees are taking advantage of 
some medical service they never used before, simply because the money 
is there and they can choose how to spend it without having to worry that 
it won't be covered under their policy," says Jones. 
 <P>
The current Medicare trust fund surplus of $130 billion is expected to 
dwindle to zero in seven years. "By 2004," says Jones, "Medicare will 
face a deficit of more than $100 billion." Medical Savings Accounts are 
just what the doctor ordered to avert that grim prospect.

<h2>Pursuit of Happiness</h2></center><P> 

[Along with our lives, the promise of salvation and the means through 
Christ are undoubtedly the greatest gifts ever bestowed on mankind.]
<P>
Inspiration and a close examination of God's plan in nature enabled pre-
Christian Greek and Roman philosophers to formulate reasonably 
effective systems for right living and right government. Yet God himself, 
the acknowledged source of all true law, saw fit to promulgate His codes 
more directly. First He gave us His Ten Commandments through Moses, 
and then He sent His only Son to reaffirm those commandments and to 
offer us two central laws under which those commandments were 
subsumed: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and 
with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great 
commandment. And the second is like unto it: Thou shalt love thy 
neighbor as thyself."
<P>
In His Sermon on the Mount, Christ made clear that we must obey the 
spirit of God's law and not merely the letter. Surely this is a fantastic 
vision of utopia a world in which men love their enemies and forgive 
them every trespass: in which they do not swear, do not look on women 
lustfully, and do not seek revenge; do their alms and praying privately; 
and take no thought of their own lives of tomorrow. "Be ye therefore 
perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect." Christ 
commanded the multitudes.
<P>
Christ knew that His listeners could not live up to these exacting 
standards without divine assistance, but He presented them as an ideal, 
something to strive for, and He offered us another gift, His grace, by 
which we might truly have hope of attaining perfection. This vision of 
utopia is at once the most unrealistic ever presented to man and at the 
same time the only one that we can really, with God's grace, hope to 
enjoy. It is everything that this world is not, and we must renounce the 
things of this world if we are to share in that one.
<P>
More than 400 years after the birth of Christ, the great Christian 
theologian Augustine gave to the temporal approximation of this utopia 
the name "The City of God" and juxtaposed it to the earthly city: "The 
one consists of those who wish to live after the flesh, the other of those 
who wish to live after the spirit." According to Augustine, the earthly 
city has been formed by "the love of self, even to the contempt of God: 
the heavenly city by the love of God, even to the contempt of self." The 
end of the heavenly city is "peace in eternal life," whereas "the earthly 
city, which does not live by faith, seeks an earthly peace."
<P>
In the 13th century, Thomas Aquinas adapted Aristotle's philosophy to 
the formulation of his own Summa Theologica. Like Aristotle, 
Aquinas maintained that the end of man is happiness, but he insisted 
that this happiness is an eternal one that we cannot obtain in this world.

<title>Oppose UN Children's Rights Treaty -- Duplantier</title></head>

<center><h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES </h4>
<i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.<br>

<hr>
<h2>Oppose UN Children's Rights Treaty</h2></center>
<P>

 
The proposed UN Treaty on the Rights of the Child is a good example of  
why Americans should vigorously oppose all efforts to transform the UN  
into an organization with real authority. This Treaty would override the  
U.S. Constitution, giving the federal government power over children that  
supersedes the rights of parents. 
                <P>
The underlying premise of the United States Constitution is that all  
individuals are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights.  
Our Constitution serves to protect those preexisting rights against  
encroachment by government. So-called human rights treaties proposed  
by the UN, on the other hand, presuppose that individual rights originate  
with the treaties themselves, or with the governments of signatory  
nations. This is a crucial distinction, because what government gives  
government can take away. 
                <P>
The UN Treaty on the Rights of the Child is a case in point. The Treaty  
purports to give the child the right to express his own views freely in all  
matters, to receive information of any kind from whatever source, to  
choose his own religion, and to enjoy "rest and leisure." Back talk and  
blasphemy are therefore protected, as are propaganda and pornography,  
cults and covens, idleness and iniquity -- any interest or activity indulged  
in by an undisciplined child. 
                        <P>
The Treaty would serve to protect these supposed rights of children not  
against the encroachment of government, but against the encroachment of  
parents. By denying the right of parents to raise their offspring as they see  
fit and by encouraging the rebellion of sons and daughters, the Treaty  
would divide the family into warring factions, effectively destroying the  
one institution that truly does protect the rights of children. 
                                   <P>
This UN Treaty stipulates that primary education be "compulsory and  
available free to all," giving no indication as to whether this provision  
would either require the subsidization of private and religious schools or  
prohibit their existence altogether. Prescribing school curriculum with a  
specificity contrary to our custom, the Treaty calls for inculcating in all  
children respect for "the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United  
Nations," for "civilizations different from his or her own," for the  
"equality of sexes," and for "the natural environment." The glorification  
of such things will no doubt be accompanied by the stigmatization of  
religious faith, American culture, heterosexuality, traditional families,  
and private enterprise. 
                 <P>
The Treaty would also require our government to "ensure the  
development of institutions, facilities and services for the care of  
children" and to establish universal standards for protecting young  
persons against neglect, exploitation, and abuse. Refusing to surrender  
one's child to the care of a government-approved institution may be  
presumed to constitute incontrovertible evidence of neglect. Who's to  
decide? A new international bureaucracy, of course, which will be  
established to monitor abuse of the bogus rights created by the Treaty. A  
committee of ten so-called experts will supervise this effort, and you can  
bet your first-born baby that their view of what's proper for your progeny  
will not coincide with yours. 
                        <P>

<h2>The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty </h2></center>
 
The Clinton Administration claims to have abandoned the doctrine of  
Mutual Assured Destruction, but its interpretation of the Anti-Ballistic  
Missile Treaty with the former Soviet Union says otherwise. <p> 
  
  
"The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty is at the heart of the debate on ballistic  
missile defense," say Kim Holmes and Baker Spring of the Heritage  
Foundation. "Whether to proceed more quickly or more slowly to deploy  
missile defenses, and in what way, or whether to proceed at all, is  
determined by how the ABM Treaty is viewed. The strategic assumptions  
underlying the treaty. forged during the Cold War, are very much alive in  
the Clinton Administration. They drive the Administrations approach not  
only to missile defense policy, but also to arms control and even U.S.  
policy toward Russia," Holmes and Baker charge.  <p>
  
The two defense analysts argue that the Clinton Administration's  
interpretation of the ABM Treaty is perpetuating America's vulnerability  
to ballistic missile attack. That interpretation reflects a willingness "to   
defend U.S. allies and forces overseas but leave American citizens and  
territory vulnerable to nuclear attack." Holmes and Baker contend that the  
Administration is "expanding the scope of the ABM Treaty to limit  
theater missile defenses, even though this was never intended b! the  
original architects of the Treaty."  <p>
  
The Clinton Administration calls the ABM Treaty "a cornerstone of  
strategic stability," but disavows the doctrine of Mutual Assured  
Destruction that underlies it. Holmes and Baker point out that "the basic   
assumption behind the ABM Treaty was that the ability of the Soviet  
Union . . . and the United States to destroy each other was the central  
factor in maintaining strategic stability. The ABM Treaty," they say,   
"was designed to ensure that this vulnerability continued." But, if Mutual  
Assured Destruction "is no longer the guiding principle of U.S. doctrine,  
then the ABM Treaty can no longer serve as a cornerstone of strategic  
stability."  <p>
  
The Treaty is not much of an incentive for arms control either. A strong  
U.S. strategic defense program is far more conducive to offensive  
reductions than the ABM Treaty ever was or ever will be," say Holmes   
and Baker. "During the 1980s progress toward offensive reductions  
occurred only after the U.S. made it clear to the Soviets that the Strategic  
Defense Initiative would proceed." Noting that "no major arms control  
agreement with the Russians has been initiated by the Clinton  
Administration. which has scaled back America's missile defense  
programs," the two analysts conclude that "the Russians are quicker to   
reach arms control agreements with the U.S when they face a determined  
U.S. missile defense program than when they face a weak one."  <p>
  
The doctrine of Mutual Assured Destruction should be scrapped once and  
for all, say Holmes and Baker, and replaced with a policy that "seeks to  
prevent potentially hostile forces from obtaining missiles and weapons of  
mass destruction," deters the possessors of such weapons from using  
them, defends against missile attacks once they have begun, and allows  
for preemptive strikes against missile delivery systems.  <p>

Duplantier</a> <br>November 15, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>United Nations Repatriates Asian Refugees</h2></center><P>



       

[The United Nations High Commission on Refugees has long denied 
reports that it mistreats Asian refugees, forcibly returning many of them 
to the Communist countries from which they fled. But now former 
officials of the UN High Commission have come forward to confirm 
those reports.]
<p>
Officials of the United Nations High Cornrnission on Refugees and 
spokesmen from our own State Department persist in claiming that 
screening procedures for the Vietnamese and Laotian refugees detained 
in holding camps in Thailand. Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Indonesia are 
fair and orderly. They also maintain that the poor souls who have been 
repatriated have nothing to fear from the ruthless thugs who rule their 
homelands. These claims have now been challenged, however -- by 
former officials of the UN High Commission itself.
<p>
One such official is Simon Jeans, an Australian attorney who served as a 
legal consultant to the UN High Commission on Refugees in Indonesia 
in 1992. At a recent House of Representatives subcommittee hearing. 
Jeans testified to rampant corruption by the Indonesian officers in charge 
of the refugee camps. "Corruption in Indonesia was systematic," said 
Jeans. Bribes and sexual favors were the price paid for preferential 
treatment.
<p>
Another witness before the House subcommittee was Wa Vue. a leader of 
the Hmong tribal people of Laos. This tribe was an unwavering 
Arnerican ally during the Vietnam war, and its members were postwar 
victims of a violent campaign of genocide by the communist Lao 
government. More than l 00 000 Hmong have found sanctuary in the 
United States, but thousands more live in daily dread of repatriation as 
they languish in the holding camps in Thailand.
<p>
Wa Vue and his father, Vue Mai, were detained in one of those camps. 
Vue Mai was active in a resistance movement known as the United Front 
for the Liberation of Laos. Officials from the UN High Commission and 
the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok persuaded Vue Mai to give up this effort 
and return to Laos. In November 1992 a State Department 
representative, accompanied by Thai and UN officials. escorted Vue Mai 
to the border. He was to meet with Lao officials and arrange for the 
resettlement of a large number of Hmong refugees. In October 1993 he 
disappeared in Laos and has not been heard from since. On February 26, 
1995, the rest of the Vue clan -- except for Vue Mai's wife and his son, 
Wa Vue -- were rounded up and forcibly returned, presumably to suffer a 
similar fate.
<p>
"This tragic tale is further evidence that the United States should 
reexamine its role in refugee screening and treatment in Southeast Asia," 
argues James Tyson, president of the Council for the Defense of 
Freedom. "Contrary to State Department assertions, the House 
subcommittee hearing brought out further evidence that such screening 
is extremely unfair, corrupt, and often violent." Many of the refugees 
from tyrannical regimes in Southeast Asia were loyal allies of the U.S. 
during the Vietnam War, says Tyson. "We have a real obligation to see 
that they receive equitable hearings."

<title>U.S. Postal Service -- Duplantier</title>

<h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES</h4>
<i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.<br>
F.R. Duplantier<br>
October 10, 1995<br></i><hr>

<h2>U.S. Postal Service</h2></center>

One out of five first-class letters entrusted to the United States Postal 
Service arrives late. Nearly a fourth of the Postal Service 's two-day 
Priority Mail takes at least three days to get where it's going The zip code is now four digits longer, but the postal service is showing less and less zip.<p>

"The Postal Service has a well-earned reputation for slow delivery," says 
Gregory Conko of the Competitive Enterprise Institute. More than a 
century of monopoly status has made the Postal Service "complacent and 
slothful," Conko contends. "An over-bureaucratized management and a 
powerfully unionized workforce have resisted improvement and turned 
mediocrity into a perverted trademark."

The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 gave the ostensibly independent 
Postal Service "broad authority to improve management capability, 
modernize antiquated facilities. and allow postal rates to keep pace with 
cost increases." says Conko. "Tragically, the original goal of improving 
the quality and scope of service, while achieving financial self-
sufficiency over a period of years, has never been realized." The extent of 
the Postal Service's failure is reflected in the size of the debt it owes to the U.S. Treasury -- a whopping $9 billion.<p>

Despite its lack of success, the Postal Service has its defenders. They 
argue that "private, commercial rivals -such as Federal Express, United 
Parcel Service, and more than 300 other alternate delivery firms -- are 
willing to compete with the Post Office only for expensive overnight 
service. but have no interest in delivering the lower-priced items.'> 
Conko calls this a "disingenuous argument." since the Postal Service 
enjoys a "legal monopoly on first-class mail." If that monopoly is more of 
a burden than a benefit, as this line of reasoning seems to suggest, then 
there shouldn't be any objection to repealing the monopoly. Once the 
first-class field is open to all comers, it will soon be obvious whether 
anyone wants to compete or not.<p>

"Supporters also argue that private firms wouldn't deliver first-class mail 
to ever home in the country as cheaply as the Postal Service," says 
Conko, but this too is a bogus argument. since the Post Office has never 
delivered to every home nationwide. "There are many areas in the United 
States where the Postal Service will only deliver mail to Post Office 
Boxes," notes Conko. "In some western states, farmers have to travel as 
far as 40 miles to pick up their mail. But private delivery companies often 
target rural areas for service. The Postal Service even contracts out much 
of its rural delivery . . . to private firms." Conko points out that "private competition for first-class mail delivery was alive and well (as well as legal) in the 19th century." Delivery services like the famed Pony Express "offered stiff competition to the government's Post Office, providing better. more timely service and charging lower rates."<p>

Conko applauds congressional proposals to privatize the Postal Service. 
but insists that "the most important aspect of reform remains rescinding 
the postal monopoly.... Real privatization can come later," he argues, "but 
competition is the key to improvement."<p>

<h2>
Religion in America
</h2>



<P><blockquote><i> Millions of Americans are enjoying better health and happier lives than  
they ever imagined, and you can too, once you know the secret. </i></blockquote>
<P> 

Are you suffering from high blood pressure? Does someone in your family  
show signs of depression or substance abuse? Has the fire gone out of your  
married life? Don't despair. Now there's a fast, safe, and simple way to  
overcome these problems -- and it won't cost you an arm and a leg. Sound  
too good to be true? Well, it's not.


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


 
Patrick Fagan of the Heritage Foundation reveals that going to church is  
the secret to better health and a happier life. In a new report called Why  
Religion Matters, Fagan argues that religious practice "strengthens  
individuals, families, communities, and society as a whole. It significantly  
affects educational and job attainment and reduces the incidence of such  
major social problems as out-of-wedlock births, drug and alcohol  
addiction, crime, and delinquency." 
 



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 
Research indicates that church attendance and good cheer go together.  
"Happiness is greater and psychological stress is lower for those who  
attend religious services regularly," notes Fagan. Less stress means better  
health, of course, but the benefits don't stop there. Church attendance also  
leads to happier, longer-lasting marriages. "Regular church attendance is  
the critical factor in marital stability," says Fagan. Even among those who  
have separated from their partners, "reconciliation rates are higher among  
regular church attendees." 
 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


But wait, there's more. "One of the most powerful of all factors in  
preventing out-of-wedlock births is the regular practice of religious belief,  
[which] sharply reduces the incidence of premarital intercourse. The  
reverse is also true," says Fagan. "The absence of religious practice  
accompanies sexual permissiveness and premarital sex." 
 


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;



Still not convinced? What if we told you that "alcohol abuse is 300 percent  
higher among those who do not attend church"? It's true. Not only that, but  
"alcoholics with a religious background or strong religious beliefs are  
much more likely to seek help and treatment." What about suicide? "The  
practice of religion reduces the rate of suicide," says Fagan, more  
effectively than anything else. "Those who attend church frequently are  
four times less likely to commit suicide than those who never attend."  
Church attendance also reduces the incidence of depression, before it can  
lead to suicide. Adolescents are particularly at risk for depression, but they  
"tend to experience fewer anxieties of growing up if they are religious." 
 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;




Patrick Fagan concludes that "regular religious practice is both an  
individual and social good. It is a powerful answer to many of our most  
significant social problems." Going to church is "good for individuals,  
families, states, and the nation. It improves health, learning, economic  
well-being, self-control, self-esteem, and empathy. It reduces the incidence  
of social pathologies, such as out-of-wedlock births, crime, delinquency,  
drug and alcohol addiction, health problems, anxieties, and prejudices."  
So, don't delay. Take advantage of this amazing opportunity now. For a  
happier, healthier life, go to church regularly.

<title>Duplantier: Welfare Reform/GA & OH -- 6/12/96</title>

<h2>Welfare Reform/GA & OH</h2>
<i><blockquote>
<P>
Georgia and Ohio offer two examples of how states are  
moving toward welfare reform.
</I></Blockquote><P>

"Many of the welfare reforms implemented in Georgia in  
recent years lack the boldness of initiatives in other states and  
contain too many exceptions to be truly effective," contends  
Kelly McCutchen of the Georgia Public Policy Foundation in  
Atlanta. Nevertheless, they have had an effect, combining  
with a bustling economy to reduce the welfare rolls by 6,000  
families in a single year. 
 <p>
"Probably the greatest problem facing Georgia's welfare  
system is the state's illegitimacy rate," says McCutchen in the  
May issue of Alternatives in Philanthropy, published by the  
Capital Research Center. The state began to address this  
problem in 1994 by denying cash benefits "to unwed teen  
mothers who choose to live on their own," notes McCutchen.  
"The following year, the number of teen mothers living  
independently dropped by 50 percent." In 1996, the state  
stopped its perverse practice of increasing benefits "to  
welfare recipients who have additional children." 
 <p>
The state should not encourage illegitimacy, nor should it  
subsidize indolence. "Able-bodied welfare recipients who  
quit or refuse to take full-time jobs face a reduction in  
benefits,'' says McCutchen. Under the state's latest initiative,  
called Work First, Georgia is "advising social workers that  
finding jobs for recipients is their number-one objective. It is  
also offering businesses tax credits and subsidies, giving  
them an incentive to hire and train welfare recipients." 
 <p>
McCutchen argues that there are "three key elements of  
welfare reform." The first is establishment of paternity. "The  
state," she says, "must send a clear message to teenage boys  
that they will be held financially responsible for any children  
they engender." The second key element of welfare reform is  
benefit reduction. "Welfare recipients should not be better off  
than those who work," she says. The third element is a work  
requirement. "Welfare recipients must not be allowed to stay  
at home and collect benefits." The ultimate objective of  
welfare reform, however, is to get community-based  
organizations back in the driver's seat. "When government  
moved into social welfare," notes McCutchen, "other  
institutions -- families, businesses, churches, and charities --  
were shunted aside. They must once again assume primary  
roles." 
<p> 
In the same issue of Alternatives in Philanthropy, Samuel  
Staley and Douglas Hyne of the Buckeye Institute for Public  
Policy Solutions in Dayton report that General Assistance in  
Ohio "began to be phased out in 1992 and was eliminated in  
1995. This has already saved the state $900 million," they  
observe. Ohio has also implemented a program called JOBS,  
which stands for Job Opportunities and Basic Skills. The  
program "requires a large number of welfare recipients to  
enroll in job-training programs. Refusal to participate results  
in a loss of welfare benefits,'' say Staley and Hyne.  
"Combined with state-mandated self-sufficiency contracts  
that outline steps recipients must take to prepare for  
employment, Ohio's JOBS participation sanctions are  
considered some of the toughest in the nation."

Duplantier</a> <br>December 5, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Legal Redistribution of Wealth Unjust</h2></center><P>
[Our legal system can be just, or it can be philanthropic, but it cannot be 
both.] 
 <p>
"Self-preservation and self-development are common aspirations among 
all people. And if everyone enjoyed the unrestricted use of his faculties 
and the free disposition of the fruits of his labor, social progress would be 
. . . uninterrupted," observed the l9th Century French economist Frederic 
Bastiat in a small book titled "The Law," published in 1850. "But there is 
also another tendency that is common among people. When they can, 
they wish to live and prosper at the expense of others." 
 <p>
In order to live, legally, at someone else's expense, it is necessary to turn 
the law into "an instrument of plunder." No matter how noble the 
justification, once the premise is accepted that a government can 
expropriate the wealth of some of its citizens and dispense it to others, 
theft has been legalized, and the signal has been sent -- to haves and 
havenots alike -- that nothing is secure. Bastiat considered this the 
greatest evil to which any society can be subjected, but recognized it as 
the ultimate goal of all greedy men and do-gooders. The ill effects of 
such a transformation are predictable. When the law ceases to be just, 
respect for it diminishes, and society suffers.  "The safest way to make 
laws respected is to make them respectable," said Bastiat. "When law and 
morality contradict each other, the citizen has the cruel alternative of 
either losing his moral sense or losing his respect for the law." 
 <p>
Bastiat argued that "the most peaceful, the most moral, and the happiest 
people" in the world are to be found in "countries where the law least 
interferes with private affairs; where government is least felt; where the 
individual has the greatest scope, and free opinion the greatest influence; 
where administrative powers are fewest and simplest; where taxes are 
lightest...." Their bliss shall continue only so long as each citizen 
remembers that "the existence of persons and property preceded the 
existence of the legislator, and his function is only to guarantee their 
safety." 
 <p>
Inevitably, though, there will be some who think they are better than the 
rest of us. "Too many persons place themselves above mankind," said 
Bastiat; "they make a career of organizing it, patronizing it, and ruling it." <p>
But mankind does not need their help. "God has given to men all that is 
necessary for them to accomplish their destinies." Bastiat had no use for 
"quacks and organizers . . . with their artificial systems!" He denounced 
"the whims of governmental administrators, their socialized projects, 
their centralization, their tariffs, their government schools, their state 
religions, their free credit, their bank monopolies, their regulations, their 
restrictions, their equalization by taxation, and their pious moralizations!" 
 <p>
Bastiat's challenge to the do-gooders bears frequent repetition: "You who 
think that you are so great! You who judge humanity to be so small! You 
who wish to reform everything! Why don't you reform yourselves?"

<h2>
MOSHER ON CHINA
</h2>

<P><blockquote><i>  
It's almost too bizarre to be believed, but reports of fetal cannibalism in 
communist China have been confirmed.
</blockquote></i>


<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The rumors circulated for months, and the decent Americans who heard 
them fervently hoped that they were fabricated. Then, documentation 
appeared, and reputable religious and conservative publications had no 
choice but to file their disturbing news reports. The mainstream media 
have yet to acknowledge the unpleasant reality, but even they will not be 
able to ignore it forever.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In an interview published in the January issue of the Rutherford Institute's 
monthly journal, the executive director of Human Life International's 
Population Research Institute confirms that aborted fetuses are consumed 
for health purposes in China and blames the communist government in 
Beijing for making this revolting practice possible. With as many as 14 
million abortions performed in China in a single year, "there's an ample 
supply of aborted fetuses," says Steven Mosher. Noting that the Chinese 
government is "an avowedly atheistic one which regards human beings 
only as highly evolved apes," Mosher argues that the utilitarian mindset 
inculcated in the Chinese people by their government is what "gives rise 
to fetal consumption."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Don't say it can't happen here, because it can. American society is also 
infected with utilitarianism, and the symptoms of this morally bankrupt 
philosophy are all around us. Mosher warns that "there's very little going 
on in China that isn't happening to one degree or another in the United 
States." The Chinese perform late-term abortions, and so do we. The 
Chinese forcibly sterilize women of child-bearing age, and the practice of 
tying tubes without asking is not unheard-of in American hospitals. The 
Chinese use "surplus" babies for cruel experiments, and we use fetal 
tissue from "surplus" babies for our own sickening scientific studies.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"In China," observes Mosher, "the use of ultrasound technology to detect 
defects in the unborn child is very common, and many fetuses are aborted 
for the sole reason that they happen to be female. But in the United States 
it's not illegal to abort children for reasons of gender, and it's quite 
common to abort children because a test has revealed a possible 
chromosomal defect."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
China's war on its own children will eventually spread to its elderly. 
Noting that "the population of China is aging more rapidly than any 
human population in the history of the world," as a direct result of its 
coercive birth control program, Mosher predicts that "China's future will 
involve a massive campaign of euthanasia." In fact, the elderly are 
already being denied medical treatment in Chinese hospitals "on the 
ground that treating them is not cost-effective."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mosher warns that China's self-consuming culture represents "one 
possible future of the United States." He notes that "there is a certain 
element of the radical environmentalist movement which believes that the 
population of the United States . . . should be reduced by half." If we 
don't make a convincing case for life, they may get their wish.

<title> MORE MILITARY BASES NEED TO BE CLOSED -- Heritage </title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><i><h3>MORE MILITARY BASES NEED TO BE CLOSED</i></h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/spring.htm">Baker Spring</a><br>
Senior Policy Analyst<br>
Backgrounder #1042<br>
July 18, 1995<br>
</center>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
	Congress initiated a process for closing military bases in 1988 when it became clear that the United States was going to reduce the size of its military forces after the Cold War. To provide guidance on base-closing decisions, Congress created the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission, an independent body of eight individuals with  expertise in defense policy. The commission was assigned the responsibility of deciding which military bases will be closed or realigned and submitting its recommendations to the President and Congress.
<p>

	Until recently, the base closure process had been successful. Independent commissions made recommendations to reduce defense infrastructure in 1988, 1991, and 1993. The President and Congress ultimately adopted each of the packages of recommendations, and the closure and realignment decisions are being implemented. But the latest round of base closings, which is the last currently planned, has been flawed in several important respects. The process has been politicized by the White House. Anticipated budget savings have been disappointingly meager. And base closures have lagged behind reductions in military forces, personnel, and budgets. There still are too many bases for the size of the U.S. armed forces anticipated by Administration policy.
<p>
	  The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission submitted its recommendations to the President on July 1. These include decisions to close 28 major bases, realign 22 major bases, and close or realign a larger number of minor bases. President Clinton on July 13 reluctantly accepted the commission's recommendations. As Congress considers these recommendations, there are several problems with the base closure and realignment process that must be addressed. Each presents an opportunity for a legislative remedy. Congress should:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Accept the findings of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission.</b> The military services need to close bases. The retention of unneeded bases will impose a financial drain on the military at a time when its budget has been reduced. The money saved by closing bases can be used to fund vital military readiness and modernization programs. The base closure process, therefore, must move forward. A decision by Congress to reject the findings of the commission will require the military to absorb the cost of maintaining 22 major bases and a larger number of minor bases it does not need.
<br>
<li><b>Extend the base closure process for another two rounds.</b> The closing of military bases still lags behind the reduction in military forces, personnel, and budgets. While defense budgets have declined by about 35 percent in real terms between FY1985 and FY1994, and military personnel levels have dropped by 25 percent over the same time, the size of base infrastructure has fallen by only 15 percent. This year's list of base closures and realignments submitted by the Department of Defense, as modified by the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission, makes it likely this lag will continue. Since this is the last round of base closures authorized by Title XXIX of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 1991, Congress should extend the closure and realignment process for another two rounds.
<br>
<li><b>Increase its oversight of the process by which the Administration recommends base closures to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission.</b> According to numerous press reports, the White House may have politicized the process of base closings by pressing the Department of Defense to remove bases from the closure list in states that loom large in next year's presidential race. This process was established with the intent of separating political considerations from base closure decisions. Congress needs to call the Clinton White House to account if it has attempted to politicize the process. It can start by holding hearings on whether there were attempts by aides at the White House to intervene.
<br>
<li><b>Reduce the cost of closing bases.</b> The ultimate goal of the base closure process is to reduce the cost of carrying unnecessary infrastructure. This will free up money to support military readiness and modernization. It has become apparent, however, that it is costing the Pentagon considerable sums of money to shut down the bases and that savings are not realized until years later. Congress can ease this problem by scaling back the environmental and other regulations that drive up the initial costs of closing bases. This includes shortening the lengthy process for evaluating the environmental status of bases about to closed. Further, Congress should ensure that such closing costs come not from the defense budget, badly strapped by cuts, but from such other federal accounts as the environmental account or the community development account.
<br>
<li><b>Privatize military depots.</b> The cost of performing depot maintenance is too high. In addition to making recommendations for closing or realigning regular military bases, the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission has the power to recommend closing military depots, which are logistical and maintenance facilities. The rate of closing depots is roughly the same as that for regular military bases. Congress could spur this process by enacting legislation to privatize many of the maintenance duties now performed at Defense Department depots.
</ul>
<p>


<b>THE BASE CLOSURE PROCESS IN PERSPECTIVE</b>
<p>
	The Reagan Administration began the base closure process in 1988. Subsequent recommendations for reductions were adopted in 1991 and 1993. Since Cold War defense budgets peaked in 1985 and major military personnel reductions began in 1990, the process has run concurrently with the general budget and force reductions at the Pentagon.
<p>
	But the base closure process has not led to a reduction in military infrastructure that is commensurate with other defense cutbacks. While defense budgets have declined by about 35 percent in real terms between FY 1985 and FY 1994, and military personnel levels have dropped by 25 percent over the same time, the base infrastructure has fallen by only 15 percent as measured in replacement value (see Chart 1).1  The same lag appears between base closures and reductions in military forces. For example, during the period covering FY 1988 through FY 1994, the Army shed eight divisions or, roughly 30 percent of its force structure. Yet base reductions involving all the services, as measured in replacement value, have fallen by just 15 percent. Similar comparisons can be made for the Air Force and Navy (see  Chart 2).
<p>
	The  budget savings derived from the three previous rounds of base closings are disappointing. The Pentagon estimates net savings to the defense budget from all three of the previous rounds of base closures at just $3.1 billion (1996 dollars).2  Savings have been lower than might be expected because the cost of shutting down the bases was $13.1 billion (in 1996 dollars).3  Absent the closure costs, the savings would be $16.2 billion (in 1996 dollars). After the payment of closure costs, the estimated annual savings are $4.2 billion (again in 1996 dollars).4<p>	Excess  depot capacity is likely to be as great a problem as excess military infrastructure. As military equipment inventories have fallen, the depots to service this equipment have not been eliminated. For example, between 1988 and 1994 the Air Force reduced the number of fighter and attack aircraft authorized for deployment by almost 50 percent. Assuming Air Force depots have been reduced at roughly the same rate as bases generally, the depots have been reduced by only 15 percent.5<p><b>THE PENTAGON'S RECOMMENDATIONS ON BASE CLOSURES</b><p>	The Department of Defense forwarded its recommendations for closing and realigning bases to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission on February 28, 1995. The recommendations proposed closing 33 major bases or facilities and realigning (closing a portion of a base or moving one or more of its functions) 26 others. A larger number of smaller facilities would be closed or realigned. As measured in replacement value, the recommendations would have reduced defense infrastructure by about 6 percent. Assuming this is the last round, all the rounds combined would reduce military infrastructure by 21 percent from 1991 levels, as measured in replacement value.6<p>	The recommendations of the Department of Defense do not go far enough. The resulting base structure will be too large for the size of the U.S. armed forces. For example, the Clinton Administration's projected defense budget for the year 2000 wou
ld be 58 percent of the 1985 defense budget in real terms. The number of active duty military personnel in the year 2000 would fall to 67 percent of the number in 1985. Military infrastructure, by contrast, would still be roughly 79 percent of what it was in 1985 under the Pentagon's base closure recommendation. Force structure reductions in the Air Force, Army, and Navy will also be far deeper than the corresponding cutbacks in infrastructure.
<p>
	Political considerations. Given the pressing need to reduce military infrastructure in the United States, the relatively modest recommendations of the Department of Defense were surprising. It was widely expected that in this round of base closures the Department of Defense would propose reducing military infrastructure by as much as the three previous rounds combined.
<p>
	Of course, this did not happen. The likely explanation is political intervention by the White House. President Clinton's aides reportedly attempted in 1994 to put off the entire round of reductions slated for this year because they feared the negative repercussions for President Clinton's reelection effort in affected states.7  White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta reportedly intervened with Secretary of Defense William Perry later last year to have the scope of the reductions trimmed.8<p>	The politicization of the process became apparent when President Clinton boasted in a January 1995 radio interview that the Navy's shipyard near Portsmouth, New Hampshire, would not be included on the list of closed bases. Indeed, the Portsmouth facility was not included in the Secretary's recommended closure list. Thus, the White House knew what the Secretary of Defense was going to recommend more than a month before the Pentagon submitted its recommendations. Nevertheless, the report of the Secretary of Defense to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission asserts that the recommendations for the closure of military bases were objective and nonpolitical.9  This appears not to be the case.<p><b>THE DELIBERATIONS OF THE BASE CLOSURE AND REALIGNMENT COMMISSION</b><p>To its credit, the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission apparently recognized and tried to resist the Clinton Administration's attempt to politicize the process. The commission on May 10 announced it had added 31 bases to the list recommended by the Secretary of Defense for either closure or realignment.10  The additional bases included the Portsmouth shipyard. Press reports indicated that the White House was particularly interested in striking bases from the list that were located in California, New Hampshire, and Texas.11  Nevertheless, of the 31 bases added to the list by the commission, 13, or almost 42 percent, are located in or near these three states.<p>	The commission on July 1 announced its list of bases for closure or reali
gnment.12 Despite its earlier action of adding bases to its list for consideration that were not included in the recommendation submitted by the Secretary of Defense, the commission chose not to expand the number of major bases to be closed or realigned. In fact, the  commission ultimately decided to close only 28 major military bases instead of the 33 proposed earlier by the Pentagon. The commission also recommended realigning another 22 major bases. This compares to 26 realignments recommended to the commission by the Department of Defense. The closures and realignments proposed by the commission probably will shrink the military infrastructure by about 6 percent. 
<p>

<b>IMPROVING THE BASE CLOSURE PROCESS</b>
<p>
	To be a complete success, the base closure process needs to be extended and improved. This will require Congress to:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Accept the findings of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission.</b> Moving the base closure process forward first requires implementing the current round of cutbacks. Congress should not force the military to carry the cost of maintaining unneeded bases. Congress can take a step toward preserving the base closure process by accepting the commission's findings.
<br>
<li><b>Extend the base closure process for another two rounds.</b> The additional two rounds will reduce military bases to between 64 percent and 69 percent of what they were during the Cold War. Even after these two additional rounds, the cutback in bases will trail reductions in military budgets, personnel, and forces.     Defense budgets and force structure will be around 60 percent of Cold War levels. These rounds should occur in 1997 and 1999.
<br>
<li><b> Increase its oversight of the process by which the Administration recommends base closures to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission.</b> The political manipulation of the base closure process by the White House, if true, is unacceptable. Preventing such abuses in the future will require rigorous congressional oversight. The first step requires determining whether the charges leveled at the White House by the press are true. The House and Senate Military Construction Appropriations Subcommittees should hold hearings on these charges and require both White House staff and Pentagon officials to testify.
<br>
<li><b>Reduce the cost of closing bases.</b> Savings in the base closure process have been low because the cost of shutting down bases is too high. Closing bases has become an expensive proposition for several reasons. First of all, the procedures for selling off bases and other facilities are being circumvented. Many of the properties are retained by the Department of Defense or given to other federal agencies, or to state and local governments, at no cost.13  Selling these properties to the private sector would help offset the closure costs.
<p>
	The second reason for the high costs is that local governments are successfully pressuring the federal government to provide grants and other assistance to them in order to support the conversion of properties. Such improvements include  building roads and sewer systems, many of which are funded through the defense budget. This has turned the Department of Defense into a community development agency. Funding such social and economic projects is not a proper function of the Department. The federal government needs to exercise discipline in rejecting the demands of local communities for assistance in upgrading and improving the  properties that are being disposed of by the Department of Defense.
<p>
	The third reason is that the cost of environmental cleanup is too high. The Department of Defense is expected to spend over $5 billion on environmental cleanup, much of it for cleaning up closed bases. Some of these costs are caused by unrealistic federal and local environmental requirements; cleaning ground water, for example, is likely to be expensive and in some cases impossible. Some are due to unnecessary environmental policies that put a high priority on cleanup. These policies at times result in the needless cleanup of land that will remain in federal hands and therefore not require cleanup prior to reuse.14  The Pentagon should be relieved of the costs of environmental cleanup altogether. Other federal agencies or departments, such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or a new Bureau of Natural Resources, should be given responsibility for these costs.15<li><b>Privatize military depots.</b> The base closure commission has focused on reducing the number of military depots to the level required to meet expected demand for depot service. Many of the depot functions, however, can be privatized and performed by contractors. Not only is it likely that private enterprises can perform these services more efficiently, but the Pentagon will be able to reap a dividend by selling the properties to the private sector.16  This is not to say that all such functions can be privatized. All maintenance duties that require close proximity to combat operations, or that are a part of combat operations, should remain in the hands of the military. Nevertheless, many other functions, and the associated facilities, should be privatized. This would allow the commission to be far more aggressive in closing down depots.
</ul><p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
	Base closings must continue if the military is going to maintain its combat capabilities. The excess infrastructure, if not shed, will continue to be a financial drain on the military services. In an era of shrinking defense budgets, this financial drain will weaken America's combat readiness and defense modernization programs. Shedding excess infrastructure requires extending the base closure process by another two rounds. It also entails finding ways to reduce the cost of closing bases. Further, politics must be kept out of the base closure process. Only then can the savings achieved from closing unneeded military bases be used to fund the U.S. armed forces' most important function -- preparing to fight and win the nation's wars.

Backgrounder Update #230<BR>
 7/27/94<BR>
(Updating Backgrounder No. 836, "Women in Combat: Why Rush to
Judgment?" June 14, 1991.)
</CENTER><HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>

     Secretary of the Army Togo West announced on June 1 that the Army
soon will reclassify a number of combat assignments to make them
available to women. (Memorandum from the Secretary of the Army for the
Secretary of Defense, "Recommendations for Opening Additional
Positions for Women Under the DOD Assignment Policy -- Decision
Memorandum," June 1, 1994.) Positions as combat engineers, as air
defense artillery specialists, and as pilots and crew members of
helicopters on special operations missions until now have been closed
to women in accordance with long-standing Pentagon regulations. West's
proposals represent a complete reversal of this traditional Army
policy.
<P>
     If the Army brass has its way, however, West's decision will not
stand. He withdrew his proposal after nearly unanimous opposition from
such top Army officers as Chief of Staff General Gordon Sullivan.
(Eric Schmitt, "Generals Oppose Combat By Women," The New York Times,
June 17, 1994, p. A1.) In the words of Sullivan's deputy, General J.H.
Binford Peay III, before the Senate Armed Services Committee on June
16, "I do not think it is appropriate to open up the traditional
positions of infantry, armor, field artillery, engineer at certain
levels of the battlefield, air defense at certain levels of the
battlefield, special operating force aviation, and a few others."
(General J.H. Binford Peay III, USA, testimony before the Senate Armed
Services Committee, June 16, 1994.) It is no surprise that seasoned
military leaders reject West's proposal. Allowing women into these
units would damage the military's hard-earned effectiveness and, for
the first time in U.S. history, deliberately expose women to enemy
fire and extreme risk of death and capture. West is expected to
announce a revised policy later this summer but, in the meantime, is
sticking by his original proposal.
<P>
     Before giving the Secretary of the Army or other Administration
officials free rein to change long-standing U.S. policy toward women
in combat, Congress should learn for itself what such a change of
policy would entail. It could begin by reviewing the findings of the
1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed
Forces, a bipartisan task force appointed by former President George
Bush to examine this issue. After a year's study and hundreds of hours
of hearings, the Commission voted unanimously in November 1993 to
codify into law the Army's existing regulations exempting women from
combat. The Commission also voted nine to four that the existing "risk
rule" regarding non-combat positions be retained. (Presidential
Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces, Report to
the President, November 15, 1992, pp. 24-27, 36-37.) 
<P>
     An appropriate forum for review of these and other findings of
the Presidential Commission would be joint hearings by the Senate and
House Armed Services Committees, during which West and other senior
Pentagon Officials should be required to answer a number of
troublesome questions:
<P>
Are women physically suited to the rigors of ground combat?
<P>
How will bearing and raising children affect a woman's readiness to
 deploy on short notice, as is frequently required of military units?
<P>
What are the potential consequences of women and men operating in
 intimate proximity away from home for extended periods of time?
<P>
How do women serving in the armed forces feel about being assigned to
 combat units?
<P>
What has been the experience of nations that have mixed men and women
 in combat units?
<P>

WHAT IS BEHIND THE ARMY'S NEW PUSH FOR WOMEN IN COMBAT?
<P>
     Secretary West's changes in Army assignment policies came in
response to then-Secretary of Defense Les Aspin's January 1994
decision to loosen the military's long-standing ban on women in
combat. First, Aspin rescinded the so-called risk rule, which
prevented the assignment of women to support units -- engineering,
supply, and military police units, for example -- that operate with
combat forces (such as tanks and infantry) and face a substantial risk
of contact with the enemy. Second, he ordered the armed services to
review their personnel assignment policies. Those jobs that meet the
Pentagon's narrow definition of "direct ground combat" -- "engaging an
enemy on the ground with individual or crew-served weapons [such as
machine guns and rifles], while being exposed to hostile fire and to a
high probability of direct physical contact with the hostile force's
personnel" (Memorandum from the Secretary of Defense to the [Service
Secretaries], Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Assistant
Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness), and Assistant
Secretary of Defense (Reserve Affairs), "Direct Ground Combat
Definition and Assignment Rule," January 13, 1994.) -- are to remain
closed to women. Positions in units which "routinely collocate" with
direct ground combat forces also are to remain closed, but women are
to be allowed in all other assignments. Secretary West's June 1 memo
is the Army's response to these instructions, which are to take effect
October 1, 1994.
<P>
     Calling Warfare Something Else Does Not Make It Easier or Safer.
The Administration's new definition of "non-combat" positions is both
inaccurate and unrealistic. In his memo, Secretary West explicitly
applies Aspin's definition "strictly as written," meaning that a job
must involve simultaneously "engaging the enemy," "being exposed to
hostile fire," and having "direct physical contact" with the enemy.
However, a soldier facing any one of these conditions surely is
engaged in combat. Moreover, Aspin's definition implies that only
riflemen and machine gunners can be "in combat." But someone can be
"exposed to hostile fire" well outside of rifle range; a soldier can
be killed by an artillery round fired from twenty miles away. And is
"direct physical contact" only actual hand-to-hand combat, or is being
within range of the enemy's hand grenades or pistols "direct" enough?
<P>
     In fine-tuning a definition of combat to suit their political
objective, the Administration is forging neat distinctions which
simply do not exist on the battlefield. Positions like combat engineer
and air defense artillery specialist have been closed to women because
they involve the likelihood of direct exposure to enemy fire. They
also involve operating in proximity to infantry, artillery, and other
combat forces whose sole purpose is to find and destroy the enemy. The
Administration's new rules for combat assignment imply that the enemy
will attack only U.S. forces engaged in "direct ground combat" as
Aspin defines it. At any time, however, those in what the
Administration would call "non-combat" units can be hit by enemy fire,
have physical contact with enemy troops, and otherwise "engage the
enemy." The West memorandum makes clear the Clinton Administration's
intention to open such positions to women without regard for the
realities of the battlefield.
<P>
     The Real Agenda: Career Opportunity Over Military Effectiveness.
The Clinton Administration's real objective in pushing to place women
in harm's way is explicit. Aspin's instructions in January advised the
armed services to "use this guidance to expand opportunities for
women. No units or positions previously open to women will be closed
under these instructions." Aspin further stated that "we've made
historic progress in opening up opportunities for women in all of the
services.... [E]xpanding the roles of women in the military is the
right thing to do, and it's also the smart thing to do." (Eric
Schmitt, "Aspin Moves To Open Many Military Jobs to Women," The New
York Times, January 14, 1994, p. 22.) In his June 1 memorandum, Army
Secretary West echoed this position: "America's Army is proud to be on
the forefront of providing opportunities for women.... [W]e take every
opportunity to enhance the career opportunities of all service
members.... " ("Recommendations for Opening Additional Positions for
Women Under the DOD Assignment Policy -- Decision Memorandum," op.
cit.) One analysis of West's memorandum notes that it "uses phrases
such as 'career opportunity' no less than ten times, but references to
military requirements are conspicuously absent." (Center for Military
Readiness, news release, June 8, 1994.) The Administration claims that
placing women in combat assignments will make the military more
effective, but this claim is not supported by the evidence. It is time
for Congress to examine that evidence.

<P>
QUESTIONS FOR CONGRESS
<P>
     The Clinton Administration is proposing momentous changes in
policy with serious implications for U.S. military effectiveness.
Before changes in current combat restrictions are allowed to take
effect in October, Congress must hold hearings on the role of women in
America's defense. As part of these hearings, Members must ask
Secretary of Defense William Perry, the Secretaries of each of the
armed services, and senior uniformed officers five questions.
<P>
Question #1: Are women physically suited to the rigors of ground
  combat? 
<P>
Answer: The evidence suggests that they are not. In weighing the
ability of women to perform under combat conditions, the 1992
Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces
heard testimony from Army Lieutenant Colonel William Gregor, Chairman
of the Department of Military Science at the University of Michigan,
who conducted a test of Army officer candidates and found that:
<P>
The top 20 percent of women at West Point achieved scores on the Army
  Physical Fitness Test equivalent to the bottom 20 percent of male
  cadets.
<P>
Only seven percent of women can meet a score of 60 on the push-up
  test, while 78 percent of men exceed it.
<P>
A 20- to 30-year-old woman has the same aerobic capacity as a 50-year-
  old man.
<P>
Only one woman out of 100 could meet a physical standard achieved by
   60 out of 100 men. Gregor concluded that going through this process
   would mean that "I have just traded off 60 soldiers for the
   prospect of getting one. The cost considerations are prohibitive."
   (Lt. Col. William Gregor, USA, testimony before the Presidential
   Commission, September 12, 1992, cited in the Presidential 
   Commission's Report to the President, November 15, 1992, p. C-42.)
  <P>
     Soldiers under fire must have confidence in the physical
abilities of their comrades. Before allowing women to face the stress
of combat, Congress must hear from Lieutenant Colonel Gregor and other
experts to determine whether women are physically suited for it.
<P>
Question #2: How will bearing and raising children affect a woman's
   readiness to deploy on short notice, as is frequently required of
   military units?
<P>
Answer: Because of pregnancy and family responsibilities, many women
cannot be shipped out to a foreign crisis as quickly as men. During
Operation Desert Storm, for example, enlisted women in the Navy were
unavailable for overseas deployment nearly four times more often than
men. At any given time, between 8 and 10 percent of women in the Navy
are pregnant; (Department of the Navy, Navy Personnel Survey, 1990
Survey Report, Volume 2.) for the Army, the figure is 10 to 15
percent. (Michael Levin, Feminism and Freedom (New Brunswick, NJ:
Transaction Books, 1988), p. 235.) Because Navy regulations require
pregnant sailors to be within six hours of a medical facility, each of
these women must be replaced before a ship can sail. This could lead
to sudden gaps in a small unit that depends on the presence of all
members to complete its mission. Such gaps would damage the cohesion
of a tightly knit combat team.
<P>
     Moreover, this effect will be magnified as the military continues
to shrink under the Clinton Admini-stration's defense budget cuts.
Because it is getting more difficult to attract qualified candidates,
military recruiters are trying to appeal to women with promises of
career advancement. The result is a higher number of women as a
percentage of the total force; while women accounted for only 14.5
percent of Army recruits four years ago, for example, they will
comprise 20.5 percent this year. (Rowan Scarborough, "Military
Recruiters Increasingly Rely on Women to Fill Ranks," The Washington
Times, February 28, 1994, p. A1.) Lower unit readiness caused by the
absence of child-rearing women inevitably will get worse as the
military continues to attract a higher percentage of women its ranks.
<P>
Question #3: What are the potential consequences of women and men
    fighting alongside one another?
<P>
Answer: Combat is a team activity which brings people closer together
than any other profession. A small number of women may possess the
physical and mental toughness to perform some combat duties; but
teamwork matters more than individual capabilities in combat, and this
teamwork generally is undermined by the presence of women. On one
support ship during Operation Desert Storm, 36 of the 360 women on
board -- ten percent -- became pregnant. (Alecia Swasy, "Shipboard
Pregnancies Force the Manly Navy to Cope With Moms," The Wall Street
Journal, October 3, 1991, p. 1.) In a Roper survey conducted during
the Gulf War, 64 percent of military personnel surveyed reported that
sexual activity had taken place in their unit. (The Roper
Organization, "Attitudes Regarding the Assignment of Women in the
Armed Forces: The Military Perspective," September 1992.) Mixing men
and women in military units invites sexual attraction and special
relationships, and these relationships -- or even the perception that
they exist -- destroy the morale and cohesion which any fighting force
must have to win wars. If more women join combat units that become
open to them as a result of the Administration's new policies, this
problem will only worsen.
<P>
Question #4: How do women serving in the armed forces feel about being
   assigned to combat units?
<P>
Answer: In a 1992 survey of Army women, between 70 and 80 percent of
respondents favored allowing women to volunteer for combat. Yet, among
the same respondents, 90 percent of female noncommissioned officers
and 88 percent of enlisted women indicated that they would not
volunteer; only 14 percent of the Army officers surveyed indicated
that they would volunteer for combat assignments. And fully 52 percent
of Army women claimed they would leave the service if women are
compelled to serve in combat. (Laura Miller and Dr. Charles Moskos,
"1992 Survey on Gender in the Military," Northwestern University,
September 1992.) 
<P>
     The charge that barring women from combat units inhibits their
career advancement is groundless. According to Department of Defense
statistics, even with the combat exclusion for women, the services are
promoting females at similar or faster rates than males. (Department
of Defense, "Military Women in the Department of Defense," Volume
VIII, July 1990, pp. 30, 73.) Expanding combat "opportunities" places
the aspirations of feminist activists ahead of the wishes of most
military women, who have expressed consistently strong personal
resistance to being assigned to combat.
<P>
Question #5: What has been the experience of nations that have mixed
   men and women in combat units?
<P>
Answer: History shows that the presence of women has had a devastating
impact on the effectiveness of men in battle. For example, it is a
common misperception that Israel allows women in combat units. In
fact, women have been barred from combat in Israel since 1950, when a
review of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War showed how harmful their presence
could be. The study revealed that men tried to protect and assist
women rather than continue their attack. As a result, they not only
put their own lives in greater danger, but also jeopardized the
survival of the entire unit. The study further revealed that unit
morale was damaged when men saw women killed and maimed on the
battlefield. (Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in
the Armed Forces, International Trip Report, September 14-27, 1992.)
These findings will come as no surprise to most Americans; in a recent
national survey, two-thirds of those who favored the current policy
barring women from ground combat cited the potential loss of mens'
effectiveness as a reason. (The Roper Organization, "Attitudes
Regarding the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces: The Public
Perspective," September 1992, p. 41.)
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
     The American people know that the purpose of the armed forces is
to fight and win the nation's wars, not to serve as a laboratory for
social "progress." While the military attempts to provide servicemen
and women with rewarding careers, it must not do so at the expense of
its readiness for war. Most Americans understand that the majority of
men are physically stronger than the majority of women and that the
risk of sexual attraction can undermine the cohesion and discipline
necessary for success on the battlefield. Most are also uncomfor with
the deliberate exposure of women to violence. Unfortunately, their
common sense is not shared by the Clinton Administration, which
already has shown a lack of sound military judgment regarding the
assignment of known homosexuals to the armed forces, the use of force
in Somalia, and the military build-up around Haiti.
<P>
     When their very existence was threatened, many nations -- Israel
during its 1948 war for independence, and both the Soviet Union and
Nazi Germany near the end of World War II -- used women in combat,
removing them when the crisis passed. The U.S. faces no such threat
today; moreover, thousands of qualified men and women are leaving the
military as it gets smaller. The facts demonstrate that placing women
in or near combat units will damage military effectiveness. Weakening
America's military might in this way and at this time is particularly
troubling. The U.S. armed services already are suffering from deep
budget cuts and declining morale. (For a discussion of the military
budget crisis, see John Luddy, "Stop the Slide Toward a Hollow

INTRODUCTION
  <P>   As American children begin another year of school, Congress is
ending its two-year session, making it time for a final report card. 
In the critical area of congressional reform -- the steps Congress
took to fix its internal problems -- mostly failing grades are in
order. 
 <P>    The tumultuous elections of 1992 led to the largest freshman
class of legislators in decades; for most of them, reforming the
troubled institution they were about to join was a central campaign
issue.  Lawmakers, conceding that their institution was plagued by
numerous internal problems, created a special committee -- the Joint
Committee on the Organization of Congress -- to reform the
institution.  Even though that committee's proposals were
disappointingly mild, they were fought bitterly by entrenched
interests within Congress and ultimately were sabotaged by
congressional leaders who stopped most reforms from even coming up for
a vote.  In retrospect, it appears that the Joint Committee process
was designed to fail; and, with a few notable exceptions, Members of
Congress expended little time or energy on reforms outside that
process.  Among the disappointments of the last two years, Congress:
<P>
Failed to improve its misleading budget procedures;
<P>
Did not fully apply all relevant federal laws to itself;
<P>
Failed to eliminate congressional perquisites that are used to
influence elections;
<P>
Advanced campaign finance reform that would give incumbents even more
advantages in elections;
<P>
Failed to rationalize the ineffective committee system;
<P>
Failed to eliminate party politics from internal congressional
administration;
<P>
Failed to eliminate deceptive voting practices through truth-in-voting
reforms; and
<P>
Failed even to address congressional term limits.
<P>
     This general pattern of failure is the result of opposition from
an entrenched leadership which dominated a large freshman class that,
despite campaign promises, appeared to care little about reform
issues.  This pattern, however, was interrupted occasionally by a few
individual and institutional bright spots.  The House passed a bill
applying various employment laws to Congress (a bill now being
championed in the Senate by Republican Charles E.  Grassley of Iowa
and Democrat Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut), and a few subcommittees
and non-legislative committees were eliminated.  Some members of the
Joint Committee, such as David Dreier (R-CA) and Jennifer Dunn (R-WA),
distinguished themselves on numerous reform fronts; other Members of
Congress, such as Robert Andrews (D-NJ), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Jim Inhofe
(R-OK), and Bill Zeliff (R-NH) have capitalized on specific reform
opportunities.  But these legislators unfortunately are not typical. 
Indeed, if Congress were a school, most of the class would need to be
held back in order to take remedial classes on reform.
<P>
CONGRESS'S REFORM COMMITTEE
House:  F Senate:  F
<P>     The central focus of congressional reform must be the quality of
legislation that Congress produces; that is, are laws the product of
sound policy choices made in a genuinely representative fashion? 
Judged by this standard, the process that Congress set up to reform
itself (like its routine lawmaking procedures), was destined to fail. 
Despite rhetorical support for the reform process from nearly every
Member of Congress, obstacles within the process stacked the deck
against reform.
<P>     The Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress, created to
review and recommend changes in the way Congress operates, originally
had no freshman members -- despite the fact that one-quarter of House
Members and 14 of 100 Senators were first-termers.  Only after one of
its members left Congress to enter the lobbying sector was a freshman
Representative appointed to the 24-member committee.  The fact that
the committee was stacked with senior members (their average tenure
was over fourteen years) reflects a central problem of Congress's
seniority system:  junior members rarely are granted seats on
important legislative committees and are given little opportunity to
do their central job, helping to write legislation.  They therefore
must focus on seeking repeated re-election -- and frequently on
accomplishments unrelated to legislation -- in order to acquire
committee positions with significant legislative influence.  The
overwhelming number of senior lawmakers guaranteed that the Joint
Committee would reflect the attitudes and interests of career
politicians.
 <P>    If the outcome of the reform process had matched the rhetoric of
the Members who testified before the Joint Committee, it would have
been a success.  Over the first six months of 1993, the Joint
Committee held 36 hearings and heard testimony from 243 witnesses --
including 170 federal legislators -- about what was wrong with
Congress.  Most witnesses encouraged the committee to produce a bold
package of reforms and pledged their strong support; Speaker of the
House Tom Foley, for instance, said:  "I have come to believe that
this is a process that not only can work but must work.  I pledge to
you my willingness to support you in any way that I can, and I wish
you well." (Congressional Record, August 10, 1994, p.  H-7332.)
 <P>    Despite this rhetorical support, however, the Joint Committee's
recommendations would have to go through the very legislative process
that the committee had been set up to reform -- a process which
created countless opportunities for other committees to bottle up,
ignore, or fatally modify reform legislation with no guarantee that it
would ever reach the floor of the House and Senate.  Awareness that
any reform plans would have to be acceptable to other committees
encouraged a timid atmosphere that produced tepid half-measures
coupled with schemes to evade pressing issues.
 <P>    For instance, the committee never seriously considered the
reforms that are most prominent in public discourse, such as term
limits, a balanced budget amendment, and line-item veto power for the
President.  Members decided to bypass such difficult questions as
ethics reform, application of laws to Congress, and committee
restructuring by calling for more study or for others to handle the
issue. 
<P>     Although the extensive hearings held in the first six months of
the 103rd Congress were supposed to culminate in a summer legislative
mark-up, the House leadership repeatedly refused throughout the latter
half of 1993 to permit the committee to meet in order to report out
legislation.  This delay eventually led to a November meeting where
frustrated Senate members of the Joint Committee split off and held
their own mark-up, thus further weakening prospects for a strong
reform bill that would permit committee members to form a united front
in its defense.  The House half of the committee, finally scheduled to
meet during the last week of the 1993 session (after which its
authority would expire), was split by a series of party-line votes
that left few genuine reform proposals intact.  Instead, House members
produced a bill larded with feel-good but nonbinding resolutions and
nearly meaningless reforms, such as recodifying House rules and
preventing cosmetic changes in Members' statements in the
Congressional Record.
 <P>    Republican committee members, who could have killed the package
on a party-line vote, were divided on whether the resulting package
was worth any additional effort.  Based on a commitment from Chairman
Lee Hamilton (D-IN) to bring the entire Joint Committee package to the
floor with "generous" opportunities for members of both parties to
amend it, two Republicans -- Vice Chairman David Dreier (R-CA) and
Bill Emerson (R-MO) -- voted to report out the committee product.
 <P>    Although the Joint Committee's proposals were disappointing
overall, the House and Senate reports did include some useful reforms. 
Particularly, proposals for a two-year budget process and limits on
committee memberships likely would have led to greater deliberation
and some reduction in redundancy.  Further, the committee's proposals
could have served as the basis for debate and votes on more
significant reforms in the House and Senate.  The bill's forced march
through House and Senate committees, however, gave defenders of the
status quo opportunities to destroy even these few useful reforms. 
Entrenched interests in both bodies mobilized to fight the Joint
Committee's already weak product. 
<P>
Committee chairmen opposed provisions that might eliminate committees.
     Appropriations Committee members were against a biennial budget
     process. 
<P>The Black Caucus spoke out against committee assignment limitations. 
<P>
The House Democratic Study Group demanded abolition of the Senate
     filibuster before any House reform could take place. 
<P>
The Senate Rules Committee stripped the two-year budget process
     proposal and the committee reforms from their bill, and watered
     down the provisions on application of laws to Congress while
     adding new powers for the Majority Leader and the Appropriations
     Committee. 
<P>
In the House, Speaker Foley decided to break the reform package into
     separate pieces, making it harder to pass each particular reform.
  <P>   
Faced with such legislative roadblocks, the reform bill's momentum
     crumbled.  As a result, the only proposition Congress has even
     considered is the House-passed Congressional Accountability Act
     (see section on "Congressional Coverage," on page 8). 
<P>
     Congressional leaders, all too aware of how to capitalize on
anti-reform legislative dynamics, were able to slice away at the
package's provisions and prospects.  If reformers did not understand
this initially, the leadership's opposition to and destruction of
their efforts certainly should have taught them.  This anatomy of the
Joint Committee's procedural failures carries within it a central
lesson:  any serious reform measure will encroach on so many power
bases and entrenched interests that the only hope of success lies in
bypassing existing committees and seeking votes on the floor of the
House and Senate.
<P>
COMMITMENT TO REFORM<P>
House:  F Senate:  F
  <P>   Despite low and steadily sinking public regard for Congress (as
of August 1994, only 14 percent of the public generally trusts it to
do the right thing, down from 24 percent two years earlier (Associated
Press Poll taken August 26-30 by ICR Survey Research.)) coupled with
broad public support for a wide-ranging spectrum of proposed reforms,
individual Members -- with a few exceptions -- have failed to take the
initiative to reform Congress.
<P>     One problem is that Congressmen apparently are not even
discussing reform to any significant degree.  Among the 5,400 "Dear
Colleague" letters -- internal communications among Members of
Congress -- sent between June 1993 and June 1994, congressional reform
was mentioned only 27 times, ranking 37th among 38 topics.
(Congressional Connection database service.)  For every "Dear
Colleague" that dealt with the issue, there were over 26 that dealt
with health care and over 16 that dealt with crime.  Even when
addressing constituents, Congressmen rarely mention reform.  A
Heritage Foundation review of twenty Congressmen's mass mailings found
crime addressed 44 times, health care 40 times, and senior citizens'
and veterans' concerns a total of 26 times, while congressional reform
was mentioned in only 4 instances.
 <P>    This inaction is startling, given the much-vaunted reform
orientation of the huge freshman class of 1992.  Freshman members of
both parties released reform proposals early in 1993, but few Members
have been active since that time.  Freshman Democrats were sidetracked
after Speaker Foley forced them to vote on a wide-ranging package of
anti-reformist rule changes immediately after being sworn into office
in January of 1993.  Promising that the reforms the freshmen proposed
eventually would receive a vote, Foley was able to secure 53 of 55
freshman Democrats' votes on the rules package.  The resulting reform
package, however, was derived heavily from leadership-supported
proposals on campaign and lobbying reform.  The 27 freshman reform
proposals were steered into one, then another committee of the House
Democratic Caucus, which eventually reported five to the full caucus
for further review.  As of this writing, not one of these proposals
has been voted on by the full House.
 <P>    Freshman Republicans approved a package that contained hard-
hitting reforms like term limits, appropriations reform, franking
reductions, supermajority voting requirements for tax increases, and a
balanced budget amendment.  As a class, however, GOP freshmen have
been surprisingly quiet, perhaps because of the oft-delayed promise of
action on a Joint Committee reform package.  The existence of the
Joint Committee provided a convenient justification for inaction by
congressional leaders, who argued frequently that since the committee
was exploring some particular reform, there was no need for action by
the rest of Congress.
 <P>    There were several notable exceptions to this general lack of
commitment, however.  Representative Jim Inhofe (R-OK) led the 103rd
Congress's most successful crusade for reform:  eliminating the
secrecy of the names on House discharge petitions.  Although Inhofe
lacked relevant committee memberships, his willingness to fight within
the House as well as outside of it (he spent hours discussing House
rules on talk radio shows around the country) eventually forced a
lopsided 384-40 vote in favor of full disclosure.  This reform
empowered rank-and-file Members, who -- if they constituted a majority
-- could now force a vote on legislation despite a committee
chairman's wish to block it.  By providing a way to bypass committees,
discharge reform spurred committee action.  When Judiciary Committee
Chairman Jack Brooks (D-TX) saw that 185 of the necessary 218 Members
had signed the discharge petition for an aircraft liability reform
bill (a bill he had blocked for eight years), he allowed the
legislation through his committee.  The measure received rapid
approval and is now law.  It had enjoyed broad support for nearly a
decade, but the discharge petition had been the missing ingredient. 
 <P>    Representatives Robert Andrews (D-NJ) and Bill Zeliff (R-NH)
introduced the "A to Z Spending Cuts Plan" that would trigger a
special congressional session devoted to spending cuts.  Over 200
Members signed the discharge petition for this measure; although the A
to Z plan was not considered, strong support for the petition forced
House leaders at least to advance weaker budget reform proposals (see
next section).
 <P>    Other reformers were successful in drawing public attention to
abuses of congressional processes.  Representatives David Dreier (R-
CA) and Jennifer Dunn (R-WA) were particularly persistent in trying to
secure House action (and then in publicizing House inaction) on
recommendations of the Joint Committee.  Representative Mike Crapo (R-
ID) introduced "truth-in-voting" reforms that would make individual
Members more accountable for the legislative votes they cast (see
"Truth in Voting," below).  In the Senate, Charles E.  Grassley (R-IA)
has repeatedly attempted to force Congress to apply to itself the same
laws it passes for the rest of the country.  He and Senator Joseph
Lieberman (D-CT) currently are fighting for a Senate vote on a measure
that would apply numerous laws to Congress, albeit under internal
enforcement.
<P>     Despite the congressional leadership's furious resistance to
reform and its ability to punish recalcitrant reformers, rank-and-file
Members might have been more successful in promoting change had more
of them been strongly committed to that goal.  For the most part, that
commitment was not apparent in the 103rd Congress.
 <P>         
NOTE:  The failing grade does not apply to a few reform achievers like
the Members mentioned above, who deserve special commendation for
their efforts. 
<P>
BUDGET REFORM<P>
House:  C Senate:  F
 <P>    Congress's track record on managing the federal budget is not
good.  For too long, federal legislators have relied on disguised
spending increases, votes to cut spending that actually save no money,
and legislative gimmicks that circumvent Congress's own spending caps. 
Although the House of Representatives did pass a few tentative
reforms, its efforts barely merit a passing grade, especially since
its votes were taken so late that it is nearly certain the Senate will
not pass companion measures.
<P>     The House took one healthy step, however:  it passed legislation
that, if approved by the Senate, would stop hidden automatic annual
spending increases.  These yearly "baseline" increases are calculated
by government economists, who estimate how much the federal government
will need next year to do everything it did the previous year,
adjusting for economic and demographic changes.  "Baseline budgeting"
permits spending to grow at a remarkable rate; the Medicare baseline,
for example, typically increases over 12 percent annually. (See James
K.  Glassman, "A Bit of Creative Accounting Makes the Budget a Fraud,"
The Washington Post, July 30, 1993, p.  B1.)  When legislators
announce spending cuts, they use these inflated baseline figures,
making it possible for Congressmen to claim credit for cutting
spending while simultaneously engineering large spending increases. 
Eliminating this fraudulent practice has long been a goal of
Representative Chris Cox (R-CA), who made replacement of baseline
budgeting the centerpiece of his Budget Process Reform Act.  This
summer, the House passed H.R.  4604, the Full Budget Disclosure Act
sponsored by Representative John Spratt (D-SC), which would base
budgets on the previous year's actual spending and force legislators
to justify spending increases rather than claim credit for phony
spending cuts.
<P>     The House also passed another useful budget reform this Congress: 
a measure to place tighter controls on emergency spending.  Because
funding for emergencies is not subject to limits which apply to
regular appropriations, well-placed legislators habitually add pork-
barrel items to emergency appropriations.  For instance, the $6.2
billion requested by President Clinton last year for California
earthquake relief was transformed into $11 billion by the time
Congress finished adding such obviously non-disaster items as funding
for a New York train station and pay raises for federal employees. 
The House-passed Emergency Spending Control Act, if passed by the
Senate, would make such budgetary sleight of hand a thing of the past
by requiring that non-emergency spending in an emergency bill comply
with overall spending caps.
<P>     Unfortunately, deceptive voting remains common.  Two notable
reform procedures were blocked by House leaders despite broad public
and congressional support.  The first was designed to solve the
problem of phony spending cuts.  Although Members of Congress
routinely trumpet the amounts they cut from appropriations bills,
these funds are not used to reduce the deficit.  Instead, they are
recycled by appropriations subcommittees into other programs.  Over
$1.3 billion in cuts was diverted in this fashion during 1992 alone. 
The Deficit Reduction Lock Box Act, H.R.  4057, introduced by
Representatives Mike Crapo (R-ID) and Charles E.  Schumer (D-NY),
would earmark individual appropriations cuts for deficit reduction
instead of allowing them to be recycled into further spending.  The
Lock Box Act, one portion of Representative Crapo's program of truth-
in-voting reforms, currently has 151 cosponsors. 
<P>     The A to Z Spending Cuts plan, cosponsored by Representatives
Robert Andrews (D-NJ) and Bill Zeliff (R-NH), would provide for a
special session for votes on whether to defund a wide array of
spending programs; successful spending cuts would be directed to
deficit reduction.  The plan, which has 230 sponsors, nearly achieved
passage but fell 14 signatures short of the 218 needed for a vote on
the House floor.  It was blocked by massive resistance from
congressional barons who oppose any limits on Congress's spending
power, but the vigorous efforts of A to Z proponents forced the
leadership to allow consideration of the mild budget reforms discussed
above.  As Representative Gerald Solomon (R-NY) characterized it,
"Instead of A-to-Z real spending reforms, we are going to have C-Y-A
process reforms."
 <P>    While useful, internal procedural reforms such as A to Z and the
Lock Box are less effective than constitutional reforms to limit
Congress's spending power.  A balanced budget amendment to the
Constitution and a line-item veto that would permit the President to
strike wasteful federal spending from legislation provide the best
prospects for ridding the federal budget of its pro-spending bias.
(Republican House candidates will pledge on September 27 to support
votes on these two constitutional reforms, as well as other reform
issues, if they elect the leadership of the House in the 104th
Congress.)
  <P>   The Senate debated a balanced budget amendment but narrowly
failed to muster the two-thirds majority needed for passage.  In the
House, even though 337 Members (far more than two-thirds) voted in
favor of some version of a balanced budget amendment, procedural
tricks used by the leadership ensured that no one version would
receive enough support to go forward.  The House did pass a weakened
version of a line-item veto (the Enhanced Rescission Act) that would
permit the President to propose spending cuts, but those cuts could be
blocked by a majority in either the House or the Senate.  (A genuine
line-item veto would require two-thirds of both houses to override
presidential cuts.) Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert C. 
Byrd (D-WV), however, killed the measure in the Senate.  Some action
on budget reform will be necessary for the Senate to receive a passing
grade.
<P>

CONGRESSIONAL COVERAGE<P>
House:  B Senate:  F
<P>     Congress refuses to obey many of the laws it imposes on ordinary
Americans.  Nearly a score of federal laws -- including the Civil
Rights Act, Americans With Disabilities Act, and Family and Medical
Leave Act -- either do not cover Congress at all or apply to Congress
differently than to the rest of the country.  Congress's habit of
exempting itself from laws that burden citizens, businesses, and state
and local governments is fundamentally undemocratic and makes
legislators careless about the regulatory and financial costs of
legislation.  Unlike private sector employees, congressional employees
who allege wrongdoing by their employers face a slow, secretive,
internal congressional process fraught with possibilities for
political interference.  Appeal rights are insufficient and jury
trials nearly impossible.
 <P>   Popular outrage at this double standard led to various
legislative proposals purporting to solve this problem.  The most
popular, the Congressional Accountability Act, was sponsored by
Representatives Christopher Shays (R-CT) and Dick Swett (D-NH),
eventually garnering 250 cosponsors.  When the Joint Committee on the
Organization of Congress split into House and Senate groups, House
members incorporated a watered-down version of the Shays-Swett
legislation in the reform bill they produced.  Senate leaders
appointed a Bipartisan Task Force on Congressional Coverage which --
instead of designing legislation -- issued a report advocating half-
measures.  Nine months later, that report still has not been publicly
released. 
  <P>   In August of 1994, the House passed a somewhat improved version
of the Congressional Accountability Act.  The Act gives aggrieved
congressional employees a choice between Congress's internal hearing
system (with an eventual right of appeal to federal appellate court)
or a lawsuit in federal district court with the possibility of a jury
trial.  It also incorporates ten specified employment-related laws and
permits addition of other employment statutes. 
<P>     Although the Congressional Accountability Act is an important
step forward, significant weaknesses remain.  Under the Act, a newly
created Office of Compliance would propose unique regulations for
Congress "that specify the manner in which the laws... shall apply."
(H.  R.  4822, section 5 (c) (1) (A).)  This means that Congress still
will not be following the same laws as the rest of the country. 
Congress will write its own regulations, different from those faced by
the private sector, and it will judge for itself whether those
regulations are sufficient, even as the private sector continues to
face often hostile enforcement of regulations over which it has little
control.  Furthermore, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) was
stripped from the bill when it was considered in the House
Administration Committee.  As Representative John Boehner (R-OH) has
contended, the House Bank and Post Office scandals might have been
headed off if FOIA had been applied to Congress.  Applying FOIA to
Congress also could expose such other abuses of power as use of the
congressional frank to influence elections and improper special-
interest communications from Members to federal agencies.  Finally,
the Congressional Accountability Act's application of the Occupational
Safety and Health Act (OSHA) to Congress lacks fines and allows
Congress to delay any necessary repairs for a year or more after a
violation is discovered.  Private businesses ordinarily are not
granted years to cure a violation of federal health and safety law. 
     Unfortunately, Senate agreement to the Congressional
Accountability Act appears unlikely.  The principal Senate objection
is that the new compliance office would have authority over both the
House and Senate; many Senators prefer separate House and Senate
offices.  Even if the Act should become law, however, its cozy
enforcement regime and coverage loopholes leave much room for
improvement.  Nonetheless, recognition that Congress must obey the
laws it imposes on other Americans makes the Congressional
Accountability Act one of the most important reforms to achieve any
success in the 103rd Congress.  Although the Act is flawed, its
enactment would be a significant step forward -- especially in
establishing the principle that Congress is not above the law.
<P>
PAY, PERKS, AND STAFF<P>
House:  F Senate:  F
  <P>   Congress has become an "incumbent protection society" (The term
is Alan Ehrenhalt's; see The United States of Ambition (New York: 
Random House, 1991), p.  230.) by using taxpayer-supplied public funds
for private political purposes.  Weekend trips back to the district
are funded by one official account, staff who routinely perform
campaign-style work (for example, drumming up media coverage) by
another.  Television and radio studios in congressional office
buildings are funded by taxpayers and used by officeholders to compose
and broadcast programs aired in their districts.  Perhaps most
important, the congressional frank -- "free mail" sent to constituents
-- is worth roughly $160,000 per year for each Member of Congress, an
amount greater than the average House challenger's entire campaign
budget.
<P>     Congress works hard to protect its perquisites, including
Members' salaries -- which now exceed $133,000 a year.  "Ethics
reform" legislation passed in 1989, for instance, provides for yearly
cost of living adjustments (COLAs) in congressional pay, which means
that each Member of Congress receives an annual pay raise without ever
having to vote on the question.  Congress's pension system is one of
the most expansive in the country, roughly twice as generous as any in
a Fortune 500 corporation.  Legislation to repeal the COLA or
otherwise reform congressional pay and benefits languishes with little
support.  Representative John Boehner (R-OH) has brought suit against
the COLA procedure, arguing that it violates the 27th Amendment's
stricture against congressional pay raises without an intervening
election; so far, his efforts have been unsuccessful.  For the most
part, other congressional "perks" remained untouched this session as
well.
<P>     As of mid-September, Representative Jim Lightfoot (R-IA) was
attempting to force a vote eliminating the COLA scheduled for December
1994.  Lightfoot's commendable effort would fix the problem for one
year only, however, since his amendment would be attached to an
appropriation measure.
<P>     The number of congressional employees -- long a subject of public
ire -- did see some small improvement.  Congress employs an army of
aides, now numbering over 27,000, (Norman Ornstein, Thomas Mann, and
Michael Malbin, eds.  ,Vital Statistics on Congress 1993-1994
(Washington, D.C.:  Congressional Quarterly, 1993), table 5-1, p. 
127.  Hereafter referred to as VSOC.) and its staff is by far the
largest of any legislature in the world. (VSOC, p.  121.)  In the last
thirty years, operating costs have ballooned by 800 percent. (VSOC, p. 
124.)  With critics arguing that huge congressional staffs lead to
inefficient and intrusive government, the House of Representatives has
promised to reduce its staff by 4 percent.  Its first round of staff
cuts, however, relied heavily on eliminating peripheral positions,
such as interns and administrative staff (for example, those who
distribute office furniture and supplies).  In an especially cynical
move, Representative Charlie Rose (D-NC), Chairman of the House
Administration Committee, transferred control over congressional food
services employees to private contractors while ensuring that the
services and employees would remain -- leaving the same number of
employees on Capitol Hill, but reducing the official payroll.  While
non-legislative staff shouldered the vast majority of cosmetic
reductions, highly paid personal and committee aides who function as
shadow Congressmen escaped nearly unscathed. 
<P>     The enormous subsidies for congressional mail, which increase the
federal budget and tilt federal elections in favor of incumbents, also
remained essentially unchanged.  Lawmakers should answer constituent
queries, but over nine-tenths of franking costs derive from mass
mailings initiated by Congressmen, not from responses to constituents.
(Senator Pete Wilson, "The Congressional Frank:  A Simple Case of
Abuse," Heritage Lecture No.  221, September 29, 1989, p.  1.) 
Although previous Congresses have cut franking accounts and required
disclosure of Members' total expenditures, such reforms as limiting
the mention of the sender's name to eight per page and capping his
pictures at two per page only raise questions about what prior abuses
had occurred.  Republicans have pressed repeatedly for further reform
of franking, but Rose has refused to hold any committee meetings on
the subject this election year.  The political uses of the frank were
illustrated during the tumultuous 1992 elections, when three of the
four heaviest House users of the frank lost their reelection bids.  On
average, the four sent out over a million mass-mailed letters apiece.
("Use of Franking Privilege," The Washington Post, October 22, 1992,
p.  A29.)  Although these mailings failed to save them, they
demonstrate that those in greatest political peril often use the frank
the most.
<P>     One change symbolizes the whole of congressional reform this
session.  Congress has come under fire for reserving select parking
for Members at Washington airports.  Shortly after a Senate vote
narrowly rejecting a proposal to eliminate the special parking
arrangement, signs acknowledging that the spaces were reserved for
Congressmen were mysteriously altered to read "Restricted Parking: 
Authorized Users Only."  Although one can argue that Members need
special airport parking spaces because of frequent travel, cosmetic
changes that attempt to divert attention from Congressmen's special
status without changing the situation are especially cynical.
  <P>   The solution to these problems is as easy to understand
intellectually as it is difficult to implement politically:  further
regulate or eliminate congressional "perks" susceptible to electoral
abuse.  If Congressmen want a pay raise, make them vote on it.  If
they need a broadcast studio to communicate with their districts, make
them find one in the private sector.  If they want to send what
amounts to political mailings to voters in their districts, make them
pay for it out of campaign funds; abolition of these unsolicited
mailings by members of the House alone would help level the playing
field for challengers and save taxpayers roughly $58 million every
congressional session. (Estimate from National Taxpayer's Union news
release, April 4, 1994.)  A rule that Members of Congress could
respond to, but not initiate, constituent correspondence would do more
for campaign reform than any measure currently being debated in
Congress.  Finally, real cuts -- on the order of 25 percent -- from
committee and personal staff are essential for congressional reform.
(The House Republican pledge discussed in note 5 above also includes a
commitment to reduce committee staff by a third.)
<P>
CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM<P>
House:  F Senate:  F
 <P>    In 1992 -- a year noted for anti-incumbent sentiment -- over 88
percent of incumbents running for reelection to the House or Senate
were victorious.  (In the previous decade, the average reelection rate
among House incumbents was over 95 percent. (VSOC, tables 2-7 and 2-8,
pp.  58-59.)) Incumbent dominance of congressional elections was
acknowledged by President Clinton, who claimed that his campaign
finance plan "levels the playing field between challengers and
incumbents and pays for it by taxing lobbyists and not the American
people." ("Statement by the President... on Finance Reform," Office of
the Press Secretary, May 7, 1993, p.  2.)  The President's plan and
similar congressional proposals (H.R.  3 and S.  3), however, fail to
meet this standard.  On the central test of campaign finance reform --
giving challengers a fair chance -- these proposals flunk.
 <P>    Instead of leveling the electoral playing field, campaign finance
reform legislation passed by the House and Senate (though not in final
form) would enhance incumbents' already formidable advantages, many of
which are funded by the American taxpayer.  These advantages snowball
when it comes to campaign contributions, because donors prefer to give
to likely winners.  Special interest group political action committee
(PAC) donations to incumbents especially outpace those to challengers,
and the House-passed version of campaign finance reform would heighten
this advantage by prohibiting challengers from offsetting their lack
of PAC contributions with large donations from individuals.  Because
the House scheme limits the number of donations greater than $200 that
a campaign can accept, challengers in effect would be forced to
scramble for funds in $200 increments to match the showers of $5,000
PAC gifts that go to incumbents. 
<P>     Most of the taxpayer-funded advantages enjoyed by incumbents (see
"Pay, Perks, and Staff" above) are ignored by the campaign finance
reform bills.  There is a ban on election-year mass mailings in the
Senate bill, for example, but this probably will be eliminated if the
bill goes to conference.  Instead, these bills limit the amounts that
congressional candidates can spend.  Since these spending caps are
equal for challengers and incumbents , however, they add even more to
incumbents' built-in advantage.  Two decades ago, the Supreme Court
declared that spending limits are an unconstitutional limit on First
Amendment freedoms; (Buckley v.  Valeo, 424 U.S.  1 (1976).) that is
why the bills call their limits "voluntary."  But candidates who
exceed those limits are penalized harshly by such measures as punitive
taxation and awards of hundreds of thousands of dollars in federal
subsidies to opponents.  Since incumbents 'advantages make their
effective spending limits far higher than those of challengers, this
penalty amounts to an ingeniously pro-incumbent ploy.  Incumbents will
not have to exceed the limit -- challengers will.
 <P>    Challengers who try to avoid the problem by running cheaper
campaigns will be effectively disarmed, because it takes a substantial
amount of spending just to reach parity with incumbents' taxpayer-
funded privileges, to say nothing of their natural advantages in media
access and name recognition.  $600,000, the proposed spending limit
for House candidates, is set just where challengers start to become
dangerous.  While a quarter of House challengers who spent between
$400,000 and $600,000 were victorious in the 1992 general elections,
over half of the those who spent over $600,000 won their races. 
Spending limits will shackle challengers by blocking them from
reaching effective spending parity with incumbents, who can tap public
resources for private political purposes. 
<P>     The dangers of the campaign reform plans do not stop with their
profoundly anti-competitive, challenger-stifling provisions.  They
also include direct attacks on free speech and citizen participation
in elections.  President Clinton, for instance, proposed to pay for
his plan's public campaign financing by taxing corporations for the
exercise of their First Amendment rights to petition the government. 
The Senate bill attempts to conceal its public funding by forcing
candidates who do not abide by spending limits to pay punitive taxes
-- for exercising their First Amendment rights -- at the top corporate
rate of 34 percent on all campaign receipts, with the proceeds being
funneled to those who obey the spending limits.
<P>     This double-barreled attack on freedom of speech is only the tip
of the iceberg.  Robert Peck of the American Civil Liberties Union has
argued that there are at least a dozen unconstitutional provisions in
the House bill that stifle political expression.  For instance, it
regulates political expression so broadly that a citizen who wished to
buy a sign supporting or opposing a political candidate could become
ineligible to do so by requesting a copy of the candidate's platform.
("The Devil in Campaign Finance Reform," speech given at the
Conference on Campaign Finance, American University Law School,
February 10, 1994.)  The Senate bill also restricts free speech.  An
amendment offered by Democratic Senator Robert Graham of Florida, for
example, would require anyone who sends out a "communication to the
general public" about a congressional candidate to file copies with
the state and federal governments.  Graham's amendment is drafted so
carelessly that fines could be levied for a letter to the editor of a
newspaper, for a union mailing, or even for a holiday newsletter to
family and friends which comments on a political candidate.
<P>     In short, the regulation of campaigns envisioned in these bills
is intended not to enhance political discourse, but to restrict
political activity to the advantage of incumbents while doing nothing
about the handicaps facing challengers.  This is precisely the
opposite of what real campaign reform should accomplish.  The only
redeeming value of these competing campaign reform packages is that,
because the House and Senate cannot agree on their details, they
appear unlikely to pass.
<P>
COMMITTEE REFORM<P>
House:  F Senate:  F
<P>     In 1947, Congress had 38 committees and subcommittees; today,
there are 266.  Over the last two decades alone, committee staffs in
the House of Representatives have grown by 158 percent.  The growth of
committees and their attendant staffs insulates Congressmen from
policy choices and hinders the legislative process by ensuring that
important legislation, because it will have to pass through more
committees, will be subjected to more special-interest group
influence.  Although committee reform was one of the major announced
goals of the Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress, that
panel ultimately proposed only minor tinkering with the committee
system.
 <P>    The House did make some minor progress in downsizing committees. 
In early 1993, it eliminated fifteen subcommittees and four select
committees.  The latter were obvious targets for elimination because
they lacked the power to craft legislation -- the central reason
committees exist.  But real committee reform remains unexplored. 
<P>     Committees function too frequently as legislative roadblocks,
especially when the tenure of their committee chairmen -- who have the
power to set the agenda -- is measured less easily in years than in
decades.  Over 90 percent of House committees, for instance, are
chaired by Members who have served at least ten terms in office. 
Among the popular measures perennially bottled up by hostile committee
chairmen are the balanced budget amendment, the line-item veto, term
limits, and product liability reform.  While House Republicans have
adopted a rule to limit the tenure of their top committee members,
House Democrats -- who control the committees -- have refused to adopt
a similar measure.  The majority party's refusal to enact rules that
would ensure turnover ensures that most chairmen will continue to have
little experience in public life outside of government work.
<P>    Because committee members typically will be willing to put more
energy into defending their committees than other legislators will
devote to abolishing them, the likelihood of collective decision-
making to eliminate more committees is minimal.  Furthermore, the
experience of the Joint Committee suggests that the chairmen of all
endangered committees, recognizing their common interest in the status
quo, will join to block any serious committee reform.  The most
promising route to committee reduction is to reduce the number of each
Members' committee memberships.  When Members are given seats on too
many committees, their legislative participation typically is confined
to frantic journeys between different committee hearings where, in an
attempt to sound informed, they read questions to witnesses written by
their staffs.  House Members should be limited to memberships on two
major committees and four subcommittees thereof; panels whose
memberships drop by half because of these restrictions should be
eliminated.  Senators should be limited to membership on three
committees along the same lines with legislators' preferences thus
determining what committees would be eliminated.
<P>     Not only does an excess of committees and committee memberships
harm deliberation, it also leads to proxy voting, a practice in which
one Member casts votes for another.  Although the Rules of the House
and Senate prohibit one Member of Congress from casting another's vote
on the floor, no such prohibition applies in committees, where proxy
voting is a frequent practice.  In the first year of the 103rd
Congress, for instance, proxies were used in every legislative vote in
such important House committees as Energy and Commerce, Judiciary, and
Public Works and Transportation.  Proxy voting encourages members to
vote on legislation without ever hearing arguments for or against it
and makes a mockery of representative government. 
<P>     Finally, committees that handle public business often prevent
public access.  Legislative committees that handle the nation's
business routinely close their doors to observers by majority vote. 
Although confidentiality is defensible in cases involving such
sensitive matters as national security, such subjects are rarely the
reason committee meetings are closed.  The two House committees that
close their doors most frequently are Ways and Means and
Appropriations, both of which must make politically controversial
choices about federal taxation and spending. 
<P>     The attempt to establish an open-meeting rule in the Joint
Committee's reform bill failed on a party-line vote.  Although there
was some provision for weakening the force of proxy votes in the
Senate version of the bill, that bill's demise suggests that no such
reform will take place.  In short, opportunities for reductions in
size and membership, elimination of proxy voting, and establishment of
an open meeting rule for committees were ignored.
<P>
NONPARTISAN HOUSE ADMINISTRATION<P>
House:  F Senate:  N/A
<P>     Scandals in the House Bank and Post Office were significant
catalysts for congressional reform.  In the wake of federal
indictments related to drug dealing in the House Post Office, Majority
Whip Richard A.  Gephardt (D-MO) conceded that the House of
Representatives' administrative functions had been penetrated with
"abuses and management inefficiencies," (Congressional Record, April
9, 1992, p.  H-2547.)and pledged to fix these problems by -- among
other steps -- creating a new congressional office with a nonpartisan
Director of Nonlegislative and Financial Services, subject to
bipartisan oversight.  Gephardt promised that patronage employees in
the House restaurant and computer operations would vanish once
responsibility for them was transferred to the nonpartisan
administrator and the bipartisan oversight structure.  The political
patronage system has produced incompetent but unfireable employees and
allowed partisan abuse of public resources, including distribution of
sensitive information in a partisan fashion, running political errands
on public time (such as picking up campaign contributions), and using
congressional equipment for political campaign mailings.  Implicit in
promises of reform was the idea that the opportunities for massive
patronage and corruption that this army of aides represented would
vanish under nonpartisan administration.
<P>     Over two years after these reforms, however, the patronage system
remains fundamentally unreformed.  The problem lies with an oversight
subcommittee which must ratify decisions of the nonpartisan
administrator for him to act.  Though the subcommittee has equal
numbers of Republicans and Democrats, any deadlock has the effect of
granting decision-making powers to the congressional leadership.  If
the Chairman of House Administration dislikes any subcommittee
outcome, he can simply raise the issue in the full committee, which
routinely defers to its Chairman:  Representative Charlie Rose, who
can -- and often does -- veto any change that threatens the majority
party's political preferences.  The first Director, Leonard P. 
Wishart, attempted to fulfill the office's duties but was repeatedly
rebuffed.
<P>
After responsibility for employees in charge of office equipment and
     supply was transferred to Wishart, he reviewed payrolls and found
     that two employees who had been hired under the patronage system
     were being paid inflated salaries for the work they were doing. 
     In order to make their salaries commensurate with their duties,
     Wishart submitted suggested salary changes.  Rose refused to
     approve the changes.
<P>Rose bypassed the Director by introducing a resolution in his
     committee to contract out the House Restaurant System, despite
     the fact that the restaurant system had been under the Director's
     authority for nearly a year.
<P>Rose refused to cede control over House Information Systems (HIS) --
     the House's internal computer operations -- even though the
     legislation that created the Office of the Director mandated that
     HIS would be transferred to the nonpartisan office.  Apparently,
     the patronage possibilities were simply too tempting to ignore. 
     As of July 1993, HIS had 277 employees drawing an average yearly
     salary of $48,400, which is sharply higher than the average House
     employee's paycheck.  A party-line deadlock in the oversight
     subcommittee continues to block HIS transfer.
<P>
     Wishart resigned abruptly in early 1994, suggesting in his letter
of resignation that some Members were attempting to undercut serious
moves toward neutral congressional administration.  His interim
replacement, Randall Medlock, apparently sees himself as a partisan
functionary not subject to bipartisan oversight.  He has refused to
provide information on franking costs to House Republicans, for
instance, explaining that Rose had ordered him to keep the data
confidential.  More recently, Medlock extended a food service contract
for a House cafeteria without obtaining the required subcommittee
approval.  In stark contrast to the elaborate bidding process required
for federal contract rewards -- which was followed when the House
contracted out the rest of its $9.3 million in food service business
earlier this year -- the million-dollar-a-year contract was extended
to the Skenteris family of North Carolina for an additional five years
without competitive bidding.  The contract originally had been awarded
in 1993 by Rose to his former constituents without competitive
bidding. (Alice A.  Love, "Republicans Blast Renewed Contract for Ford
Cafeteria," Roll Call, September 14, 1994, p.  14.)
 <P>    Abusively partisan administration of the House will not be
eliminated without pressure by an informed public, and congressional
leaders make it difficult or impossible to find out how they manage
their internal affairs.  For instance, the Freedom of Information Act
(FOIA), which applies to much of the federal government, excludes
Congress.  Both the principle that Congress should be subject to the
laws it writes for everyone else and the public's right to know demand
that Congress comply with FOIA.  Knowing in advance that its internal
operations would be subject to outside scrutiny would encourage
Congress to conduct its affairs with probity.
<P>     Partisan abuse of staff will continue as long as the underlying
problem remains unsolved.  The House needs to do what it promised: 
hire a professional administrator who is not turned into a pawn in a
continuing effort to maintain partisan advantage.  That administrator
must have as his central priority the professionalization of
administrative tasks -- especially including House Information
Services -- and be under the direction of the bipartisan oversight
committee, not a partisan committee chairman.  A deadlock in the
oversight subcommittee should lead to a vote on the floor for
difficult cases, replacing unilateral action by the House
Administration Committee.  This would force partisan disputes to be
debated openly.  Until the commitment to nonpartisan administration
under bipartisan oversight is honored, reforms remain cosmetic and the
Director remains an arm of the congressional leadership.
<P>     The House and Senate both have refused to open their internal
operations and finances to the public through the Freedom of
Information Act, and the House has taken a step backward from reform
by refusing to implement its promise of nonpartisan administration. 
These policies are scandalous and are likely to breed even more
scandals.
<P>
TRUTH IN VOTING<P>
House:  F Senate:  N/A
  <P>   When constituents judge the job performance of Congressmen,
voting records are a central factor.  But Members of Congress, well
aware that their political support can stand or fall with the votes
they cast, have rigged the system to avoid accountability for the
choices they make.  In some cases, they make decisions without ever
voting on them.  In others, they use procedures that make their votes
deceptive or meaningless. 
 <P>    A favorite tactic of the congressional leadership is to
manipulate the rules by which the House of Representatives conducts
its legislative business.  While the rules of the House are generally
fair, they are routinely ignored and can be waived at any time by a
bare majority vote.  A special rule for each piece of major
legislation is crafted in the Rules Committee and then ratified by the
full House.  More often than not, these special rules prevent
pertinent amendments from being considered, making it possible for
legislators to claim they favor popular policies while lamenting the
lack of opportunity to vote on them.  For the last six years, a
majority of special rules have limited amendment opportunities, and
the problem continues to grow:  the percentage of restrictive rules
mushroomed from 15 percent in the 95th Congress (1977-1978) to nearly
three-quarters of all legislation in this Congress. (Congressional
Record, August 10, 1992, p.  H-7330.)
  <P>   An even greater abuse of the legislative process is the
leadership's practice of producing legislation and then forcing votes
almost immediately, so that legislators do not have a chance to read a
bill before voting on it.  Although House Rules require that
legislation be available to Members three days before a vote, this
rule is often waived.  Copies of the 3,000-page, $496 billion tax
increase that Congress passed in 1993 were available to Members for
roughly twelve hours; any Congressman who wanted to read the bill
would have had to scan 250 pages per hour, making decisions at the
rate of nearly $700 million per minute.  More recently, the crime
bill's revised conference report was passed under a rules waiver only
a few hours after it was put together, and the text was unavailable to
most Members until the day after House passage.
 <P>   Another procedural trick creates opportunities for Congressmen to
vote for popular measures without actually advancing them in the
legislative process.  Under a "king-of-the-hill" rule, Members can
vote on a long string of competing legislative proposals, but only the
last one to receive a majority vote becomes law.  When a balanced
budget amendment was considered under a king-of-the-hill rule in the
House, many more than the required two-thirds voted for the amendment,
but it ultimately failed to pass.  The rule permitted Members to
divide their votes among four different proposals, ensuring that any
Member who wanted to take credit for a balanced budget vote could do
so without any risk that the House would pass the measure.  A recent
king-of-the-hill vote on the crime bill permitted Members to vote in
favor of narrowing appeal rights for death row inmates and then,
moments later, to vote in favor of expanding them.  The legislative
significance of such contradictory procedures is dwarfed by their
electoral importance, as legislators can compile a voting record
suitable for nearly any audience.
<P>    Just as some procedures enable Members to vote without
legislative consequences, others allow them to take real action
without votes.  For example, House Members have rigged the budget
process so that they now no longer have to cast a vote on raising the
debt limit if the overall federal budget is out of balance.  Instead,
a procedural vote on the budget is deemed to have legislative
significance.  Last year, a similar procedure was used to enact new
deficit targets for future years without an actual vote.  Whatever one
thinks of the wisdom of such choices, the procedure used to make them
(or, more precisely, to avoid making them) cheats representative
democracy.
<P>     Representative Mike Crapo (R-ID) has introduced truth-in-voting
legislation that would abolish several of these deceptive procedures;
although the bill has 83 cosponsors, the House so far has declined to
act on it. (For a more extensive discussion of truth in voting, see
Dan Greenberg, "It's Time for Truth in Voting," Heritage Foundation
Backgrounder No.  977, February 23, 1994.)
<P>      The House needs a five-day waiting period before voting on
legislation, which would create more time for analysis and
improvement; a two-thirds requirement to waive House rules, which
would dampen the current trend towards their subversion; and
elimination of such deceptive voting procedures as the automatic debt
limit hike and the king-of-the-hill rule.  Although some Members
doubtless have an interest in keeping the legislative process as rapid
and secret as possible, this is not an interest that should be
respected.
 <P>    One of the few successful reforms in this Congress was
Representative Jim Inhofe's (R-OK) success in eliminating the secrecy
of the signatures on House discharge petitions (as discussed in
"Commitment to Reform," earlier in the paper).  Disclosing the
signatures on these petitions reveals which Members of Congress
actually support up-or-down votes on legislation that House leaders
wish to sidetrack.  Because this reform changed House Rules and will
lead to more votes on controversial questions, Congress's performance
on truth-in-voting reforms merits a barely passing grade.
<P>
TERM LIMITS

<P>
House:  F Senate:  F
  <P>   The changes in the legislative process, congressional perks, and
internal administration discussed above are attempts to solve
Congress's central problem:  abuse of power.  For too long, incumbents
have been able to conceal the policy choices they make through
deceptive voting and accounting procedures and cement their reelection
by using taxpayer-funded perks.  Congressional reform must be crafted
and passed by Congress, and incumbents' experience permits them to
design legislation which evades -- or, in some cases, contradicts --
its stated goals.  (See the discussion of congressional coverage and
campaign finance reform above.) Term limits, the best prospect for
real congressional reform, come from outside of Congress; across the
country, strong public support for term limits (74 percent in one
recent poll (Americans Talk Issues poll, January 1994.)) is
counterbalanced only by furious resistance from elected officials.
  <P>   Term limits are the best solution to many of Congress's larger
problems.  Limiting the terms of federal legislators would change the
composition of Congress by attracting candidates with demonstrated
expertise in something besides politics.  Limits would change
legislators' incentives:  citizen-legislators would serve briefly,
focus their energies on solving a few discrete problems, and go home. 
They also would ensure congressional turnover and mandate independent
representation that better reflects the sentiments of the electorate. 
Ever-present concerns about reelection would be removed from Congress
by the deprofessionalization that term limits would bring to American
politics. 
<P>     Despite strong public support for limiting congressional terms,
Congress has refused to act.  Term limits have passed overwhelmingly
in every state that permitted its voters a choice, but the House
Judiciary Committee has held only two inconclusive hearings on term
limits -- two more than were held in the Senate, where limits came up
for a vote only once; a proposed amendment to the campaign finance
reform bill, which would have limited candidates who accepted public
campaign funds to two terms, failed 39-57.
<P>    Generally, legislators prefer to fight term limits in private,
through litigation and by delaying votes on term limit proposals.  The
Senate, for example, voted in 1993 to authorize its legal counsel to
argue against term limits in an Arkansas case that questioned their
constitutionality -- a case currently before the Supreme Court.  Such
use of public resources for political purposes is especially galling
when it flies in the face of the unambiguous majority of the voters. 
Speaker Foley has blocked a House vote on term limits until their
constitutionality is "decided by the courts." ("This Week with David
Brinkley," November 8, 1992, ABC transcript.)  The Speaker's
constitutional scruples do not apply universally, however; he
championed campaign finance reform legislation in the 103rd Congress
despite significant questions about its encroachment on First
Amendment rights.  Congress frequently has approved constitutionally
disputable legislation with special provisions for expedited judicial
review.  Furthermore, Foley is by no means a neutral party in this
case, having sued the voters of his own state in an effort to overturn
their 1992 vote in favor of term limits.
<P>     There are defenders of term limits in Congress, where over 100
House Members have signed a discharge petition that would wrest
control over term limits legislation from the Judiciary Committee. 
That committee is controlled by Texan Jack Brooks, a Member of
Congress since the Truman Administration who is currently running for
a 22nd term.  The elimination of senior committee Members' power to
bottle up for decades any ideas they oppose will be one of the most
salutary effects of congressional term limits.  House Republicans
already have imposed term limits on their top committee members
through an internal party caucus rule. (The House Republican pledge
discussed in note 5 above also includes a commitment for a floor vote
on term limits.)
 <P>    Congress should allow a vote on, and approve, an amendment to the
Constitution that establishes term limits.  This vote should be free
of the procedural roadblocks that characterized the deceptive voting
procedures used by the House earlier this session to foil the balanced
budget amendment.  Until Congress takes action, it deserves opprobrium
for ignoring the most significant political mass movement the United
States has seen for decades. (For a more extensive discussion of term
limits, see Dan Greenberg, "Term Limits: The Only Way to Clean Up
Congress," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 994, August 10, 1994.)
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>     Students who fail their coursework are forced to repeat a grade.
Ideally, incumbents who fail at their assignments should face an even
harsher punishment: removal from office. The 103rd Congress, swept
into office by promises of reform made to the American people, has
failed to deliver on a broad array of measures. The 104th Congress,
which will be elected this fall, in the next two years should:
<P>
Create a legislative process which permits up-or-down votes on
     important reforms;
<P>
Eliminate misleading budget procedures;
<P>
Fully apply all relevant federal laws to itself;
<P>
Eliminate congressional perks that are used to influence elections;
<P>
Pass campaign finance reform that gives a fair chance to challengers;
<P>
Rationalize the ineffective committee system by limiting memberships;
<P>
Eliminate party politics from internal congressional administration;
<P>
Pass truth-in-voting reforms to eliminate deceptive voting practices;
and

Limit congressional terms.
<P>
     Individual Members of Congress should make such reforms their top
legislative priority. Continued inaction will contribute to further
decline in public approval for -- and public legitimacy of --
Congress. The 103rd Congress gets poor marks on its reform record,
especially considering its tremendous initial promise. But like every
recipient of a poor report card, Congress can learn from it that there
is tremendous room for improvement.

<h2>Government Bureaucracy</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
Few American taxpayers noticed much difference when thousands of 
government workers were declared nonessential and told to stay home 
until the federal budget crisis could be resolved. The only question 
was, how did so many unnecessary employees ever land a civil service 
job in the first place?
</i></blockquote>



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 In a recent editorial in the Washington Times, Gordon Jones of the 
Association of Concerned Taxpayers records the candid observations of 
one federal government employee regarding the low levels of 
productivity among his coworkers. "A large percentage of federal 
workers hurt rather than help get the work done," claims the 
exasperated civil servant, who for obvious reasons prefers to remain 
nameless. (We'll call him J.B., short for Jaundiced Bureaucrat.) J.B. 
complains that the worst one-third of the federal work force "actually 
drains energy and production from the efforts of their colleagues." 
Clearly, it would be better to pay such people to stay home; but, if 
that's the case, why pay them at all?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The worst offenders were probably born that way, but there's something 
about working for the government that devitalizes even the most 
competent and conscientious civil servant. "Most federal workers did 
not start this way," says J.B. "Most walked in the door on their first 
day of federal service with a strong work ethic and an optimistic 
vision of serving their fellow citizens." Eventually, however, "the 
dysfunctional work environment takes its toll. First they lose their 
optimism, and then many lose their work ethic. Why? Because they 
observe many nonproductive troublemakers going undisciplined, and 
hardworking individuals going unrewarded. They learn that the 
personnel policies and processes encourage frivolous grievances and 
insupportable accusations. They learn that, in most cases, it is more 
helpful to your federal career to maintain the status quo."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Where are the managers, the persons responsible for motivating the 
work force and assessing individual performance? They're there, all 
right, but they're not doing their jobs. "The word 'management' is 
often used in the federal service by people who do not seem to 
understand what it means," observes J.B. "Individuals selected for 
their political connections instead of their management ability fill 
critical decision-making positions." Such persons are "guided by a 
perspective that demands a short-term 'fix' rather than a longer-term 
solution." The yes men they surround themselves with are happy to 
validate this self-serving approach.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It may come as a surprise that many of the idlers feeding at the 
public trough in Washington feel themselves strangely put upon. 
Despite all evidence to the contrary, they're convinced that they're 
underpaid, compared to private-sector employees, and overworked. J.B. 
dismisses these complaints. "An amazing number of federal employees," 
he insists, "could not qualify for jobs in the private sector that 
paid anywhere near our current salaries." With 10 weeks' worth of 
vacation, holidays, and sick leave each year -- and precious little 
expected from him when he does show up at the office -- J.B. confesses 
that he is anything but underpaid and overworked.

 <i> September 6, 1996</i><p> 
 
<h2> Separating School & State </h2><p>                           



<i>The federal government doesn't run the churches in America Why should it run the schools?</i><p>

"In America, we don't use the government to run the churches; and, considering our diversity, we have admirable religious harmony," observes Marshall Fritz in the July issue of The Freeman. Fritz believes that "this 'hands-off" policy is America's greatest gift to the human race." He recommends that the policy be extended to the field of education, as well, calling for "the separation of school and state."<p>

A former Christian school principal, Fritz is the founder of the Separation of School and State Alliance, which advocates the dismantling of the public school system in America. "People have long pondered why parent-funded private schools seem to work fairly well . . . and tax-funded public schools seem to be going downhill at an increasing speed," Fritz remarks. "In fact, public-school educators are scrambling to imitate the non-essential features of private schools. Some call for uniforms, son e want 'values' programs, all clamor for fewer layers of administration in their hopes to reverse their downward plunge. The stampede has gone so far that even union leaders are calling for . . . 'more choice and market dynamics."' They just don't get it, says Fritz. "In their call for 'market dynamics,' union leaders miss the real secret of success of parent-funded schools: parental responsibility."<p>

This, Fritz declares, is "the key difference between tax-funded and parent-funded schools. Parent-funded schools have a high percentage of parents who are fully exercising their parental rights in education, and tax-funded schools have few such parents." Fritz explains that "parents who directly provide for their children's education sacrifice. That act both reflects and influences their attitude about their children's education. In contrast, paying taxes . . . is neither investment nor sacrifice. One is not deferring gratificat on, but merely avoiding pain. Coercion is central to the financing of tax-funded schools," Fritz contends, "whereas deferred gratification, usually based on hope and love, is the financing source of parent-funded schools."<p>

Fritz argues that government, as "the great enabler of irresponsibility and dependence," has created "an epidemic of parental irresponsibility." Nor will parents learn to be responsible again until they are forced to "pay the price of irresponsibility." Fritz argues that parent-funded schools succeed because they "have love as part of their culture; it starts with their financing. Tax-funded schools have coercion as part of their culture; it also starts with their financing. In education, like so much of life, love works. Coercion doesn't."<p>

While recognizing that "our forebears had the wisdom and courage to end government-compelled church funding, attendance, and practice," Marshall Fritz says we should go them one step better and prohibit government from "compelling school funding, attendance, and curriculum. Only with the separation of school and state," says Fritz, "can we re-establish parental responsibility, protect parents' rights, and enable schools, teachers, and students to flourish in an environment of educational freedom."<p>

<title>Duplantier: "McCARTHYISM" -- 6/03/96</title>

<h2>"McCarthyism" </h2>


<i><blockquote>
<P>
When liberals accuse conservatives of "McCarthyism, " they're 
engaging in the very practice they claim to abhor. They're employing the 
infamous smear tactics of innuendo and guilt by association.
</I></Blockquote><P>


"McCarthyism" is a noxious term, so much so that any public figure 
accused of it becomes an instantaneous pariah. "McCarthyism" is also an 
ironic term, for two reasons. First, Senator Joseph McCarthy never 
engaged in any of the tactics associated with the term "McCarthyism." 
He did not make wild, unsubstantiated charges against hundreds of 
innocent people. He smeared no one. Second, the few dozen government 
employees that McCarthy did accuse of being Communists were just 
what he said they were. There was sufficient evidence at the time to 
warrant investigation of the figures he named. In the last four decades, 
the guilt of these person has been firmly established, and materials 
recently released from Soviet archives only add to the crushing weight of 
existing evidence.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If anything, McCarthy did not go far enough, concludes former FBI 
Assistant Director Ray Wannall. "The National Security Agency's 
release of the 'Venona' documents, intercepted communications of Soviet 
KGB officers in the United States to their bosses in Moscow, suggests 
that McCarthy's charges of government infiltration understated the 
reality," says Wannall. The Venona papers "underscore the fact that our 
government was massively riddled with Americans in high-ranking 
positions who were tilting policy to serve Soviet ends and engaging in 
espionage, including sharing our atomic secrets with Stalinist Russia."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Wannall argues that McCarthy had good reason to be "especially 
concerned about the State Department. Not only had the department 
been infiltrated by such high-ranking officials as Alger Hiss," but 
thousands of government personnel "had been merged into the 
department from other agencies following World War II," without first 
being screened for Communist affiliations and other security risks.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In 1948, two years before McCarthy leveled the charges that provoked a 
storm of simulated outrage, the House Committee on Un-American 
Activities reported that "there have been numerous Communist 
espionage rings at work in our executive agencies which have worked 
with and through the American Communist Party and its agents to relay 
to Russia vital information essential to our national defense and security. 
Russian Communists have worked hand in hand with American 
Communists in these espionage activities."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"In the wake of what we knew about communism and how thoroughly 
our government had been penetrated by Soviet agents before Joe 
McCarthy exploded onto the political scene," Wannall observes, "it is 
difficult to understand how so many Americans rallied to the anti-
McCarthy cause, or how the term 'McCarthyism' has taken on such a 
derisive tone." Wannall contends that many of McCarthy's critics were 
"apprehensive about what he might reveal concerning them and their 
friends, and they reacted with fury," using the very tactics that we have 
all been conditioned to associate with Joe McCarthy. History will one 
day record, however, that the only person smeared during the McCarthy 
era was McCarthy himself.

<h2>The Future of Education

</h2>



<P><blockquote><i>    
The political correctness movement has captured America's universities, and the NEA dominates our    
public school system. But students won't have to learn in lock step much longer, because the technological    
revolution will soon make these institutions of indoctrination obsolete.</i></blockquote>
<p>    
    
Years ago, many Americans got their education from correspondence courses. Now, an enterprising outfit    
in Springfield, Virginia has updated the concept for the '90s. The Teaching Company offers more than 60    
college-level courses on audio and video cassettes. One of their more popular offerings is a 70-part series    
of 45-minute lectures entitled The Great Minds of the Western Intellectual Tradition. Two well-known    
and respected scholars from prestigious Ivy League universities deliver most of the lectures, with four    
other "superstar teachers" supplying the balance. "The result," according to a full-page advertisement in a    
popular weekly magazine, "is a definitive survey of Western thought by an all-star teaching team with no    
equal in lecturing skill at any single college campus anywhere in the world."    



  



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


  
What could be better than access to "an all-star teaching team" on videocassettes at a fraction of the cost    
of college tuition? How about a give-and-take between you and a noted scholar in the privacy of your own    
home? That's available now, too -- thanks to Bob Jones University and something called the Live    
Interactive Network Classroom, or LINC for short. The Live Interactive Network Classroom can be in    
your living room or in a traditional schoolroom -- or in any other private or public facility. No matter    
where you are, you'll receive daily satellite transmissions from a teacher in a television studio -- a teacher    
you can see and hear and speak to, as can any other student anywhere in the country who happens to be    
participating in the same class.



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


     
    
Who's the intended target of this satellite schooling service? Surely not the nation's elite. "The wealthy    
will always be able to afford the best private education," writes syndicated columnist Cal Thomas. In a    
recent column describing the Live Interactive Network Classroom, Thomas argues that LINC "can free the    
middle class, and especially the poor, from their bondage to government schools. As an all-in-one    
resource, it can maintain the highest standards in foreign languages, math, and science, as well as    
advanced subjects, such as physics, that are not always available in private education." Cal Thomas    
predicts that LINC "could eventually allow all parents the freedom to choose what they believe is best for    
their children, at a reasonable price, and without the indoctrination that passes for education in the current    
intellectually and spiritually closed system" that all taxpayers must subsidize whether they want to or not. 



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

   
    
If the Teaching Company and the Live Interactive Network Classroom developed by Bob Jones University    
are any indication of what education will be like in the future, American students have every reason to    
rejoice. American educators, on the other hand, had better start looking for new jobs.

<h2>Union Electioneering</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
The AFL-CIO recently announced that it plans to spend $35 million to   
influence the outcome of this year's elections. That's seven times what the   
labor federation normally spends on national elections!
</i></blockquote>
<P>     
  
  
 
  

<p>  
"After decades of declining political influence, labor unions have pledged   
to multiply their election efforts this year with a $35 million war chest,"   
says Charles Griffin of the Heritage Foundation. "The first real test of   
organized labor's new activism -- Oregon's special election for a United   
States Senate seat -- resulted in a narrow victory for the candidate heavily   
backed by big labor. Similar efforts can be expected in numerous House   
and Senate races this fall." After all, new AFL-CIO President John   
Sweeney won election to his post late last year by "pledging more active   
organization drives to help increase the union rolls in America and   
promising vocal political campaigns to promote the union movement's   
liberal agenda."  
<p>  
The AFL-CIO made more than 230,000 phone calls and sent out more   
than 350,000 pieces of mail on behalf of the Democratic candidate in the   
special election in Oregon to fill the Senate seat vacated by Bob   
Packwood. "The AFL-CIO did not act alone, however. By joining forces   
with at least 11 individual unions, it was able to mount a considerable   
presence in this one targeted race," observes Griffin. "The considerable   
firepower mustered by these organizations resulted in more than $   
183,000 in political action committee donations to the Democratic   
candidate."  
<p>  
Griffin emphasizes that "impact is not measured in direct PAC spending   
alone. Phone banks, direct mail, paid advertising, and grassroots   
organizing are all significant activities that labor used in Oregon and can   
be expected to use throughout this year to promote favored political   
candidates. Many of these activities can be funded out of forced dues. In   
Oregon, these efforts were worth hundreds of thousands of dollars more   
than direct, reported expenditures."  
<p>  
Griffin predicts that "the AFL-CIO and other labor organizations will   
continue to invest heavily in campaign activity" during the course of this   
election year, and concedes that they have every right to do so.   
"Unfortunately," he says, "much of this politicking will be funded   
through mandatory worker dues, and much is unreported and unregulated   
by federal election laws." Griffin argues that it is unjust for union   
members to be "compelled to surrender their own pay . . . to finance   
political activity to which they may well object." He urges Members of   
Congress, in addressing campaign finance reform, to consider "whether it   
is fair to force every union member to pay for the ideological warfare of   
union officials.'' Reform legislation, says Griffin, should stipulate that   
"only voluntary contributions are used for politics."  
<p>  
Organized labor promises to be a major player in the 1996 elections.   
While conceding that unions should be "as free as other organizations to   
pursue their political goals," Charles Griffin of the Heritage Foundation   
insists that "the coercive nature of union funding, and the regulatory   
advantages unions enjoy, are unjust and unfair."

<blockquote><i>
The case of Army Specialist Michael New is a lot more complicated 
than it looks. It involves considerably more than the mere question of 
a soldier disobeying a commanding officer.

<P> 
"The case of Michael New appears simple at first glance," says 
Congressman Roscoe Bartlett of Maryland. "A soldier disobeys a direct 
order and is court-martialed, convicted, and given a bad conduct 
discharge." There's a lot more to it than that, however. "Michael New 
is the first American soldier prosecuted for declining to wear the 
uniform and badge of another government," observes Congressman 
Bartlett. "What is at stake is nothing less than whether we are a 
nation ruled by men, or one ruled by laws."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Bartlett points out that Michael New is a decorated soldier who 
previously served in a United Nations peacekeeping mission. He 
participated in "Operation Southern Watch" in Kuwait in 1993 -- albeit 
"under an American commander wearing his American uniform." Bartlett 
notes that Michael New also agreed to go to Macedonia, as commanded, 
"but questioned his additional orders to wear a United Nations uniform 
including a blue beret and shoulder patch, to rely solely upon a 
United Nations identification card, and to serve under the overall 
command of a foreign officer." New concluded that these orders would 
unlawfully "transfer his allegiance to the United Nations."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As it happens, quite a few of our Congressmen agree with Michael New 
that these orders were illegal. Roscoe Bartlett addresses the issues 
one by one. First, the uniform: "Altering the Army Battle Dress 
Uniform with any foreign badge is prohibited under Army uniform 
regulations." Second, the UN I.D. card: "No American soldier, prior to 
the Macedonia mission, had ever been required to carry and rely upon a 
UN identity card." Third, the question of foreign command: "The 
president as commander-in-chief does not have the authority to deploy 
American soldiers to serve under foreign command."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A number of Congressmen also believe that the mission itself is 
unlawful. The deployment of U.S. troops to Macedonia was "authorized 
and always explicitly defined as a 'Chapter VII' peace enforcement 
operation under the UN Charter," observes Bartlett. "American military 
participation in Chapter VII UN Operations always requires prior 
congressional approval under Section 6 of the United Nations 
Participation Act and under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution." 
Bartlett concludes that "Mr. Clinton's order to deploy American combat 
troops to Macedonia beginning in July 1993 was illegal and 
inconsistent with U.S. statutes and the Constitution."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Roscoe Bartlett believes that "Americans should be grateful for 
Michael New's moral courage to obey his conscience and our 
Constitution." The Congressman has introduced a resolution in the 
House of Representatives called "The American Hero Restoration Act," 
which urges President Clinton to overturn the conviction of Michael 
New and "restore his place of honor in our military." Bartlett says 
it's time to affirm that "American soldiers enlist in our all-
volunteer military to fight for and defend the United States, not the 
United Nations."

<h2>Why America Must Cut Immigration </h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>"Immigration has been, and can continue to be, in the national interest -- 
if properly regulated." </i></blockquote>
<P> 
The United States issues 675,000 immigrant visas a year. Senator Alan 
Simpson of Wyoming thinks that's far too many. As chairman of the Senate 
Subcommittee on Immigration, Simpson has proposed cutting the number to 
540,000, a 20 percent reduction. "The first and most important reason [for 
reducing immigration] is that the American people desire it," says Simpson. 
If Congress fails to take the initiative on this matter, he argues, "the 
people in the states and local communities of this country will most surely 
take it into their own hands to make the badly needed changes." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The reason the American people want a reduction in immigration is "to allow 
the historically high flow of immigrants who have entered in the past 
several years to assimilate, to learn English . . . and to become 
integrated into the American economy." Simpson says that Americans "want 
criminal aliens swiftly expelled from this country. They want assurances 
that immigrants will not become a burden on the public welfare system. They 
want to know that American workers, particularly workers and students just 
entering the job market, will have a fair chance at the jobs offered by 
American employers -- and that wages of U.S. workers will not be undercut 
by foreign workers overjoyed to receive a fraction of what Americans earn." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
With regard to the immigration of family members, Simpson argues that 
"those opportunities should be reserved for the 'nuclear family' of 
citizens and permanent residents." He argues that "our present policy of 
giving preference to more distant family members . . . leads to the entry 
of in-laws of in-laws and persons who have only the most distant kinship 
relationship to the original immigrants -- or even none at all." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Senator Simpson believes that it is in the national interest to "restrict 
the immigration of unskilled workers, those who would directly compete with 
American workers entering the job market as a result of new limitations on 
the use of public assistance." He contends that "responsible immigration 
reform must also consider the more than one-third of a million Americans" 
who lost their jobs in the past year. "Of particular concern," he says, 
"are Americans who are laid off only to see their former jobs lawfully 
performed by temporary foreign workers.'" 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Senator Alan Simpson's proposed legislation to revise immigration policy is 
based on the following common-sense principles: "Persons who are here 
illegally, particularly criminal aliens, should be quickly removed from the 
country through the reform of our detention and deportation process -- and 
while here should not be able to either work or obtain most forms of public 
assistance. Persons seeking to come legally should be swiftly united with 
their close family members in this country or . . . expeditiously and 
effectively screened so that they may take the jobs for which no qualified 
American is available. Finally, the overall number of immigrants should be 
reduced for at least five years."

Budget Falls Far Short," March 15, 1994.)<br>
By Baker Spring<br>
Backgrounder Update #242<br>
March 7, 1995
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>

          "We must not cut defense further."  This quote is from the
State of the Union Address President Clinton gave a little over a year ago. 
Yet on February 6, the President submitted his fiscal year 1996-2000 budget
proposal, which indeed cuts defense further.  His new proposal would
reduce defense spending by 5.3 percent in FY 1996 and an additional 4.1
percent in FY 1997.  In fact, the Clinton proposal for the entire five-year
period would slash the defense budget by over $140 billion (in budget
authority) from the Congressional Budget Office's January 1995 baseline,
which is the standard against which Congress votes to increase or decrease
federal spending.
     <P>
               The problem is actually worse than these budget
figures suggest.  The amount the Clinton Administration has budgeted for
defense is not enough to fully fund the Administration's own defense
program.  In fact, because of the Administration's unwillingness to
acknowledge the cost of its program, the Clinton defense budget will fall
short by $110 billion from 1996 to 2000.  This shortfall will have a
devastating effect on combat readiness, the morale of U.S.  troops, and the
quality and effectiveness of American arms.  The specific effects of this
shortfall will be to:
<P>
     Lower troop morale and hamper recruitment.
 <P>    
          Under the Clinton plan, military pay will not keep up with
inflation.  Previous Clinton Administration defense budgets have not
accounted fully for the effects of inflation, and this new budget is no
exception.  The Administration has requested a 2.4 percent pay raise for
military personnel in 1996; the Congressional Budget Office estimates that
inflation will be 3.4 percent next year.  The trend of not adjusting pay to
account fully for the effects of inflation continues throughout the five-year
budget period (see Chart 1).  If inflation remains at 3.4 percent a year for
the next five years, the average soldier's pay will drop by almost 10 percent
in real terms.  These cuts in real wages not only will hamper the services'
ability to recruit and retain high-quality personnel, they will badly damage
morale.
   <P>  
     Weaken combat readiness.
  <P>   
          Despite Clinton Administration claims that it is giving
military readiness the highest priority, readiness funding levels are falling. 
Readiness is funded mainly by the operations and maintenance account of
the defense budget.  These funds pay for the daily costs of running and
maintaining the nation's armed forces.  As with military pay, funding levels
for operations and maintenance will decline in real terms because of a
failure to adjust for inflation (see Chart 2).  Instead of letting readiness
funding levels drop, the Administration should tap into the $11 billion in
non-defense activities that the Pentagon will be forced to spend in 1995. 
Congress should reinvest savings from these programs in near-term readiness
programs.
  <P>   
     Deny troops the advanced weaponry they need to prevail over
America's foes.
  <P>   
          Funding for military research and development will drop
dramatically in the Clinton defense budget (see Chart 3).  The
Administration requested $36.2 billion (in 1995 dollars) for research and
development in the current fiscal year.  By the year 2000, the U.S.  will be
spending only $25 billion (in 1995 dollars).  This 30 percent drop in
research and development funding levels will shrink the pool of technologies
from which the next generation of weapons will be drawn.  As a result, U.S. 
armed forces may lose their technological superiority over potential foes. 
If this happens, the low-cost victory of the Persian Gulf War, where
casualties were kept low because of U.S.  technological superiority, will be
a thing of the past. 
  <P>   
      Assure an armed force too small and weak to win the nation's
wars.
<P>     
          A 1995 report by the General Accounting Office (GAO)
states that the Administration's Bottom-Up Review force will not be able to
handle two major regional wars "nearly simultaneously," as promised by the
Pentagon.  If the under-funding of the BUR force continues, the U.S.  may
be hard-pressed to win even one major regional war.  The reason:  the
military would be forced to make cuts to levels significantly below those
recommended in the BUR.
     
   <P>  
     
     Fixing the Problem
    <P> 
          The Clinton Administration's fiscal 1996 defense budget, like
its predecessors, is woefully inadequate.  It is up to the Congress to do
something about the Clinton assault on national security funding.  To protect
American security, Congress should: 
<P>
      Fund military pay at the cost of inflation.  This means funding the
military pay account at somewhat less than $79 billion in current ("then
year") dollars by the year 2000, the last year in the five-year program.
 <P>    
     Adjust operations and maintenance levels of funding to levels of
inflation. 
 <P>    
      Increase funding for research and development to $46.9 billion in
current dollars by the year 2000.
  <P>   
     Reinvest non-defense funds in the defense fund budget in national
security programs.
<P>
          Congress should scale back spending programs in the defense
budget that have little or nothing to do with national defense.  Some of this
spending supports civilian athletic events and extensive non-defense medical
research programs.  Spending on these programs should be applied to
maintaining near-term readiness.
<P>
     
     Conclusion
    <P> 
          By a vote of 241-181, the House of Representatives on
February 16 passed the National Security Revitalization Act, pledging "to
reassess United States military needs and reverse the continuing downward
spiral of defense spending."  Congress can start fulfilling this pledge by
stopping the Clinton assault on funding for national security.  The choice is
clear:  Will America remain a global power able to defend American
freedom and prosperity?  Or will the United States shrink as a great power
and become vulnerable to the whims and threats of the many dangerous
forces existing in the world today?  Congress has the power to ensure that
the country makes the right choice.

 <TITLE>HOW THE U.S. CAN PROMOTE GREATER FREE TRADE IN ASIA -- Heritage </TITLE>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<b>Heritage Lecture 480</b><br>
<p>
<h2>The Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/95lect.htm">Lectures and Seminars</a></h2>
<hr>
<H3>How the U.S. Can Promote Greater Free Trade in Asia</H3>
Robert B. Zoellick Speaking in Heritage's Van Andel Center, November 9, 1994
<P>
<br>
     I would like to thank Heritage for arranging this panel on the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.  I remember discussing
with Treasury Secretary Baker in 1988 the prospect of forming a
similar group for Finance Ministers.  We moved on to other duties that
summer and never had a chance to launch it.  When the Australians and
others launched the APEC idea in 1989, it very much fit our strategic
view.<P>
     I want to focus on three topics.  The first is the strategic
perspective.  The second is the general purposes of APEC.  And the
third is some suggestions on what APEC's future agenda might be.
   <P>  First, on the strategic perspective.  We are at the end of one
era and at the beginning of another.  So it is important to try to
convey to the public a sense of how institutions like NAFTA and APEC
fit together.  While it is perhaps a simplification, I would suggest
that after World War II, the primary strategic objective of U.S. 
foreign policy was to try to transform Western Europe and Japan into
both allies and partners so we could cooperate on a common agenda. 
The three core elements of that strategy were containment of
communism, reconstruction of Western Europe and Japan, and the
creation of a liberal economic order, particularly with respect to
capital and trade flows.
     <P> Today the United States has two similar strategic objectives. 
The first is to ensure that it maintains strong ties with Western
Europe and Japan.  We cannot take those relationships for granted in
the absence of the Cold War glue.  There are many issues on the
horizon that could lead to strains on those relationships.  We also
have the second objective:  to reach out to the next group of
potential partners that can help us in assuming mutual
responsibilities and promoting mutual economic, political, and
security interests.  Not surprisingly, these potential partners are
the nations that are building market economies, civil societies, and
pluralistic and democratic systems.  The obvious candidates are in
Latin America, Central/Eastern Europe, and, of course, East Asia.
    <P> When you look at the world with this framework, you can see the
interconnections between the things that the United States has been
trying to do through NAFTA, the Enterprise for the Americas
Initiative, APEC, the promotion of a special U.S.-EC relationship, and
our suggestions for offering special free trade arrangements to
Central and Eastern Europe.  This is the political economy structure
for U.S.  foreign policy after the Cold War.  It could be a vehicle
for explaining to the American public how these issues relate to one
another.
   <P>  My second topic is the general purposes of APEC.  I believe
regional integration can support ongoing global liberalization. 
Regional integration is natural.  It reflects economic interdependence
and a number of challenges that cross national lines.  However, it is
very important that we make sure that regional initiatives accommodate
other regional efforts and support ongoing, global liberalization. 
The countries of APEC, by and large, have prospered from an open
global economic system.  That system has been the source of much of
their astounding economic growth.  So by their very nature, most APEC
nations remain very oriented toward an open global system. 
    <P> So even though the increased trade and investment flows within
the Pacific basin provide a basis for new regional arrangements, I
think all the countries of Asia recognize that they benefit from a
healthy, global system.  APEC must fit within and support that global
system.  Similarly, it is important to demonstrate how arrangements
like NAFTA, the Asian Free Trade Agreement, or other groups relate to,
and are mutually supportive of, both APEC and the global system.  It
is also important to relate other Asian developments -- for example,
the growth triangle of Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia, or the
economic region of Southern China including Hong Kong -- within this
integrative model.
   <P> NAFTA and APEC can also be employed to develop innovative
liberalizing arrangements that later can be expanded.  Let me cite
from the NAFTA example.  The provisions in NAFTA on intellectual
property, investment, services, and agriculture go far beyond what we
expect to be able to get in the Uruguay Round.  So there is the
possibility that by creating a model with one group of trading
partners, we can move the liberalization agenda ahead in ways that may
be adopted later by others.  APEC offers the same potential.
 <P>    These efforts also help fight protectionism at home.  The OECD
reported recently that over the last ten or twelve years, twenty of
the 24 OECD countries had moved in the direction of trade protection. 
The so-called bicycle theory suggests that if we are unable to move
the trade liberalization agenda forward, then the forces of
protectionism will pull us down.  Regional efforts can keep up the
momentum for liberalization.
  <P>   Another general purpose of APEC is to ensure that the economic
infrastructure of an integrated Pacific community includes the United
States.  There has been a great increase in intra-Asian and trans-
Pacific trade flows.  One statistic really brought this home to me
recently.  The merchandise trade between Singapore and Taiwan and the
United States is now 20 percent greater than the United States'
merchandise trade with Germany.  When you consider how most Americans
perceived Singapore and Taiwan twenty or thirty or even ten years ago,
I think that is a startling fact; I am sure it is one that most
Europeans do not recognize. 
    <P> The decisions we make today about economic infrastructure will
affect patterns of interaction far into the future.  In some ways, the
APEC agenda is a twentieth century analogy to what happened in the
U.S.  West in the nineteenth century.  In that century, the location
of the telegraph lines and railroads influenced the patterns of
communication, the economic flows, and how integration took place. 
Today, in the Pacific, we are determining where the airline routes go,
what telecommunication systems we will use, what languages people will
speak, where students will study, and many other questions that will
set patterns of future interaction.  It is in the interests of America
and of Asia that the U.S.  turn out to be a key part of this
"infrastructure."
    <P> The third purpose of APEC is that good economic ties create a
stronger foundation for America's ongoing security engagement in the
Pacific.  I'll illustrate the point briefly by referencing a comment
made to me by a former Australian Defense Minister.  He said that
today the policy planning staffs throughout East Asia are examining
two questions very seriously.  One is whether they should develop
weapons of mass destruction.  The other is whether they should shift
their conventional forces from internal security to force projection. 
At least in his view, the primary variable in those analyses is
whether the United States maintains a forward deployed presence in
Asia.  I believe, not surprisingly, that it is very important for the
United States to maintain that presence.  I also believe, however,
that it will be very difficult for any administration to maintain that
presence well into the future unless it can demonstrate to the
American people that we have strong economic and political ties to the
region.  So an organization like APEC, or an event like the Seattle
meeting, are ways of getting the message to the American people about
our economic and security interests in the Pacific.
   <P>  One other security point:  economic arrangements within the
Pacific can also support the cooperative security systems that the
Asians are starting to build.  For example, the ASEAN Post-Ministerial
Conference structure has started a security dialogue.  Of course, we
should not overstate the capabilities of these arrangements.  The U.S. 
force presence is going to remain critical for Pacific security. 
Nevertheless, there are areas, such as transparency of defense
budgets, dealing with narcotics problems, piracy, and I hope
proliferation, where Asian cooperation could enable others to share
the load with the U.S.  Cooperation on economic topics can prepare the
way for political and security arrangements.
  <P>   The fourth purpose that I see for APEC is that it can be an
institutional vehicle for supporting U.S.  business.  I will cite one
example.  The United States promoted a telecommunications group, both
because it is important for the region's economic infrastructure, as I
noted earlier, but also because we had very strong business support. 
We tried to involve these U.S.  businesses in the work that we
promoted at APEC.
   <P>  The fifth purpose for APEC has run throughout my comments:  APEC
can affect U.S.  public opinion.  We have extraordinary opportunities
and interests in Asia.  Yet I think that view is not well understood,
particularly on this coast.  An institution like APEC can help get the
message out.  Meetings like the Seattle conference help focus
attention in the United States.
   <P>  The sixth purpose of APEC is to help position the United States
globally.  While many people are anxious about the U.S.  role in the
world, the United States remains the one global power -- whether in
terms of security, economics, or politics.  Our share of world GNP
remains in the low 20s, as it has for about ten or twenty years.  The
United States' interests obviously cannot be restricted to the
Americas, Europe, or, for that matter, Asia.  Our objective should be
to integrate ourselves effectively into all those regions, so as to
enhance our global influence.
  <P>   Finally, I wanted to talk briefly about what should be on APEC's
agenda.  It is important to recognize that APEC's gradual pace of
development has been dictated by practical considerations of the need
to bring our Asian, and particularly ASEAN, partners along.  Singapore
has been a great booster of APEC from the very start, but other ASEAN
countries have worried that APEC might in some way dwarf ASEAN's role. 
They were also concerned about whether the institutionalization of
APEC might create a bureaucracy that could undermine their interests. 
So it took four years to get APEC off the ground. 
   <P>  At this point, APEC needs two things.  First, it needs a vision,
a sense of where it is going.  But APEC also needs practical steps
that will demonstrate how it can achieve goals that will move toward
that vision.  The "Eminent Persons" report is an effort to devise
vision.  Fred Bergsten has been the United States representative. 
From the work that I have seen, I think this group has done a very
good job.  I hope their report will be published, because it can help
launch the debate on APEC's long-term view.
  <P>   My vision is for free trade throughout the Pacific community.  I
realize that this goal will not be easy to achieve.  But I think we
will be better able to organize political and business support in the
United States if we have a sense of where we are going.
  <P>   The near-term agenda for APEC depends a great deal on NAFTA and
the Uruguay Round, not surprisingly given the fact that, at least in
my concept, all of these efforts are related.  In the very near-term,
I continue to think that there is an opportunity for APEC to give a
very needed push to completing the Uruguay Round.  I suggested after
the Tokyo Economic Summit that the U.S.  should send an emissary to
ASEAN and other countries in Asia with a message:  "Now that we have
moved forward the negotiations on market access by coming forward with
a package in Tokyo, it is time for those in Asia who also support free
trade and who want the Uruguay Round to succeed to come up with a
package that we could use at APEC."
    <P> An APEC initiative on the Uruguay Round would be a wonderful
opportunity to demonstrate that APEC stands for something.  It would
also demonstrate something that I think Asians are slow in recognizing
-- that is, the decisions on multi-lateral trade issues are not only
in the hands of the United States, the European Community, and Japan. 
The countries of East Asia are now big enough economically, and
certainly their prospects are sizable enough, that it is very
important that they also make market access offers, particularly in
the services area.  Seattle offers an opportunity for the countries of
APEC to send a signal about their outward orientation by giving the
Uruguay Round a push. 
  <P>   Beyond the Uruguay Round, and I hope beyond the NAFTA, I have a
list of ten items for APEC's future agenda.  I will touch on each, to
give you a sense for future discussions.  Some items are small, to
create movement in the near term.  Some are more ambitious.
     <P>The first is a trade and investment consultation agreement.  It
is still striking that there are many obstacles to trade and
investment that probably nobody really thinks are a good idea, but
have remained in place because countries have not devoted attention to
the detailed work of eliminating them.
   <P>  Second, I would focus on infrastructure developments.  We could
start by following through on the working groups that have been
established in APEC.  These groups deal with topics like
transportation, telecommunications, higher education and training, and
customs processes.  My former colleague, Sandy Kristoff, who is now on
the NSC staff, did a super job of trying to overcome Korean customs
impediments.  A great deal more needs to be done in this area.  In
transportation, for example, we have been trying to overcome barriers
through airline negotiations, which continue to operate through
bilateral agreements.  If the United States and Asian countries are
interested in having more contact, whether by students or
businesspeople, we should welcome competition that will help us lower
air fares.
  <P>   A third item would be mutual recognition of product standards and
testing.  We have launched some efforts in these areas with the EC. 
Some of this work is handled through standards organizations.  But we
could simply start reviewing these items, one by one, particularly in
the area of high technology, to see whether standards or approval
processes are getting in the way of business.
     <P>Fourth, APEC could address items that might fall by the wayside
in the Uruguay Round process.  This agenda might include topics like
government procurement, intellectual property, financial services, and
perhaps competition policies.  We could seek to bring together like-
minded countries to push the liberalization agenda forward,
demonstrate successful records, and then, I hope, bring others along
over time.
     <P>The fifth topic could be an investment code.  It is striking the
degree to which trade now follows investment, as opposed to vice-
versa.  As I recall, over a majority of our trade with Europe
represents intra-company trade flows.  Western Europe and North
America have a very rich exchange of direct investment, but neither
the European Community nor the United States has a similar pattern
with Japan.  This asymmetry of direct investment could be affecting
our trade patterns.
     <P>One might begin with a voluntary investment code.  It could cover
topics like national treatment, transparency, non-discrimination, and
the right of establishment.  All countries, including the U.S., have
some restrictions on foreign investment.  Countries might list those
limits and then use the GATT framework or such an agreement to roll
back those limits over time.
    <P> Investment is also very important to competition in services. 
When you examine how trade agreements deal with services, you observe
that the key to liberalization is to open investment opportunities for
people who want to start service operations in other economies.
    <P> The sixth idea is to involve the finance ministers in macro-
economic discussions.
    <P> Seven, APEC should explore ties with other institutions, for
example, the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank, and IFC.  To help
avoid making APEC into a bureaucracy, it would be natural to involve
the ADB and others with the infrastructure program.
   <P>  The eighth point would be to continue to involve private
business, for the reasons that I noted.
  <P>   The ninth idea is of a slightly different type, which is to
explore the basis for sub-regional ties.  I know there is some concern
about this in some quarters in Asia, but it would be useful to examine
how the NAFTA and the Asian Free Trade Agreement might be able to
interact to liberalize trade, perhaps ultimately by creating free
trade arrangements between one another.  This would have to be done
carefully so as not to discriminate against others.
    <P> My tenth and final point is to give the APEC ministerials a
particular focus.  For example, if the Ministers launched an agenda
like the one I have outlined, they could review the progress of
specific topics each year.
   <P>  I think that what happens over the next week on NAFTA is going to
go a long way toward determining whether APEC has much life or future. 
I find it striking, as I am sure many of you do, that the President is
working very hard on NAFTA.  But he is struggling to get 100 votes
from his party, when he has 258 in the House of Representatives.  When
the Bush Administration secured fast track negotiating authority, over
the opponents of both NAFTA and the Uruguay Round, we got 93
Democratic votes.  Now I have just got to believe that one way or
another there is the capability to beg, borrow, or steal 100
Democratic votes.  And if they do, I am pretty confident the
Republicans will put up 120. 
   <P>  It would be a tremendously negative signal for everybody around
the world if the President could not get NAFTA through.  It would be a
signal to American politicians, most of whom do not focus on trade
issues, that protectionism was the favored course.  It would be a
signal to countries like France in the Uruguay Round that they would
be nuts to accept a difficult agriculture deal because they couldn't
be sure the Americans could get it through in our own Congress. 
Countries in Asia would say, "Why should we be making arrangements
with a country that can't do the sensible thing with 90 million people
on its border."  The ramifications of this, not only for economics,
but for foreign policy and security policy, are absolutely enormous.

<p>
Buried deep within one of the many articles that sought to account for the tragic suicide of Kurt Cobain last year was a most surprising revelation. According to Village Voice writer Sarah Ferguson, the grunge-rock pioneer's favorite television shows included Leave It to Beaver and Mayberry, R.F.D.<p>
That a cutting-edge cultural icon married to alternative rock's premier feminist (Courtney Love, of the band Hole) could have such retrograde, politically incorrect viewing tastes was, in Ferguson's mind, "odd." But it was also revealing. Grunge rock "is music for kids who grew up too fast," Ferguson says. "It engages in a kind of mournful nostalgia for a childhood without violation." <p>
Cobain was certainly no stranger to violation. Every significant examination of his life regards the divorce of his parents as a major turning point. In fact, so painful were Cobain's memories of the divorce that he once held a gun to his head and told his wife, "I'd rather die than divorce."<p>
Clearly, one does not have to regard Mayberry as nirvana in order to believe that Cobain and many members of his generation would have fared far better if they had grown up in something resembling Beaver Cleaver's neighborhood. Yet, few people todayeven conservativesare prepared to confront the problem that first sent Cobain's young life reeling. Indeed, when Dan Quayle returned last year to the San Francisco club where he gave his famous 1992 Murphy Brown speech, he was quick to point out that when he spoke of the problems surrounding single-parent families, he wasn't referring to "households where the father has died, or even where he is separated by divorce." Rather, Quayle said, he was referring to "those households that have never known a father."<p>
Now, in fairness to Quayle, he also noted that "the ideal situation for our children is to be born and raised in an intact family." Nevertheless, by suggesting that divorce has more in common with death (which is almost always involuntary) than with illegitimacy (almost always voluntary), Quayle's remarks contribute to the trivialization of divorce at a time when social scientists are increasingly likely to agree that the impact of divorce on children is almost always negative and often devastating.<p>
Indeed, as Barbara Dafoe Whitehead argued in her celebrated article on family break-up in the Atlantic Monthly, divorcelike illegitimacyis strongly linked to a wide variety of negative outcomes for children, from child abuse and neglect to serious juvenile crime. A 1994 study of juveniles in the Wisconsin correction system found that 1 in 3 came from divorced or separated homes. Several studies show that unmarried girls whose parents divorce are much more likely to engage in premarital sex and get pregnant out of wedlock than girls from intact households. A 1994 study by researchers at Duke and North Carolina State University reported that family dissolution is a stronger predictor of suicide for young males than such factors as unemployment.<p>
Despite the clear impact of family break-up on children, "some people aren't comfortable talking about divorce and adultery," former Education Secretary William Bennett told a Christian Coalition conference last year. "But it seems to me we have to talk about them. They are before us, and they have great consequences."<p>
Great indeed. The number of children directly affected by divorce has more than doubled in a generation, from 463,000 in 1960 to 985,000 in 1991. Until political and cultural leaders give proper attention to the link between divorce and many of our nation's most serious social problemscrime, poverty, educational declinewe stand little chance of reversing these trends. <p> <b><center>Too Close to Home</b></center>
<p>
One of the obvious reasons there is less public handwringing about divorce than illegitimacy is because divorce hits closer to home in middle America. As Chester Finn of the Hudson Institute recently observed, "Whereas illegitimacy happens mostly among people who live on the other side of the tracks, much divorce and separation takes place in 'our' own neighborhoods, indeed among our friends and relations, and sometimes even ourselves." Divorce is subject to the phenomenon Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan calls "defining deviancy down," in which a society loses its capacity to define certain problems as problems because of their sheer prevalence. Illegitimacy, conversely, continues to be viewed as "deviant" because it is still fairly rare among the middle and upper classes.<p>
It is frequently asserted that half of all marriages end in divorce. The number, derived by comparing the annual number of marriages to the annual number of divorces, overstates the likelihood of a failed first marriage.  This is because the number is skewed upward by the experience of men and women who have gone through divorce many times. The truth is that about one quarter of all adults who have ever been married in America today have also experienced divorce.<p>
Still, divorce is common enough that to raise concerns about it publicly is to risk being impolitic. As Bennett puts it, "The rules are broken down. If you leave your wife and get yourself a 'trophy wife,' you're not going to be greeted with condemnation or even a raised eye by most people, because it has become a convention."<p>
Not only has this convention stifled debate, but it has helped create an expectation of marital failure that can be seen throughout our culture. A recent cartoon in a major publication depicted one young adult saying to another, "It's only marriage I'm proposing after all, not a lifetime commitment." Similarly, in a recent Newsweek story on divorce, one young woman explained why she limited the guest list at her wedding to 70 people, less than one third the size of her sister's wedding list: "I was afraid to make that much of an investment," she said. "What if it didn't work out? Then, I'd have to tell all those people." <p>
Such apprehensions about marriage are especially common among those whose parents have split up. A study by Pamela Webster, a sociologist at Brown University, found that adults whose parents had divorced rated their own chances of divorcing to be considerably higher than did adults whose parents had not divorced. This finding held up even when comparing groups of couples who rated their marital happiness equally. <p>
Sadly, expectations of marital failure have a way of becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Psychologist Silvio Silvestri reports that adult children of divorced parents are four times more likely to get divorced than adult children of intact couples. <p><b><center>The Myth of the Good Divorce</center></b> <p>
Another hindrance to public discussion of marital dissolution  is that many Americans still want to believe that divorce can lead to greater personal fulfillment and stronger relationships between men and women. In the closing scene of the hit movie Mrs. Doubtfire, the central character offers some grandmotherly advice to a young girl trying to come to terms with her parents' break-up. "Some parents, when they're angry, they get along much better when they don't live together," Mrs. Doubtfire says. "They don't fight all the time and they can become better people and much better mommies and daddies." <p>
However much many would like to believe this view of divorce, it is increasingly at odds with the experiences of both children and adults. A study at the University of Oregon found that the impact of divorce on a woman's health and well-being is far more serious than the impact of being fired. Another study, from the University of Alberta, shows that divorced or separated individuals are roughly three times as likely to commit suicide as married people. The University of Texas reports that "divorced men exhibit substantially higher rates of psychological distress and alcohol consumption than do married men." And David Larson of the National Institute for Healthcare Research reports that "being divorced and a non-smoker is only slightly less dangerous than smoking a pack or more a day and staying married."<p>
These and other research findings recently prompted an eclectic group of prominent scholars known as the Council on Families to issue a report decrying the state of marriage in America. The report observed, "In the domain of marriage and family life, our recent explosions of freedom have taken a terrible and largely unexpected toll. Relationships between men and women are not improving; they are becoming more difficult and more unhappy. Many women are experiencing chronic economic insecurity. Many men are isolated and estranged from their children. Many more people are lonely."<p><b><center>Rebuilding the Walls</b></center>
<p>
Over the last three decades, the walls surrounding lifelong marriage have crumbled. The age-old social barriers to divorce, promiscuity, illegitimacy, and cohabitation have been removed in the name of promoting personal freedom and self-expression. A growing number of peopleespecially those in Cobain's generationnow know first-hand that the walls that were thought to entrap and restrict were really there to protect.<p>
So how can the walls be rebuilt? How can confidence in the institution of marriage be restored? Although it would be a mistake to draw inspiration from the last three decades of welfare-state activism, there are some constructive models for addressing certain social problems. One such model is the anti-smoking movement.<p>
At a time when virtually every other area of American life was becoming more and more permissive, the anti-smoking movement succeeded in convincing the American public to adopt less permissive attitudes about smoking. Not only did many Americans change their own behavior (the proportion of adult smokers fell from 42.4 percent in 1965 to 25.6 percent in 1991), but Americans supported efforts to modify the behavior of others. <p>
The anti-smokers' success was due to many factors, including:<ul>
<li>
The careful collection and dissemination of compelling research on the health risks of smoking and inhaling second-hand smoke;<li>
The effective use of media persuasion, including articles, op-eds, essays, reports, and public-service advertisements;<li>
The tireless pursuit of incremental changes in public policy (limiting sales to minors, banning smoking on airplanes and in public buildings, etc.); <li>
The periodic sponsorship of special events (like the Great American Smoke-Out) to raise public awareness and spur private action;<li>
The ongoing provision of practical services (counseling, support groups, etc.) to people interested in behavioral change.</ul>
<p>
To restore confidence in marriage, we need a similar multidimensional strategy. This strategy should seek to repeat the anti-smokers' success, giving particular emphasis to the following four ideas:<p>
Focus on the future. For many people, the subject of divorce is intensely personal and extremely painful. It evokes bad memories and bitter feelings. As such, no attempt to restore public confidence in the institution of marriage is likely to succeed unless it is forward-looking. <p>
This means focusing public attention on lowering the divorce rate henceforth. And it means giving greater emphasis to the future choices of today's young people than to the choices made by their parents. "It may be unreasonable to expect a widespread change of heart about marriage among today's adults," states the Council on Families. "But young people can and often do strive to rebel, to be idealistic, and to do things differently than their elders."<p>
Indeed, in one marriage-related areasexualitythere is already evidence of a movement among today's young people to challenge norms ushered in by their parents' generation. In the last few years, hundreds of thousands of young people have joined public campaigns pledging to save sex for marriage, and the proportion of high schoolers who report that they have had sexual intercourse at least once has declined by at least 6 percentage points since 1990.<p>
A youth-oriented campaign extolling the virtues of lifelong marriage is likely to win support from intact married couples. And it should win support as well from many who have experienced divorce, since most divorced parents want marital success for their children every bit as much as intact couples do. 	<p>
Still, success will not come easily. While many children of divorce long for the strong, enduring marriages their parents never had, many are wary of commitment and fear repeating their parents' mistakes. This is one reason cohabitation is so prevalent among the young. Yet, far from increasing the likelihood of marital success, "trial marriages" actually are linked to higher divorce rates. Indeed, a 1991 study published in the Journal of Marriage and the Family found that 40 percent of cohabiting unions disintegrate before marriage, and that marital unions that begin as a cohabiting relationship have a 50 percent higher rate of divorce than those that do not. <p>
Challenge the church. No cultural institution is more important to the restoration of marriage than the religious community. Churches and synagogues claim a time-honored, divinely-ordained role to help couples understand the moral and spiritual nature of their marriage vows. Religious institutions bear a unique responsibility for helping those embarking on and struggling to maintain marriage commitments. Similarly, only faith communities can offer redemptive hope to people who have experienced marital failure.<p>
While religious leaders do not bear full responsibility for the absence of public discourse about divorce, they can hardly blame others for the failure of many marriages. Author Michael McManus notes that many churches have become "blessing machines" that wed interested couples but offer few marriage-related services, like counseling for engaged and married couples, practical advice on how to strengthen troubled marriages, and mentoring programs for younger couples.<p>
Sermons that warn against divorce or condemn the casual termination of marriages are not popular among some ministers, McManus says. Sermons that acknowledge that the Bible prohibits remarriage in some cases (Matthew 5:32) are even less popular, even though unqualified acceptance of divorce and remarriage can only discourage marital perseverance.<p>
The failure of the church (particularly the Protestant church) to significantly influence the surrounding culture can be seen in the fact that four of the six states with the worst divorce rates in the country (Alabama, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Tennessee) are found right in the heart of the Bible Belt.<p>
When religious leaders take seriously their responsibility for strengthening marriage in their congregations and their communities, divorce does decline. For example, several years ago, ministers in Peoria, Illinois, adopted a community marriage policy that stated none of the city's churches would marry any couple that had not completed a premarital counseling program. In the three-year period after the pact was adopted, Peoria's divorce rate fell nearly 20 percent.<p>
Elevate marriage in public policy. America's retreat from marriage is first and foremost a problem of the heart. It cannot be fixed by the issuance of a government decree or by the adoption of a new government policy. <p>
This does not mean, however, that reform of public policy has no place in a larger strategy to restore confidence in marriage. The law is a teacher. America's casual attitudes about marital permanence are both reflected in and advanced by laws that permit "no-fault" divorce in cases where one spouse wishes to preserve the union, and by laws that require some married couples to pay dramatically higher taxes than cohabiting couples.<p>
Reversing these misguided policies will not only help those directly affected by them, but will also teach others that lifelong marriage is the normative standard our society upholds. Thus, pro-marriage policy reform is both an end in itself, in that it corrects legal wrongs, and a means to an end, in that it stimulates a broader cultural appreciation of marital permanence.<p>
How, then, do we solve these problems? Michigan's state legislature is considering a divorce-reform proposal that would require the establishment of "fault" in cases where one spouse wants to preserve the marriage. This change (and a similar provision requiring "fault" in cases where children are involved) would make family abandonment more difficult by offering greater legal protection to innocent parties in divorce cases.<p>
In the tax front, three ideas deserve attention. Allan Carlson of the Rockford Institute advocates the resurrection of "income-splitting," a practice that allows married couples to divide their total earnings evenly between them before assessing their tax liability. This practice prevents a second income from kicking couples into a higher tax bracketwhether that second income comes from a wage-earning wife or a moonlighting husband. <p>
Another tax option worth considering is a deduction that would adjust tax liability not just for marital status, but also for marital longevity. Tax benefits that modestly increase with each year that a couple stays together would allow a portion of the societal benefit associated with marital stability to be claimed by those who have been married the longest.<p>
Certainly, one must guard against wildly skewing the tax code to promote social goals. But if divorce truly imposes economic costs on society (higher crime, greater need for remedial education, higher health-care costs, and the like), then it may be beneficial to allow lifelong married partners to pay slightly lower taxes than their contemporaries who are married for the second or third time.<p>
Finally, we should consider eliminating "means-testing" in various government programs, since income-based limits on program eligibility tend to penalize marriage. Some married households with income above the threshold can qualify for benefits if they split up and form two separate households. Likewise, some cohabiting couples able to claim benefits as unmarried individuals would lose their benefits if they were to marry and combine their household income.<p>
Valorize marital toughness. There is a common misconception that couples who have good, solid, enduring marriages are "lucky." Supposedly, happily married couples do not face any of the conflicts and struggles that other couples face. They do not go through rough times or encounter serious relational turbulence.<p>
The truth is, every marriage faces trials and hardships and breakdowns in communication. Yes, some couples manage to limit conflict better than others, but every marriage faces difficulties. Ruth Bell Graham was once asked if she had ever contemplated divorcing her husband, evangelist Billy Graham. "No," she said, "but I have considered murder."<p>
If every marriage faces challenges, why is it that some survive and others do not? According to John Gottman, of the University of Washington at Seattle, couples that succeed work hard at resolving conflict. In his recent book, Why Marriages Succeed or Fail, Gottman argues that many of the theories about why some couples divorcemoney problems, sexual disagreements, incompatibility, and so onfail to explain why other equally dissatisfied couples confronting these very same issues do not split up. The real issue, Gottman concludes, is not money or sex or compatibility. The real issue, instead, is whether couples are willing and able to work out their marital differences.<p>
Research by social scientists Nick Stinnett and John DeFrain shows that one of the seven characteristics commonly found in strong, healthy families is the ability to deal effectively with conflict and crisis. Like Gottman, Stinnett and DeFrain find that couples who have to work through difficult problems believe that experience strengthens their marriages. This is important, because most public discussion about divorce revolves around whether divorce would be better than a marriage in which spouses are fighting all the time. This framework assumes falsely that a marriage gone sour can never be made sweet again. It encourages many couples to throw in the towel prematurely. <p>
David Blankenhorn, the president of the Institute for American Values, argues that a broad spectrum of marriages exists in America today. At one end are a small percentage of marriages that are almost effortlessly blissful; at the other, a small percentage that are headed for almost certain failure. Between these two extremes, Blankenhorn says, are the overwhelming majority of marriages: unions that can, with grit and perseverance, not only endure but prosper. <p>
Encouraging lasting commitment in a society that seeks instant gratification is no small challenge. But if it is true that people tend to do those things that are most apt to earn them a good reputation, then it follows that deliberate efforts to valorize marital toughness and perseverance are needed in everything from high-school textbooks to Hollywood movie scripts. At the very least, such efforts could help counterbalance existing cultural messages that undercut marital permanence and stability.<p>
Efforts to valorize enduring commitment should be particularly targeted at men, who historically have shown a greater propensity to neglect family responsibilities than have women. Turning the hearts of men to their families may do more to address divorce (and many other social problems) than any other proposed remedy. On this front, the most encouraging signs on the cultural landscape are the emergence of groups urging men to see that self-sacrifice is a defining characteristic of authentic masculinity. The National Fatherhood Initiative is devising strategies to restore the importance of fathers in society's thinking about family and community life. The National Center for Fathering helps provide dads with practical childrearing skills. The Promise Keepers movement challenges men to make and keep a set of pledges to their wives and families. This year, more than 600,000 men are expected to attend Promise Keepers conferences and seminars.<p>
Given the tenuous state of marriage in Americaand the tragic consequences of divorce on kids like Kurt Cobainone should hope that these efforts succeed. America desperately needs more men to commit themselves to their wives in the way that Theodore Roosevelt once did. On the day that his wife accepted his marriage proposal, Roosevelt wrote in his journal: "The aim of my whole life shall be to make her happy and to shield her and guard her from trial, and, oh, how I shall cherish my sweet queen. How she, so pure and sweet and beautiful can think of marrying me, I cannot understand, but I praise and thank God it is so."

<h2>Corporate Giving</h2>


<i><blockquote>



You'd think that Big Business interests would support our free   
enterprise system and our constitutional form of government, but they   
don't. In fact, the bulk of their annual corporate giving goes to nonprofit   
groups that promote increased regulation and higher taxes.  

   </blockquote></i>

<P>

An expert on corporate philanthropy claims that "corporate America is   
funding its enemies." Austin Fulk of the Capital Research Center reports   
that "many corporations give away their investors' dollars to special   
interest advocacy groups that favor irresponsible government policies   
harmful to a corporation's own best interests." In a recent issue of   
Human Events, Fulk charges that "big business is undermining   
American values by freely contributing to tax-exempt groups that work   
against a free and competitive market." He points out that "tax-exempt   
groups receiving the biggest share of corporate charitable dollars   
repeatedly offer status quo proposals to solve America's most pressing   
problems: racial quotas, increased welfare and entitlement programs,   
higher taxes and more government spending, command-and-control   
environmental laws, and regulations on employers."  
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


More than 300 nonprofit advocacy groups received contributions from   
America's top 250 corporations in 1993, but only 35 of those groups   
received more than $250,000 apiece. Austin Fulk reports that nearly two-  
thirds of these 35 groups "favor the liberal, tried-and-failed policies of   
bureaucratic government. Groups such as the Nature Conservancy, the   
NAACP, the Center for Community Change, and Planned Parenthood   
get big corporate grants."  
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Liberal groups with a Big-Government bias aren't the only beneficiaries   
of corporate largesse, however. "Corporations not only fund groups   
working against the general interests of business, but some also support   
radical activist groups that are principled opponents of America's   
enterprise tradition," says Fulk. "Corporate funding, even in small   
amounts, affects the fortunes of radical activists far out of proportion to   
the actual dollar amount. A corporate gift lends respectability to radical   
groups. It gives them a credential so that they can ask other corporations,   
individuals, and grantmaking foundations for funding."  
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Donations to nonprofit groups that promote big government also   
undermine the work of legitimate charities. "Private charities have a   
record of effectively delivering services," says Fulk. "But too often their   
work is overshadowed by failed government programs that perpetuate the   
social problems they were supposed to address. The mission of charity is   
hurt when government programs replace private programs, and when   
taxpayer funding replaces private contributions and individual   
voluntarism."  
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Austin Fulk of the Capital Research Center urges American investors to   
hold corporate management responsible for foolish and self-defeating   
philanthropy. If managers can't make charitable contributions wisely,   
they should make none at all. "Corporate managements do shareholders   
and the nation a grave disservice when they fund leftist advocacy   
groups," says Fulk. "If the welfare state is to be replaced by an   
opportunity society, support for nonprofit institutions must become more   
discerning. Individuals as well as corporations must champion charities   
and advocacy groups that encourage self-reliance. And they must refuse   
support to nonprofit groups that draw strength from government."

<h2>
TAX-FUNDED LOBBYING
</h2>

<P><blockquote><i>  
Do you ever wonder where your federal income taxes go? Billions go to 
programs that subsidize special interest groups lobbying the government 
to increase spending! Consider the implications of that vicious circle 
when you file your 1040 today.
</blockquote></i>


<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"The federal budget provides numerous slush funds that can be used to 
subsidize the lobbying and political activities of special-interest groups," reports Charles Griffin of the Heritage Foundation. "The agendas of these tax-subsidized groups tend toward bigger government, more spending,
and increased regulation. Every American is forced to finance this system 
that allows well-connected Washington-based groups to use taxpayer 
funds to advance political causes to which many Americans object."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
AmeriCorps received $427 million from American taxpayers in 1995. 
Griffin claims that "several AmeriCorps programs have engaged in 
advocacy and direct partisan politics at the expense of the taxpayers," and 
in violation of the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993. 
Also in 1995, the Legal Services Corporation funneled $400 million of 
our money to private groups that "engage in political and lobbying 
activities, often at the expense of the genuine legal services needed by the 
poor." Griffin describes the Legal Services Corporation as "the legal 
pillar of the welfare state," litigating and lobbying to expand the number 
of welfare recipients and drive up costs by "hundreds of billions of 
dollars."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Nearly $200 million was allocated for Title X Family Planning in 1995. 
"Despite the fact that much of Planned Parenthood's agenda is repulsive 
to large numbers of Americans," observes Griffin, "this high-profile 
political organization receives a substantial portion of its revenue each 
year" from programs administered under Title X. The National 
Endowment for the Humanities used the $180 million it received in 1995 
to promote "a liberal political and ideological agenda," says Griffin. 
"Abuse of federal grant dollars for political purposes is rampant in the 
National Endowment's most prominent current project, the so-called 
National Conversation. At the cost of millions of dollars, the endowment 
is subsidizing such special-interest groups as the National Council on 
Aging, the American Bar Association, and the American Library 
Association."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The $75 million allocated to the Market Promotion Program in 1995 for 
developing "commercial export markets for U.S. agricultural 
commodities" wound up in the hands of "some of the largest and most 
vocal special interests in the country," Griffin charges. Recipients of 
Market Promotion Program grants "opposed bipartisan efforts to reform 
farm subsidies. They fought successfully against the effort to eliminate 
[the Market Protection Program] outright, and they also fought reforms 
designed to decrease taxpayer subsidies to farmers, particularly large 
corporate farms. Once again, all of these self-serving efforts were 
subsidized unwittingly by the American taxpayer."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Griffin insists that "government funding of political activism is 
indefensible. Yet, hundreds of groups now receive government grants 
which are used, and used effectively, to subsidize their political 
activities." The question is, why do we put up with this outrage?

<h2>
CHINESE BANDITS
</h2>

<P><blockquote><i>  
The communists in China may have nothing but contempt for the 
democratic values of the West, but that doesn't stop them from lusting 
after the prosperity that only a free society can attain.
</blockquote></i>


<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The communists in China long to get their hands on the wealth of Hong 
Kong and Taiwan. They don't seem to understand how that wealth was 
created, or how quickly it would evaporate under communist control. Nor 
do they realize that China itself could be equally prosperous, if they 
would only allow their people the freedom to enjoy the fruits of their own 
labor.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The communists in China also covet the wealth of the United States. 
Since they're not willing to take the steps necessary to create such wealth 
in their own country, however, they've decided to steal ours. The Chinese 
government is actively pirating products and technology patented, 
copyrighted, and trademarked in America. The Chinese have stolen 
computer programs, pharmaceutical products, agricultural chemicals, 
musical recordings, videos, automotive designs, and other intellectual 
properties created by, and rightfully belonging to, American citizens and 
businesses.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These works of genius are a tribute to the remarkable potential of our 
free-enterprise system. They are the envy of the world, and a mainstay of 
our economy. They are, of course, available for sale to China. And China 
is certainly welcome to compete fairly with us by creating similar 
products on its own. That would involve hard work, however, and a 
liberalization of the Chinese economy that might prove dangerous for the 
slave masters in Beijing. So, instead, China simply copies American 
products illegally. Chinese factories churn out counterfeit CDs, videos, 
and computer programs by the thousands every day, selling their bootleg 
booty around the world.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These Chinese bandits are undermining the markets of American 
manufacturers to the tune of $1 billion per year. That's how much their 
piracy of U.S. intellectual property is estimated to cost our economy in 
lost exports. Lost exports mean lost jobs, in this case as many as 20,000. 
Unfortunately, American businessmen anxious to tap into the vast 
Chinese market are playing right into the hands of these conniving 
thieves. The experience of the McDonnell Douglas Corporation is just 
one example of how Chinese communists deceive American businessmen 
in order to steal U.S. technology and equipment. By pretending to be in 
the market for a fleet of passenger planes, the Chinese were able to 
negotiate rock-bottom prices on the items that they really wanted -- U.S. 
equipment that would enable them to augment their military capabilities. 
Once they had that equipment in hand, they canceled the order for planes.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Last year, U.S. negotiators persuaded the Chinese to sign yet another 
agreement promising to put an end to their piracy. Getting them to sign 
was easy. Getting them to honor the agreement is another thing. U.S. 
officials keep threatening to impose trade sanctions, but the Chinese don't 
take them seriously, and go right on stealing.

<TITLE>Why This Conservative Favors This NAFTA -- Heritage </TITLE>
<b>Heritage Lecture No. 473</b>
<p>
<h2>The Heritage Foundation Lectures and Seminars</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Why This Conservative Favors This NAFTA</h3>
<a href="http://www.house.gov/armey/welcome.html">Representative Dick Armey</a> Speaking on November 4, 1993
<p>
<br>
     I appreciate this opportunity to speak to you today about one of
the most important opportunities that America has faced in several
decades.  The North American Free Trade Agreement, which adds Mexico
to the current free trade area with Canada, will create the largest
free trade zone in the world, with a population of 370 million and a
gross domestic product of $7 trillion.
<P>
     Most of the arguments in favor of NAFTA have focused on the
short-term economic benefits to the U.S.:
<P>
     <UL>Mexico's tariffs on American goods average about ten percent
     while America's tariffs on Mexican products average only about
     three percent.  Consequently, when NAFTA eliminates these
     tariffs, America gains greater access to Mexico's market than
     Mexico gains to America's.

     Under NAFTA Mexico will allow American enterprises to provide
     banking, securities, insurance, and other services in its market.

     All serious scholarly studies of the effects of the agreement
     find net new jobs created in the U.S.  The only open question is,
     "How many?"</UL>
<P>
     With all of these benefits, it is curious that some conservatives
actually oppose NAFTA.  On a few points their concerns are valid, but
their conclusions about the actual effects of NAFTA are mistaken.  The
environmental and labor commissions established by the NAFTA side
agreements, for example, are unneeded.  But, they do not give more
power to radical American environmental groups, they do not endanger
American sovereignty, and they do not offset the benefits that will
result from freer trade.
<P>
     Today I want to give you ten reasons why all Americans who want a
prosperous, growing country, and conservatives in particular, who
favor less government control of the economy and more freedom for
individuals, should favor NAFTA.
<P>
REASON #1:  NAFTA originated as part of the vision of one of the most
outstanding conservatives in this country's history -- Ronald Reagan.
<P>
     In the late 1970s Ronald Reagan was setting forth his vision of
America, a vision that won him the White House and a vision which,
when translated into economic policy, led to this country's longest
period of economic expansion.  Part of that vision was a free trade
area in this hemisphere, stretching from the Yukon in the Arctic to
the Straits of Magellan in South America.
<P>
     The Reagan Administration negotiated the country's first free
trade area in 1985 with Israel.  Next followed the FTA with Canada. 
NAFTA is the next step in the Reagan vision of a free trade
hemisphere.
<P>
REASON #2:  Conservatives stand for the freedom of individuals, not
for the power of governments.  NAFTA restores sovereignty to
individuals.
<P>
     Too often we speak of free trade as, for example, between Mexico
and the U.S.  But what do we mean by Mexico and the U.S.?  Do we mean
the governments of these countries?  Do we mean the physical
territory?
<P>
     In point of fact, Mexico and the U.S.  do not trade anything. 
Individual Americans and individual Mexicans are the actual merchants
and customers.
<P>
     NAFTA removes the current restrictions of the Mexican and U.S. 
governments on the freedom of their citizens to trade with one
another.  NAFTA removes power from the hands of governments and
restores freedom to the sovereign individual.

     <P>Some critics have complained that somehow, by allowing the
economies of Mexico and the U.S.  to become more interdependent, NAFTA
robs America of its sovereignty.  But to these critics I say that it
is not your economy to begin with.  Conservatives reject the premise
that a country's wealth is collective or communal.  The American
economy belongs to millions of individual private property owners who
should be free to use and dispose of their property as they see fit. 
This freedom includes the right to buy from and sell to Mexicans.
<P>
REASON #3:  Conservatives respect the lessons of history.  One of
these lessons is that free trade leads to a prosperous world.  Another
is that protectionism leads to poverty.
<P>
     To paraphrase my friend Thomas Sowell, I don't have faith in free
trade, I have evidence.  Freer trade leads to greater prosperity.
<P>
     In the 19th century Britain became the dominant economic power. 
Why did Britain, a small island, rise to economic dominance?  In part
it was because Britain progressively opened its markets to imports. 
It realized that it makes little sense to waste manpower, raw
materials, land, and capital to produce goods and services that can be
purchased more cheaply elsewhere.  It is better to allow the
individuals who are most efficient in producing any given good or
service to do so and to allow them to trade with others for the things
they cannot produce as efficiently.
<P>
     Even countries that kept their markets more closed than Britain
to the outside world in fact prospered through trade liberalization. 
Germany, for example, was only united as a country under the
leadership of Prussia in 1871.  But that union was the culmination of
a process of eliminating trade barriers between the numerous small
German principalities.  The efficiency that resulted from the free
trade area between these German states helped what became unified
Germany to grow and prosper.
<P>
     The U.S.  kept trade barriers relatively high in the 19th century
as well.  But much of the American national enterprise in that century
was settling the vast territory of the West.  America was a huge,
European-size continental free trade area, stretching from the
Atlantic to the Pacific, the same distance as between Madrid and
Moscow.
<P>
     NAFTA will apply this lesson, that freer trade means greater
prosperity.
<P>
     History also shows us the follies of protectionism.  During the
1920s the U.S.  progressively raised its trade barriers to other
countries.  Of course, that meant that other countries could not earn
the dollars necessary to purchase U.S.  products.  So the U.S. 
government, through the newly created federal reserve system, expanded
credit and encouraged lending to other countries.
<P>
     When the stock market crashed in October 1929 because of these
policies, policy makers and the public assumed the country was in a
temporary recession.  By early 1930 the economy was beginning to
rebound.
<P>
     But in that year President Hoover changed a recession into a
depression by raising taxes twice.  First he raised taxes on personal
and business income.  And second, he raised taxes on purchases from
overseas, under the infamous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act.
<P>
     Britain followed suit at the 1930 Ottawa conference by
establishing the imperial preference system to favor trade within its
empire and discourage trade outside of it.  Similarly, France tried to
restrict within its empire.  Fascist Italy already was trying to keep
out foreign goods and investments.  And when Germany went fascist it
followed a similar policy.
<P>
     Unlike a trading bloc, NAFTA does not establish significant new
barriers to non-NAFTA members.  Rather, it opens markets and, it is
hoped, will lead to more free trade areas.
<P>
REASON #4:  Conservatives understand the need for institutional checks
on government abuses of freedom.  NAFTA provides such a check.
<P>
     To explain this point, I call your attention to one of the
principal reasons why Mexico wants NAFTA.  The Mexican government over
the past seven years has taken major steps to convert its socialist
economy into a free market economy.  It has joined the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and, as a result, already lowered many
of its trade barriers.  It has controlled the runaway inflation of its
currency.  It has sold off many government-owned enterprises.
<P>
     But the free market advocates in Mexico understand that these
reforms could be undone by a future government.  And the Leftist
opposition in Mexico that might control or influence such a government
is indeed anti-American and anti-free market.  Two Leftist critics of
the government of Mexican President Carlos Salinas, for example,
recently suggested that in place of NAFTA, Mexico levy a 100 percent
tariff on American imports while allowing Japanese and European
imports into the country duty-free.
<P>
     Thus, to make it difficult or impossible for a future government
to scrap the free market reforms, Mexican reformers understand the
need to integrate their country's economy with the economy of a
relatively prosperous, more free market country.  For Mexico, the
obvious candidate for economic partnership is the U.S.  If Mexico is
more integrated with America's economy, what would happen, for
example, if the government of Mexico decided to nationalize and run
enterprises that belong in the private sector? 
<P>
      Naturally such companies would run inefficiently.  But with a
free trade area, American firms would provide alternatives to the
high-cost, low-quality government goods or services.  The Mexican
government enterprises would lose millions of dollars and require
massive government bailouts even larger than those normally required
by such enterprises.  Mexico would have a very hard time affording
such an economically irrational policy in a NAFTA with the U.S.  and
Canada.
<P>
     But the same controlling effect on government can work on America
from closer economic ties with Mexico.  For example, many of America's
environmental laws have little or nothing to do with protecting the
public health and safety, and everything to do with empowering
bureaucrats.  With NAFTA, the U.S.  will have a strong incentive to
replace these senseless laws with a more efficient and just form of
environmental protection based on private property rights.  America
would have a strong incentive to clean up its own competitiveness act.
<P>
REASON #5:  Conservatives examine new arrangements closely and base
their decisions on facts.
<P>
     Conservatives know well not to trust the words and assurances of
governments when they propose new policies.  This does not means that
conservatives oppose all change, only change that limits freedom and
expands government power.
<P>
     Some conservatives fear that the labor commissions and especially
the environmental commissions set up by the NAFTA side agreements
might take away American sovereignty or give radical environmentalists
in America more power.  These concerns are legitimate and reflect the
kind of care and attention to the potential dangers of new government
bodies that is a hallmark of conservatives.  But I'm happy to report
that while the commissions are unnecessary, they do not pose a danger
to Americans.
<P>
     Let me review briefly what the commissions can and cannot do. 
The first function of the commissions is fact-finding.
<P>
  Each commission consists of representatives of the three NAFTA
governments and a Secretariat.  The secretariat of the environmental
commission is empowered to investigate cases called to its attention
of a country's failure to enforce its own laws.  The commissions
cannot search for cases on their own.
<P>
  Further, the commissions have no subpoena powers for collecting
evidence.
<P>
  What the commissions can do, in the end, after an arduous process
that weeds out nuisance complaints, is issue reports of their
findings.  These reports, like other reports by international bodies,
might be informative or they might be useless.  But they have no
effect whatsoever on the power of the American people to conduct
policy as they see fit.
<P>
     The second function of the commission is dispute resolution.
<P>
  If a NAFTA member government believes that another member is
engaging in a "persistent pattern of failure to effectively enforce"
its own environmental or labor laws where a tradeable good or service
is involved, it can request consultations and, on the agreement of the
other NAFTA member, have a dispute resolution panel convened.  But if
a country is found to be engaging in such a pattern, its sovereign
powers still cannot to overridden by the panel.
<P>
  If the guilty country does not agree to change its practices, the
panel can levy a fine of no more than $20 million.  If the country
refuses to pay the fine, the worst the panel can do is allow the
aggrieved country to restore certain limited tariffs to pre-NAFTA
levels to collect the fine.  This is similar to retaliation under
GATT.  It does not limit sovereignty.
<P>
     It is critical to note that nothing in NAFTA prohibits a country
from changing its own laws.  Often critics cite Article 1114 of the
accord which states that "it is inappropriate to encourage investment
by relaxing domestic health, safety or environmental standards."
<P>
But NAFTA contains no mechanism by which member governments can act
against an alleged violator.  The lip service paid by NAFTA to these
standards does not confer upon any international body legal authority
over U.S.  domestic affairs.  The U.N.  charter, for example, calls
for the peaceful solution of all international disputes.  Has this
produced world peace?  Has an American weapons manufacturer found
itself answering to an international tribunal for violating such
policies?
<P>
  The environmental agreement makes clear that, while NAFTA countries
are urged not to reduce environmental standards, they still retain the
right to make their own policies.  Beginning the side agreement is a
preamble "Reaffirming the sovereign right of States to exploit their
own resources pursuant to their own environmental and development
policies....  "
<P>
 Article 3 of the side agreement, while calling for high levels of
environmental protection, does so while "Recognizing the right of each
Party to establish its own levels of domestic environmental protection
and environmental development policies and priorities, and to adopt or
modify accordingly its environmental laws and regulations....  "
<P>
Free market advocates need not fear that American special   interest
groups will use the commissions to impose more    regulations on the
U.S.  economy.  According to Article 2021    of NAFTA, private parties
do not have a right of action in   U.S.  courts based on Commission
findings.
<P>
REASON #6:  Conservatives understand that free trade areas breed more
free trade areas, that NAFTA is a means to spread economic liberty
throughout the hemisphere and the world.
<P>
     The U.S.  often complains about trade barriers in other
countries.  American firms face restrictions when they try to sell
computers in Brazil or rice in Japan.  Of course, the U.S.  has many
trade barriers as well.
<P>
     The U.S.  government often uses the threat of trade retaliation
as a means to force other countries to remove trade barriers.  This
approach does not work very well.
<P>
     But consider the economic dynamics set up by a free trade area. 
Brazilian firms, for example, want to compete with American firms
selling products in Mexico.  But under NAFTA, American products enter
Mexico duty-free.  Brazilian products, however, are subject to an
average ten percent duty.
<P>
     How can Brazil make up for this disadvantage?  By raising trade
barriers on Mexican or American products?  No!  Such an approach would
not make their goods more competitive in Mexico.
<P>
     Brazil would have a strong incentive to follow the strategy "If
you can't beat 'em, join 'em."  Only by seeking membership in the free
trade area, could a country place itself again on an equal footing
with their competition.
<P>
     This phenomenon in fact is already occurring.  The Japanese, for
example, were concerned about the U.S.-Canada FTA and are now
concerned about NAFTA.  NAFTA gives the U.S.  more leverage to open
the markets of Japan and Europe.
<P>
REASON #7:  Conservatives understand that only through free exchange
can American living standards continue to rise.  NAFTA expands such
exchange. 
<P>
     Rising material living standards result from rising productivity. 
To be more productive, American businesses must produce more goods and
services with given amounts of labor, capital, land, and raw
materials.  The only way workers can trade their labor for more real
purchasing power is if their labor is more valuable, that is, if they
produce more goods and services.
<P>
     But to prosper we cannot simply produce more of the same old
things.  The history of economic development over the past two
centuries is one of creating new goods and services never before
dreamt of.  This development included introduction and/or mass
production of everything from trains, planes, and automobiles, to
skyscrapers and assembly lines, to penicillin, anesthetics, heart
transplants, to telephones, radios and televisions, microchips, and
personal computers.
<P>
     The world's leading industrial countries are those that pioneer
the new products.  How can we assure ourselves that America will
remain on the economic cutting edge?  How can we give American
entrepreneurs the strongest incentive to continue in our pioneer
economic spirit?  How can we make America competitive in the future? 
Simple.  Allow Americans to compete.
<P>
     By creating a huge free trade zone, NAFTA will allow for a more
efficient division of labor.  Mexicans and Americans respectively will
put more resources into the production of goods and services at which
they are most efficient.  The combination of greater competition and a
larger market will help guarantee that America will remain the world's
most productive economy.
<P>
REASON #8:  Conservatives are optimists who seek to expand economic
opportunity, and not cower behind trade barriers.
<P>
     The motivation of many opponents of NAFTA seems to be simply
fear.  While none can demonstrate exactly what the dangers of freer
trade are from NAFTA, they want us to take their emotions as a reason
to deny freedom of commerce to Americans.  It is embarrassing to hear
Americans fear that they just can't compete.
<P>
     But America is the one country in the world built on the attitude
of optimism and the expectation of opportunity.  This country was
settled by pioneers who risked everything to move to a new land, faced
physical dangers, left countries that offered no avenues of
advancement for a country that offered absolutely no guarantees but
one:  the guarantee that every American be free from repressive
government, that every American be free to rise to whatever level they
could through his own hard work and efforts, and to trade freely based
on mutual consent.
<P>
     The result was the most prosperous country in the world.
<P>
     Again, while some concerns about NAFTA are legitimate, some fears
manifestly are not.
<P>
NAFTA opponents should not fear free trade when America has the most
productive economy in the world.
<P>
NAFTA opponents should not fear free trade when America is the largest
exporter in the world.
<P>
NAFTA opponents should not fear free trade with a country whose
economy is only one twentieth the size of America's.
<P>
NAFTA opponents should not fear free trade when the history of
American enterprise, when unshackled from government taxes and
regulations, is one of meeting and winning every economic challenge.
<P>
REASON #9:  Conservatives understand that if this country abandons
free trade and free markets, it could indeed become a second-rate
power.
<P>
     It is instructive to consider the example of Argentina.  Earlier
in this century, Argentina was one of the top ten richest countries in
the world.  Its living standards were comparable to those in Europe. 
It is a country blessed with incredible natural resources, for
example, the pampas, which is one of the most fertile wheat and cattle
producing parts of the world, and its own oil reserves.  British
investors built what was then a state-of-the-art railroad.  It had
power plants, factories, and other facilities.
<P>
     But in the 1940s it followed the anti-free trade, anti-foreign
investment, pro-central planning approach of Juan Peron.  It closed
its markets.  And over the decades it joined the ranks of less
developed countries.  Today, Argentina is engaged in a great national
struggle to transform its economy and to rejoin the world market.
<P>
REASON #10:  Conservatives understand that with NAFTA, America can
enter the 21st century as the preeminent economic power in an
economically expanding hemisphere.
<P>
     I conclude my talk by observing that America truly has the
opportunity to enter the 21st century as the preeminent economic power
in an economically expanding hemisphere.  NAFTA is an agreement that
is good for America.  But it is an agreement that especially should be
favored by conservatives.  NAFTA reflects the optimism that is basic
to the American character and the search for opportunity that made
America great and will make it greater still in the future.
<P>
     If we abandon NAFTA, Republicans run the risk of ceding the
intellectual high ground of free trade and allowing Pat Buchanan and
Ross Perot to put a stamp of protectionism on the party.  But this
party stands for ideas, for individual freedom and for economic
opportunity.  When Reagan followed this formula, the result was seven
years of economic growth and prosperity.  We cannot abandon our
principles and a winning formula for the purposes of an apparent
political expediency that will politically damage our party and our
country in the future.<P>

["Industry executives claim there is no conclusive evidence  
demonstrating that video game violence affects young people." Recent  
research, however, show that claim is false.] 
 <P>
"In 1990, the National Coalition on Television Violence found that nine  
of 12 research studies on the impact of violent video games on children  
and adolescents reported harmful effects," says Jerry Melchisedeck of  
Focus on the Family. In a new report called Bringing Out the Worst in  
Us: The Frightening Truth About Violence, the Media, and Our Youth,  
Melchisedeck cites research identifying "a short-term relationship  
between playing violent games and increased aggressive behavior in  
younger children." Other research suggests that "the ill effects of video  
games are worse than those of TV because children actively control the  
violence rather than passively view it. In other words, the more children  
practice violent acts, the more likely they are to perform violent acts." 
 <P>
Jerry Melchisedeck says one researcher "reported that 40 out of 47 top  
video games he surveyed centered on violence, and 13 of those contained  
subthemes that emphasized the idea of women as victims." That same  
researcher "concluded that there are no gray areas in the behavior of  
game characters, and that players are rarely required to reflect or make  
contextual judgments." The manufacturers and distributors of violent  
video games resort to the usual dodge to justify their poisonous products.  
They insist they're only giving the customers what they want. "If  
consumer demand is the industry's guiding principle," says Melchisedeck,  
"then the future of video and computer gaming holds products that are  
progressively violent and realistically three-dimensional." 
 <P>
The demand for increasing levels of "realism," if you can call it that, has  
ominous implications. Video games now outsell Hollywood films, and  
that has movie moguls murmuring. Hollywood's getting in on the action,  
developing "interactive" movies that allow gamers gorged on two- 
dimensional gore to immerse themselves in cinematic savagery. 
 <P>
The ability to "download" video games is one of the major appeals of the  
so-called Information Superhighway. Thirty million people worldwide  
are now hooked up to the Internet, and video games aren't the only non- 
educational diversion available to them. Electronic mail is another. E- 
mail allows for the uncensored global transfer of words; sound; artistic,  
photographic, and videographic images; and computer software.  
Pornographers and pedophiles are already exploiting the perverse  
possibilities. 
 <P>
"Like the public library, the Internet provides access to volumes of up-to- 
date facts and data," says Jerry Melchisedeck. "Millions use it in the same  
manner as previous generations have referenced hardbound  
encyclopedias. For some, however, the Internet is a means of propagating  
their obscene, often violent, inclinations under the guise of First  
Amendment freedom. Access to this disturbing fare is as easy as a click  
of a button." Melchisedeck warns that "parents must not look to the  
government to protect their children. They must take an active role in  
monitoring the types of information" that the Internet delivers directly  
into their homes.

<h2> PROTECTING PROPERTY RIGHTS</h2>
<p>
<i>"The federal government increasingly passes the costs of its policies on 
to private property owners. To protect species under the Endangered 
Species Act, to preserve wetlands under the Clean Water Act, or to effect 
some other such goal, the government typically prohibits or constrains 
property owners from using their property as they wish. "</i>
<p>
"Although the United States was founded on the principle that 
government should not be allowed unfettered power to impose its will on 
law-abiding citizens or seize their property, federal agencies have found a 
loophole that allows them to usurp property through regulation," observes 
John Shanahan of the Heritage Foundation. "These regulatory takings can 
strip any American of the right to use his land as he wishes. In some 
cases, they even can almost wipe out the value of that land -- and, with it, 
the life savings of individual citizens."
<p>
The Private Property Protection Act of 1995, passed by the House last 
year, "would require compensation by the regulating federal agency 
whenever regulatory restriction of property rights under the Endangered 
Species Act and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act exceeds 20 percent 
of the value of the regulated parcel," observes Shanahan. The Omnibus 
Property Rights Act of 1995, now under consideration in the Senate, 
"would require compensation by federal regulating agencies whenever 
the taking of some 'portion' of property diminishes the value by 33 
percent."
<p>
Both bills seek to reinforce the U.S. Constitution's unambiguous 
endorsement of property rights. "The Fifth Amendment implicitly 
recognizes that the federal government may take property for public use," 
concedes Shanahan, but "explicitly mandates that government must pay 
the property owner for the land confiscated." It thereby "ensures that the 
cost is borne by those who benefit -- the public -- and not by the citizen 
unfortunate enough to own the land the government requires." Any 
federal regulation that deprives an American citizen of the full use of his 
property violates the spirit, if not the letter, of the Constitution. "Just 
compensation for regulatory takings preserves individual civil rights," 
argues Shanahan, noting that "property rights are essential to preventing 
the usurpation of other rights under the Constitution."
<p>
Imagine the consequences if there were no Fifth Amendment. "If 
government had a free hand to take property without payment, the 
incentive to confiscate property that conferred only a small public benefit 
would be overwhelming," says Shanahan. "In fact, that is exactly what 
has happened. The federal government now owns 30 percent of 
America's land, with even higher percentages in the West, and is using 
regulatory takings with increasing frequency to enhance its effective 
control over even more extensive tracts."
<p>
Compensation requirements are needed to discourage the federal 
government from confiscating property. The problem today, says John 
Shanahan, is that "federal enforcement officials have found that they can 
use regulations to gain control of property while circumventing the just 
compensation requirements of the Constitution. Federal property rights 
legislation thus is needed to provide a standard that will force federal 
regulators to consider the costs and benefits of taking private property."

INTRODUCTION
<P>
     Terrorism is a cancer that has plagued the Middle East for
decades. It is now metastasizing into new and more deadly forms that
pose grave challenges to the United States and the West. Middle
Eastern terrorists are striking outside their home region, boldly
attacking high-profile targets, and killing in a more indiscriminate
manner. Last year the U.S., which had never suffered a major terrorist
attack on its soil by Middle Eastern terrorists, was rocked by the
bombing of the World Trade Center in New York City, which killed six
Americans and wounded over 1,000. This was the highest casualty toll
ever recorded for a single terrorist incident. A subsequent bombing
campaign against targets in New York City was stopped in its tracks in
June 1993 by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
<P>
     The World Trade Center bombing embodies several ominous trends in
Middle Eastern terrorism. It epitomizes the drift toward large-scale,
indiscriminate violence. It also underscores the degree to which
radical Islamic extremists have supplanted radical nationalists, such
as the Palestine Liberation Organization, as the chief Middle Eastern
terrorist threat to the U.S. Moreover, radical Islamic groups are
inciting Sunni (orthodox) Muslims to support revolutionary terrorism
in Egypt and Algeria, just as radical Shia Muslims were incited by the
Iranian revolution. Finally, the Sudanese connection of several of the
bombers demonstrates how Sudan has become the "new Lebanon" -- a host
for a wide variety of terrorist groups and an important bridge between
Shia Iranian radicals and the new wave of Sunni Arab radicals.
<P>
     The United States cannot afford to ignore the wake-up calls
presented by the World Trade Center bombing and the foiled Iraqi-
sponsored assassination attempt against former President George Bush
during his April 1993 visit to Kuwait. The taboo against international
terrorist attacks inside the country and against important national
symbols has been broken. Washington must lead a concerted
international effort to make such terrorist attacks more difficult,
more costly to the perpetrators, and more risky for the states that
back them.

<P>
     The Worldwide Spread of Middle Eastern terrorism. The U.S. is by
no means the only country to feel the wrath of Middle Eastern
terrorists in recent months. In July, 117 people were killed in a
series of four bombings in nine days that swept Argentina, Panama, and
Britain. Most, if not all, of this carnage is believed to be the
handiwork of the world's most deadly terrorist organization --
Hezbollah (Party of God), an Iranian-sponsored and Syrian-backed
terrorist group based in Lebanon that perpetrated the October 1983
bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut. In August, radical
Islamic terrorists seeking to overthrow the Algerian government killed
two Chinese and five French citizens in Algeria, as part of a
terrorist campaign against foreigners that has claimed 60 lives since
September 1993.
<P>
     Yet, the U.S. and its citizens have been the world's foremost
targets of international terrorism in recent years. The FBI estimates
that 32 percent of terrorist attacks worldwide from 1982 to 1992 were
targeted against Americans or American property. (FBI Terrorist
Research and Analytical Center, "Terrorism in the United States:
1982-1992" (Washington D.C., 1993), p. 11.) Middle Eastern terrorism
remains the greatest terrorist threat to the United States. Although
some 20 percent of all international terrorist incidents from 1982 to
1992 have been traced to Middle Eastern quarrels, these incidents have
accounted for about 35 percent of terrorist-related fatalities.
(Testimony of terrorism expert Brian Jenkins before the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, Subcommittee on International Security,
International Organizations and Human Rights, March 12,1993.) Middle
Eastern terrorist incidents repeatedly have drawn the U.S. into
international crises. State-sponsored terrorist attacks against
Americans have triggered U.S. military retaliation against Iran, Iraq,
and Libya. 
<P>
     Iran has been the foremost state sponsor of terrorism since the
1979 Iranian revolution. But terrorist attacks against Western targets
dropped off after the 1989 election of President Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani, who was more interested in rebuilding Iran with Western
help than in exporting revolution. Now that Rafsanjani is steadily
losing ground to more radical leaders in a bitter internal power
struggle, there could be an escalation of Iranian-sponsored terrorism.
Indeed, this may already have started to happen with Hezbollah's July
bombing campaign.
<P>
     Despite the growing danger, the Clinton Administration has failed
to mount a credible effort to stem the tide of terrorism. Although it
pays lip service to counterterrorism, the Administration unwisely
remains wedded to a State Department reorganization plan that would
downgrade the Office of Counterterrorism and signal friends and foes
that fighting terrorism is not a high priority. To more fully protect
American citizens from the scourge of Middle Eastern terrorism, the
Clinton Administration should:
<P>
Make counterterrorism a top priority in American foreign policy. 
  <P>   The Administration should shelve its plan to downgrade the status
of the State Department's Office of Counterterrorism and make
terrorism a top permanent agenda item at the annual G-7 summits.
<P>
Tackle international terrorism as a form of low-intensity warfare.
<P>     Treating it as a purely criminal matter does not effectively
address the issue of state-supported terrorism.
<P>
Punish state sponsors of terrorism on as many fronts as possible.
 <P>   Raise the diplomatic, economic, political, and military costs of
state terrorism to the point where they exceed the expected benefits.
<P>
Mobilize reluctant allies to maximize pressure on terrorist states and
groups. 
 <P>    Washington increasingly should apply public pressure on allied
governments, particularly in Europe, that appease terrorist states.
<P>
Maintain the option to retaliate unilaterally for terrorist attacks
with decisive military force. 
 <P>    The use or threat of force is an essential deterrent to state-
supported terrorism.
<P>
Stand firmly behind states threatened by Middle Eastern terrorism.
 <P>    Algeria, Egypt, Israel, and Turkey require firm U.S. support and
close cooperation against international terrorism.
<P>
Upgrade counterterrorism intelligence. 
 <P>    The FBI, CIA, and other intelligence agencies need to expand
their sources of human intelligence on international terrorism and
consult closely with allies and other concerned states.
<P>
Reform immigration laws to improve internal security.
<P>     Deportation proceedings should be streamlined, political asylum
requests should be screened more quickly and decisively and visas
should be denied to members of groups that use, support, or advocate
terrorism. Federal criminal penalties for visa and passport forgeries
should be toughened.
<P>
Work to restore order in anarchic areas where international terrorist
groups thrive. 
  <P>   The U.S. should back efforts by the governments of Lebanon and
Afghanistan to roll back the influence of Islamic radicals and
dismantle terrorist training camps.
<P>
THE UPSURGE IN RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM OUTSIDE THE MIDDLE EAST
<P>
     Middle Easterners are the prime suspects in a series of four
terrorist attacks against far-flung Western targets in July. On July
18 a car bomb destroyed a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires,
killing 96 people and wounding more than 200. The next day a bomb
destroyed a commuter plane in Panama, killing 21, most of them Jewish
businessmen. A car bomb exploded outside the Israeli Embassy in
Lebanon on July 27, wounding 13 people. The next day another car bomb
demolished the London offices of a Jewish charity organization.
<P>
     A previously unknown group calling itself Ansarallah (Partisans
of God) claimed responsibility for the Buenos Aires and Panama
bombings. American intelligence specialists believe that the group is
a subsidiary of Hezbollah, the Lebanon-based radical Shiite terrorist
organization. Sheik Sobhi Toufeili, the leader of Hezbollah's most
militant faction, is suspected of being the leader of the group.
(Louise Lief, "Partisans of Terror," U.S. News and World Report,
August 8, 1994, p. 36.) There has been speculation that the attacks
were meant to derail the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations, because the
bombings straddled Jordanian King Hussein's July trip to Washington to
sign a non-belligerency accord with Israel. A more likely explanation,
however, is that this spate of terrorism was a spillover of the
intensifying fighting between Israel and Hezbollah in southern
Lebanon. 
<P>
     Hezbollah undoubtedly was smarting over Israel's capture of one
of its leaders, Mustafa Dirani, in Lebanon on May 21. The radical
Islamic terrorists also may have been angry over Israel's June 2 air
strike that killed some 45 of its cadres in Lebanon. Israeli and
American intelligence officials are said to have little doubt that
Iran also was behind the July 18 Buenos Aires bombing. (Testimony of
Steven Emerson, before the House Foreign Affairs Committee,
Subcommittee on International Security, International Organizations
and Human Rights, August 1, 1994.) Up to 20 Iranian Revolutionary
Guards, who train and equip Hezbollah forces, apparently were killed
in the June 2 air strike. (Michael Parks, "Bombings Underscore World's
Vulnerability," The Los Angeles Times, August 1, 1994, p. A3.) Iran
was implicated in a similar terrorist operation in Argentina that took
the lives of 29 people in March 1992. Hezbollah claimed responsibility
for that bombing, which destroyed the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires,
possibly retaliating for an earlier Israeli attack that killed its
military chief. Electronic intelligence intercepts and an extensive
forensic investigation revealed that Iranian officials had helped
acquire the plastic explosives used in that 1992 bombing. (Steven
Emerson, "Diplomacy That Can Stop Terrorism," The Wall Street Journal,
July 22, 1994, p. A10.) Iran also has been implicated in the July 18
Buenos Aires bombing by an Iranian defector questioned by Argentine
criminal investigators. (Gabriel Escobar, "Iranian Diplomats Said to
Be Suspects in Blast at Argentine Jewish Center," The Washington Post,
July 29, 1994, p. A27.) 
<P>
     The string of bombings in July greatly concerns U.S.
counterterrorism officials. They are worried about the ability of
Hezbollah terrorists to mount a sustained, coordinated, and well-
organized terrorist campaign against targets all over the globe. (The
car bomb used against the Israeli Embassy in London was delivered by a
woman, a fact that has led some experts to doubt involvement of
Hezbollah in that particular attack, because the organization
previously has condemned the use of women in terrorist actions.
Nevertheless, the possibility that a secular terrorist group carried
out that attack does not necessarily let Iran off the hook, because
Tehran has used secular groups such as the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine - General Command.) The attacks apparently
were planned well in advance and utilized local support networks for
reconnaissance and preparation. (Michael Parks, "Bombings Underscore
World's Vulnerability," The Los Angeles Times, August 1, 1994, p. A3.)
The July 19 mid-air bombing of a Panamanian commuter plane is
especially troubling because it may be the first suicide terrorist
attack on an airliner. (British counterterrorism officials secretly
have warned British airlines to be on guard for suicide bombers. Jamie
Dettner, "Airlines Warned of Suicide Bombers," The Washington Times,
August 8, 1994, p. A15.) 
  <P>   

 THE CONTINUING MYSTERY OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTER BOMBING
<P>
     The February 26, 1993, bombing of the World Trade Center was a
curious terrorist operation. On the one hand it was well-planned and
professional; the terrorists were able secretly to construct and
deploy a massive truck bomb. On the other hand, it was a surprisingly
amateurish operation. The four terrorists convicted of the attack took
unnecessary risks, such as giving a correct name and address when
renting a vehicle for delivering the bomb.
<P>
     So far, no foreign state has been found responsible for the World
Trade Center attack. But there are disturbing shreds of circumstantial
evidence that point to possible Iranian or Iraqi involvement. Sheik
Omar Abdul Rahman, the radical Egyptian cleric who inspired and
possibly directed the bombers, long has been on the Iranian payroll,
according to Vincent Cannistraro, the former head of CIA
counterterrorism operations. (Bill Gertz, "Iran Backs Terrorist
Networks in U.S., Canada," The Washington Times, March 17, 1993, p.
A7.) Sheik Omar regularly was given large sums of money by Iran's
intelligence service, using Iran's delegation to the United Nations as
a conduit. ("Washington Whispers," U.S. News and World Report, May 31,
1993, p. 23.) U.S. government investigators discovered that about
$100,000 was transferred to the suspects before the bombing from banks
in foreign countries, including Iran, but it is not known if this was
payment for the attack or for other activities such as propaganda or
recruitment. (Ralph Blumenthal, "$100,000 Is Linked to Trade Center
Suspects," The New York Times, April 25, 1993, p. 41.)
<P>
     Other signs point toward Iraq. For instance, the attack took
place during the second anniversary of the ground offensive against
Iraq in Operation Desert Storm. Terrorist attacks launched on
anniversaries historically have been a common means of seeking
vengeance in the Middle East. Another troubling circumstance is that
Ramzi Yousef, who apparently set the plot in motion, entered the U.S.
in 1992 on an Iraqi passport on a trip that began in Iraq. Moreover,
Abdul Yasin, an Iraqi suspect who cooperated with the FBI and was
released from jail, later flew back to Iraq and is now believed to be
living in Baghdad. Many New York law enforcement officials reportedly
believe that Iraq was involved, although they can not prove it.
(Laurie Mylroie, "World Trade Center Bombing -- The Case of Secret
Cyanide," The Wall Street Journal, July 26, 1994, p. A16.)
<P>
     Iraq also would seem to have more to gain from such a terrorist
operation than Iran. Saddam would have had a strong incentive to
punish the U.S. for its role in Desert Storm. Iraq also may have
wanted to provoke a confrontation between the U.S. and its arch-rival
Iran by casting suspicion on Tehran for the bombing. This would
strengthen Iraq's perceived value in the Middle East as a bulwark
against revolutionary Iran, an argument Iraqi diplomats have made in
attempts to persuade members of the United Nations Security Council to
lift the U.N.-mandated sanctions against Iraq. (Iraq also had
sponsored a similarly deceptive terrorist operation in June 1982, when
it ordered the Abu Nidal Organization, a renegade Palestinian
terrorist group, to shoot the Israeli Ambassador to Britain, an act
which provoked Israel to punish the Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO) by invading Lebanon to destroy its base camps. The payoff for
Iraq was that the Israelis dealt Iraq's rival Syria a sharp military
setback in the course of the Lebanon War, and precluded Syria from
joining its ally Iran in its 1980-1988 war with Iraq.)
<P>
     A final disquieting consideration was the nature of the World
Trade Center bomb itself. Not only was the bomb huge, loaded with
1,200 pounds of explosives, but it was customized with compressed
hydrogen to magnify the blast and sodium cyanide to create a poisonous
cloud after the explosion. (The sodium cyanide apparently burned up
completely instead of turning into a gas. See Mylroie, op. cit., p.
A16.) A bomb that big and sophisticated has never before been
detonated by a terrorist group that did not have state sponsorship or
long-standing experience in building explosive devices.
<P>
THE NEW BREED OF RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS
<P>
     The World Trade Center bombers are a new breed of terrorist.
Unlike the tightly disciplined cells that dominated terrorism in the
past, they functioned in a loosely organized ad hoc manner. Three of
the six charged with the bombing were dedicated followers of Sheik
Omar Abdul Rahman, the fiery spiritual leader of the Islamic Group, a
radical fundamentalist movement that has waged a terrorist campaign to
overthrow the Egyptian government.
<P>
     At least three of the six bombers had fought in the war in
Afghanistan against Soviet and Afghan communists. The Sheik also made
at least three visits there since 1980 and two of his sons reportedly
fought there. Thousands of Muslims from roughly 40 countries flocked
to Afghanistan following the 1979 Soviet invasion. (Pakistani
officials estimated that at least 2800 foreign Muslims remained in
Afghanistan in 1993. Edward Gargan, "Where Arab Militants Train and
Wait," The New York Times, August 11, 1993, p. A8.) Radicalized
veterans from the Afghan war -- called by some journalists the
"University of Jihad"(Holy War) -- have returned home and have become
the spearheads of radical Islamic movements in Algeria, Azerbaijan,
Bosnia, Egypt, Sudan, and many other places around the world. (Tim
Weiner, "Blowback From the Afghan Battlefield," The New York Times
Magazine, March 13, 1994, p. 53.) Hundreds of these "Afghanis" are
being trained by Iranian Revolutionary Guards in Sudanese training
camps.
<P>
     Radical Islamic movements have mushroomed not only in the Muslim
world, but also among Muslim immigrants in the West. The World Trade
Center bombers were all either recent immigrants or illegal aliens.
Although they may have been drawn to America by economic opportunities
and political freedoms, these terrorists rejected America's values and
what they considered to be its degenerate culture of materialism and
secularism. Rejecting assimilation into the resented society of their
host country, they were susceptible to incitement by Sheik Omar. What
they did mirrors what happened in several other terrorism cases, such
as Hezbollah's 1985-1986 bombing campaign in France and its bombings
in Buenos Aires in 1992 and 1994. In all three cases, small portions
of local immigrant communities provided support for the terrorist
operations. 
<P>
     Ironically, many radical Islamic movements outlawed in their own
countries have found sanctuary in Western countries. So long as they
are in the West, they cannot be arrested by the police back home. Like
Sheik Omar, leaders of these radical movements lambaste their host
countries while taking advantage of their open political systems to
travel freely, organize politically, raise funds, recruit new members,
support underground opposition movements in their home countries, and
sometimes to direct terrorist activities. Germany long has been a base
for Islamic extremists. (German intelligence officials estimate that
about 700 Arab extremists live there, along with over 42,000 other
foreign extremists. Jim McGee, "U.S. Pledges Global Pursuit in
Bombing," The Washington Post, March 13, 1993.) The U.S. has become a
safe haven for Hezbollah, the Islamic Group, Algerian fundamentalists,
and Palestinian fundamentalists. Israeli officials claim that Hamas
(Islamic Resistance Movement), the radical Palestinian Islamic group
that is using terrorism to undermine the nascent Palestinian-Israeli
peace, actually is directed from a headquarters in the United States.
(Ehud Yaari, "A Safe Haven for Hamas in America," The New York Times,
January 27, 1993.) 
<P>
     The support networks that these terrorist groups are forming
inside the U.S. for fundraising, recruitment, and propaganda
activities could become the nucleus for terrorist attacks on American
soil. These potential terrorists are dangerous because, unlike hit
teams dispatched from the Middle East, they are now blending into
Western societies where they have established personal and communal
roots. U.S. counterterrorism officials worry that "sleeper cells"
already established inside the U.S. could lie dormant for many years
until activated for specific terrorist actions. (The FBI discovered a
sleeper cell of the Abu Nidal organization inside the U.S. in 1986 and
arrested four Palestinian members in April 1993 after one member of
the group murdered his daughter. See William Carley, "A Trail of
Terror," The Wall Street Journal, June 16, 1993, p. A1.)
<P>
     Moreover, the decentralized structure of many of the radical
Islamic movements makes it difficult for host governments to detect,
defend against, or apprehend terrorists lurking within these
movements. The loosely linked informal webs of Islamic militants,
often organized in small groups around a charismatic cleric, are
harder to track and infiltrate than the more rigidly organized
Palestinian terrorist groups that have been a major threat for
decades. The Palestinian groups had a more straightforward
organization and often were corrupt and therefore susceptible to
bribery. They also were easier to penetrate because infighting between
rival organizations led them to provide information on each other.
<P>
     The new breed of radical Islamic terrorist is more intractable,
less likely to betray other terrorists, and more unpredictable. In
contrast to long-established Palestinian terrorist groups who had more
predictable targets and objectives, Islamic radicals have more unclear
motives and a wider variety of targets. They not only attack Israel,
secular governments in Muslim countries, and states that support the
secular regimes they oppose, they also target reporters with whom they
disagree, intellectuals they despise (such as Salman Rushdie, the
author of The Satanic Verses), and Western cultural institutions such
as the American University in Beirut. 
<P>
     Most Palestinian terrorist groups refrained from assaulting
Americans or launching attacks on American soil. The reason: they
wanted to influence American public opinion to change U.S. foreign
policy and to drive a wedge between Israel and America. They made the
cold-blooded political calculation that killing Americans would hurt,
rather than help their political cause. 
<P>
     This self-imposed restraint often is not as strong among Islamic
militants. This new breed of terrorist is hostile not only to American
policies, but to many American values. For example, they reject
secular law and democracy and the separation of church and state. They
view American culture as a threat to Islamic piety and revile what
they perceive to be the degenerate secular and materialist bias of
American society. To Islamic radicals, the U.S. is the villainous
successor of the European colonial empires that have sought to
dominate the Middle East since the time of the crusades. In their holy
war against the West, terrorism is an acceptable instrument for
carrying out the will of God. Because they are motivated by
apocalyptic zeal, and not sober political calculations, their choice
of possible targets is much wider and more indiscriminate than that of
other terrorists. Since they are less predictable, they can be more
dangerous than Palestinian or other Middle Eastern terrorists.
<P>
     Islamic radicals also often have a different audience in mind
than Palestinian nationalists. Instead of using terrorism to influence
Western powers to change their policies, they often use terrorism to
punish Western powers and inspire other Muslims to rise up against the
West. This focus on the Muslim audience rather than an American
audience helps explain how the bombers of the World Trade Center could
rationalize their bloody actions. The bombing was meant to demonstrate
the power of Islamic radicals and the vulnerability of the U.S., not
to lead the U.S. to rethink its Middle East policy.
<P>
THE PERSISTENT THREAT OF STATE-SPONSORED TERRORISM
<P>
     The Middle East is a hotbed of state-sponsored terrorism. Five of
the seven states that have been branded by the U.S. government as
sponsors of international terrorism-- Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, and
Syria--are located in the region. (Cuba and North Korea are the other
two on the State Department's list of states that sponsor terrorism.)
Moreover, 22 of the 41 major international terrorist groups described
in the State Department's annual report on global terrorism are based
in the Middle East. (See U.S. Department of State, Patterns of Global
Terrorism: 1993, April 1994, Appendix B.) The region not only is
infested with more terrorist groups than any other region, but these
groups subscribe to a wider variety of ideologies and causes, ranging
from Marxism to secular Arab, Armenian, Kurdish, and Palestinian
nationalism to radical Islamic fundamentalism. Each year the Middle
East is the world's foremost exporter of terrorism, with most of the
spillover afflicting Western Europe. (Between 1980 and 1989 over 400
terrorist actions spilled over from the Middle East to other regions,
with 87 percent of these actions occurring in Western Europe. Paul
Wilkinson, "Terrorism, Iran and the Gulf Region," Jane's Intelligence
Review, May 1992, p. 222.)
<P>
     Because of the heavy concentration of terrorist states and
terrorist groups, most new trends in terrorism develop in the Middle
East, then spread quickly to other regions. Radical Palestinian groups
such as the Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine
(PFLP) pioneered the tactic of airline hijackings after the 1967 Arab-
Israeli war. When improved airport security measures made hijacking
more difficult, Palestinian groups such as the 15 May organization
were in the forefront of the trend of airline bombings. 
<P>
     Most terrorist groups prior to 1970 were autonomous organizations
of indigenous dissidents that pursued their own agendas without
outside support. (Neil Livingston and Terrell Arnold, eds., Fighting
Back: Winning the War Against Terrorism (Lexington, Mass: D.C. Heath,
1986) p. 12.) During the 1970s the Soviet Union and its satellites
greatly expanded their support for terrorist groups. Moscow often used
Middle Eastern client states such as Iraq, Libya, Syria, and the
former People's Democratic Republic of South Yemen as intermediaries
to mask Soviet arms, training, intelligence, and logistical support
for a wide variety of terrorist groups. 
<P>
     The radical Arab states, which regularly used terrorism as a tool
of repression against internal opposition, sought their own terrorist
surrogates to wield as weapons against Israel, Western powers, and
other Middle Eastern states. Libya, Syria, and Iraq courted
Palestinian splinter groups or created their own Palestinian puppet
organizations to buttress their claims to Arab leadership. These
puppets also were used as proxy terrorists who, if caught, would not
bring down retaliation on the head of the state sponsor.
<P>
     The 1979 Iranian revolution brought Iran into the forefront of
international terrorism. Iran organized, trained, equipped, and
financed Shiite revolutionary movements such as Hezbollah in Lebanon
and Ad Dawa (The Call) in Iraq and the Gulf States. Under Iranian
supervision, Hezbollah unleashed a lethal terrorist campaign in 1983
to drive the Western peacekeeping forces out of Lebanon, bombing the
U.S. Embassy in Beirut in April and the Marine barracks in October.
After Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani was elected President in 1989,
Iranian support for international terrorism was toned down and the
Western hostages held by Hezbollah in Lebanon gradually were released
by the end of 1991. But assassinations of Iranian exile leaders
continued at an alarming pace. Government-sponsored terrorism also was
supplemented by terrorism financed by Iranian so-called charitable
foundations, many of which are controlled by radical clerics opposed
to many of Rafsanjani's policies. One of these, the Fifteenth of
Khordad Foundation, has put a $2 million bounty on the head of Salman
Rushdie, condemned to death as a blasphemer by Ayatollah Khomeini in
1989. (Rushdie's publishers, translators, and bookstores that sell his
books have been targeted for terrorist attacks. In the last five years
113 people have died in violence related to the Rushdie affair in more
than 20 countries. See Bizhan Torabi, "The West, Iran Deadlocked Over
Rushdie," The Washington Times, February 16, 1994, p. A13.) 
<P>
     President Rafsanjani's power steadily has been eroded by radical
rivals who have gained dominance over the Iranian parliament. He is a
lame duck, prohibited by the Iranian constitution from running for re-
election for a third term in 1996. As the struggle to succeed him
intensifies, there is a good chance that Iran's support for terrorism
will escalate. The West and the U.S. make convenient targets for hard-
liners in their fight to seize power. In fact, Iran already has become
more aggressive in supporting terrorism. In addition to suspected
Iranian involvement in the July bombings in Buenos Aires and London,
three Iranians await trial in Thailand for an attempt to bomb the
Israeli Embassy in Bangkok in March. In April, the British government
charged that it had clear evidence of growing contacts between Irish
Republican Army terrorists and Iranian embassies in Europe. (In
addition to providing money and possibly arms to the I.R.A., London
charged that Iran also was building links to the Syria-based Japanese
Red Army. Stewart Dalby, "Iran Accused of Terrorist Links," Financial
Times, April 29, 1994, p. 1.) In May, more than 300 Iranian
Revolutionary Guards arrived in Bosnia to organize Muslim militias and
terrorist groups, according to U.S. intelligence sources. (Bill Gertz,
"Iranians Move into Bosnia to Terrorize Serbs," The Washington Times,
June 2, 1994, p. A1.)
<P>
TOWARD A MORE EFFECTIVE U.S. COUNTERTERRORISM POLICY
<P>
     The U.S. has an historic opportunity to crack down on Middle East
terrorism. The end of the Cold War and collapse of the Soviet Empire
have deprived Middle Eastern terrorist states of superpower backing.
The embryonic peace agreement between Israel and the PLO has reduced
one source of terrorism, although Palestinian rejectionists both
within and outside the PLO continue their terrorist war against
Israel. Iraq's defeat in the Gulf War and subsequent isolation has
constrained state support from that quarter, particularly as long as
Baghdad moderates its policies in an effort to wriggle out of U.N.-
sponsored economic sanctions. Iran and Libya are isolated and beset by
substantial economic problems caused in part by low oil prices.
Sudan's radical Islamic regime is drained by a long-running civil war
and a grim economic situation. Syria faces a precarious future as
President Hafez al-Assad, not in the best of health, plots his
personal political endgame. 
<P>
     All of these Middle Eastern regimes, which have exported so much
terrorism-related misery, are simultaneously vulnerable on a number of
different fronts. In the past they have been able to shrug off Western
demands to halt their support of terrorism. But now that they have
lost Soviet backing and have become increasingly dependent on the West
for economic support, that is no longer true. The West now has more
influence and leverage over these states. Moreover, many of these
regimes are threatened by internal political opposition, or the
prospect of such opposition in the near future. The U.S. and other
Western powers, therefore, gain potential leverage by supporting or
threatening to support opposition groups hostile to terrorist regimes.
<P>
     While the threat or actual use of force is the ultimate deterrent
to terrorism, experienced terrorist states and groups often are
successful in concealing their responsibility for terrorist outrages
to avoid military reprisals. To deter terrorism, Washington must
convince its allies and other concerned states to increase the
diplomatic, economic, military,and political costs of state-supported
terrorism. A unified Western campaign to curtail Middle Eastern
terrorism now has a greater chance for success than ever before. Only
the U.S. can forge and lead such a coalition. To build an
international consensus to combat terrorism and to follow through and
act on that consensus, the Clinton Administration should:
<P>
Make counterterrorism a top priority in American foreign policy. 
<P>
     The Clinton Administration must drop its short-sighted plan for
downgrading the State Department's Office of Counterterrorism. This
reorganization plan would fold that office into a new Bureau for
Narcotics, Terrorism and Crime and demote the Coordinator for
Counterterrorism from the current equivalent of an Assistant Secretary
of State to the level of a Deputy Assistant Secretary. L. Paul Bremer,
a former Ambassador-at-Large for Counterterrorism, noting that the
office would be "gutted," charged that: "The Clinton Administration
has neglected the terrorist threat, with our public officials paying
only lip service to the problem." (L. Paul Bremer, "With Assad, Talk
About Terrorism," The Wall Street Journal, January 14, 1994, p. A10.)
   <P>
	Congress has temporarily blocked the Administration's plans.
Under the leadership of Representative Benjamin Gilman (R-NY), the
House voted on April 18, 1994, to retain an independent Office of
Counterterrorism. But the Administration has not given up on its
reorganization plan, which originated in the Bush Administration as a
cost-cutting measure. 
<P>
     Congress will again have to wrestle with the reorganization plan
after April 30, 1995, when the Gilman amendment expires. At that time,
Congress should consider insisting that the Administration permanently
shelve its plans to downgrade State's counterterrorism office. This
office instead must be given the bureaucratic clout to champion tough
anti-terrorism policies against other bureaus in the State Department,
or in other departments, that have little or no interest in combating
terrorism. Therefore, the Coordinator for Counterterrorism, who is the
U.S. government's senior full-time counterterrorism official, must
have direct access to the Secretary of State, and not be relegated, as
the Administration plans, to the bottom of a cumbersome reporting
chain. To secure the diplomatic clout that is needed to impress U.S.
allies and terrorist nations, the Coordinator should be restored to
the status of ambassador-at-large, as was the case during the Reagan
Administration. 
<P>
     Washington should aggressively raise the profile of the
counterterrorism issue by injecting it into every multilateral
diplomatic forum and every high-level bilateral meeting with officials
from allied governments or terrorist regimes. The U.S. should ensure
that the issue of terrorism appears automatically on the agenda at
every G-7 summit. The Coordinator for Counterterrorism should become a
permanent fixture at the summits as the prime mover in a multilateral
working group on counterterrorism.
<P>
Tackle international terrorism as a form of low-intensity warfare. 
<P>
     Terrorism is the most ubiquitous kind of low-intensity conflict.
Yet, it is too often treated primarily as a law enforcement issue.
While bringing the rule of law to bear on terrorists is desirable, it
is not always possible, particularly when terrorists are being
protected by a state sponsor. In cases of state-supported terrorism,
which the CIA estimates comprise up to 80 percent of all international
terrorism, it is not realistic to rely solely on law enforcement
agencies to fight terrorists. 
<P>
     State-supported terrorism is in effect an act of war and should
be approached as a form of surrogate warfare. The U.S. should not
unnecessarily hobble itself in this war against terrorism by treating
state-sponsored foreign terrorists the same as it treats domestic
terrorist groups. Counterterrorist forces should not require courtroom
standards of evidence before they take action. Adopting a narrow
legalistic approach to fighting terrorism would lead to American
paralysis and terrorism would proliferate unchecked. 
<P>
     The U.S. should make use of the full arsenal of its weapons
against terrorism by relaxing self-imposed restrictions on special
operations. For example, Executive Order No. 11905, signed in 1976,
was designed to prohibit assassinations of foreign leaders, but it
also has been interpreted as prohibiting commando assaults on
terrorist groups. This executive order should be refined to permit
such special operations, particularly against terrorist groups that
have killed Americans in the past, such as Hezbollah or the Abu Nidal
organization. Counterterrorist teams also should be deployed to
apprehend terrorists in anarchic areas such as Lebanon or Afghanistan,
and not just in international waters or airspace.
<P>
     The U.S. should also make greater use of non-violent covert
actions, such as the dissemination of disinformation to create
dissension inside terrorist groups and psychological warfare to
aggravate the terrorists' sense of vulnerability and to encourage
distrust of their state sponsors. Agents of influence, wherever they
can be inserted, would help to disrupt terrorist operations and turn
terrorists against each other. Sabotage operations also should be
launched against the safehouses, logistics support networks, and
financial assets of terrorist groups. 
<P>
Punish state sponsors of terrorism on as many fronts as possible. 
<P>
     Middle Eastern states have relied heavily on state-sponsored
terrorism because it is a cost-effective tool to their foreign
policies. The U.S. should work with its allies and other concerned
states to raise the diplomatic, economic, political, and military
costs of supporting terrorism so high that it outweighs the strategic
benefits.
<P>
Diplomatic sanctions. 
<P>
     Countries victimized by terrorism in the past have broken
relations or reduced the size of the diplomatic mission of the state
sponsor. This helps limit the threat of terrorism, because much of it
is directed, supported, and financed by intelligence personnel
operating under diplomatic cover. But diplomatic sanctions usually
have been unilateral, ad hoc responses that have had little effect on
terrorist states. Washington should propose an agreement among the G-7
and NATO allies that would require all of them to expel large numbers
of diplomats, if not break diplomatic relations completely, with
states that support terrorist attacks. Moreover, diplomatic personnel
of these states should be expelled for each confirmed terrorist attack
by a surrogate terrorist group. 
<P>
     This measure would raise the public uproar over terrorism and
increase the costs of each attack. This may give pause to some
terrorist states, particularly those such as Iran and Sudan, that want
the West to bail them out of dire economic predicaments. At a minimum,
reducing the diplomatic presence of terrorist states will make it
harder for them to support terrorism out of their embassies. For
example, the expulsion of diplomats greatly undermined Iraq's ability
to export terrorism during the 1991 Gulf War. 
<P>
     Regardless of whether it can gain G-7 support for such an
agreement, the U.S. should pressure its allies to pare down the
diplomatic presence of Iranian and Sudanese diplomats in their
countries. Diplomats from Iran and Sudan have been implicated in the
July bombing in Buenos Aires and in the 1993 bomb plots in New York
City. The Iranian diplomatic presence particularly should be cut back
in Germany and Venezuela, which are centers for Iran's intelligence
and terrorist networks.
<P>
     Economic sanctions. Washington should persuade its allies to
participate in developing a multilateral version of the State
Department's list of states that support terrorism. Once placed on the
list, a terrorist state should be denied economic assistance, arms
sales, and preferential trade privileges from all participating
states. Further, the allies would be committed to voting against
financial aid for that state in international financial institutions
such as the World Bank. If Western Europe and Japan presented a united
front in threatening to impose sanctions, it could have a sobering
effect on the five Middle Eastern terrorist states. All, with the
possible exception of Libya, will require Western or Japanese economic
assistance, loans or renegotiation of existing loans in the near
future. Iran already is staggering under the financial burden of its
$30 billion foreign debt. Iraq owes foreign creditors more than $14
billion, Syria owes $16.5 billion, and Sudan's foreign debt is in
excess of $16 billion. Now that the Soviet Union has dissolved, they
have no place else to go. The U.S. should convince its allies to take
advantage of their financial leverage and elevate counterterrorism to
the forefront of economic aid and loan renegotiation decisions. 
<P>
     Trade sanctions against terrorist states will be more difficult
to extract from the Western Europeans and Japanese since they see
Iran, Iraq, and Libya as potentially lucrative export markets and
important sources of oil supplies. France and other countries already
are impatient to lift the U.N.-sponsored economic sanctions on Iraq.
To block this, Washington should make Iraq a high-priority test case
for Western anti-terrorism cooperation. The U.S. should stress Iraq's
abortive plot to assassinate former President George Bush during his
visit to Kuwait in April 1993 (For more on Iraq's assassination plot,
see James A. Phillips, "Punish Saddam's Terrorism With Military
Action," Heritage Foundation Executive Memorandum No. 358, June 11,
1993.) and Baghdad's continuing terrorist attacks on the Kurds and on
U.N. personnel in northern Iraq. To test Baghdad's intentions,
Washington should request the extradition of Abdul Yasin, an Iraqi who
participated in the plot to bomb the World Trade Center, who returned
to Iraq. (Yasin was seen outside his father's house in Baghdad by an
ABC News reporter earlier this year. Mylroie, op. cit.) If Baghdad
balks at observing the terms of the extradition treaty that it signed
with the U.S., then it clearly will be in violation of U.N. Security
Council Resolution Number 687 (April 1991), which called on Iraq to
abandon its support of terrorism. This violation could become a
justification for maintaining the U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
<P>
     The Europeans have been more cooperative in imposing economic
sanctions on Libya for its refusal to extradite two suspects in the
1988 Pan Am flight 103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. But these
U.N.-imposed sanctions have fallen short of an embargo on Libyan oil.
The U.S. should expand the sanctions to include Libya's oil exports.
Washington should work through the U.N. Security Council to impose an
oil export regime similar to the one imposed on Iraq: oil revenues
would be funneled into a U.N.-administered escrow account that could
be used to pay reparations to the families of victims of Libyan
terrorism. This could be a model to punish other terrorist states that
block international efforts to apprehend terrorists.
<P>
     Another terrorist state that is extremely vulnerable to concerted
international economic sanctions because of its crumbling economy is
Sudan. It already has sought to appease the West by turning over the
notorious Venezuelan-born terrorist Illich Ramirez Sanchez, alias
"Carlos the Jackal," to France on August 15. (Carlos was a terrorist
playboy who had outlived his usefulness to Syria, which had harbored
him until 1991. Carlos's leftist politics did not endear him to
Sudan's radical Islamic regime.) 
<P>
     Iran will be a more difficult case because of the reluctance of
America's allies, particularly Germany and Japan, to sacrifice their
short-term commercial interests in exporting to Iran. Now that Iran is
having difficulty repaying its debts, foreign creditors may be more
willing to consider trade sanctions against Tehran. In any case, the
U.S. could strengthen its case for economic sanctions against Iran if
President Clinton blocks the proposed $750 million sale of up to 20
Boeing 737 jetliners to Iran and prohibits U.S. oil companies, the
largest purchasers of Iranian oil, from buying Iran's oil exports.
(American oil companies currently are prohibited from importing
Iranian oil into the U.S. but are allowed to buy it for resale
elsewhere. See James Phillips, "Containing Iran," Heritage Foundation
Backgrounder No. 980, March 9, 1994.)
<P>
     The U.S. should drive up the prospective political costs of
state-sponsored terrorism. This can be done by supporting opposition
groups in countries that engage in international terrorism. All Middle
Eastern terrorist states have generated domestic opposition.
Washington should provide diplomatic, economic, and even military
support to the most viable opposition groups in terrorist states. The
Kurds in Iraq, the resistance movements in southern Sudan, pro-Western
exile groups and the increasingly restless Azeris, Baluch, and Kurds
in Iran, and Libyan dissidents all merit increased American and
Western support. The Assad regime in Syria has brutally eliminated
most domestic opposition, but President Assad's persistent health
problems and the recent death of his son and heir apparent, Basil, has
increased uncertainty about the political durability of Syria's
minority Alawite regime. Although there may be no viable opposition
inside Syria in the short run, the U.S. should increase its diplomatic
support for an independent Lebanon free from Syrian domination. 
<P>
Mobilize reluctant allies to maximize pressure on terrorist states and
groups.
<P>
     Western Europe has borne the brunt of the spillover of Middle
Eastern terrorism, yet historically has been reluctant to take
determined action against it. Too often, European states have sought
to appease terrorist states and cut separate deals with them, rather
than take a unified stand against terrorism. Last October, Germany
hosted a visit by Iran's Minister of Intelligence and Security, Ali
Fallahiyan, the overseer of much of Iran's terrorist operations.
France appeased Iran last December by expelling two suspected Iranian
terrorists whose extradition had been sought by Switzerland for the
1990 assassination of an Iranian opposition leader in Geneva. 
<P>
     The U.S. must drive home to its allies that appeasement of
terrorism is a self-defeating policy that only encourages more
terrorism. France may be ripe for persuasion, now that an upsurge in
terrorist attacks against French citizens in Algeria led Paris to
crack down on exiled Algerian radicals in France in early August.
France now criticizes the U.S. and Germany for allowing exiled
Algerian radicals to continue to operate freely within their borders.
Washington should cooperate with France and closely monitor the
activities of Algerian radicals in the U.S., while pressing Paris to
support greater international cooperation in isolating terrorist
states, particularly Iran.
<P>
     Germany and Japan, the two biggest exporters to Iran, are the
weak links in Western efforts to isolate Iran. Both states argue that
they aid Iranian "moderates" by maintaining good trade and diplomatic
relations with Iran. This rationale has grown increasingly threadbare
in view of Iran's continued support of terrorism. Besides, Iran's
"moderates" are losing ground to more radical elements in Tehran who
are likely to escalate terrorism unless confronted with firm
international pressures. The U.S. should strongly warn Germany and
Japan, first privately and increasingly in public, that appeasement
only encourages Iran and other terrorist states to believe that
terrorism is cost-free. Worse, by conducting preferential trade
relations with Iran and granting it foreign aid and loans, Germany and
Japan are subsidizing Iran's terrorism. 
<P>
     Washington also should press its allies to establish a high-level
central office for coordinating counterterrorism policies. These
offices could act as liaisons with allied counterterrorism agencies.
Modeled on the U.S. Office of Counterterrorism, these offices would
help raise the profile of counterterrorism as an international issue
and make international cooperation more effective and timely.
Washington also should lobby all its allies to adopt stiffer penalties
for terrorism, including longer jail terms and the seizure of the
assets of terrorist groups or states. The Europeans, in particular,
should be pressed to stop releasing terrorists before their sentences
have been completed.
<P>
     Washington also should press Saudi Arabia to halt the flow of
financial aid to radical Islamic movements. Substantial sums of money
from private Saudi religious foundations and individuals have
bankrolled Sheik Abdul Rahman and other radical fundamentalists.
Riyadh placed restrictions on the flow of these funds outside the
country in 1993 but needs to more carefully control the activities of
the Islamic foundations to prevent them from meddling in the internal
affairs of other Muslim countries. 
<P>
Maintain the option to retaliate unilaterally for terrorist attacks
with decisive military force. 
<P>
     The use or threat of use of military force is essential for
punishing and deterring state-sponsored terrorism. The military
response should be designed to raise the cost of terrorism above the
price a terrorist state is willing to pay. The U.S. should not get
bogged down in a tit-for-tat exchange by limiting its attacks merely
to terrorist training camps. Instead, it should strike targets that
the terrorist state highly values, such as its internal security
forces and secret police. For example, if Iran or one of its
surrogates, such as Hezbollah, lashes out at an American target, the
U.S. should not content itself with destroying a few easily
replaceable terrorist camps in Lebanon or Iran. Rather, the U.S.
should attack Iran's Revolutionary Guards which train terrorists and
provide internal security, as well as Iran's Ministry of Intelligence
and Security.
<P>
     A sharp and decisive military reprisal not only can have a
deterrent effect on the terrorist state attacked, it also can have a
strong demonstration effect on other states that support terrorism.
For example, the April 1986 air strikes against Libya had a
significant impact on Syria as well as Libya. According to the State
Department, Libya reduced its involvement in international terrorism
from 19 incidents in 1986 to six in 1987, while Syrian involvement
fell from 34 in 1985 to six in 1986 and to one in 1987.
<P>
     Special operations are an important option for fighting
terrorists close to innocent civilians, in hostage rescue operations,
and in efforts to apprehend terrorist leaders. The Pentagon must make
an effort to maintain the strength and readiness of the Special
Operations Command which includes the elite "Delta Force," Army
Special Operations Forces, Navy Seals, Marine Reconnaissance teams,
and a special assault unit from the 101st Air Assault Division. These
forces should be periodically dispatched on anti-terrorism training
exercises in friendly Middle Eastern states to give them familiarity
with the region and experience with desert warfare. 
<P>
Stand firmly behind states threatened by Middle Eastern terrorism. 
<P>
     Middle Eastern terrorists pose much more of a threat to secular
and moderate regimes in the Muslim world than to the West. Islamic
revolutionary movements have used terrorism to undermine and
demoralize ruling governments, polarize societies, and intimidate
secular opposition. Terrorists have become the shock troops of Islamic
revolutionary movements seeking the overthrow of the governments of
Egypt and Algeria. The U.S. has a major stake in both countries. A
radical Islamic revolution in either of them would send shock waves
throughout the Arab world.
<P>
     Washington should steadfastly support the governments of Egypt
and Algeria in their efforts to reach an accommodation with political
opposition groups while firmly suppressing terrorists. American
diplomats should not meet publicly with radical Islamic leaders
because this could undermine the existing government. Nor should
Washington permit radical Islamic leaders, such as Tunisian
revolutionary Rashid el-Ghanoushi, to visit America unless they reject
terrorism. Nor should it pressure any government to enter talks with
any group that supports terrorism. Whenever possible the U.S. should
share its intelligence on terrorist groups and their supporters with
the governments battling revolutionary terrorists.
<P>
     In addition to supporting moderate Arab regimes threatened by
terrorism, the U.S. should cooperate closely with Turkey and Israel in
combating terrorism. Both countries are valuable sources of
intelligence on international terrorism and should be furnished with
American intelligence on terrorist activities in a timely manner. The
U.S. also should maintain relentless pressure on Syria to halt its
support for the Kurdish Workers Party and the Armenian Secret Army for
the Liberation of Armenia, two terrorist groups that have killed
scores of Turks. Moreover, Washington should strongly back Israel's
demand that any Syrian-Israeli peace agreement must include guarantees
that Syria will cease its support for Palestinian terrorists and help
end Hezbollah's rein of terror in Lebanon. 
<P>
Upgrade counterterrorism intelligence. 
<P>
     Fighting terrorism effectively requires detailed and timely
intelligence about the operations of terrorist groups, their support
networks and their state sponsors. The FBI has made effective use of
intelligence information to pre-empt at least 78 terrorist plots since
1982. (Estimate provided by Kevin Giblin, Senior Intelligence Officer
for Counterterrorism, FBI, in an August 3, 1993 Forum of the U.S.
Global Strategy Council entitled "Terrorism: The Next Phase?") But the
new breed of radical Islamic terrorists, organized in informal
amorphous groups, presents a new challenge for intelligence-gathering.
To maintain and expand its intelligence network, the FBI should make a
systematic effort to recruit Arab-Americans and American Muslims.
<P>
     The CIA needs to upgrade the volume and quality of its human
intelligence on terrorist groups and states. It must develop a more
extensive network of agents dedicated to counterterrorism intelligence
and infiltrate terrorist groups on a long-term basis. The CIA should
make every effort to recruit American and foreign personnel with
extensive knowledge of and experience in the cultures and societies of
their terrorist adversaries. The CIA's Counterterrorist Center,
created in 1986 by President Reagan after the hijacking of TWA flight
847, should be expanded and devote more resources to surveillance of
the new breed of radical Islamic terrorists. The National Security
Agency and various defense intelligence agencies should be directed to
give counterterrorism a higher priority in their intelligence-
gathering efforts. The Defense Department also should consider
dedicating more of its reconnaissance satellites to gathering
information on possible military targets related to terrorism, such as
terrorist bases and training camps in terrorist states and the Syrian-
controlled areas of Lebanon.
<P>
     In addition, the U.S. should improve its efforts to reward
informants who provide useful information about terrorist activities.
The State Department's International Counterterrorism reward program
provides monetary awards of up to $2 million for information on
terrorist activities against Americans. It has led to the defection of
more than ten terrorist informants and the prevention of nearly a
dozen acts of terrorism against Americans. This program should be
publicized more widely in the Middle East. A recent report that a
valuable informant was treated shabbily by the U.S. government is
disconcerting because it could lead the trickle of informants to dry
up. (See Jill Smolowe, "A Hero's Unwelcome," Time, May 9, 1994, p.
50.) Informants who risk their lives to provide important intelligence
should be promptly rewarded for their efforts.
<P>
Reform immigration laws to improve internal security. 
<P>
     Sheik Abdul Rahman and two of the World Trade Center bombers
entered the country illegally. They eventually were caught but were
allowed to remain in the country pending subsequent legal proceedings.
This situation is intolerable. Congress should reform the immigration
laws to accelerate deportation proceedings and simplify and
consolidate the lengthy procedural hearings and appeal system that
permit illegal and undocumented aliens to evade immigration controls.
Applicants for political asylum should be screened to weed out and
immediately deport those without a credible basis for asylum.
<P>
     Tougher penalties should be imposed on the production or use of
fraudulent passports and visas. Nine of the original 35 indictable
counts in the 1993 New York bombing plots involved visa or passport
offenses. The recently passed crime bill contains a measure that will
double the maximum prison terms for such crimes from 5 to 10 years
(and increase to 20 years if the documents were used to facilitate
terrorism) and boost fines from $2,000 to $250,000. A companion
measure sponsored by Representative Gilman, which currently is under
consideration by the House Judiciary Committee, would allow the
government to seize the assets of criminals convicted of creating or
using false documents for terrorism or drug smuggling. If passed, this
measure would make it harder for terrorists to obtain false documents.
<P>
     Finally, the U.S. government should automatically deny visas to
members of groups that advocate, support, or participate in terrorism.
Unfortunately, the 1990 Immigration and Naturalization Act killed the
provisions of the 1952 McCarran-Walter Immigration and Nationality Act
that allowed the U.S. government to restrict the entry into the U.S.
of members of a group deemed a threat to U.S. security. The State
Department now wrings its hands over denying visas solely because of
membership in a terrorist group. This loophole, which puts the nation
at risk, needs to be closed. Congress should pass legislation that
enables the U.S. government to deny visas to foreigners because of
membership in terrorist groups rather than requiring proof of personal
involvement in terrorist acts, as is now the case.
<P>
Restore order in anarchic areas where international terrorist groups
thrive.
<P>
     Many of the World Trade Center bombers were supporters of the
radical Afghan group Hezbi Islami (Party of Islam) led by Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar, a virulently anti-Western Islamic militant. Some reportedly
were trained in Hezbi Islami camps and fought in the Afghan war. The
U.S. should drop its short-sighted hands-off policy in Afghanistan
that has led it to remain neutral in the fighting between Hekmatyar's
Islamic zealots and the provisional government of President
Burhanuddin Rabbani. With a limited commitment of financial aid, the
U.S. can greatly strengthen the ability of the moderate Afghan forces
to defeat Hekmatyar's drive to transform Afghanistan into a
revolutionary Islamic state. By bolstering Rabbani's regime, the U.S.
could help end the anarchy that gives terrorists a foothold in
Afghanistan. (See James Phillips, "Winning the Endgame in
Afghanistan," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder Update No. 181, May 18,
1992.)
 <P>
    In addition, Washington should press Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to
end their support of Hekmatyar.
<P>
     The U.S. also should revive its efforts to build a stable and
independent Lebanon. Syria has sought to keep the Lebanese weak and
divided to assure its own dominance there. It has vetoed the efforts
of the Lebanese government to extend its control into southern Lebanon
and disarm Hezbollah. The U.S. should insist that Syria abide by the
terms of the 1989 Taif agreement, which require Syria to withdraw its
40,000 troops to eastern Lebanon and permit the Beirut government to
extend its control over its own territory. Only then will Lebanon
cease to be a staging area for international terrorism.
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
     Middle Eastern terrorism has become more unpredictable and
audacious. Radical Islamic terrorists inspired by Iranian, Algerian,
and Egyptian revolutionary movements have overshadowed Palestinian
nationalist terrorists as a threat to the West. These new terrorists
often are supported by networks of radical Islamic activists who live
in Muslim communities in the West. Even more worrisome is the
training, arms, financial support, and guidance which radical Islamic
terrorists receive from such states as Iran and Sudan. 
<P>
     International terrorism is not likely to be eradicated, but it
can be weakened considerably if increased diplomatic, economic,
political, and military pressure is brought to bear on the state
sponsors of terrorism. The U.S. must lead an international campaign to
raise the costs of terrorism. This will require a coordinated, firm,
and relentless international effort. This kind of cooperation paid off
in disarming Iraqi terrorism during the Gulf War, and it can work
again. The U.S. must convince its allies that they now are involved,
whether they want to be or not, in an international war against
terrorism.
<P>
     To do so, the Clinton Administration must do more to stop
international terrorism. It must shelve its misguided plan to
downgrade the State Department's Office of Counterterrorism, toughen
its approach to terrorist states, and remain vigilantly on guard
against terrorist movements. Only then will its allies sacrifice their
short-term commercial interests to advance the long-term security
interests of the West and other targets of Middle Eastern terrorists.

<h2>Bilingual Ed.</h2></center><P> 
[Bilingual education is a bureaucratic boondoggle that is isolating 
immigrant children from the rest of American society and relegating 
them to a life of second-class citizenship.]
<P>
Federal bureaucrats forced bilingual education programs into the public 
schools in 1974 without any research whatsoever to demonstrate their 
effectiveness. Twenty years later, there's still no proof that these 
programs bring immigrant children into the English-speaking 
mainstream of our nation. Prior to 1974, millions of immigrants learned 
English by the immersion method. That means that immigrant children 
went to public schools where only English was spoken and learned this 
new language rapidly. They then went home and taught English to their 
parents.
<P>
Since 1974, federal regulations have required that public school 
instructors be proficient in the foreign language they teach, but do not 
require that they speak English fluently. A school can lose its federal 
funding if it fails to "instruct," "maintain," and "develop" in the student's 
native tongue, but there is no corresponding penalty for failing to teach 
English. Unfortunately, foreign language instructors have discovered 
that they can enhance their job security by delaying their students' 
transition to English. As a result, many of their students graduate from 
public high schools without ever learning English. 
<P>
Representative Toby Roth of Wisconsin has introduced a bill in Congress 
mandating that all federal government business be conducted in English 
and repealing statutes that require non-English ballots and bilingual 
education. "In many places in America, English is no longer the first 
language in school," says Roth. "Our children are now taught, by law 
and with government funds, in dozens of languages other than English -- 
12 different languages in New York City alone. Instead of a first-rate 
education in English. students in bilingual education classes are taught 
in their native tongue, and English is rarely spoken."
<P>
Toby Roth argues that, despite the enormous expense involved (an 
estimated $8 billion annually), "bilingual education is a dismal failure at 
doing what Congress originally asked it to do: teach children English 
quickly and effectively. Tragically, it relegates countless children -- 
unable to speak, understand, and use English effectively -- to a second-
class future. More important, programs like bilingual education divide 
our country by undermining the common bond that holds our country 
together -- our English language."
<P>
Congressman Roth says that the purpose of his legislation is simply to 
ensure that "the primary language of instruction in schools is English, 
and that [Americans] vote and deal with the government in English. 
People will still be able, even encouraged, to speak and learn a foreign 
language, and preserve their heritage," he insists. "The only significant 
difference will be that government actively reinforces our common 
language rather than erodes it."
<P>
Congressman Roth says that his overriding goal is "to keep America one 
nation, one people. We must preserve the common bond that has kept 
this country of immigrants together for more than two centuries by 
making English our official language. Our future as a united nation 
depends on it."
<p>                           <P>

INTRODUCTION
<P>
     Charges that the Congress is unresponsive, arrogant, and ultimately
ineffective have been an increasingly significant political issue for the
past decade. Now that the 1994 elections have changed partisan control of
Congress and delivered a clear reform mandate, the new leadership of the
House of Representatives has assembled a package of rules changes
designed to make that body more accountable and more effective. These
proposals, to be approved on the first day of the 104th Congress, January
4, 1995, include provisions to reduce congressional bureaucracy, to make
voting and budget procedures more fair and open, to encourage a more
deliberative and accountable legislative process, and to subject Congress to
most laws now applied to the private sector. These are large and important
first steps toward making Congress more responsive to American voters and,
in the process, restoring public confidence in that institution. As historic
as they are, these changes should mark only the beginning of continuing
congressional reform efforts, including the ultimate adoption of term limits.
  <P>   For four decades, the House of Representatives was under the control
of one party. During that period, House procedures became increasingly
arbitrary and secretive. The House's internal management grew sloppy and
bred corruption. Committee-based fief- doms were dominated by special
interests, and committees often were unable or unwilling to produce
legislation responsive to broad public desires. Congressional Republicans
increasingly criticized these developments, calling for a more streamlined,
responsive, and equitable legislative process.  In the end, voters felt
alienated from their elected officials, and Congress's approval rating
plummeted. The new House rules package largely achieves the goals of the
institution's critics, with scores of minor and major changes in House rules
designed to:<P>
Improve deliberation by banning proxy (absentee) voting in committees,
ensuring minority rights in the amendment process, and requiring fuller
reporting on spending bills.<P>
Streamline the legislative process by cutting the number of committees and
subcommittees, abolishing joint referrals of legislation, and slashing
committee staff.<P>
Promote accountability by requiring that committee meetings be open to
the public and to the broadcast media, requiring roll call votes on major
legislation, prohibiting changes in debate transcripts, and conducting a
comprehensive audit of House finances.<P>
Increase responsiveness by imposing term limits on the Speaker and
committee chairmen and providing for consideration of a measure to apply
federal laws to Congress as the first legislative vote in the 104th Congress.
   <P>  The rules changes prepared for the first day of the new House
session include numerous other provisions designed to help achieve these
four goals, which the new majority also promises to pursue in its day-to-day
administration of the House by, for instance, making legislation and
background information quickly available to the public electronically on the
Internet.
<P>     After the first day, this new, more open House of Representatives
should seek further improvements in the legislative process, including deeper
cuts in congressional staff, spending, and free mail, reductions in
congressional support agencies (requiring Senate cooperation), budget
process reforms, and term limits.
 <P>    

FILLING THE REFORM VACUUM
 <P>    Public approval of Congress has been declining for over a decade,
fueled initially by a consensus that legislators were failing to act on 
the nation's problems. Voter animus was heightened by a series of scandals
which symbolized the degree to which Congress had become self-serving
and detached from the concerns of average Americans. At the same time,
public awareness of procedural abuses in Congress was increasing, fueling
grassroots movements for limits on the number of terms that Members of
Congress could serve. Beginning in 1990, term limits were approved in
every state that held a vote on them. In 1992, a record-setting class of
freshmen Representatives was elected on a wave of reform sentiment. By
1993 an obscure House procedure known as the discharge petition became
the object of a talk radio-spawned mass movement to open up the workings
of Congress.
<P>     Despite these warning signs, leaders of the 103rd Congress took little
or no action to improve the institution, gambling that the public would lose
interest in the issue. In a meeting with a dozen reform-minded freshman
Democrats shortly after the 1992 elections, then-Speaker of the House Tom
Foley argued that nobody would be concerned about congressional reform
by the time of the 1994 elections. As a result of leadership pressure, the
103rd Congress failed to change such institutional embarrassments as
deceptive budgeting, an overgrown staff and committee system, entrenched
leadership structures, proxy voting, secret committee meetings, and near-
dictatorial powers exercised by committee chairmen. Foley's prediction that
the public would lose interest was wrong. Voters recognized that these
congressional abuses had become threats to representative self-government,
and their conviction was a significant factor in the revolutionary election
results of 1994.
 <P>    The Republicans' Contract With America includes term limits and
eight changes in House rules which the candidates promised would be
enacted on the first day of the 104th Congress. Since the election,
Republicans have assembled a rules package which fulfills those promises
and adds several provisions designed to produce a more efficient, open, and
fair legislative process. By passing this proposed new rules package, the
House will accomplish more reforms in one day than the previous
Congresses have in twenty years. These historic changes should not be the
end of the reform process, however. In the coming months Congress should
examine unfair incumbent electoral advantages such as the franking (free
mailing) privilege and large personal staffs, and sharply reduce staffing in
support agencies (possibly taking advantage of the opportunity to sell one
of its office buildings). It also should consider additional truth-in-voting
reforms such as lengthier review periods for legislation, formal restrictions
on closed rules (which prohibit or limit amendments on the House floor),
and application of the Freedom of Information Act to Congress.
  <P>   

CONTRACT REFORMS
  <P>   The reforms included in the Contract With America will be offered
as eight separate resolutions, allowing for a separate debate and vote on
each.<P>
Staff Cuts and Committee Reforms. The new rules package will eliminate
three House committees -- Post Office and Civil Service, District of
Columbia, and Merchant Marine and Fisheries -- and 25 subcommittees.
  <P>   Congressional committees and subcommittees have grown
enormously. Congress's 1947 reorganization, which cut the number of
committees and subcommittees to under 200, was undone by rapid
committee and subcommittee growth in the 1970s. This expansion nearly
doubled the number of committees and subcommittees; their total did not
fall significantly under 300 until the early 1990s.
<P> Growth in committees and staff has ensured that Congressmen will be
removed from policy choices and hindered from passing legislation, since
a larger committee structure subjects bills to redundant scrutiny and more
special-interest group influence. The concomitant larger number of
committee assignments sometimes has forced members to neglect some of
their committee duties and thus devalued the importance of committee work
and the deliberation that is supposed to take place there. Reducing the
number of panels will make Congress better able to focus on legislative
priorities.
  <P>   The committee reform provision also will shrink House committee
staff by one-third. House committee staff has grown almost twelvefold
since World War II, with the most dramatic increases again occurring in the
1970s. The growth rate of House committee staff has far outpaced the
substantial growth in Senate committee staff as well as growth in the
personal staff in either House -- in the last two decades alone, committee
staffs in the House of Representatives have grown by 158 percent. Congress
is the most heavily staffed legislature in the world by a factor of five;
with nearly 40,000 employees, it has grown over twice as fast as the entire
federal government since World War II. 
 <P>    Staff cuts are worthwhile for a number of reasons, not the least of
which is the opportunity for savings from the nearly $2.3 billion yearly
expense of the institution. Furthermore, experience shows that the larger the
congressional staff, the more likely it is to pursue independent agendas,
usurping decisions properly left to democratically elected representatives.
Former Senator Walter Mondale (D-MN) described the pressures on an
overstaffed legislator: "I felt sorry for them, so I would try to work with
them. Pretty soon I was working for them." A larger legislative staff eager
to improve the country from Washington, D.C., also creates pressure for the
expansion of the federal government.
<P>
Truth in Budgeting.
<P> The second of the Contract provisions will require committees to compare
new spending recommendations to the provisions of current law. The new
leadership is also committed to additional truth-in-budgeting reforms,
including reform of the "current services baseline," but cannot accomplish
them on the first day in session since they will require changes in statutes
or in procedures affecting both Houses of Congress.
Term Limits for Committee Chairmen.
<P>  House committee chairmen will be prohibited from serving more than
three consecutive Congresses (six years). Limitation of tenure for committee
chairmen begins to address some of the concerns of advocates of full-scale
legislative term limits. A central problem of previous Congresses has been
that the committee chairmen, who set Congress's agenda, had spent decades
in office. In the 103rd Congress, for example, two of the House's three most
powerful committees (Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce) were
chaired by Congressmen who had held the chair for over a decade, while the
third (Appropriations) had just been vacated by a Congressman who had
held it since the 1970s. Over 90 percent of House committees were chaired
by Members who had spent at least ten terms in office. Although this figure
will drop to 55 percent in the 104th Congress -- partly because of the switch
in party control -- the dangers of concentrated power and of committee
chairmen who are resistant to new ideas remain.
<P>     Term limits for committee chairmen would increase the likelihood
of their openness to new perspectives. They would also reduce opportunities
for wasteful, district- and reelection-oriented federal spending aimed at
favored constituents and special interest groups. Voters would also have less
reason to evaluate incumbents running for reelection on the basis of
seniority, and thus more reason to take into account candidates' views on
the issues of the day.
<P>
Elimination of Proxy Voting.
<P> Elimination of the practice of allowing absent members of a committee to
loan their votes to other members is a critical step to ensure fairness and to
improve committee deliberation. Although House Rules have strictly
prohibited one Member of Congress from casting votes for another on the
House floor (indeed, ethics reprimands have been triggered by this rule's
violation), proxy voting was the norm in most committees in the 103rd
Congress. In 1993, for example, the House Committees on the Judiciary,
Public Works and Transportation, and Energy and Commerce used proxies
on every single legislative vote. 
 <P>    Historically, proxy voting allowed the majority party leadership to
extend its control over committee outcomes by scheduling multiple,
contemporaneous committee and subcommittee meetings. Committee
chairmen, who determine their committee's entire legislative agenda, could
postpone votes on controversial matters until they controlled sufficient proxy
votes to ensure that the vote would go their way. Proxy voting also
promoted committee absenteeism by ensuring that legislators who skipped
meetings would retain their ability to cast votes in absentia. It allowed
legislators to abandon their deliberative responsibilities by voting for or
against legislation without hearing any discussion or argument on its merits.
Abolishing proxy voting will reduce the power of committee chairmen and
foster deliberation by forcing Congressmen to show up for work in
committees if they want their votes to count.
<P>     The additional rules reforms to follow the eight Contract provisions
include four related changes. "Rolling quorums" (allowing Congressmen to
stick their heads inside a meeting room briefly and thus meet the minimum
attendance requirement for a committee to do business) will be prohibited,
and most committees would be barred from meeting when the House is in
session. Most Members will be restricted to two full committee and four
subcommittee assignments, preventing the inflation and devaluation of
committee assignments. Finally, joint referral of a bill to two or more
committees will be abolished. Like the proxy ban, these provisions will
emphasize the importance of members actually working on legislation in
House committees, increasing committees' accountability while improving
their product. 
<P>
Open Meetings.
<P> The new rules package will also ensure public access to committee
meetings. In previous Congresses, committees frequently closed their doors
to the press and public, a step the panels could take for nearly any reason.
In fact, the two House committees that most often operated in secret --
Appropriations and Ways and Means -- were the bodies making
controversial choices about federal taxation and spending.
  <P>   Former Speaker Foley, who helped write the committee-closing rules
roughly two decades ago, once suggested that secret meetings make for
better decisions. "I think sometimes there is a feeling that there is better
discussion, less inhibited, more free and full discussion... in closed
session." But Foley's suggestion that public accountability poisons
deliberation runs counter to American ideals of republican self-government,
in which citizens are expected to pass judgment on the actions of the
lawmakers who represent them. In fact, past examples strongly suggest that
the public interest would have been served by increased openness and
disclosure. For instance, the Ways and Means Committee prevented the
public from observing discussions of the 1988 catastrophic illness
legislation. Just months later, as the public began to understand the
consequences of the law, it was repealed. Greater openness in government
might have prevented that legislative disaster.
 <P>    The new rules will allow committees to close meetings only if a
public session would endanger national security, compromise law
enforcement, or defame or incriminate individuals. Further, broadcast media
would be permitted to cover any open hearing or meeting (currently, media
coverage is subject to a vote of approval). Related additions to these
Contract provisions include requirements that committees publish recorded
committee votes in their reports (most voting records are now available only
by personal journeys to committee offices) and that committee transcripts
could not be altered other than for minor grammatical changes.
<P>
Making Tax Hikes More Difficult.
<P>The new rules package would require a three-fifths vote of the House to
pass any income tax rate increase and prohibit retroactive taxation of
income. Among Washington commentators the 60 percent rule has been
particularly controversial, with claims that the new rule is anti-democratic
or even unconstitutional. Behind the heated rhetoric of Beltway
commentators is the conviction that new tax increases are needed. The
supermajority requirement is quite similar to restrictions voters have
imposed on numerous state legislators. Among the most beneficial aspects
of the 60 percent tax rule is that any future Congress desiring to raise taxes
would have to alter or waive the rule, providing a warning sign of a
potential tax boost. The provision also balances the burden of a 1990 budget
law which effectively requires a 60 percent vote in the Senate to cut taxes
(unless the reductions are offset by increases in other taxes or cuts in
entitlement spending).
<P>
Authorization of House Audit.
<P> The seventh Contract-related rules change will authorize a comprehensive
audit of House records, assets, and facilities by an independent accounting
firm. Some House accounts have been audited sporadically by the General
Accounting Office, an internal congressional agency. Despite the fact that
one such audit uncovered the House Bank scandal, most House accounts
have not been examined regularly, and some may have never been reviewed
by an independent examiner. This audit will be the first complete accounting
of the House's financial status ever made available to the public.
<P>
Applying Federal Laws to Congress.
 <P>The last of the Contract reforms is a rule paving the way for the first
legislative action of the new House -- consideration of the Congressional
Accountability Act (CAA). This measure has both substantive and symbolic
importance. Passage of the CAA will underscore the principle that no
American should be immune from the law or receive special treatment in its
application. The bill also will encourage legislators to continue to review the
burdens that federal laws place upon American citizens and ensure that the
benefits they bring exceed their attendant costs. The laws which would be
applied to Congress include the Civil Rights Act, the Americans With
Disabilities Act, the National Labor Relations Act, the Occupational Safety
and Health Act, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, and
the Family and Medical Leave Act.
  <P>   The House passed a version of the Congressional Accountability Act
near the end of the 103rd Congress, but the measure died because the Senate
failed to consider it. As a stopgap solution the House extended coverage of
the specified laws to itself by an internal rules change in September of 1994,
but a statute rather than a House rule is necessary to grant congressional
employees review rights in federal court. This year the Senate appears
poised to act on the Accountability Act early in the session, giving it very
good prospects for passage.
  <P>   The major remaining flaw in the current version of the
Accountability Act is the exclusion of the Freedom of Information Act
(FOIA) from the list of covered laws. The FOIA does not apply to the
private sector because it is intended to give the public access to government
information. Excluding FOIA can only give the appearance that Congress
thinks it has something to hide, and runs counter to the openness in
government principles infused in most other House reforms. A joint House-
Senate group apparently will study application of FOIA to Congress, though
without a promise of action.
<P>
ADDITIONAL FIRST-DAY HOUSE RULES REFORMS
  <P>   The new Republican majority in the House will go beyond reforms
promised in the Contract With America with a further package of rules
changes which will also be adopted during the House's first meeting on
January 4. These reforms are fully consistent with those offered in the
Contract, further advancing principles of fairness and accountability in
House procedures. The most significant of these are term limits for the
House Speaker, more equitable procedures governing special rules used for
significant legislation, and a more open appropriations process.
<P>
Ending the Emergency Spending Loophole and Other Appropriations
Reforms.
<P> The new rules package will close a loophole that enabled legislators to stuff
pork into emergency spending bills. Because emergency relief bills are not
subject to overall spending limits, they have been abused to advance
programs which could not be justified in the regular legislative process. For
instance, the $6.2 billion that President Clinton requested for earthquake
relief in 1993 ballooned into an $11 billion federal spending spree by the
time Congress had finished adding such extraneous items as federal
employee pay raises and funding for a New York train station. Although the
House in the 103rd Congress passed legislation banning such budgetary
sleight of hand, the Senate failed to take action on the measure. Passage of
this reform through House rules will eradicate this problem in the House
even without Senate action.
<P>     Several other changes in the appropriations process will grant rank-
and-file Members more say in spending decisions. Members will be
permitted to offer "en bloc" amendments to transfer appropriations money
from one program to another and to offer limitation amendments that
prohibit federal funds from being used for specific purposes. En bloc
amendments currently are not allowed, and limitation amendments are
allowed only if sponsors can first defeat a procedural motion. 
  <P>   New rules would also require appropriators to identify projects that
are not authorized (as is normally required). This step will both draw
attention to authorizing committees which are failing to perform their job
and to appropriators who are too eager to do it for them. For instance, no
foreign aid bill has been authorized for the last eight years, which has left
all decisions in that area entirely in the hands of appropriators.
<P>
Greater Specificity About Rules Waivers.
<P> One particularly egregious abuse of House procedures has been the practice
of the blanket rules waiver, which authorizes departure from all House rules.
Blanket waivers have enabled the majority party leadership to force
immediate votes on lengthy bills while avoiding questions about what
particular rule needed to be avoided, what part of the bill required special
treatment, and what the departure from standard procedure would
accomplish. For instance, when Rep. Jack Brooks (D-TX) came before the
Rules Committee to request a blanket waiver on the 103rd Congress's crime
bill, he was asked by Rep. David Dreier (R-CA) what aspects of the
gargantuan legislation needed waivers. "I don't know," Brooks responded,
"and I wouldn't tell you if I did!" Among the items Brooks was hiding was
a large grant to a university in his own district. The new waiver restrictions
would require the Rules Committee to specify "to the maximum extent
possible" any departure from standard House Rules, giving legislators who
opposed bending the rules a road map to focus their criticisms far more
sharply.
<P>
Minority Rights to Offer Amendments.
<P> Many House Republican complaints over the last decades have centered
around the fact that they have not been allowed to contribute to the
legislative process. This situation has been exacerbated by historically large
proportions of amendment-limiting rules. Too often majority party leaders
refused to allow the minority party any role (Former Speaker Tip O'Neill
is reported to have said during his tenure that "Republicans are just going
to have to get it through their heads that they are not going to write
legislation!"). Republicans have pledged to adhere to their own calls for
fairness as a majority party by:<P>
Guaranteeing in House rules the minority's right to offer at least one
amendment to every piece of legislation in the form of a "motion to
recommit with instructions," and<P>
Pledging that at least three-quarters of House rules will be open to all
amendments (reversing the nearly three-quarters closed ratio recorded by
Democrats in the last Congress).
<P>
Honest Housekeeping. Several new rules will provide better information to
the public, including:
<P>
Requiring recorded votes on appropriations, tax, and budget bills.
Previously, such legislation was occasionally passed by voice vote, which
denied constituents information on Congressmen's policy choices.
Preventing revision of the Congressional Record. In previous Congresses,
Members were able to hide mistakes or embarrassing statements they uttered
on the House floor by submitting corrections to Record compilers. Such
rewriting of history, which allowed Congressmen to appear in the best
possible light in the Record, would be disallowed by the new rules.
Providing more timely information on the identity of Members signing
discharge petitions (a method of bypassing recalcitrant committees).
Providing House documents and records to the public via the Internet or by
other electronic means (a step the new leadership has pledged which does
not need a rules change).
<P>
Abolition of Legislative Service Organizations (LSOs).
<P>
 There are currently 140 special interest congressional caucuses: of these, 28
have been permitted to be LSOs. This status permits groups to have office
space, access to House equipment and services, and funding through
Members' clerk-hire accounts. Unfortunately, LSO spending was poorly
controlled, allowing spending on items prohibited under normal rules. Items
billed to LSOs in the past include $2,646 worth of glass sculptures used for
gifts, $4,000 for pastries, a $9,000 reception, and over $10,000 in one year
for a petty cash fund -- with no receipts. Over one-fifth of the $35 million
spent by LSOs in the past decade remains unaccounted for. Not only did
LSOs occupy scarce congressional offices, they contributed to policy
fragmentation and client-based approaches to public policy, often acting as
official proxies for outside special interest groups.
   <P>  The new rules abolish LSOs, which could save a significant portion
of the $5 million yearly that they cost. Because LSO funds came from
individual congressional accounts, which are not addressed in the first-day
rules changes, actual savings will depend on subsequent action by Congress.
<P>
 Abolition of Commemorative Legislation.
<P> 
The new rules package would ban commemorative legislation such as
National Dairy Goat Awareness Week and National Tap Dancing Day.
Although legislation that honors certain groups or activities is appreciated
by the beneficiaries, such activity diverts congressional attention from more
important matters.
<P>
Abolition of Delegate Voting.<P>
 In the 103rd Congress, the majority congressional leadership awarded the
five delegates from the District of Columbia and U.S. Territories the right
to vote on the House floor in most instances. Republicans opposed this
measure, arguing that the delegates neither represented citizens of the states
(as specified in the Constitution) nor, for the most part, paid federal taxes.
The new rules package would eliminate this controversy by restricting the
right to vote on the House floor to those representatives of (in the
Constitution's words) "the People of the Several States."
<P>
Term Limits for the Speaker.<P>
 Reforms in the committee system and other changes in House rules have
the effect of concentrating more power in the hands of the Speaker. While
most observers agree that centralization was needed, many Congressmen
also feared that concentrating power for too long in the hands of any one
person might lead to abuses similar to those being combatted by these same
rules changes. In response to these concerns, incoming Speaker Newt
Gingrich has agreed to support a House rule limiting his own tenure (and
that of his successors) to four terms (eight years). As with term limits on
committee chairmen, or on Congress as a whole, this reform strikes an
appropriate balance between the powers necessary to govern a great nation
and the danger of leaving such power in the hands of any one official for
too long.
<P>
RULES REFORMS BEYOND JANUARY 4
  <P>   Following the sweeping rules changes on the first day of its session,
the House should not and likely will not abandon further reform efforts.
Many needed reforms will require the cooperation of the Senate, the passage
of legislation, or simply more study and consideration than was possible in
the two months between election day and the opening of the new Congress.
Among the most important of these reform areas are:
<P>
Additional Staff and Budget Cuts.
<P> House Republicans considered but postponed a proposal to reduce the
number of employees that each Representative is permitted to hire. Over 40
percent of personal office employees are devoted to casework or essentially
political functions. While Congressmen should remain sensitive to special
problems of constituents, most casework is on routine matters such as
pensions, entitlement benefits and passports. These problems could be better
addressed through nonpartisan ombudsmen, for example, leaving
Congressmen more time to address broader problems, and leaving fewer
staffers available for private electoral purposes. For instance, hundreds of
staffers currently spend the bulk of their workday writing and sending
hundreds of millions of franked letters yearly, which serve as supplementary
quasi-campaign mailings for incumbents seeking reelection. The "volunteer"
campaign work performed by many congressional staffers sometimes
approaches being a sub rosa condition of hire and almost certainly
contributes to the record incumbent reelection rates of over 90 percent that
House Members have seen on average over the last two decades. Congress
should also reduce the franking budget and consider further restrictions on
pre-election mailings. Finally, the House and Senate should work together
to reduce staffing in the bloated congressional support agencies, particularly
the General Accounting Office. Matching the one-third reductions in House
committee staffing is a realistic goal for the support agencies. Both staff and
franking are likely to be addressed this spring in the congressional
appropriations process.
<P>
Ending Baseline Budgeting.
<P> 
The new rules package requires committees to compare proposed spending
to actual current spending levels. However, without further changes, the
overall federal budget process will still use "baseline budgeting," which
compares proposed spending to imaginary totals based on actual spending,
inflation, and demographic and economic factors. This system has permitted
Congress to slip disguised spending increases into budgets without taking
responsibility for doing so. The Medicare baseline, for instance, typically
calls for yearly increases of 12 percent to 13 percent, double or triple the
rate of inflation.
   <P>  As Texas Democratic Representative Charles Stenholm has noted,
baseline budgeting "creates a bias to increase spending." The new rules
package would address this problem in the case of individual bills, but
Congress should also change the Budget Act so that the entire budget
process operates on the same principle. The House passed baseline reform
legislation last year which died in the Senate. Early House action this year
would vastly improve prospects in the Senate, where new leaders may be
more favorable to this change.
<P>
TRUTH IN VOTING
<P>     In the 103rd Congress, Representative Mike Crapo (R-ID) introduced
the Truth in Voting Act, a package of rules reforms designed to make the
House's legislative process more open, understandable, and accountable.
Roughly half of the dozen truth-in-voting reforms in Crapo's bill are
included in the House's new rules package. The balance of Crapo's truth-in-
voting reforms, however, are worthwhile.
<P>
Establish a "deficit lockbox" for spending cuts.
<P> Although Members of Congress love to trumpet their votes in favor of
politically popular spending cuts, the implied benefit of these cuts -- that
they will save money or reduce the deficit -- is almost always nonexistent.
A House vote to cut spending simply cedes control of the funds in question
back to the appropriations conference committee that originally spent the
money. That committee can simply restore the cut spending or reallocate the
money to another pet program; either of these options destroys the savings
aimed at by budget-cutters. A lock box would allow lawmakers to designate
spending cuts for deficit reduction.
<P>
Require a three-fifths majority to waive rules.
<P> Although incoming Rules Committee Chairman Gerald Solomon (R-NY)
has pledged to make three-quarters of the legislation the House considers
open to amendment, requiring a supermajority vote to block further
legislative improvements would provide a better guarantee of minority rights
in the amendment process. The House could preserve the right of the
majority to force action by specifying conditions (such as time limits or pre-
publication requirements) which could be adopted by a simple majority vote,
while requiring a higher threshold for conditions which might shut out
minority voices or rush legislation unreasonably.
<P>
Eliminate House rules that make procedural tricks possible.
<P> Among the rules abuses targeted by Crapo's Truth in Voting bill are "self-
executing rules" which cloak substantive provisions in procedural votes. In
the past, the House has made policy through procedural votes on such
disparate matters as aid to the Contras, congressional pay, changes in deficit
targets, and endorsement of President Clinton's policies on homosexuals in
the military. Perhaps the most disturbing example is a permanent self-
executing provision, House Rule XLIX, also known as the "Gephardt Rule"
which permits continual increases in the federal debt limit, in line with
annual budget resolutions, without the embarrassment of voting to hike it.
Crapo would also prohibit "king-of-the-hill" rules which permit Members to
vote on both sides of the same issue. 
<P>
Apply the Freedom of Information Act to Congress.
<P> Although the new House's first order of business -- at last to apply federal
laws to itself -- is praiseworthy, this endeavor will remain flawed and
incomplete until Freedom of Information Act coverage is included.
Congressional secrecy has done more to harm the institution and make it
susceptible to scandal than perhaps any other action. Abuses centering
around the House restaurant, post office, and bank scandals would likely
have been eliminated or curbed far earlier had knowledge about their details
been available to the general public. Citizens have a right to know about the
contacts that Members of Congress make with special-interest lobbyists and
federal regulatory agencies. Applying FOIA to Congress is the best way to
ensure that such information is disclosed.
<P>
Rein in conference committees.
 <P>Federal programs often become more expensive over the course of many
years, but they rarely become $5 billion more expensive over the course of
a few weeks. When the $22 billion Senate crime bill and its $28 billion
House counterpart went to conference committee, that committee produced
a $33 billion product. Although massive public scrutiny eventually enabled
congressional budget-cutters to reduce the bill's expense, unlimited
committee discretion routinely enables committee members to add new
spending to the legislation that ultimately must be voted on by both Houses
of Congress. New House Rules specifying that conference committees may
not fund programs at a higher level than either House of Congress had
approved would eliminate committee skullduggery and redistribute power
from conference committees to rank-and-file legislators. Such rules should
also require conference committees to follow the dictates of any motions to
instruct passed by the House, rather than allowing conferees to ignore those
often overwhelming votes.
<P>
TERM LIMITS
  <P>   The Contract With America promises only a House vote on term
limits. However, if House leaders make only desultory efforts to secure the
two-thirds supermajority necessary to pass a constitutional amendment, term
limit supporters will be outraged and citizens may feel they were tricked.
While the reforms the new House majority has embraced are huge
improvements, the task of congressional reform will not be complete until
term limits become the law of the land. Only term limits can guarantee that
Republicans will keep their vows to remember life in the minority and to
remain sensitive to the will of the American people. The clearest test of
House leaders' real commitment to term limits would be a vigorous effort
to find a way to defuse the controversy between six- and twelve-year House
service limits, which threatens to complicate this already difficult effort.
<P>
CONCLUSION
 <P>    Although disputes over the way the House operates are often
portrayed as arguments over arcane details with little significance, the votes
that establish the rules by which the House does business are some of the
most important ones that House Members will cast over the next two years.
Previous Congresses operated under rules that inflated staff, weakened the
quality of House deliberation, kept important matters out of the public's
view, and eroded individual Members' accountability. Passage of the new
rules package will be an unprecedented House cleaning: it will make the
House more efficient, more accountable, more deliberative, and more open
to public scrutiny. 
 <P>    Among the highlights of the new rules are:
Application of private sector laws to Congress;
Elimination of numerous House committees and subcommittees, a one-third
cut in committee staffs, and a prohibition on proxy (absentee) voting;
Imposition of term limits on committee chairmen and the Speaker;
Requirements for open meetings and better reporting of committee action,
particularly in the appropriations process;
Greater fairness in the rules process governing consideration of major
legislation.
 <P>    Even after their historic first day, House leaders should remain
committed to reform by pursuing:

Further staff and budget cuts;<P>
Budget process reforms;<P>
Additional truth in voting measures;<P>
A term limits constitutional amendment.<P>
     The historic changes that the new Republican majority will make in
the rules of the House of Representatives on January 4 should not be an
end, but a beginning to the process of reforming Congress. Further reforms
in Congress's structure and in the budget process are particularly critical.
Many steps in these areas will require joint action by the House and Senate,
making them impossible to address on the first day of the congressional
session. The new House and Senate leaders should quickly begin working
together to address these needed reforms. Ultimately, Members of Congress
must not forget that a term limits constitutional amendment is the true
measure of congressional reform.<P>

<h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES</h4>
<i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.<br>
F.R. Duplantier<br>
October 5, 1995<br></i><hr>

<h2>People for the American Way</h2></center>

People for the American Way is pulling out all the stops in its fight 
against the so-called Religious Right. That's because the radical left 
knows the tide is turning against them.<p>

The Capital Research Center describes People for the American Way, the 
tax-exempt organization founded in 1980 by television producer Norman 
Lear, as "the largest and most influential group seeking to counter the 
Religious Right in America." PAW's donors include big names in the 
entertainment industry, the National Education Association and several 
other unions, and numerous tax-exempt foundations.<p>

The group's avowed objectives are to uphold church and state separation, 
maintain prohibitions against school prayer, and provide "technical and 
legal assistance" to combat "censorship" of school books. "During the 
1992-93 school year, PAW says it documented 347 cases in which a 
parent, school official, or church group demanded that library [books] or 
textbooks be removed or restricted -- up from 229 cases the year before." 
According to PAW, "religious conservatives or members of organizations 
described as 'Far Right' . . . were involved in 90 percent of the cases and 
were believed to have inspired another 18 percent."<p>

A PAW report on the conservative impact on school boards during the 
1992-93 school year documents "the emergence of a grassroots 
revolution that threatens to undermine an already challenged American 
public education system." PAW alleges that the Right "is now in the 
initial stages of a community-by-community battle to gain control over 
school boards through the ballot box."<p>

People for the American Way thinks that the exercise by parents of their 
democratic prerogative is truly sinister! PAW argues that it is unfair for 
candidates of the Religious Right to win elections without revealing 
"their full agenda for the schools." PAW ignores the fact that such 
"stealth tactics" were the very means liberals used to establish their 
current hegemony. PAW warns that the so-called, Religious Right is no 
longer confined to the "Bible belt," noting that in 1993 "Religious Right 
candidates won school board elections in at least 12 states." According to 
PAW's count, roughly a third of the 243 candidates it identified as 
belonging to the Religious Right "won primaries or general election 
campaigns" in 1993.<p>

For years now education officials have acted as "change agents," 
insinuating into the public school system policies and curricula offensive 
to parents with traditional values. Gradually, the hidden objectives are 
becoming known, and parents are fighting back. The education 
establishment grows increasingly hostile as it tries to protect its control 
over children's minds. The attacks against the Religious Right, 
orchestrated by People for the American Way, are going to get shriller. 
But the shriller they get, the more cause there is for optimism; for that 
shrillness is a reflection of the insecurity felt by members of a public 
school monopoly facing exposure. They know that the secret victories 
they have achieved over the past several decades will not withstand an 
open battle.<p>

<h2>College Education</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
The National Association of Scholars has just published a devastating 
report on the dumbing down of 50 top undergraduate colleges and 
universities in America.
</i></blockquote>
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Comparing the years 1914, 1939, 1964, and 1993, the National 
Association of Scholars concludes that students at our country's elite 
institutions of higher learning no longer receive a comprehensive 
liberal-arts education. The universities have simply purged from the 
curriculum many of the required courses that provide the historical, 
cultural, political and scientific basics of our society.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The number of mandatory courses plummeted from an average of 10 in 
1914 to fewer than three in 1993. Students are rarely required now to 
take basic survey courses in key disciplines. Few of today's courses 
require prerequisites, thereby diminishing the cumulative impact of a 
college education. In 1914, universities offered an average of only 23 
courses per institution that did not require a prerequisite course; 
today, the number is 582. Only 12 percent of universities now require 
a thesis or comprehensive examination to get a bachelor's degree. As 
late as 1964, more than half of universities did.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Few colleges teach writing or mathematics any more, a fact that is 
evidenced by the appalling number of graduates who can neither draft a 
coherent memo nor keep a basic ledger. In 1914, nearly all 
universities had required courses in English composition; today, it's 
only 36 percent. In 1914, 82 percent of the universities had 
traditional mathematics requirements; now, only 12 percent do. As late 
as 1964, more than 70 percent of the institutions required at least 
one course in the natural sciences; that figure has now fallen to only 
34 percent. In 1914, 90 percent of our elite colleges required 
history; now only one of the 50 schools has a required history course. 
Literature courses were required at 75 percent of the institutions in 
1914; today, not one of the "best" institutions has a literature 
requirement.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Meanwhile, the total number of courses offered at undergraduate 
institutions has quintupled since 1914. That quantity, unfortunately, 
does not translate into quality. The majority of these additional 
courses feature arcane subjects of interest, and profit, only to the 
dilettantes who offer them. Many courses don't even offer college-
level material, but seek instead to remedy the many deficiencies of 
the average high school education. Sometimes these courses are called 
"remedial," but the institutions prefer euphemisms such as "second 
tier" and "sub-freshman." Unheard of prior to 1939, today such make-up 
courses are offered in 70 percent of the elite universities, and most 
of them award college credit.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The National Association of Scholars concludes that our best colleges 
and universities now turn out graduates who are painfully ignorant of 
western civilization and heritage. They do not learn the highlights of 
our history, they do not understand the implications of our political 
and economic systems, and they cannot appreciate our literary and 
artistic legacies. Because our colleges have failed us, we now risk 
losing the common bond that unites us as Americans.

<h2>Kinsey Part I</h2>


<i><blockquote>
<p>
Sex education programs in schools across America are based in part on studies published by Alfred Kinsey in 1948 and 1953 called Sexual Behavior in the Human Male and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female.  
</I></Blockquote>
<p> 
Representative Steve Stockman (R-1X) thinks the world-famous Kinsey Institute in Bloomington, Indiana should be investigated for possible fraud and criminal child abuse. Late last year, Stockman introduced the Child Protection and Ethics in Education Act of 1995 ( H.R. 2749), calling for a General Accounting Office probe of the government funded  studies of human sexuality conducted by Alfred Kinsey   
nearly 50 years ago. If the GAO concludes that "criminal wrongdoing or scientific fraud" did occur in the preparation of the Kinsey Reports, then "any organization or school [that] uses these studies, without indicating the unethical and unscientific nature, will be denied federal funds for any educational purpose."  
<p>
Congressman Stockman tried to determine on his own the source for the data in Table 34, a chart in the original Kinsey Report that purported to measure the sexual responsiveness of infants, children, and teenagers. His efforts turned into a wild goose chase. "First, I was told by the Kinsey Institute  that the data were compiled from the notes of a single pedophile who is deceased," recalls Stockman. "But, according to Kinsey's book, the table was composed from the observations of 'several adult males who have had sexual contacts with younger boys."'  
<p>
Either way, Kinsey's research into the sexuality of children -- upon which professionals rely heavily for their understanding of normal childhood development -- apparently rests on the testimony of at least one sexual deviant. "This indicates that the basis of sex education in America is a study of the systematic molestation of children as young as four months old," says Stockman. The only other alternative is that Table 34 is a complete fabrication. "Other scholars who worked  with Kinsey in the early '50s have said that the numbers . . . were made up -- fraudulent research," he observes. Stockman  says the purpose of the Child Protection and Ethics in Education Act is "to determine to what extent the United States Government funded these fraudulent and criminal studies and what liabilities should be assessed."  
<p>
In a letter to his colleagues in Congress, Stockman pointed out that the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States (known as SIECUS) bases its own widely-used and often-imitated sex-ed programs on the studies of Alfred Kinsey. "These texts," he observed, "form the basis of sex education in the public schools of America." Stockman urged his fellow Congressmen to view a videotape called The Children of Table 34, produced by the Family Research Council. The 30-minute expose charges that data recorded in the Kinsey Reports are based on "systematic molestation of infants and children." The documentary concludes that the evidence of fraud and ethical violations in Kinsey's research  warrants an inquiry into the Kinsey Institute.

<H3><I> CHANGING THE SUBJECT AT THE U.S.-JAPAN SUMMIT: 
SECURITY IS NOW MORE IMPORTANT THAN TRADE </I></H3>

By Seth Cropsey<br>
Backgrounder Update #215<BR>
 2/9/94
<P>
(Updating Asian Studies Center Backgrounder No. 124, "Reshaping the
National Spirit of Japan, June 26, 1992.")
<P>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>

     Prime Minister of Japan Morihiro Hosokawa arrives in Washington
this week for an important trade summit meeting with President Bill
Clinton on February 11. Clinton's objective is to force Japan to
increase its purchase of such American manufactured products as
automobiles, auto parts, and telecommunications equipment. 
<P>
     Japan agreed last year to buy $19 billion of U.S.-made auto parts
by the end of March 1995. Clinton now wants to expand this commitment
by approximately 20 percent for each of the next three to four years.
The Clinton negotiators also want Japan to increase its imports of
foreign telecommunications equipment to the approximate levels of
other major industrialized Western nations, or about 25 percent. Japan
now imports only five percent of its telecommunications equipment.
<P>
     For the American service industry, which in 1992 enjoyed a multi-
billion trade surplus with Japan, the Clinton trade negotiators are
trying to calculate indices by which to measure foreign penetration of
Japan's market. Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration effort to
manage trade is ill-advised with regard to the politics and economies
of both America and Japan.
<P>
     Instead of trying to force Japan to buy a specified amount of
goods and services from particular sectors of the American economy,
Bill Clinton should use the summit to reach agreement with Japan's
Prime Minister on the biggest challenge that today should unite
Washington and Tokyo: North Korea's nuclear weapons program. America
and Japan have a greater immediate interest in agreeing on how to face
this threat together than they do in disagreeing over trade. 
<P>
     As Director of Central Intelligence James Woolsey told the Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence last month, "North Korea could
already have produced enough plutonium for at least one nuclear
weapon. North Korean [builds] 1000 kilometer range missiles which can
be made capable of carrying nuclear weapons.... Potentially at risk is
most of North East Asia.... "  
<P>
     Japan falls within range of these missiles. As America's second
largest trading partner and the keystone of the U.S. military's
stabilizing presence in Asia, Japan's security is far more important
to America than the trade issues which divide the two nations.

<P>
BOTH JAPAN AND AMERICA ARE CHANGING
<P>
     Although the theme of Bill Clinton's campaign and presidency has
been change, his Administration's policy toward Japan has overlooked
the significant changes that have taken place in both countries since
Clinton was inaugurated.
<P>
     The U.S. in now clearly in the midst of an economic recovery.
Housing starts, automobile sales, consumer confidence, and factory
orders are all up. Were it not for a change in the reporting of
federal statistics, unemployment figures for January would show the
decrease that has characterized them steadily for the past twelve
months. Indeed, so strong is economic activity that, to prevent the
possibility of overheating and inflation, the Chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, last week announced an increase in the
prime rate for the first time in five years.
<P>
     Economic Funk. Japan, by contrast, is in a real economic funk.
The Nikkei Stock Average wallows around in the high teens, less than
half the 39,915 figure reached on the last day of December 1989, which
marked the high-water mark of the Japanese bubble. The long-term value
of commercial property in Tokyo, according to Kenichi Ohmae, director
of McKinsey & Co.'s Japan operations, is less than 70 percent of where
it stood five years ago. Ill economic omens arrive daily: In the
autumn of 1993, Tokyo area department stores' sales fell more than 10
percent from the previous year and registered their twentieth monthly
drop. 
<P>
     Last month, Japan's Labor ministry summoned executive officers of
a machine tool manufacturer, the Okuma Corporation, to justify why the
company's mandatory retirement age had been lowered from 60 to 56. The
company wanted to make ends meet, and the ministry was trying to
sustain retirement standards that were set in better times. According
to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association, the country's auto
production fell by 10.2 percent in 1993, the largest single decline in
46 years. The government's Economic Planning Agency warns that a
recovery may not occur until the middle of 1995.
<P>
     The political landscape has changed, too. Most important, the
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which had ruled Japan for 38 years,
lost power in July. It was replaced by a coalition headed by current
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. He came to power calling both for an
end to the widespread corruption that has characterized Japanese
politics for decades, and for political reform that would offer the
Japanese people real choices in elections.      
<P>
     At the root of Hosokawa's political reforms are measures that
will increase democracy by ensuring that each representative district
elects a single member to the national legislature. Under the old
system, the election of several members from each district suppressed
political differences, and encouraged bribes as the principal means to
influence elections. The reforms also will reduce the excessive power
of rice growers who, until now, have commanded three times as much
representation in the Diet as city-dwellers. 
<P>
   The LDP's fall from power, and Prime Minister Hosokawa's success
in attacking corruption and increasing democracy do not change Japan
overnight. They do not in the twinkling of an eye make Japan
hospitable to foreign products. But they do indicate a new direction
for Japan following its successful fifty-year post-World War II effort
to rebuild the nation into a great commercial power. 
<P>
     Problem of Success. Japan's problem today is its success: the
government's mercantilist policies encouraged its people to put their
hard-earned money into savings, and it assisted Japan's great
companies in accumulating tremendous wealth. But the same policies
also made the prices of Hondas and Toyotas cheaper for Chicagoans by
making them more expensive for the citizens of Osaka. An unholy
alliance between entrenched bureaucrats and big business kept low-cost
American rice out of Japan to succor the powerful domestic rice lobby.
And the same cozy relationship between powerful bureaucrats and LDP
politicians also drove up the price of Tokyo real estate and enabled
Japanese industry to go on its famous international dumping
expeditions of the l980s.
<P>
     The Japanese people have had enough of these policies, and those
who live in the 45 percent of homes that lack flush toilets would like
to improve their lives. Prime Minister Hosokawa's predecessor, Kiichi
Miyazawa, who fell from power when the LDP was defeated, knew that
Japan was ready for change when he came to office in November 1991. In
his maiden speech, he told the Diet that he wanted to make Japan "a
lifestyle superpower." But Miyazawa was not the politician to take the
long steps needed to make that happen.
<P>
     Hosokawa is taking these steps. But as the head of a fractious
coalition that includes Japan's unrepentant Socialists, he is hanging
on to political life by the fringe of a summer kimono. Last week, for
the second time in as many weeks, his government narrowly survived a
crucial parliamentary test. Hosokawa's proposal to cut individual
income taxes to stimulate the economy nearly resulted in the
government's fall last week when the Socialists threatened to walk
out.
<P>

BOLSTERING HOSOKAWA'S REFORMS
<P>
     The Clinton Administration is trying to take advantage of Japan's
political upheaval and economic weakness to force a regimen of managed
trade on Tokyo. This is a major mistake in the Administration's
handling of foreign affairs. But, unlike in Bosnia, Somalia, and
Haiti, the problem is not weakness. It is ignorance and inexperience. 
<P>
     Hosokawa's efforts to change Japan offer the best hope that
Japanese consumers rather than its bureaucrats will start to shape
Tokyo's policy. Consumers do not want to pay four times as much for
domestic rice as they would for imported rice. Hosokawa ended Japan's
ban on rice imports in December. And, as Bill Clinton himself noted in
a speech last July at Waseda University in Tokyo, "the average
Japanese family pays more than twice as much of [its] income for food
as the average American family." Japanese consumers want to see the
amount of money they have to spend on food and other goods come down.
Prime Minister Hosokawa's reforms are empowering Japan's consumers.
<P>
     Bill Clinton and his advisors should understand the intention of
Hosokawa's policy. Clinton's policy should seek to strengthen
Hosokawa, and ensure his success. A prime minister who returns to
Japan having been forced to buy specified amounts of particular
American products will be weaker. He will find it more difficult to
survive and continue to make the changes that promise more jobs for
Americans who export to Japan, and a better standard of living for the
Japanese. 
<P>
CHANGING THE SUBJECT AT THE SUMMIT
<P>
     The most diplomatic way to get out of a bad situation is to
change the subject. Clinton can steer clear of the situation his
advisors have placed him in with Japan by changing the subject from
managed trade to the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear weapons
program. There is excellent reason to shift the focus of the February
11 meeting to this serious issue.
<P>
     The most important reason: Washington and Tokyo have a clear and
shared interest in preventing Northeast Asia from embarking on a
nuclear arms race. North Korea's ability to threaten Japan with
nuclear bombardment would pressure Japan to consider building its own
atomic weapons program -- especially if because of deteriorating trade
relations, Tokyo fears the loss of American defense protection. A
nuclear-arming Japan would dismay the Asian nations that still
remember Japanese aggression in World War II; it also would induce
China to redouble its effort to expand its defenses, add to the
pressure on South Korea to develop its own unconventional weapons, and
initiate similar pressures in such places as the Republic of China on
Taiwan. 
<P>
     All of this, in turn, would hurt the entire region's rosy
economic future. Money spent on weapons does create jobs. But it also
generates legions of defense procurement bureaucrats and forces
otherwise competitive private companies into a debilitating dependence
on government work and military contracts. Such an occurrence in Asia
would take the economic wind out of the western Pacific rim's sails.
And, the U.S. would suffer too as the fastest growing market for its
goods and services shifted its attention to weapons, as well as the
means to deliver and defend against them.
<P>
     Bill Clinton should use this week's summit with Morihiro Hosokawa
to discuss America and Japan's common interest in addressing North
Korea's nuclear ambitions. Specifically, Clinton should:
<P>
Urge Hosokawa quietly to cut off as much as possible the flow of cash
from people of Korean ancestry living in Japan to their relatives in
impoverished North Korea. 
<P>
     This infusion of hard currency provides North Korea with at least
$600 million per year. Its unpublicized reduction would be a signal of
Japanese resolve to North Korean ruler Kim Il-Sung that he, in turn,
can respond to without appearing to lose face;
<P>
Discuss before U.N. action takes place what measures the U.S. and
Japan need to take if international pressure fails to open North Korea
to international inspection of its nuclear facilities;
<P>
Conclude the summit with a smile, a handshake, and a joint statement
that tells the world that the U.S. and Japan stand together as allies
in the face of the serious problem raised by North Korea's nuclear
weapons program.
<P>
     By acting like statesmen, both leaders will appear as statesmen.
Hosokawa will be able to go home without having been weakened by
submitting to a managed trade regimen. And Clinton, having
strengthened Hosokawa so that he can continue his reforms, will
advance America's interest in a Japan that welcomes American products.
The rest of Asia is likely to benefit as well: a strong U.S.-Japan
relationship is the region's most powerful bulwark against whatever
danger the future holds.
<P>

<title>U.N. Leaks U.S. Intelligence -- Duplantier</title></head>

<h2>U.N. Leaks U.S. Intelligence</h2></center>
<P>

 
President Clinton has taken steps to ensure that the security of U.S.  
classified intelligence information is never compromised again by the  
likes of CIA mole Aldrich Ames. Leaks resulting from lax security  
practices at the United Nations, however, don't seem to concern him. 
  <P>
"A new politicized management team has been hired to shake up, purge,  
and otherwise discipline the CIA's covert operations directorate," reports  
Frank Gaffney of the Center for Security Policy. "This is being done in  
the name of preventing such disastrous compromises of U.S. intelligence"  
as those perpetrated by Aldrich Ames. "Yet, there appears to be one  
important exception to this policy," says Gaffney. "If the compromise  
occurs as the predictable result of sharing intelligence with the United  
Nations, it seems the Clinton administration is inclined to regard that as  
an acceptable cost of doing business." 
                     <P>
Sharing intelligence information with the United Nations can be risky  
indeed. Gaffney points out that UN personnel in Somalia were "rather  
casual about safeguarding classified information supplied by the United  
States. In fact, had it not been for a chance discovery by a U.S. diplomat  
literally turning out the lights as the UN bailed out of Mogadishu,  
sensitive data -- some of which reportedly identified the Somali sources --  
would have been compromised." 
                          <P>
This near-disaster was not unprecedented. "There have been at least four  
incidents in which the United Nations has breached the security of  
classified documents provided by the United States," reports Gaffney.  
Until recently, in fact, "there was no agreement in place obliging the  
United Nations to provide for the protection of intelligence supplied by  
the United States." Gaffney says the Clinton administration seems to  
believe that "it would be demeaning to the Secretary-General even to ask  
for such an agreement." 
                              <P>
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee amended the Foreign Relations  
Revitalization Act so that it "blocks the provision of U.S. intelligence  
information to the United Nations, its employees. or any associated  
organization unless mechanisms 'have been formally agreed to and  
implemented by the United Nations for protecting intelligence methods  
and sources."' The United Nations would thus be required to "adopt  
background investigation and security violation investigation procedures  
comparable to those employed by the United States government; agree to  
protect U.S.-provided intelligence in a similar manner; immediately  
notify Washington if there has been a security breach . . . and cooperate  
in U.S. Law enforcement investigations [of such breaches]; and ensure  
that U.S. classified data is not given to nationals ineligible for access to  
such information." 
                 <P>
Despite its boisterous attempt to prevent any further damage to U.S.  
intelligence efforts by double agents, the Clinton administration  
strenuously opposes efforts to protect U.S. intelligence from treachery or  
incompetence inside the UN. The lesson to be learned from the Ames  
affair, according to Frank Gaffney, is that intelligence sources "are highly  
perishable and, once exposed, are gone for good." He warns that  
"undisciplined, indiscriminate sharing of classified information with the  
United Nations" is sheer folly.

<title>GATT & NAFTA: The After-Effects -- Duplantier</title></head>

<center><h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES </h4>

<hr>
<h2>GATT & NAFTA: The After-Effects</h2></center>
<P>
 
The North American Free Trade Agreement (known as NAFTA) and the  
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (called GATT) are wreaking  
havoc on the U.S. economy, but it's not too late to save our sovereignty. 
   <P>
The American Coalition for Competitive Trade (known as ACCT) plans  
this month to file the first of several legal challenges to the NAFTA and  
GATT treaties and the $53 million bailout of Mexico. The Coalition is  
determined to block the implementation of these sovereignty-usurping  
treaties before they cause any more damage. Former U.S. Customs  
Commissioner William von Raab has signed on with the ACCT Lawyers  
Committee supervising the legal challenges, which is headed by  
America's Future Chairman Robert Morris. 
                       <P>
Two years ago, at an ACCT conference on NAFTA, von Raab predicted  
that passage of the trade agreement linking the Mexican and American  
economies would lead to "chaos on the border," and so it has. "Trucks are  
rolling across the Rio Grande by the thousands," ACCT reports, "many of  
them loaded with cocaine and other illegal drugs now being sold on the  
streets and in the school yards all across our country." Thomas Considine,  
director of the federal government's Drug Enforcement Administration.  
advised a Senate committee in August that drug gangs in Mexico could  
eventually rival the ruthless ring now operating in Colombia. According  
to the Washington Times, these gangs routinely rob Southern Pacific  
freight trains "carrying millions of dollars in consumer goods" hecho en  
Mexico and destined for the U.S. market. 
                                  <P>
A Congressional Joint Economic Committee reported that "Mexican  
imports to this country cost the United States 137,000 jobs" in the nine  
months following passage of NAFTA. Imports from Mexico have soared  
since then, perhaps tripling the job-loss figure. "Trade with Mexico has  
been a big factor in the expanding U.S. trade deficit this year," says trade  
correspondent Richard Lawrence in the August 1 8th Journal of  
Commerce. In the first six months of this year, "the U.S. posted an $8.5  
billion merchandise deficit in Mexican trade, compared with a $1 .1  
billion surplus a year earlier." 
                    <P>
A study by Vanderbilt University documents some of the specific  
consequences of NAFTA: tomato production down 25 percent in Florida,  
Scott Paper Company cutting more than 10,000 jobs worldwide prior to  
opening multimillion-dollar plants in Mexico, the virtual elimination of  
the apparel industry in the United States. Syndicated columnist Sam  
Francis says the impact of NAFTA can be measured in "the destruction of  
whole lives, careers and lifetime hopes . . . as plants relocate,  
communities vanish, neighborhoods stagnate and opportunities for  
Middle Americans gurgle away forever in the backwash of NAFTA's  
sweep through the American economy and society." 
                         <P>
The American Coalition for Competitive Trade is determined to  
document the true cost of NAFTA and GATT and to see that these  
treaties are revoked before that cost soars even higher. Their efforts may  
determine whether or not America remains a land of opportunity.

<h2>Welfare Makes The Problem Worse</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>Welfare spending in New York City has exacerbated the Big Apple's 
monumental social problems. What's the solution? Surely not more spending!</i></blockquote>
<P> 

"Over the last 30 years, New York City and State have devoted an increasing 
share of their revenues to the most dysfunctional members of society," 
writes Heather MacDonald in the Winter issue of the Manhattan Institute's 
City Journal, "and now social service spending constitutes the largest 
share of both city and state budgets. Yet, as spending grew, so did the 
social problems that spending was supposed to solve." A reasonable person 
might have concluded that throwing more money at the problems would 
probably do more harm than good. The official response, however, was quite 
the opposite. "The government," notes MacDonald, "responding by adding more 
programs." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Heather MacDonald concludes that "New York City's enormous commitment to 
social welfare spending has not stemmed social breakdown." If anything, it 
has made matters worse. "Social service spending has sucked out of the 
private economy capital that could have been used to create jobs, the best 
mechanism for ending poverty," says MacDonald. "But, in response to 
inner-city poverty, welfare advocates call for further social service 
spending, thereby accelerating the flight of business from the city." In 
addition to stifling job creation, welfare programs also discourage the 
formation of traditional families -- which are also a time-tested means of 
overcoming poverty. "The two-parent family is all but extinct in some 
neighborhoods, rendered superfluous by welfare's subsidy for illegitimacy," 
says MacDonald. "The resulting increase in juvenile delinquency, truancy, 
and teen pregnancy brings in more social services, which in turn further 
erode the incentives for personal responsibility." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Social service programs "reward dysfunctional behavior and subordinate the 
well-being of children to dubious ideology," says MacDonald. "Families 
create sound individuals by imposing discipline and moral values on 
children. Even if a government program could do this, these programs do 
not; for years, imposing values has been anathema to social workers, who 
studiously avoid making judgments about the 'life-style choices' of their 
clients." MacDonald argues that social workers confuse "moral deficit with 
material need." The more irresponsible a person is, the more financial 
assistance he receives. "Just as the birth of illegitimate children 
provides the mother with an income, so will deplorable child-rearing bring 
her a benefit." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
These perverse incentives are the direct result of "contemporary social 
worker's refusal to make moral judgments," says Heather MacDonald. "Rather 
than taking children or adults away from destructive environments, the 
reigning service ethic dictates that they remain 'in the community' and 'in 
the family' for treatment." Such wishful thinking ignores the fact that 
"usually there is no real community to go back to. Treating a juvenile 
delinquent in the war-torn environment that produced him does not look like 
a recipe for success." MacDonald argues that, when social workers respond 
to "unsustainable ways of life" as though they were "short-term crises," 
their efforts are doomed to failure.

<title>Duplantier: Myths About Crime -- 03/14/96

<h2>
Myths About Crime
</h2>
<blockquote><i>
  
False ideas can have tragic consequences, say two respected criminologists, who argue that false ideas   
about crime have made the crime problem worse.  
</BLOCKQUOTE></I>
<P>  
 
"For the last quarter-century, a network of anti-incarceration, pro-prisoner analysts, activists, lawyers,   
lobbyists, journalists, and judges has perpetuated a number of false ideas about crime and punishment in   
the United States," say criminologists Charles Logan and John DiIulio. In an essay titled "Ten Deadly   
Myths About Crime and Punishment in the U.S.," published in a new book called Criminal Justice: The   
Legal System vs. Individual Responsibility, Logan and DiIulio argue that "the consequences of these false   
ideas have been quite tragic indeed." They've made it easier for criminals to indulge in crime, and they've   
concentrated crime "in economically distressed inner-city neighborhoods, inviting the criminal predators   
of these areas to repeatedly victimize their struggling underclass neighbors."  
  


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

One of the most enduring myths about crime in the United States is that it is caused by poverty. Logan and   
DiIulio report that many academic criminologists believe the myth that "capitalism produces pockets of   
poverty, inequality, and unemployment, which then foster crime. The solution [according to this view] is   
government intervention to provide jobs, stimulate the economy, and reduce poverty and other social ills."   
The truth, as it turns out, is quite the opposite. Poverty does not cause crime; crime, on the other hand,   
does cause poverty.  
  


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;



Logan and DiIulio note that "inner city areas where crime is rampant have tremendous potential for   
economic growth, given their infrastructure of railways, highways, electric power, water systems, and   
large supply of available labor. There is every reason for these areas to be wealthy," they say, "and, indeed,   
many of them have been rich in the past. But crime takes a terrible toll on physical, fiscal, and human   
capital, making it difficult to accumulate wealth and break out of the cycle of poverty. Criminals steal and   
destroy property, drive away customers and investors, reduce property values, and depreciate the quality of   
life in a neighborhood. Businesses close and working families move away, leaving behind a vacuum of   
opportunity." Inner cities need "physical protection and security" to make them viable again; instead, they   
get "economic intervention."  
  


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;



Another myth about crime in the United States is that prisons are filled with "petty offenders who should   
not be there." Logan and DiIulio say it isn't so. They cite data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics   
showing that "U.S. prison populations consist overwhelmingly of violent and repeat offenders."  
  

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A third myth concerns the physical conditions within our nation's prisons. "There are two popular and   
competing images of American prisons," report Logan and Dilulio. "In one image, all or most prisons are   
hell holes. In the other image, all or most prisons are country clubs. Each image fits some prisons," they   
concede. "But the vast majority of prisons in the U.S. today are neither hell holes nor country clubs." They   
are what they're supposed to be: an effective means for isolating and punishing the criminal element.

Duplantier</a> 
<br>
January 17, 1996<br></i><hr><h2>Musical Madness</h2>
</center>
<P>
["Popular musical messages contribute to an increasingly violent and 
morally bankrupt society. "]
<P>
In a new report called Bringing Out the Worst in Us: The Frightening 
Truth About Violence, the Media, and Our Youth, Focus on the Family 
research manager Robert Waliszewski argues that "musical messages are 
capable of planting dangerous ideas in the minds of young people or 
fueling those which already exist." He provides samples of some of the 
more offensive rap and heavy-metal lyrics and cites documented accounts 
of the violent crimes they've inspired. Although there is much evidence 
that "a strong correlation exists between a steady diet of mayhem and the 
urge to act on it," Waliszewski concedes that "no one knows what the 
cumulative effect will be when a young person consumes a steady diet of 
violent music."
<P>
Musically inspired sexual assaults and murders are just the tip of the 
iceberg. "For every teenager who makes the 6 o'clock news by carrying 
out an act of violence, there are thousands more whose values are being 
fashioned subtly through disturbing musical messages," says 
Waliszewski. "They're learning that demeaning women is not only 
acceptable, but [even] preferable to treating women with respect. They're 
hearing accounts that glorify serial killers and praise drive-by shootings. 
They're being bombarded with the messages that parents and other 
authorities are not worthy of respect; that life revolves around drugs, 
money, and perverse forms of sexual activity -- to be obtained by force, if 
necessary."
<P>
The content of contemporary music is qualitatively different from that of 
even the recent past. "Three decades ago, not one popular song 
encouraged robbery, rape, murder, assaults, or using weapons to settle 
disputes," says Waliszewski. "In today's popular music, all these themes 
can be found -- and worse! Nothing is taboo. Unfortunately, America's 
streets and neighborhoods increasingly reflect this fact. What's more, 
since violent lyrics are a relatively new phenomenon, no one knows the 
results of raising a generation on this type of musical diet. In addition, 
teenagers have greater access to (and are listening to) far more music than 
they have in past generations." Waliszewski notes that, by the end of high 
school, the average teenager has listened to more than 10,000 hours of 
rock music.
<P>
Violent crime increased by over 500 percent during the three decades 
ending in 1990. There may be a host of factors contributing to this social 
pathology, but "violence in the media" is certainly one of them. "Music 
industry insiders often shirk responsibility by saying their music reflects 
society but does not impact it," Waliszewski observes. "Some music 
industry insiders have argued that, as performers and 'actors on the stage,' 
musicians cannot be held responsible for their fans' criminal behavior. 
Their anti-social messages are not to be taken seriously because...they 
don't actually mean what they say."  Such claims are disingenuous at best. 
Whether they know what they're doing or not, the purveyors of this 
madness should be held accountable for the damage they've done to an 
entire generation of young Americans.

[They're convinced they can solve all the world's problems if we just do 
what they say. No matter how messed up their own lives are, no matter 
how much they disrupt the lives of others, those dauntless do-gooders 
never stop believing that they know what's best for the rest of us.]
<p>
The do-gooders jump from cause to cause, dictating solutions that betray 
ignorance of the problem at hand and total disregard for the consequences 
of their proposals. They don't seem to care whether their policies and 
practices really work or not. Why, then, do they do what they do? <p>Don't 
let their lofty rhetoric fool you. What do-gooders are really after, says 
syndicated columnist Thomas Sowell of the Hoover Institution, is "ego 
gratification " By making us feel bad, they make themselves feel good.
<p>
Sowell cites many examples. "Recycling, drug education, sex education, 
animal rights, gun control, multiculturalism. environmentalism and 
innumerable other social crusades produce far more benefits to the 
crusaders than for society,. In many cases, they make society worse off," 
says Sowell. "Studies have repeatedly shown recycling does more harm 
than good, and much evidence suggests that the actual consequences of 
both drug education and sex education are nil, at best."
<p>
Do-gooders don't care if recycling causes more ecological damage than 
the original manufacturing process. They don't care if drug and sex 
education programs encourage experimentation. They don't care if gun 
control increases violence. They don't care if multiculturalism 
exacerbates racial tensions. Do-gooders don't care how things really 
work, or what the truth is. Their sole concern is to "make a statement." As 
Sowell points out. "there is no need to check out facts if the real point is 
moral preening."
<p>
Do-gooders have plagued mankind with their coercive correctives for 
hundreds of years. "In the l 9th century, housing reform in the cities was 
the big crusade," says Sowell, "especially in the slums occupied by 
recently arrived immigrants. Though many immigrants lived in crowded 
quarters in run-down neighborhoods because they had no choice, others 
doubled up and scrimped to save money to send to their families back in 
the old country. Some saved to prepare for a better future."
<p>
It's too bad that the do-gooders couldn't leave well enough alone, but it's 
in their nature to interfere. They felt compelled to save those poor souls 
from themselves. "Reformers decided that people needed more space per 
person and wrote that into laws, thereby raising the cost of housing to the 
immigrants," says Sowell. "People were forced to spend their money not 
on what their own top priorities were, but on what the anointed 
busybodies decided was best for them."
<p>
Such meddling has gone on for millennia. Sowell understands the 
syndrome and accepts it as a fact of life, observing that "the real question 
is not why some people treat public policy as exercises in ego 
gratification. The question is why the rest of us listen to them so 
gullibly."

<h2>Global Taxes</h2></center><P> 

[The fat cats at the United Nations are tired of having to rely on the 
generosity of member countries. They now want to bypass these 
sovereign governments and tax the people of the world directly!]
<P>
The calls for a global tax to finance the operations of the United Nations 
seem to be coming from all quarters. The so-called Independent 
Commission on Population and Quality of Life argues that the United 
Nations should be able to tax aviation traffic and freight, aviation fuel, 
ocean freight and cruises, telecommunications frequencies, 
communications satellites, international postal items, and trade in goods 
and services. At the UN World Summit for Social Development, held in 
Copenhagen earlier this year, Clinton appointee James Speth, head of 
the UN Development Program, proposed a global tax on speculative 
movements of international funds, the consumption of non-renewable 
energy, environmental permits, and the arms trade. The Clinton 
Administration is pushing for ratification of the UN Convention on the 
Law of the Sea, which would set up an International Seabed Authority to 
collect fees and royalties imposed on American mining firms.
<P>
James Tobin, 1981 Nobel Prize winner in Economics, has called for a 
tax on spot transactions in foreign exchange. Tobin predicts that "the 
revenue potential is immense, over $1.5 trillion a year." Needless to say, 
UN bureaucrats are enthusiastic about the possibilities of this new 
"Tobin tax."
<P>
The Commission on Global Governance argues that "it is time for a 
consensus on global taxation for servicing the needs of the global 
neighborhood." The Commission, which is supported by government and 
foundation funding, calls for taxes on flight-lanes, sea lanes, and ocean 
fishing areas. The Commission claims that "the idea of safeguarding and 
managing the global commons, particularly those related to the physical 
environment, is now widely accepted."
<P>
The Worldwatch Institute calls for a global tax to finance "the transition 
to a sustainable society -- including environmental programs, social 
initiatives, and peacekeeping efforts." The Oxfam Poverty Report 
proclaims that "international aid should be seen as a financial 
entitlement, and as part of a compact between citizens in the industrial 
and developing worlds." The Ford Foundation wants the UN to have 
Special Drawing Rights from the International Monetary Fund. This 
"levy on the utilization of the global commons" would allow the UN to 
put the squeeze on American taxpayers without going through our 
Congress. The World Federalist Association, headed by former 
presidential candidate John Anderson, recommends UN taxes on 
international travel and postal service.
<P>
The United Nations has no right or authority whatsoever to tax people, 
businesses, or transactions, but that won't stop the UN's greedy 
international bureaucrats from trying to usurp such authority. Too much 
of our country's wealth has already been squandered on this subversive 
organization with the cooperation of American leaders. Imagine how the 
UN will bleed us dry when it has its own taxing power and no longer 
needs to ask for our cooperation!

<title>U.N. Ambassadors Owe U.S. $9 Million -- Duplantier</title></head>

<hr>
<h2>U.N. Ambassadors Owe U.S. $9 Million</h2></center>
<P>

United Nations ambassadors and their embassies owe U.S. banks,  
landlords, and merchants more than $9 million, and some have been  
delinquent on their debts for more than two years! 
       <P>
"The problem of diplomatic indebtedness is a matter of significant  
concern," admits UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. "Non- 
payment of just debts reflects badly on the entire diplomatic community  
and tarnishes the image of the United Nations itself." As much as it may  
worry the Secretary-General, the tarnished image of the UN is the least of  
concerns for the unfortunate New York City businesses left holding the  
bag. And some observers would argue that the UN's image isn't nearly as  
tarnished as it deserves to be. 
                     <P>
The debt of the deadbeat diplomats stood at roughly $1 million in 1990,  
but the UN's head-in-the-sand reaction allowed it to multiply by a factor  
of nine in just five years. Moreover, it was only at the insistence of the  
U.S. mission and the City of New York that the debt was made public at  
all. The names of the offending diplomats, however, remained secret. A  
vote by the U.S. Senate at the end of July, withholding $10 million from  
the UN until the names of the diplomats are disclosed, may loosen some  
lips. 
                         <P>
About 80 percent of the $9 million debt is owed to banks and landlords,  
the rest to merchants. According to Boutros-Ghali, 31 missions have  
contributed to the debt, but five alone account for 83 percent of it. Those  
five are rumored to be the African nations of Sierra Leone, Congo, Zaire,  
Liberia, and the Central African Republic. 
                             <P>
"Some missions had not paid rent for two years or more," reports  
Boutros-Ghali. "And a number of residential landlords had either lost  
their property or were at risk of losing it because diplomatic tenants. who  
could not be evicted, would neither pay their rent nor leave the property." 
                                       <P>
New Yorkers don't like getting stiffed, and they're becoming increasingly  
reluctant to offer their goods and services to foreign legates. The billion  
dollars of revenue that the UN supposedly generates for the city each year  
is offset by the cost of services the city must provide, and by the  
aggravation caused by diplomats who flout local laws and abuse their  
privilege of immunity. Americans outside of New York derive no  
economic benefit whatsoever from the UN, but the price we pay as  
taxpayers is substantial, given the status of the United States as the UN's  
largest contributor. The real cost of the UN, however, must be reckoned  
in liberties and lives lost.  
              <P>
Next Wednesday marks the fiftieth anniversary of the ratification of the  
United Nations Charter by the United States Senate on October 25, 1945.  
For the next two weeks, while the major media trumpet the dubious  
achievements of this would-be world government, we'll be reporting  
Behind The Headlines on the myriad ways in which the United Nations  
undermines the sovereignty of our country and threatens the individual  
rights protected by our U.S. Constitution.

<h2> Welfare Reform/PA & OR </h2>


<i><blockquote>


Welfare as we know it is not long for this world. State governments all 
across America are redesigning so-called entitlement programs to make 
sure that they promote self-sufficiency rather than dependence.
</blockquote></i>
 
"Over the past five years a new consensus has emerged in the welfare 
debate," reports Peter Barwick of the Commonwealth Foundation in 
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. "In sharp contrast to the traditional view of 
welfare as an entitlement," says Barwick, "many experts now agree that 
welfare must require work, and that the single most important step that 
can be taken to reform welfare is to impose up-front work requirements 
on all able-bodied recipients. Support for this view comes not from a 
mean-spirited desire to punish welfare recipients, but from a concern to 
help welfare recipients achieve long-term self-sufficiency."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Barwick argues that the welfare reform plan proposed in Pennsylvania 
"falls short in its effort to replace welfare with work. To his credit, the 
Governor insists that welfare recipients work a minimum of twenty hours 
a week in order to receive benefits. Unfortunately, the significance of this 
requirement is vitiated by the fact that it can be satisfied with all sorts of 
substitute activities." Barwick contends that "the Governor's plan gives 
far too much wiggle room to those who would coddle recipients with 
notoriously ineffective and expensive 'education' and 'training' programs, 
or confine them to public-sector make-work programs which fail to give 
participants marketable skills and experience."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


One program that does effectively link welfare to work is Oregon's Full 
Employment model, known as JOBS Plus. This program, Barwick 
explains, "takes the money already allocated for the three largest welfare 
programs -- Aid to Families with Dependent Children, Food Stamps, and 
Unemployment Insurance -- and uses this money instead to subsidize 
jobs for welfare recipients in the private sector." Having proven quite 
successful during its two years as a pilot program, JOBS Plus is now 
being implemented statewide. Barwick notes that Oregon's Full 
Employment model "has been influential in shaping reform in nearly a 
dozen other states to date."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


How does the program work? "Participation in JOBS Plus is required of 
virtually all those who qualify for AFDC, Food Stamps, or 
Unemployment Insurance," observes Peter Barwick. "Participants are 
initially given assistance in finding regular full-time jobs. Those unable 
to find traditional employment are placed in subsidized jobs with private-
sector employers. These employers -- who volunteer for the program and 
have final say in all hiring decisions -- are reimbursed by the state for the 
minimum wage plus the employer's share of Social Security, 
Unemployment Insurance, and Workers' Compensation premiums. 
Subsidized jobs under JOBS Plus are temporary, lasting four months, 
with an optional two-month extension. Employers are free to hire 
satisfactory participants at any time during the process."
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

                                                                           
Poor people crave self-respect just like anyone else. Why not give them a 
chance to achieve it, with welfare reform programs that offer a hand-up 
rather than a handout?

    As the Navy, Congress, and the American people consider the now
notorious "Tailhook" sexual misconduct case, perspective is required.
Twenty-six women have charged that they were sexually assaulted by a
number of officers at last September's annual convention of the
Tailhook Association, the professional organization of naval and
marine aviators. If the charges turn out to be true, then those guilty
should be punished to the fullest extent of the law. Sexual misconduct
represents a grave breach of professionalism and has no place in the
military. However, the uproar surrounding this incident threatens to
harm the effectiveness of the Navy as a fighting force. Promotions of
fleet commanders have been held up, and some in Congress, such as
Representative Patricia Schroeder, the Colorado Democrat, are saying
that the only way to prevent sexual misconduct in the military is to
put women in combat. The result is plummeting morale and disarray in
one of the finest fighting forces the world has ever seen. 
<P>
     This is going too far. Concern about eradicating sexual
misconduct in the military should not be allowed to destroy the very
reason for the military's existence: to protect the security of all
Americans. The culprits, if they are guilty, should be punished, but
the Navy as a whole should not be condemned. Nor should the Navy be
forced to embark on some social experiment -- by putting women in
combat positions, for example -- which not only will do nothing to
stop sexual misconduct, but will also weaken the team cohesiveness and
fighting ability that is the key to winning battles and wars.
<P>
    Tailhook and its Aftermath. The Tailhook saga began last
September in Las Vegas at the convention of the Tailhook Association,
named for the device that stops landing aircraft on the decks of
carriers. Lt. Paula Coughlin says that she was forced to run a
gauntlet down a hotel hallway filled with Navy officers who grabbed
her breasts and tried to remove her clothing. After the Navy
investigated this incident, it was discovered that possibly seventy
officers engaged in such assaults on at least 26 women (fourteen of
them fellow officers) at the Las Vegas convention. The damage from
this incident has been compounded by the presence and alleged
complicity of senior officers, by failures throughout the chain of
command to respond adequately to complaints, and by revelations that
reports of misconduct from earlier conferences were ignored. Navy
Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III resigned on June 26, invoking the
Navy's tradition of bearing full responsibility for the actions of his
men. Although Garrett has not been accused of participating in or
condoning the events at the Tailhook symposium, which he attended, his
handling of the subsequent investigation has been widely criticized.
<P>
    Tailhook and Congress. The initial congressional response to the
Tailhook affair is damaging the morale and combat effectiveness of the
Navy. From June 4 to July 2, Congress delayed the promotions of
roughly 4,500 Navy and Marine officers above the rank of Navy Lt.
Commander and Marine Corps Major in order to determine whether any of
them was involved in the Tailhook incident. Many changes of command
were postponed, including those for the forces responsible for the
waters off Yugoslavia, and the naval base at Guantanamo Bay, where
thousands of Haitian refugees are currently being housed and
processed. The House Appropriations Committee, chaired by Pennsylvania
Democrat John P. Murtha, on June 29 voted to double its original cut
of 5,000 positions from Navy headquarters. Murtha said that this
action was "directly connected to the obstruction and arrogance of the
Navy."
<P>
    Representative Schroeder meanwhile has tried to use the outcry
over Tailhook to bolster her case for placing women in combat
positions. For example, in a June 28 interview on Cable News Network
concerning the Tailhook incident, Schroeder criticized the Navy's
handling of the issue, implying that the real problem was the unequal
treatment of women. She said: "If you're the best for the job and you
want the job, you get it... ," meaning, of course, a combat job. 
<P>
    The idea of Schroeder and other liberal lawmakers seems to be
that the military is the proper place for social engineering, no
different from any other workplace, and perfectly suitable to applying
the feminist principles of absolute equality between the sexes.
Represenative Barbara Boxer, the California Democrat, said in a June
28 television interview concerning the Tailhook controversy: "The
thing about the military is, it has always been a place for
opportunity, first for people of color -- they broke the color barrier
-- and then for women. We have more work to do here and in other
areas, but we've got to make sure we move forward." Moving forward for
Boxer, of course, is putting women into combat. In her view, the
military is more important as a vehicle for curing social ills than as
a fighting machine.
<P>
    Unfortunately, military leaders are showing signs of caving into
the kind of pressure generated by Schroeder and Boxer.
<P>
    Example: When asked whether the problem of misconduct would be
    solved by placing more women on ships, the Chief of Naval
    Operations, Admiral Frank Kelso, replied on June 28 that he was
    waiting for the report of the Presidential Commission on the
    Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces, which is due in
    November. He failed to speak out against placing women in combat.
    In fact, in several appearances before this Commission, not a
    single senior Navy officer has argued strongly against allowing
    women into combat.
<P>
    Example: Rear Admiral Leonard N. Oden, the commander of the Naval
    Training Center in Orlando, Florida, describes an experimental
    co-educational "boot camp" for recruits as incredibly successful.
    Mixed gender recruit platoons are outperforming their all-male
    counterparts in training. But peacetime training is far removed
    from combat. The fact that the sexes have separate sanitary and
    housing facilities, totally impossible to accomplish in combat
    units or aboard combat ships in war, is not made clear.
<P>
    Military Leaders Must Hold the Line. In this emotionally charged
atmosphere, the Navy's leaders must follow three courses of action.
They must: 1) expeditiously but fairly investigate and punish those
who are found guilty in the Tailhook case; 2) continue vigorously
their support for the "zero tolerance" policy toward sexual misconduct
that was developed in 1989; and 3) forcefully explain to Congress and
the American public why women should not be allowed in combat. 
<P>
     Women do not belong in combat for several reasons. There is a
risk that physical standards for combat training will be compromised
if women are allowed into combat positions where those standards are
critically important, such as in the infantry and in special
operations units. There is also the disruption of the military's
mission that will result from the pregnancy of female troops in combat
positions.
<P>
    But most damaging would be the devastating impact on the morale,
team cohesion, and fighting spirit of the armed forces. Combat is a
team activity which brings infantrymen and sailors more closely
together than any other form of work. Some women may indeed be as
physically and mentally capable as men to perform some combat duties,
but what matters more in combat is not individual ability, but
teamwork. The presence of women in combat units, especially those in
the infantry, would disrupt the teamwork that makes a difference
between victory and defeat on the battlefield. Special relationships
inevitably would develop, introducing new risks as men acted
differently in combat toward females than they do toward males. 
<P>
     If Schroeder and other feminists want to solve the sexual
misconduct problem in the military, the last thing they should do is
advocate putting women into combat. Female soldiers will be taken
prisoner and sexually abused by enemy forces. This is precisely what
happened to Maj. Rhonda Cornum when she was taken captive by the
Iraqis during the Persian Gulf War. She was, she later acknowledged,
"violated manually -- vaginally and rectally." It makes little sense
to expose women to new and even more horrific threats in the name of
protecting them from their own American colleagues.
<P>
    The Navy as an institution should not be made a scapegoat as the
Congress tries to find a solution to the sexual misconduct problem in
the services. This not only would be unfair to the thousands of male
Navy officers and personnel who do not abuse women, it would damage
the fighting capability of the Navy, which would be a disservice to
the nation and the American people whom it is entrusted to protect.
<P>
    The Navy is a fine institution. It has successfully responded to
problems of racial prejudice and drug abuse which continue to plague
the civilian world. Its policy of "zero tolerance" for drugs, enforced
by random testing and dismissal for offenders, virtually eliminated
the problem when it was implemented in 1981. There is every reason to
believe that the problem of sexual misconduct will be dealt with in
the same manner. Outside pressure to find the culprits of sexual
misconduct is fine, but damaging the integrity of the Navy as an
institution should not be the cost.
<P>
    America Does Not Need A Kinder, Gentler Military. Despite their
justified outrage at the Tailhook incident, Americans must realize
that the military needs fighters, not laboratory subjects for
experiments in social engineering. The purpose of the military is to
fight and win wars, not to serve as a jobs program or as a vehicle for
social change. If the federal government is to ask men to risk their
lives in combat, it must not create an environment that will increase
that risk. This is what putting women into combat positions would do.
Far from solving the problem of sexual misconduct, women in combat
would merely feminize the warrior culture of the armed services, and
thereby weaken its ability to do its job.

INTRODUCTION 
 <P>
Excessive pay, perks, and expenses focused citizen anger on Congress 
and helped trigger the 1994 electoral revolution.  The new Republican 
majorities in the House and Senate moved quickly to cut staff and 
expenses and eliminate many of Congress's exemptions from the law.  
Further steps are necessary, however, to reduce perks, reform 
pensions, and further trim staff.  Congressional committees currently 
are considering some of these reforms, while others will likely be 
debated in the course of the appropriations process.  But several 
problems remain.  
 <P>
Automatic pay raises are scheduled each year with no vote required, 
further boosting lawmakers' salaries, which already exceed $11,000 a 
month; 
 <P>
Congressional pensions far exceed most private-sector plans, and 
benefits exceed those of most other federal employees; 
 <P>
Taxpayer-funded mailings, travel, and other perks are abused to 
promote incumbents' reelection bids; and 
 <P>
Congress remains the most heavily staffed legislature in the world. 
 <P>
These perks continue to insulate Congress from American citizens, 
frustrate political fairness, and promote legislative careerism and 
bureaucracy.  Reforms in these areas will mean a more efficient, 
representative, and politically competitive Congress. 
  <P>   
PAY.  Congress should repeal its automatic pay raise so that Members 
will have to bear political responsibility for raising their own pay.  
Given the recent adoption of the 27th Amendment -- which attempts to 
prevent lawmakers from raising their own pay without taking 
responsibility for it at the polls -- the time for ending automatic 
pay hikes has come.  Because that amendment was drafted long before 
cost of living adjustments were conceived, the constitutionality of 
current automatic adjustments is debatable, but the amendment's intent 
is clear and gives Congress an additional reason to end the practice.  
Congress also should enforce existing federal laws that dock 
lawmakers' pay for unexcused absences. 
 <P>
PENSIONS.  Congress should reform its pension system, which encourages 
careerism and is twice as generous as any private-sector plan.  The 
current system of escalating benefits creates open-ended liabilities 
for taxpayers and should be changed to one funded largely or 
exclusively by the contributions of Members themselves, similar to 
private-sector 401(k) retirement accounts.  New rules should apply to 
all Members elected or reelected in 1996 or later, forcing Members 
either to leave office at the end of the 104th Congress under the old 
pension system or to continue into the 105th Congress under new rules. 
 <P>
PERKS.  Official franking (postage), travel, and media resources 
contribute significantly to historically high incumbent reelection 
rates.  Congress should trim perks with an eye to eliminating 
unjustifiable campaign-related spending, especially the frank.  At a 
minimum, the House should double the franking cuts recently authorized 
by its Oversight Committee.  Congress's ultimate goal should be to 
eliminate the mass mailings its Members send out -- mailings which 
accomplish little besides serving as taxpayer-funded quasi- campaign 
aids -- either by cutting the funds available for franking or 
by regulating mass mailings out of existence.  Subsidies for 
publications and services like calendars and recording studios that 
lack any legislative function should be ended, and such other perks as 
frequent flier miles accrued through official travel and free medical 
care from military hospitals should be disallowed. 
 <P>
STAFF.  Congress's huge staff is expensive and opens the door to 
bigger and more intrusive government.  The role played by aides in 
congressional elections should be curtailed or eliminated entirely.  A 
cut in personal staffs, so far untouched by the new Republican 
Congress, would force lawmakers to make more decisions directly 
instead of 
leaving them to subordinates. 
  <P>    
The new Congress has made an impressive start on franking and 
committee staff cuts.  However, to complete the reform effort, Members 
must deal with their automatic pay raises, fat pensions, taxpayer-
funded perks, and retinues of personal staff.  Until they do, the 
overgrown Congress will remain less efficient, effective, and thrifty 
and more insulated from the real world than it ought to be. 
 <P>
 
A FAST START FOR REFORMS 
 <P>
Congressional reform was a major focus of the Contract with America, 
and the new Congress deserves praise for aggressively beginning to 
reform itself in a few short weeks.  Rules changes and staff cuts were 
among the first- day items in the Contract, which also included term 
limits, line-item veto power for the President, and a balanced budget 
amendment.  Such changes will affect congressional powers and 
operations dramatically. 
 <P>
On the very first day the House was in session, it voted to shrink 
committee staff by one-third and abolish three committees and twenty-
five subcommittees, in keeping with the promises of the Contract.  
Given that House committee staff had grown to roughly 1,200 percent of 
its size at the end of World War II, such a cut was long overdue.  
These reforms did more than eliminate some committee redundancy; they 
saved money.  The Oversight Committee was able to cut committee 
funding by 30 percent because of staff cuts, saving taxpayers $67 
million yearly.  Similar cuts -- a 15 percent cut in committee funding 
and a 12.5 percent cut in funds for leadership offices -- have been 
made in the Senate. 
 <P>
In January, Congress passed and the President signed legislation 
applying to Congress eleven federal laws, such as the Occupational 
Safety and Health Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the 
Civil Rights Act, from which it had been exempt.  for the first time 
in history, aggrieved staffers can take their cases to federal court, 
argue them before a jury, and have access to appeals.  The rapid 
passage of the Congressional Accountability Act with strong bipartisan 
support is a credit to Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, Senate 
Majority Leader Bob Dole, and other congressional leaders. 
 <P>
In March, the House Oversight Committee approved a one-third cut in 
members' franking allowances from their 1994 authorizations.  This 
would save over $20 million in postage-related spending yearly, 
bringing down the average yearly spending ceiling per congressional 
office from $163,000 to $108,000.  This is a healthy step on the road 
to elimination of franking abuses. 
 <P>
In April, the House passed legislation that would bring generous 
congressional pensions more in line with those of other federal 
employees.  The legislation would reduce the benefits accrual rate to 
equal those of other federal employees; increase the contributions 
lawmakers and other federal employees make to their own retirement, 
bringing the share of benefits paid for by employees from 28 percent 
to 34 percent; and bring pension calculation practices into parity 
with the private sector by calculating 
retirement ann cities on the basis of the highest five, not three, 
years of salaried employment.  These reforms are long overdue, given 
that the federal employee pension system now has a shortfall of over 
half a trillion dollars, which must be paid for out of general 
revenues. 
 <P>
In short, the actions Congress already has taken demonstrate a serious 
commitment to internal reform and bode well for the difficult tasks 
that lie ahead.  The most pressing areas for further reform are 
congressional pay, pensions, perks, and staff. 
 <P>
CONGRESSIONAL PAY 
 <P>
Federal lawmakers' salaries have been a source of controversy since 
the early nineteenth century.  When Congress passed its first pay 
raise in 1816, furious voters replaced nearly two-thirds of the House 
of Representatives  -- a turnover rate unsurpassed until the 
controversies over slavery that led eventually to the War Between the 
States.  The next Congress responded by repealing the pay raise.  
Perennial controversies over lawmakers' pay have led Congress to 
experiment with establishing independent panels to set pay scales, 
providing tax deductions for lawmakers' Washington living expenses, 
and attaching congressional pay raises to bills adjusting all federal 
workers' salaries. 
 <P>          Currently, the taxpayer pays each Member of Congress 
$133,600 yearly.  The "ethics reform" passed by Congress in 1989 
provided for annual cost of living adjustments (COLAs) derived from 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics' index of wages and salaries in private 
industry so that lawmakers would never have to vote on politically 
explosive pay raises.  Representative John Boehner (R-OH), now 
Chairman of the House Republican Conference, brought suit against the 
automatic COLA in 1992 on the grounds that it violates the 27th 
Amendment's stricture against implementing legislative pay raises 
without an intervening election.  The lawsuit failed at both the 
federal district and federal appellate levels, however, thus making 
the amendment's intent -- that a Congress should not be allowed to 
change its own salary without an intervening election -- a 
dead letter.  Neither Boehner nor the other 20 Members who had 
standing in the case chose to appeal the appellate decision to the 
Supreme Court. 
<P> 
          Although  the congressional COLAs are intended to be 
automatic, it is possible for determined Members to block their 
implementation.  Last year, for instance, the House voted to amend the 
Treasury/Postal Service appropriations bill to delete the pay raise 
scheduled for January 1995.  When Representative Jim Ross Lightfoot 
(R-IA) realized that the conference committee for the appropriation 
intended to delete the House provision blocking the pay hike, he 
threatened to call for a House vote to instruct the conference 
committee to eliminate the pay raise.  Although Lightfoot's motion 
would not have been binding on the conferees, the threat of having to 
defy what almost certainly would have been a lopsided negative vote 
was enough to make the committee retreat on its pay raise efforts.  
Similar efforts blocked a COLA scheduled for 1994. 
 <P>
          Ultimately, however, such actions block COLAs for only one 
year, leaving automatic pay raises to reappear every year.  The long-
term solution is to rewrite the law to eliminate automatic pay raises, 
especially since the political pressures that blocked new COLAs for 
the past two years show every sign of continuing.  Since most workers 
do not receive an automatic pay hike every year, it is difficult to 
see why Congress should, especially when Members do not even have to 
vote on it.  The Constitution puts Congress in charge of setting its 
own pay; Members should accept that responsibility. 
 <P>
          Representatives Michael Bilirakis (R-FL), Howard Coble (R-
NC), Marge Roukema  (R-NJ), and Gerald Solomon (R-NY) independently 
have introduced legislation that would eliminate the automatic 
congressional COLA currently in effect.  Representative Andy Jacobs's 
(D-IN) H.R.  834 would cut congressional pay to its 1989, pre-"ethics 
reform" level of $89,500 yearly. 
<P> 
          The federal law that requires Members to forgo their salary 
if they fail to show up for work should be enforced.  This has become 
a problem particularly among lawmakers who run for other offices or 
lose their primary bids for reelection.  For instance, in the 103rd 
Congress, Representative Craig Washington (D-TX), who was beaten in 
his reelection primary, subsequently failed to show up for work for 
two months; Representative Jim Slattery (D-KS) was absent for 40 days 
while campaigning unsuccessfully for governor; and Representative Fred 
Grandy (R-IA) was absent for more than a month during his failed 
gubernatorial campaign.  Over $47,000 of taxpayer money was paid to 
these three no- show Congressmen for the days they missed.  Since 
federal law permits paid absences for lawmakers only in the case of 
personal or family illness, these Representatives essentially are 
profiting from Congress's failure to enforce its own laws -- a problem 
that is compounded when unexcused absences occur just before primary 
elections, since voters have relatively little opportunity to take 
absences into account.  The National Taxpayers Union has filed a 
complaint with the House Ethics Committee, but ethics complaints 
should not be required to make Congress follow the rules it has set 
for itself. 
<P> 
          Paying lawmakers' salaries when they do not show up for work 
not only wastes money, but also subsidizes their campaigns for 
election to other offices or reelection to those they already hold.  
Former congressional candidate Michael Maibach has experienced how 
campaign laws make it more difficult for private-sector employees to 
be elected to Congress:  "[Out of 15 candidates for one congressional 
seat, I was] the only one on a private payroll.  The other 14 included 
three sitting county supervisors and one state legislator.  While the 
law required that I not campaign on [my employer's] time, those 
already in office had no such constraint.  Taxpayers, in effect, paid 
them to campaign for their next office!...  Lawmakers who make it 
illegal to campaign on 'company time' make it legal for themselves to 
campaign on 'government time.'"  Maibach 
concludes that the current system locks out most candidates who are 
not self-employed, independently wealthy, or already holding public 
office. 
<P> 
          In addition to the tremendous disadvantages private-sector 
candidates already face, the Federal Election Commission has proposed 
greater regulation of the personal use of campaign funds, which would 
eliminate candidates' ability to pay themselves a salary during 
campaigns.  Payment of salaries from campaign funds is often the only 
way many 
challengers can approach parity with incumbents, each of whom is paid 
a full salary even while campaigning.  Ironically, when former 
Maryland Senate candidate Alan Keyes paid himself a salary from 
campaign funds, he was buffeted by accusations of unethical conduct, 
despite the fact that his purpose was merely to put himself on the 
same level as the incumbent he faced -- who retained a full-time 
salary while campaigning, paid for by 
taxpayers. 
 <P>
          The most sweeping solution to the problem of a Congress too 
highly paid and too insulated from the experiences of the rest of the 
country is presidential aspirant Lamar Alexander's proposal to "cut 
their pay and send them home."  Alexander advocates a 50 percent 
salary cut coupled with legislative sessions of no more than six 
months per year.  This would permit lawmakers to retain an authentic 
connection to the districts they represent by living and working 
there, rather than acquiring a Washington mindset that often is 
antithetical to the desires of their constituents.  
 <P>
CONGRESSIONAL PENSIONS 
 <P>
     Congress's pension system is roughly twice as generous as those 
of most Fortune 500 corporations.  Not only do these generous pensions 
burden the taxpayers, but they also promote political careerism by 
providing incentives for lawmakers to extend their tenure.  Over 250 
Members of the 103rd Congress will become "pension millionaires," 
receiving pension income after their retirement in excess of $1 
million.  For instance, former Speaker of the House Tom Foley is 
eligible for nearly $124,000 per year in addition to the pay he will 
receive from his job at a lobbying/law firm.  The former Speaker could 
take in over $3 million in pension checks over the course of his 
expected lifetime.  COLAs are applied to congressional pensions as 
well as congressional salaries.  Only one in ten private-sector 
pensions is adjusted for inflation, and many of those compensate for 
only 
a third of the inflation rate. 
 <P>
          Although some Members of Congress have defended their 
pension system as being the same as that of other federal workers, 
legislators' pensions actually are far more generous.  Congressional 
pension formulas have the same high "accrual rate" -- one of the 
formula's three variables -- as those of policemen and firefighters.  
Since the pension 
formulas of few other occupations are so high, and since the work of a 
Congressman rarely contains dangers on a par with entering burning 
buildings or subduing felons, it is difficult to justify the extra-
high accrual rates.  Inflated pension formulas compound the problem of 
legislators' ignorance of and inexperience with the economic 
challenges of those they ostensibly represent. 
 <P>
          With the public becoming noticeably more exercised about 
congressional pensions, several lawmakers have produced pension reform 
proposals.  Representative Howard Coble's (R-NC) H.R.  165 is the most 
radical; it removes legislators from the federal employee retirement 
system, thus eliminating pension benefits from congressional service.  
Another Coble bill, H.R.  126, would eliminate the COLA from 
congressional pensions.  Senator John McCain's (R-AZ) S.  48 would 
subject legislators' retirement 
annuities to the standard current earnings test, which would make 
congressional pension recipients vulnerable to the same rate of 
taxation that Social Security recipients face.  Senator Spencer 
Abraham's (R-MI) S.  355 would mandate disclosure of pension 
contributions, expected returns, and any other information needed to 
calculate the total costs to taxpayers of congressional pensions.  
Senator Richard Bryan (D-NV) has offered S.  288, which lowers 
congressional pension accrual rates to the same level as federal 
pensions and caps retired lawmakers' payments at the level of their 
final high salary; in the House, Representatives Glen Browder (D-AL) 
and Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) have introduced similar measures, H.R.  907 
and H.R.  575, respectively.  As noted above, pension reforms recently 
approved by the House include adjustments to accrual rates.  Senator 
Bryan has promised to seek a vote on his measure shortly. 
 <P>
          Representative Dan Miller's (R-FL) proposal, H.R.  804, is 
the most comprehensive:  Miller's plan would eliminate the current 
congressional pension system for Members who begin their service in 
the 105th Congress or later and replace it with a 401(k)-style tax-
exempt savings plan.  This would mirror the move from "defined 
benefit" plans to "defined contribution" plans currently taking place 
in the private sector by letting legislators decide how much they wish 
to contribute to their own retirement and freeing taxpayers from 
unfunded pension liabilities.  Contributions of up to 5 percent of 
salary would be matched for up to twelve years of service, after 
which, although the limit for a Member's own contributions would be 
raised to 10 percent, taxpayers no longer would match these retirement 
savings.  Capping the donation limit at twelve years would remove any 
pension-related financial incentive for serving in Congress longer 
than that period of time.  Legislators also would retain Social 
Security benefits.  Members with service prior to the 105th Congress 
would be allowed to continue contributing to their pensions until they 
were vested, in order to fulfill the expectations upon which they 
relied when making previous contributions, but no more contributions 
after the twelve- year limit would be accepted. 
 <P>
          Miller's plan moves in the right direction, but it could be 
improved.  The ultimate goal of pension reform should be to remove all 
lawmakers from defined benefit plans.  This would reduce the 
incentives to stay in office and would be a first step toward easing 
the unfunded liability of the Civil Service Retirement System 
(currently estimated at over $500 billion).  The best solution is to 
require all Members to enter defined contribution plans as a condition 
of further congressional service.  Since it is arguably unfair to take 
away benefits without notice from lawmakers who have planned for them 
in the past, lawmakers ought to be given a choice: either retire at 
the end of the 104th Congress with their current pension intact or 
(assuming they win reelection) enter the 105th Congress with a defined 
contribution plan that does not impose additional liabilities on the 
taxpayer. 
 <P>
          A similar proposal was applied in the 102nd Congress, when 
Members were given notice that they would forfeit the privilege of 
taking their campaign funds for personal use upon retirement, as they 
traditionally had been able to do, if they remained into the 103rd 
Congress.  Although some defenders of the current pension system may 
argue that lawmakers who assumed it would continue have made their 
financial plans on that basis, election to Congress is a limited-term 
contract of employment that inevitably expires.  Since lawmakers are 
not entitled to assume they will win their next campaign for 
reelection, they certainly cannot assume continuous preservation and 
expansion of pension benefits premised upon reelection.  
 <P>
Finally, Congress should adopt a similar solution for all federal 
employees, since switching congressional pensions to a defined 
contribution system leaves the problem of other federal pensions -- 
and their unfunded liabilities -- unsolved.  The legislation the House 
passed in April, which equalizes accrual rates and contribution levels 
among Members, congressional staff, and other federal workers, is a 
step toward this goal.  However, it only postpones rather than 
eliminates the liability crisis which ultimately will be borne by 
taxpayers. 
 <P>
CONGRESSIONAL PERKS 
 <P>
     The keystone of congressional perks is the frank -- mail from 
congressional offices paid for by taxpayers, not lawmakers.  Use of 
the frank permits every incumbent to send out hundreds of thousands of 
dollars worth of self-publicizing mail and stoke the fires of 
reelection.  Although House measures to cut staff, committees, and 
subcommittees have received more attention, franking cuts arguably are 
even more important.  Earlier this month, the House Oversight 
Committee authorized a one-third cut from the 1994 funding level for 
franked mail, bringing down the average spending ceiling per member 
for franked mail from $326,000 to $216,000 per two- year term.  (Even 
this reduced ceiling exceeds the amount -- roughly $206,000 -- the 
average major-party challenger spent on his entire 1994 campaign.) A 
series of reforms in Senate franking over the past several 
years have come close to eliminating taxpayer-funded mass mailings in 
that body. 
 <P>
          Although the franking privilege dates back to the First 
Continental Congress of 1775, most of the abuses it has fostered have 
a considerably more modern pedigree.  Many derive from "postal patron" 
mailings, delivered to each stop on a postal route and therefore not 
required to carry a specific name or address.  Before the early 1960s, 
postal patron mail almost always was restricted to rural or private 
carrier routes.  (For two brief periods, first in the mid-1930s and 
later in the mid-1950s, city routes could receive postal patron 
mailings.) Since that time, expanded use of postal patron mail and 
advances in technology -- primarily computers that sort and target 
demographic groups and printers that produce personalized letters -- 
have combined to grant incumbents impressive taxpayer-funded direct-
mail capabilities. 
 <P>
          Before 1973, the only standards that regulated franking were 
those formulated by the courts and postal authorities, whose 
reluctance to irritate Congress led to lax enforcement and general 
confusion about the frank's proper use.  This climate led to several 
questionable uses of the frank in the 1972 elections.  Representative 
Fletcher Thompson (R-GA), for example, sent franked mail to voters 
across his state in the course of an unsuccessful Senate campaign.  
The cost of the mailing -- over $200,000 -- became a factor in 
Thompson's eventual loss to Sam Nunn.  With twelve cases of alleged 
abuse in the courts, lawmakers moved in 1973 to create new franking 
guidelines.  New regulations defined frankable material, restricted 
mass mailings, and created a House Commission on Congressional Mailing 
Standards to resolve franking disputes and rule on individual cases.  
Similar duties were assigned to the Senate Select Committee on 
Standards and Conduct (later renamed the Select Ethics Committee). 
 <P>
          Although the regulations  issued by the Commission on 
Mailing Standards have eliminated the frank's most crassly reelection- 
oriented uses (for instance, Members are blocked from sending mass 
mailings statewide or 60 days before they appear on the ballot, must 
disclose the amount they spend on franking, and no longer may send 
letters of congratulation for birthdays or anniversaries), they betray 
an awareness that mass mailings are used all too frequently to bolster 
the name identification and image of their senders.  For instance, the 
"guidelines" (which do not carry the full force and effect of 
regulations) that the Commission issued limiting all mailings to two 
pictures of the sending Congressman per page and eight mentions of his 
or her name (not including use of the name in the frank proper, the 
masthead, the return address, a photo caption, a reprint from the 
Congressional Record, or a signature) not only illustrates the self-
promotional potential of the frank for incumbents, but also raises 
disturbing questions about the extent of such use before any reforms 
were issued. 
 <P>
          Although the word  frank is derived from the Latin for free 
(francus), franked mail is decidedly not free.  As computer and 
printer technology improved in the 1970s and 1980s, making it easier 
to send targeted direct mail and produce impressive postal patron 
mailings, the use of the frank exploded.  Between 1972 and 1988, 
yearly franking costs increased,   after adjusting for inflation, by 
86  percent.  During the 1980s, Congress spent from a low of $43 
million per year to a high of $113 million per year on taxpayer-funded 
postage.  House franking has risen in every election year by an 
average of 64 percent from the previous year since 1980. In 1993, for 
example, House franking costs totaled $24.6 million, which grew to 
$42.3 million in 1994 -- a 72 percent increase.  Franking trends 
show a decided drop beginning in the early 1990s.  Although causation 
is difficult to prove, the 1990 rules requiring individual office 
disclosure of franking amounts (and the attendant embarrassment that 
comes from a great deal of franking) probably had something to do with 
the drop.  Franking costs, however, remain well above their pre-mass 
mailing level. 
 <P>
          Potential for abuse of the frank is noticeably smaller in 
the Senate, which in 1994 prohibited its use in conjunction with mass 
mailings in most cases.  One exception is that Senators may divert up 
to $50,000 from their clerk-hire account to fund mass mailings.  This 
approach at least forces lawmakers to trim staff if they want to send 
out mass mailings.  Senator Connie Mack (R-FL) has been instrumental 
in Senate passage of this and several other franking reforms since 
1989; besides curbing mass mailings, their primary effect has been to 
mandate detailed disclosure of franking practices. 
 <P>
          The House Oversight Committee's franking reform will cut up 
to nearly $24 million yearly from congressional budgets.  But this is 
not the only reason to reform the frank.  Equally important is the 
abuse of "free" congressional mail as a quasi-campaign tool.  
Endangered incumbents routinely use the frank to supplement their 
campaign mailings.  The National Taxpayers Union calculated last year 
that the 37 most endangered House incumbents (as determined by 
political analyst Charles Cook) spent, on average, three times as much 
on franking as the 27 retiring Members just before the 1994 elections.  
Franking essentially represents public funding for congressional 
candidates -- but for incumbents only.  The frank has long served as 
the foundation for the structure of taxpayer-funded incumbent 
advantages, and its widespread use likely helps explain the 90 percent 
reelection rate that House Members have enjoyed for decades.  In 1992, 
three of the four top House frankers lost their reelection bids, which 
suggests that these Members understood their political troubles and 
used public funds liberally to try to counteract them. 
 <P>
          Enormous subsidies for congressional mail reshape the 
playing field in incumbents'  favor in addition to expanding the 
federal budget.  Defenders of big franking budgets typically argue 
that Members of Congress must answer constituents' concerns by mail.  
This is true but essentially irrelevant.  While in the Senate, 
California Governor Pete Wilson estimated that over 90 percent of 
franked mail is initiated by Congress, not by constituents.  Former 
Maryland Senator Charles McC.  Mathias estimated in 1982 that mass 
mailings constituted 96 percent of Senate mailings that year.  In 
1994, the House sent out 267 million pieces of mail but received only 
41 million pieces -- 15 percent of the amount it sent out.  Most 
franked mail is in the form of mass-mailed leaflets that provide 
information to every household in the district -- essentially 
advertising brochures designed to place the incumbent in the best 
possible light.  Although some Congressmen argue that their districts 
need regular mass mailings to be informed about what is happening in 
Washington, it is difficult to argue that the government should 
provide news services or that Members of Congress are politically 
neutral sources. 
 <P>
          The Oversight Committee's cuts in franking allocations 
should be the beginning -- not the end -- of the new Congress's 
efforts at franking reform.  The committee is considering proposals to 
expand the pre- election period in which franked mass mailings are 
banned (currently 60 days) and to increase the frequency of franking 
disclosure.  (Ever since quarterly disclosure was mandated in 1991, 
franking has declined steadily.) The 60-day ban is not extensive 
enough.  In 1994, fifteen Members of Congress sent out over 250,000 
pieces of mail each during the week before the ban took effect, at a 
cost of nearly $40,000 per Member.  Such behavior strongly suggests 
that Congressmen are coming as close as possible to the deadline that 
separates permissible from impermissible franking, and thus that the 
deadline should be moved back further. 
<P> 
          Representative Mike Castle (R-DE) has introduced H.  R.  
923, the Franked Mail Savings Act, which would cut the franking 
allowance further and prevent incumbents from flooding their districts 
with mass mail just before the 60-day deadline by banning mass 
mailings during election years.  It would not regulate franked mail 
that responded to constituents' queries.  Several other 
Representatives -- Porter Goss (R-FL), Fred Upton (R-MI), Pat Danner 
(D-MO), Tim Holden (D-PA), Tom Davis (R-VA), and Bernard Sanders (I-
VT) -- also have introduced measures to cut the franking allowance. 
 <P>
          None of these bills, however, approaches the 75 percent cut 
proposed in the last Congress by Representative Bob Inglis (R-SC).  
Even that massive a reduction would not come close to affecting the 
responsive function of the frank, although it would eliminate most 
postal patron mailings. 
 <P>
          A 75 percent cut in the franking allowance would not have 
affected about 20 percent of the 103rd Congress -- those who were the 
lowest frankers -- at all.  In the year from October 1993 to September 
1994, 93 Members, over 1 in 5, spent less than $40,000 -- 
approximately the yearly allowance that a 75 percent cut would entail.  
(This set of frankers contains equal numbers of Republicans and 
Democrats, plus one independent.) This demonstrates that Members can 
respond to constituents and get along with quite a bit less than the 
six-figure annual franking budget that scores of Members claim is 
essential. 
 <P>
          Cutting the franking budget down to size would ensure 
smaller budgets and fairer elections.  The ultimate goal of franking 
reform should be to eliminate mass mailings entirely, and 
Representative Ray LaHood (R-IL) has introduced a measure, H.R.  1137, 
that would abolish them.  The House Oversight Committee's actions and 
Representative Castle's proposals represent healthy steps toward the 
goal of abolition. 
 <P>
          Several other congressional perks are likewise indefensible.  
Getting rid of congressional perks which give electoral advantages to 
incumbents should be at the top of the reform agenda.  For instance, 
the House and Senate Recording Studios, which provide facilities at 
less than commercial rates for lawmakers to produce radio and 
television shows, provide quasi-campaign services which could be 
supplied just as well by the private sector.  They exist primarily to 
make life (and reelection) easier for incumbents.  Furthermore, 
taxpayer funds should not be used to purchase, imprint lawmakers' 
names on, or frank calendars from the U.S.  Capitol Historical 
Society.  Representative Scott Klug (R-WI) has introduced a 
resolution, H.  Res.  24, that would end the yearly practice of 
automatically funding 2,500 calendars per Congressman.  Congress has 
eliminated its yearly purchase and production of agricultural 
yearbooks, and it should do the same with its calendars. 
 <P>
          Personal use of frequent flier miles also should be 
eliminated by the House.  Senators have not been able to take frequent 
flier miles for personal use since the practice was forbidden in 1991.  
Granting lawmakers personal use of their frequent flier miles creates 
an additional incentive for them to spend more on travel.  Permitting 
personal use of frequent flyer miles is essentially no more defensible 
than granting lawmakers personal use of interest derived from savings 
accounts under the control of the federal government.  In general, it 
is difficult to see why Members should be allowed personal benefit 
from exercise of their official duties.  Lawmakers should be 
encouraged to use their frequent flier miles for official business, 
but personal use should be disallowed, both to encourage thrift and to 
remind Members that when their constituents want to fly across the 
country, they have to pay for it. 
 <P>
          Finally, lawmakers no longer should receive free outpatient 
medical care from local area military hospitals.  They are paid a 
generous salary and are given an excellent health care plan that 
allows them to choose from among several different health care 
providers.  There is no reason to perpetuate a policy that further 
isolates lawmakers from the experience of the people who elect them to 
federal office.  Maintaining special privileges for lawmakers that are 
unrelated to the exercise of their legislative duties is simply 
unjustifiable. 
 <P>
CONGRESSIONAL STAFF 
 <P>
In the last thirty years, congressional operating costs have 
skyrocketed by 800 percent, partly because of the Capitol's "aides 
crisis."  Since World War II, House and Senate personal staffs have 
increased more than fivefold and sixfold, respectively, while 
committee staffs have increased twelvefold and fourfold.  The 103rd 
Congress's payroll of nearly 40,000 employees contained five 
legislative staffers for every one in the world's second largest 
legislature, the Canadian Parliament.  There are hundreds of taxpayer-
funded congressional staffers whose only job is to create favorable 
press coverage for the Senator or Representative who employs them.  
The large number of aides who perform quasi-campaign work for their 
employers almost certainly is related to the historically 
unprecedented rates of reelection that incumbent Congressmen have 
enjoyed over the last two decades.  Public outrage at an overstaffed, 
overpaid, and oversupplied-with-perquisites Congress forced majority 
Democrats in the 103rd Congress and majority Republicans in the 104th 
to respond in varying degrees to calls for cuts. 
 <P>
          The House leadership in the 103rd Congress promised a 4 
percent staff reduction, but their performance left much to be 
desired.  The first round of cuts relied heavily on elimination of 
peripheral staff positions, such as interns and distributors of office 
furniture and supplies.  Representative Charlie Rose (D-NC), then 
Chairman of the House Administration Committee,   accomplished one 
especially misleading series of staff cuts by transferring control 
over the   employees of several congressional cafeterias to private 
contractors.  This  bureaucratic maneuver enabled Rose to take credit 
for staff cuts while ensuring that the number of Capitol employees 
would remain the same, with the only change a recasting of the 
official payroll.  Cosmetic reductions like these were joined to 
reductions in non-legislative staff, while legions of highly paid 
personal and committee staff escaped unscathed. 
 <P>
          Leaders of the 104th Congress have embarked upon a more 
serious attempt to cut staff.  In the House, Members voted to cut 
committee staffs by one-third, partly by eliminating three committees 
and twenty-five subcommittees, leading to a 30 percent reduction in 
overall House committee spending.  When added to the elimination of 
fourteen subcommittees during the previous Congress, these reforms 
constitute a good first start at reducing the redundant scrutiny and 
special-interest influence that the cumbersome committee structure 
breeds.  On the other side of the Capitol, the Chairman of the Rules 
and Administration Committee, Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), has 
implemented the Republican Conference's recommendation to cut 
aggregate Senate committee spending by 15 percent.  While these cuts 
are a strong first step, they fail to address lawmakers' overgrown 
personal staffs.  
 <P>
          A central reason that large congressional staffs pose a 
danger to representative democracy is that they serve too often as 
campaign teams.  In some cases, "volunteer" campaign work is a sub 
rosa condition of hire.  Even when it is not, staffers have a very 
strong interest in seeing their boss get reelected.  Congressional 
staffers are prohibited from making financial contributions to their 
employers' reelection campaigns.  Many, however, are bribed or 
dragooned into "volunteer" campaign work.  Employees of any particular 
lawmaker should be prohibited from doing campaign work for that 
lawmaker along the lines of the recently revised Hatch Act.  
Alternatively, a less intrusive (but also less effective) reform would 
be to prohibit the use of public funds for aides' travel between 
Washington, D.C., and the Member's district in the 90 days before any 
primary or general election. 
 <P>
          Regardless of campaign abuses, however, Congress remains 
overstaffed.  The cuts in House and Senate committee staff did not 
affect large personal staffs.  Indeed, one of the rules reforms the 
House passed on the first day of the 104th Congress actually may have 
had the perverse effect of increasing personal staff.  Abolition of 
legislative service organizations (LSOs) -- special-interest 
congressional caucuses that were permitted office space, use of House 
equipment and services, and access to Members' clerk-hire accounts -- 
was billed by reformers as an economy measure that would save as much 
as $5 million yearly.  LSO funds, however, came out of personal office 
budgets, which were not reduced when the LSOs were abolished.  As a 
result, many congressional offices have used the freed-up funds to 
hire new staff. 
 <P>
          A retinue of personal staffers for each lawmaker leads 
inevitably to a more activist and intrusive government, as well as to 
a dispersal of decision-making authority to unelected aides.  Clerk-
hire and franking accounts for each Senator and Representative should 
be combined, and their total should be reduced.  This will allow each 
Member to decide whether he wants to spend money from a smaller pool 
on postage or on staff.  A 10 percent cut would be a reasonable start.  
Roughly half the money saved could be used to establish a central 
office with primary responsibility for routine constituent requests, 
such as furnishing copies of federal legislation, helping with 
passport problems, and addressing simple problems with Social Security 
or veterans benefits.  Such an office would remind lawmakers that 
their job is fundamentally legislative in nature; it would also remove 
a heavy clerical burden from overworked congressional staffers. 
 <P>
          Constituent service not only distracts legislators and their 
staff from the work they were elected to do, but also undermines 
competitive elections by permitting incumbents to take credit for 
nonpartisan good works that obscure their legislative record.  
Professor Morris Fiorina has estimated that casework accomplishments 
add 5 to 10 percent to incumbents' vote totals because of gratitude 
for constituent services.  Nearly one out of every five congressional 
staffers deals exclusively with constituent service; one House 
lawmaker estimated that his office had directly assisted over 600 
constituents in the first six months of his term.  Easing the burden 
of constituent service borne by congressional staffers would encourage 
Congress to concentrate on legislation that benefits the entire 
country. 
 <P>
CONCLUSION 
 <P>
Congress should end wasteful, inefficient spending and perquisites 
that separate lawmakers from their constituents, promote career 
politics, and foil fair elections.  Action on the political reform 
that the American public has demanded is beginning to materialize, as 
shown by the 22 states that passed term limits legislation and the 
provisions of the Contract with America that provided for 
congressional committee and staff reductions.  These actions are good 
first steps, but Congress should continue to reform its own pay, 
pensions, perks, and staff.  Particularly, it should: 
 <P>
Eliminate the automatic pay raise mechanism currently in effect; 
 <P>
Prohibit its own members from receiving payment for extended unexcused 
absences; 
 <P>
Establish a defined contribution pension system that forces career 
legislators either to leave with their old pensions or to continue 
without them, thus saving taxpayers money and reducing incentives for 
congressional careerism; 
 <P>
Curtail franked mass mailings from House Members through a 75 percent 
cut in the franking allowance; 
 <P>
End support of all congressional perquisites, such as personal 
recording studios and calendars mailed out at taxpayers' expense, that 
appear to have no genuine legislative function; 
 <P>
Disallow personal use of frequent flier miles acquired on official 
business; 
 <P>
Prohibit Members from receiving free outpatient medical care from 
local area military hospitals; 
 <P>
Discourage aides from performing campaign reelection work, either 
through simple prohibition of the practice or tighter regulation of 
staff travel; and 
 <P>
Cut clerk-hire budgets by 10 percent, using some of the savings to 
create a central constituent service office to handle routine 
requests. 
 <P>
These reforms are needed to bring Congress more in contact with the 
challenges faced by average citizens, to help restore Americans' trust 
in government, and to eliminate the tremendous, taxpayer-funded 
advantages incumbents use to defeat challengers.  Elimination of these 
advantages, in addition to saving taxpayers money, would represent 
true campaign finance reform by diminishing the overwhelming 
advantages incumbents enjoy in elections.  Perhaps even more 
important, such reforms would force lawmakers to oversee more programs 
and enterprises of the federal government directly, rather than leave 
them in the hands of unelected staffers.  Reformers who seek genuinely 
competitive elections and a more efficient, representative, and 
deliberative Congress should place cuts in congressional pay, perks, 
pensions, and staff at the top of their agenda.

Duplantier</a> <br>November 24, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Spies Elude U.S. Security</h2></center><P>

[The John Walker spy case shocked America. How did Walker manage to 
steal so many of our county's secrets and pass them on to the Soviets for 
18 years without being detected?]
<p>
How did John Walker get away with his treacherous activities? The 
answer is simple: "The U.S. security system does not work." <p>That's the 
conclusion of George P. Morse, a security consultant with half a century 
of experience. Morse considers it likely that "American secrets are still 
being compromised in ways similar to those which John Walker found so 
easy and effective to employ, for there is really no effective U.S. 
government security system in place to stem the hemorrhaging." In a 
new book called America Twice Betrayed Morse concludes that our 
nation's security system is "unsound and unworkable and should be 
abolished and replaced."
<p>
A veteran of 30 years' service with the OSS and CIA, Morse contends 
that the apprehension of spies like Walker has resulted more often from 
luck than vigilance. "The great majority of spies and enemy agents have 
actually been uncovered by accident." he observes, "or through exposure 
by the subject's relatives or defectors from the intelligence services of 
other nations. They have not generally been uncovered by our official 
government security, investigative. or intelligence systems." In fact. says 
Morse. "the way security has traditional v been conceived and organized 
by the U.S. government makes it virtually impossible to protect our 
secrets."
<p>
In his book. America Twice Betrayed. Morse proposes a new system of 
U.S. government security to "remedy many of the failures of the past 
[and] at the same time substantiallv reduce both the monetary and 
human costs associated with security." What is needed, says Morse, is "a 
total rethinking of our basic approach to security." His first step would be 
to eliminate the "wasteful and counter-productive" full field investigation 
of all applicants for federal employment. Such an investigation "creates 
the illusion that the people investigated and then 'cleared' will always be 
loyal and honest." says Morse. "It provides a false sense of security 
which enables management and staff to avoid [their obligation to 
maintain] constant vigilance."
<p>
Instead, Morse would require the applicant "to offer proof of both 
suitability and trustworthiness and loyalty." Standard reference checks 
would be followed by an intensive interview. drug-screening. and a 
polygraph examination. "Polygraph tests -- and the fear of having to 
undergo one -- are arnong the few really effective tools available to the 
government to deter and detect treason or prevarication." Says Morse, who argues that "applicants seeking government employment and security 
clearance must, as a condition of their employment, accept reasonable 
limits of privacy and their constitutional rights against self-
incrimination."
<p>
Morse also calls for the development of "an appropriate and 
comprehensive set of standards that state concretely what is and what is 
not acceptable to qualify for a U.S. government security clearance." The 
most pressing need. however, is for a dramatic improvement in "the 
abysmal quality of management exercised by the Executive Branch from 
the President on down."

<h2>
REP. SMITH ON CHINA
</h2>

<P><blockquote><i>  
During hearings last May on the coercive population control program 
that Communist China has conducted for at least two decades, the 
chairman of a House Subcommittee posed the question. Should such a 
monstrous abuse of human rights affect our relations with that barbaric 
country?
</blockquote></i>

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congressman Christopher Smith, chairman of the House Subcommittee 
on International Operations and Human Rights, began his opening 
remarks by noting that Communist China "routinely compels women to 
abort their 'unauthorized' unborn children. The usual method," he 
observed, "is intense 'persuasion' using all of the economic, social, and 
psychological tools a totalitarian State has at its disposal. When these 
methods fail, the woman is taken physically to the abortion mill. Forced 
abortions are often performed very late in pregnancy, even in the ninth 
month." The final indignity is forced sterilization for the woman or her 
husband.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Forced abortion was properly considered a crime against humanity at the 
Nuremberg war crimes tribunal," Congressman Smith continued. "It is 
employed regularly with chilling effectiveness and unbearable pain upon 
women in the People's Republic of China. Women in China are required 
to obtain a birth coupon before conceiving a child. Chinese women are 
hounded by the population control police and even their menstrual cycles 
are publicly monitored as one means of ensuring compliance. "
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congressman Smith reported that the communist government in China 
has recently "issued a new law on eugenics which is now taking effect 
and which nationalizes discrimination against the handicapped. In a move 
that is eerily reminiscent of Nazi Germany, the Communist Chinese 
Government is implementing forced abortion against handicapped 
children and forced sterilization against parents who simply do not 
measure up in the eyes of the State. Despite all of this," said Smith, "the 
United Nations Population Fund continues to provide funds, materiel, 
people [and the] shield of respectability that the Chinese program so 
desperately wants."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Smith chastised the head of the UN Population Fund for insisting that 
China's birth control program is voluntary. "This is unmitigated nonsense 
and a big lie," said the congressman. "Degrading a few men, women, and 
children may be of no great matter for the Chinese communist regime, 
which has long regarded homicide and torture as among the basic tools of 
statecraft," conceded Smith, but that doesn't explain the willingness of 
Westerners to overlook -- or even facilitate -- such abuses. "So the most 
shocking thing about forced abortions and sterilization in China is not 
that they happen," said Smith, "but that otherwise humane societies such 
as the United States might forcibly return people who have managed to 
escape from them."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This is exactly what our current government has done. "The Clinton 
administration, which campaigned on a human rights platform that was 
justly critical of some of the refugee policies of its predecessors," said 
Smith, "quickly reversed course and began mass forcible repatriations of 
people who had escaped from China." The President has thus made the 
American people a party to the slaughter of innocents in China.

<h2>
ENVIRONMENTALISM
</h2>



<P><blockquote><i>  
"By the end of the 1980s, environmental bills accounted for nearly one-
fifth of bills presented to Congress and almost one-quarter of those 
enacted into law."
</blockquote></i>
<P>



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
                            
"The government's environmental activism has been costly," writes 
Jonathan Adler of the Competitive Enterprise Institute. "The 
Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that Americans spend 
well over $150 billion per year complying with environmental 
regulations." In a new book called Environmentalism at the Crossroads, 
published by the Capital Research Center, Adler argues that businesses 
trying to absorb the costs of compliance "are likely to pass on the cost to 
consumers by raising the price of their products. And, when they are 
confronted by the uncertainties of statutory interpretation and the 
regulatory enforcement of environmental law, they may decide to slow 
the development and application of new technologies."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The cost of environmental regulation continues to increase, even as more 
and more Americans are questioning its effectiveness, "particularly in the 
area of risk reduction." Adler contends that "attempting to improve 
environmental quality in one area can hurt the environment in other 
areas." Even worse, regulations can sometimes have an effect quite the 
opposite of what was intended, as has happened with the Endangered 
Species Act. Adler notes that "landowners lose the right to use their land 
as they see fit when an endangered animal is discovered on it. 
Landowners cannot build or enlarge their homes, plant crops, or cut down 
trees. Rather than protect wildlife, the Endangered Species Act punishes 
landowners, in effect, for creating or maintaining a species habitat. The 
Act creates disincentives for protecting endangered species," says Adler, 
with the result that "landowners who find an endangered species on their 
property may well decide to destroy it and its habitat before it's 
discovered by federal authorities."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Adler asserts that "many policy experts and the public now recognize the 
failings of much environmental policy." Nevertheless, he says, 
"Washington's environmental lobbies are unyielding." They know that 
regulatory reform is needed to establish accurate methods of risk 
assessment, proscribe unfunded mandates, and protect private property 
rights, but they refuse to admit it. Rather than harness the time-tested 
incentives of the free enterprise system in the service of their mission, 
they remain blindly committed to government intervention. "Washington 
environmental lobbyists steadfastly oppose risk assessment, relief from 
unfunded mandates, and greater protection of property," Adler observes. 
"Environmentalists do not see that the public's interest in economic 
common sense and fairness is compatible with support for a clean 
environment."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Without meaningful reform, however, regulators will continue to target 
risks that have "public relations or political value," in the process 
spending "millions of dollars that do comparatively little to improve 
public health and environmental quality." They will continue to impose 
unfunded mandates on state and local governments, with the result that 
"local priorities must be subordinated to Washington's dictates." And they 
will continue to issue environmental regulations that "override private 
land-use decisions," thereby violating the "takings clause" of the Fifth 
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

<title>Duplantier: MARDI GRAS -- 2/20/96</title>

<h2>Mardi Gras</h2>


<i><blockquote>
Today is Mardi Gras in New Orleans. As tractors tow the papier-mache 
and crepe-covered floats of the Rex parade down oak-lined St. Charles 
Avenue to Canal Street, parade-goers of all ages will shout their 
traditional plea to the trinket-laden riders: "Throw me something, 
Mister!"
</blockquote></i>

<P>
Everyone's a beggar on Carnival Day in New Orleans, pandering for 
handouts that come in the form of cast-metal doubloons, strings of 
multicolored beads, and oversized plastic cigars, toothbrushes and other 
oddities. It's a day of self-indulgence, and it's all in fun, but it takes 
hundreds of well-trained policemen, posted at every corner of the six-
mile parade route, to keep the merriment from getting out of hand. As 
much as New Orleanians love their Mardi Gras, you'd be hardpressed to 
find anyone who isn't glad to see it end on Ash Wednesday, the 
beginning of Lent.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Imagine people hanging out in the streets all year long waiting for 
someone to toss them a few freebies, having nothing better to do in the 
meantime other than look for ways to get into trouble. A single day of 
community-wide excess may serve as a relief valve for the pressures that 
build up during the year, but socially-sanctioned self-indulgence on a 
continuing basis makes no sense at all. Yet, that's just what we have with 
our federal welfare system.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation argues that welfare "reduces 
work effort and promotes illegitimacy and poverty-prone single-parent 
families." The government dole is "extremely efficient at replacing self-
sufficiency with dependence, but relatively ineffective in raising incomes 
and eliminating poverty." Welfare is especially detrimental to children -- 
increasing the dropout rate and the unwed pregnancy and delinquency 
rates, and reducing longterm earning potential.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Foreign aid is nothing more than international welfare -- a global, year-
long Carnival -- and the effects are just as harmful. "Not only has the 
U.S. foreign aid program failed to promote economic growth in less 
developed countries, but many recipient countries are worse off because 
of it," say Bryan Johnson and Thomas Sheehy, also of the Heritage 
Foundation. They argue that, "instead of helping poor countries lift 
themselves out of poverty, aid often impedes their economic growth 
while damaging their fragile economies."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Maybe it's time the federal government took a tip from the City of New 
Orleans. If the politicians in Washington are determined to continue 
offering handouts and encouraging self-destructive behavior, let them 
confine this madness to a single day of the year. Let all the recipients of 
government largesse -- from individual entitlements to corporate 
subsidies to foreign aid -- gather in Washington for an annual one-day 
blowout. Let them jockey for position along the streets of the nation's 
capital as they wait for costumed congressmen to roll past on decorated 
floats. Let them all scream "Throw me something, Mister!" at the top of 
their lungs and fight among themselves for the goodies tossed their way. 
Then they can go home and behave themselves for the rest of the year.

<h2> NEA Resolutions </h2><p>                           




<i>The National Education Association maintains one of thefive largest federal Political Action Committees in the country. The teachers union donated 99 percent of its PAC money to the Democrats in 1994 It's important to know, then, where this influential group stands on various issues.</i><p>


Ninety-one percent of the nine thousand delegates attending the NEA convention in Washington DC over the July Fourth weekend voted to endorse Bill Clinton for reelection as President of the United States. Clinton was on hand to accept the NEA's Friend of Education Award, and to present his plan for education reform, which included Internet access for every public school classroom in America, tax credits for anyone wanting to attend a-cornmunity college, and a $10 million program to combat truancy. The President proposed financial penalties for mothers and fathers who miss parent-teacher conferences, or whose children skip classes. He also recommended that the government provide "intensive counseling" for such parents.<p>

Resolutions approved at the 1996 NEA Convention were more circumspect than last year's bombshells, but they still exhibited hostility to traditional values and the rights of parents. Needless to say, the delegates called for increased federal funding for public education, in particular for programs designed to alleviate "sexual orientation discrimination." They argued that the "immigration status of students or their parents" should have no bearing on eligibility for public school attendance. And they insisted that privatization, performance contracting, tuition tax credits, and voucher plans are "detrimental to public education and must be eliminated."<p>

NEA delegates endorsed "early childhood education programs in the public schools for children from birth through age eight." Such programs would include "a full continuum of services for parents and children, including child care, child development, developmentally appropriate and diversity-based curricula, special education. and anorooriate bias-free screening devices."<p>

 

NEA delegates asserted an "increasingly important role" for public schools in providing sex education. "Teachers and health professionals," they contend, "must be legally protected from censorship and lawsuits." Otherwise, they might have to think twice about offering instruction in birth control usage and perverted sexual techniques. "To facilitate the realization of human potential," the delegates proclaimed, "it is the right of every individual to live in an environment of freely available information, knowledge, and wisdom about sexuality." The delegates also called for "comprehensive AIDS education programs as an integral part of the school curriculum."<p>

The NEA insists that homeschooling students "meet all state requirements. Instruction should be by persons who are licensed by the appropriate state education licensure agency, and a curriculum approved by the state department of education should be used." Less adamant about holding its own members responsible, the teachers union opposes "standardized testing that is mandated by local, state, or national authority [and] the use of these tests to compare one student, staff member, school, or district with another." Not surprisingly, NEA delegates resolved that "competency testing must not be used as a condition of employment, license retention, evaluation, placement, ranking, or promotion of licensed teachers."<p>

the Looming North Korean Nuclear Threat," January 29, 1992.)

<P>

     South Korea's new Foreign Minister, Han Sung-joo, arrives in
Washington this week for talks with the Clinton Administration. This
visit comes at a critical time. Bill Clinton is being tested by the
world's longest-ruling Stalinist dictator, North Korea's 80-year-old
Kim Il-sung. The North Korean dictator signalled his apparent
determination to build nuclear weapons when on March 11 North Korea
announced its decision to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-proliferation
Treaty (NPT) -- the first country ever to do so. Evidence is mounting
that a North Korean nuclear weapon may be imminent. On February 24,
Central Intelligence Director James Woolsey said, there is a "real
possibility that North Korea has already manufactured enough fissile
material for at least one nuclear weapon." 
<P>
     The cost of failing to stop North Korea from obtaining nuclear
weapons is high. At the very minimum, it may prompt an Asian nuclear
arms race, and at worst, North Korea might sell nuclear weapons to
Middle East terrorists, who could threaten Americans abroad and at
home. The Clinton Administration must treat North Korea's nuclear
challenge as a serious threat to global peace. Halting North Korea's
nuclear program, while also avoiding a war on the Korean peninsula,
must now be Clinton's first priority in Asia. 
<P>

NUCLEAR THREAT IMMINENT?
<P>     The United States and its allies must recognize that North Korea
could very soon have one or more nuclear weapons. U.S. intelligence
sources were hinting in early 1992 that North Korea could have a
nuclear weapon by mid-1993. Recent public statements by the new
Director of Central Intelligence are consistent with his predecessor's
assessment. Some South Korean government sources indicate that the
North already may have more than one nuclear weapon. 
<P>
     Regardless of these estimates, it is well known that North Korea
is working hard to build a bomb. Its nuclear research facility is
located near Yongbyon, about sixty miles north of the capital,
Pyongyang. At this site are two nuclear reactors capable of producing
plutonium. A 30 megawatt reactor completed in 1987 may have been
producing 15 pounds of plutonium a year, enough for one Hiroshima-size
bomb. A larger 200 megawatt reactor may be completed this year --
capable of producing 100 pounds of plutonium a year. Yongbyon is also
known to have technology to reprocess plutonium into nuclear weapons
material. Besides the Yongbyon facility, recent defectors say, North
Korea has underground nuclear research facilities. 
<P>
     North Korea's possession of nuclear weapons would greatly enhance
the threat posed by its 1.1 million-strong armed forces. In addition
to 700 combat aircraft, North Korea soon may have a long-range missile
to deliver nuclear warheads. With possible Libyan funding, North Korea
is completing a modified Russian Scud ballistic missile with a 600-
mile range. From North Korea, this missile could reach Beijing,
Khabarovsk in Russia, Osaka in Japan, and all of South Korea. Nuclear
weapons enable North Korea to pose a number of regional and global
threats. They are:
<P>
Threats to Korea: Most directly threatened would be the 43 million
     South Koreans and the 37,000 U.S. troops there to help deter a
     North Korean attack. With nuclear weapons, North Korea can
     perpetuate its communist system and the division of the Korean
     nation. 
<P>
Blackmail: North Korea could use its nuclear weapons capability to
     pressure South Korea and Japan into making political concessions,
     such as removing U.S. military forces from their territory.
<P>
Nuclear proliferation: Pyongyang's status as a nuclear power would
     encourage South Korea and Japan to obtain nuclear weapons to
     defend themselves.
<P>
Threats to Israel: North Korea is an economic basket case. It can earn
     badly needed cash by selling nuclear weapons to radical Middle
     Eastern countries like Iran, Libya, and Syria -- which already
     have purchased North Korean Scud missiles.
<P>
Nuclear terrorism: North Korea also could market its destructive wares
     to terrorist groups bent on bombing American and other Western
     cities. North Korea, after all, is an experienced and
     enthusiastic practitioner of state terrorism. It blew up a South
     Korean airliner and its 115 passengers in 1987, and killed 21
     people while trying to assassinate South Korean President Chun
     Do-whan during a 1983 visit to Burma.
<P>

LIMITS OF DIPLOMACY
<P>
     North Korea's withdrawal from the NPT demonstrates the limits of
using diplomacy to end the nuclear threat posed by that country. For
three years now, South Korea, the U.S., Japan, Russia, and China have
cooperated diplomatically to convince North Korea to abandon its
nuclear weapons program. In 1991, for example, the U.S. withdrew its
tactical nuclear weapons from South Korea and agreed to suspend for
1992 the annual "Team Spirit" U.S.-ROK military exercises. In late
December 1991, North and South Korea signed an agreement that promised
unprecedented cooperation in political, economic, and cultural
relations. Pyongyang and Seoul signed a second agreement in December
1991 in which both nations pledged not to "test, produce, receive,
possess, store, deploy or use nuclear weapons," or to "possess
facilities for nuclear reprocessing and uranium enrichment." The
latter agreement also promised to establish a commission to organize
inspections by each side of facilities suspected of possessing nuclear
capabilities.
<P>
     North Korea, however, has failed to observe these agreements.
Wider economic and cultural contacts, which might undermine the rule
of Kim Il-sung, have not been allowed to flourish. North Korea remains
a totalitarian state whose 21 million people suffer the burden of a
steadily worsening economy. Recent visitors report power blackouts in
Pyongyang, and the government exhorts its people to eat less and less
as reports of food shortages abound. Notwithstanding, Kim Il-sung
maintains his massive military forces and goes on pouring scarce
resources into his nuclear program.
<P>
     Pyongyang also refuses to fulfill its part of the 1991 North-
South nuclear agreement. To date, the North has refused the South's
invitation to inspect any of its facilities which Pyongyang believes
to possess nuclear material. It also has denied access to North Korea
by South Korean inspectors. Last year North Korea allowed six
inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a United
Nations-affiliated agency charged with preventing diversion of nuclear
materials for military purposes. But Washington and Seoul felt that
these were not enough. Hence the request for access by South Korean
inspectors. Seoul's fears apparently are well-founded. Late last year
North Korea refused a seventh round of IAEA inspections, apparently
fearing the discovery of its nuclear weapons program. After the IAEA
on February 25 set a one-month deadline for Pyongyang to respond to
the IAEA's request for inspections, the North Koreans answered by
withdrawing from the NPT on March 11.
<P>
AMERICAN LEADERSHIP NEEDED
<P>
     If North Korea ignores the IAEA's March 25 deadline, the U.S.
should begin a campaign to end North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
On March 25, South Korea's new Foreign Minister, Han Sung-joo, will
arrive in Washington for consultations with the Clinton
Administration. To underscore the gravity of this issue, Bill Clinton
should reassure Foreign Minister Han of America's commitment to defend
South Korea and state his determination to end North Korea's nuclear
threat. A comprehensive program to end North Korea's nuclear threat
should include:
<P>
Diplomatic carrots: Clinton should declare that immediate North Korean
     resumption of IAEA inspections and near-term initiation of
     unrestricted North-South mutual nuclear inspections are
     preconditions for improved U.S.-North Korean relations,
     particularly in the area of trade.
<P>
United Nations action: Washington and Seoul should lead an effort in
     the U.N. Security Council to focus world attention on North
     Korea's withdrawal from the NPT and its nuclear weapons program.
     Because time is critical, Washington should urge the U.N.
     Security Council to establish a deadline for North Korea's
     compliance with the NPT. If this deadline is missed, the U.N.
     should consider sanctions against North Korea.
<P>
Economic pressure: Washington should consult with Seoul, Tokyo,
     Moscow, and Beijing on the range of possible economic sanctions
     against Pyongyang. Seoul already has stopped business investments
     in North Korea. Possible economic sanctions should include
     suspension by all nations of investment and trade with North
     Korea. 
<P>
Pressure on China: Washington should enlist Seoul and Tokyo in a
     campaign to convince Beijing of their common interest in imposing
     economic and political sanctions against an unrepentant North
     Korea. Chinese cooperation on economic sanctions will be
     critical, as North Korea now conducts most of its trade with
     China. However, on March 12, China blocked a U.N. Security
     Council effort to condemn Pyongyang's withdrawal from the NPT.
     The U.S. should make it clear to China that the strength or
     weakness of Washington's political and economic relations with
     Beijing will depend on its cooperation in stopping North Korea's
     nuclear weapons program.
<P>
Military options: War against North Korea would devastate the Korean
     peninsula and must be avoided at every reasonable cost. But South
     Korea must be defended. Washington should offer to upgrade South
     Korean defenses with such modern weapons as Patriot missile-
     interceptors and the J-STARS radar aircraft, which can observe
     North Korean troop movements. Despite looming Pentagon budget
     cuts, the U.S. should not reduce its 37,000 troops now in the
     ROK.  

<P>
CLINTON'S TOUGH TEST
<P>
     Since 1950, successful management of U.S.-Korean relations has
been a mark of successful U.S. Presidents. The last to stumble, Jimmy
Carter -- who sought premature U.S. troop reductions from South Korea
-- damaged both America's reputation in Asia and his own. Bill Clinton
now faces a much tougher test in seeking to end North Korean's nuclear
weapons threat. 
<P>
     With one-twentieth of its population in the military, Pyongyang
is well-armed. The addition of nuclear weapons to its arsenal
qualifies North Korea as extremely dangerous. It should be remembered
that its current ruler, Kim Il-sung, started the Korean War in 1950.
Since then he has threatened South Korea with border provocations and
terrorist attacks. The difference now is that Kim Il-sung may soon
have nuclear weapons, and at the age of 80, may have far less to lose
today than he did in 1950. 
<P>
     Kim Il-sung's bloody determination should remind Americans of
Saddam Hussein, whom the U.S. mistakenly underestimated before the
Persian Gulf War. If the U.S. and its allies treat Kim Il-sung as they
did Saddam Hussein, America's position as the world's major power,
Asia's peace and prosperity, and Bill Clinton's reputation will all be
at risk.
<P>

<title>Duplantier: CORELESS CURRICULA -- 6/06/96</title>

<h2> Coreless Curricula </h2>


<i><blockquote>


"In demolishing the notion of a relatively stable body of knowledge, a 
traditional set of disciplines to which developing thinkers must 
apprentice themselves, [American universities] have invited their 
students, though half-formed and ill educated, to indulge in a fantasy of 
their own extravagant powers." </blockquote></i>
<P>

In the Spring issue of the Manhattan Institute's "City Journal," 
contributing editor Kay Hymowitz examines the American university 
system and laments "the complete disappearance of a fixed, coherent 
curriculum and with it any shared notion of the well-educated man or 
woman. All that once ordered higher education -- requirements, majors, 
the traditional disciplines, the core curriculum -- is vanishing into the 
chaos of postmodernism. The structured, comprehensive, directed course 
of study has been replaced by a "do-your-own-thing curriculum."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

How do the universities explain this great shirking of their responsibility, 
and the intellectual aimlessness to which they've condemned a 
generation? It's all for the best, they say. They did it on purpose! "The 
college brochures yield plenty of examples of how the academy has tried 
to transform the shattering of the curriculum into a boon for students," 
reports Hymowitz. These glitzy sales packets promise the unformed, 
undisciplined student suffocating amounts of the very things he doesn't 
need: "flexibility, openness, independence, freedom." By encouraging 
their students to believe that "they can, in all their ripe perfection, step 
outside society and each create his own one-man culture," the 
universities renounce their very reason for being, which is to encourage 
breadth of learning and an appreciation for the interconnectedness of 
things. <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"The sheer proliferation of courses . . . amplifies the illusion of 
undergraduate freedom," says Hymowitz, adding that "the hundreds of 
thousands of choices available to students stretch the distribution 
requirement to the borders of triviality." Even when a student is required 
to take a specified number of courses from each of certain broad 
categories -- such as humanities, sciences, and social sciences -- he can 
satisfy the requirement with courses so lame or esoteric that he fails to 
acquire even an overview of the discipline.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


"The myth of the college brochure begins with an illusory student: not 
just independent but self-motivated, passionate, self-aware, well-
informed. Consider instead the reality of the college student just 
graduated from an American public school," Hymowitz urges. "Surveys 
suggest he knows little about, among many other things, American 
history. Does he ponder his ignorance in this area and sign up for an 
American history course? Of course not. The libertarian curriculum 
neglects the obvious: the student doesn't know what he doesn't know. 
Further, he doesn't know what he needs to know to be a well-informed 
member of society. That's why someone invented required courses."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The rapidly multiplying menu of course offerings perpetuates "the 
mystique of specialization, which renders archaic the entire notion of a 
shared world of knowledge," says Kay Hymowitz. "Such an approach, 
with its glorification of unencumbered autonomy and individual choice, 
provides no foundation for social solidarity and active citizenship."

<h2>
Education Reform
</h2>



<P><blockquote><i>  
According to a national opinion poll conducted by USA Today in 
January, the quality of education in our country is the number-one 
concern for most Americans.
</blockquote></i>


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The quality of education in America is declining because "power in 
educational public policy rests with the producers, not the consumers," 
says Charles Greenawalt of the Commonwealth Foundation in 
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. "Public education should serve the public 
interest and be accountable for its performance, but this is not the case." 
The education establishment "possesses near-monopoly control of this 
area of public policy." Greenawalt argues that the primary objective of 
this establishment is "not to improve and strengthen their performance, 
but to preserve itself, its clout, the status quo, and the resources at its 
disposal. This status quo is facilitated by complex layers of local, state, 
and federal regulations that apply to the schools and are implemented by 
overstaffed and generally unresponsive school district bureaucracies."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Greenawalt calls for "major shifts of authority and control over resources 
from producers to consumers and from experts to civilians. This means 
giving parents, taxpayers, elected officials, and community leaders far 
greater say over what schools need to accomplish, how the schools will 
be held accountable for this task, and how children and schools will be 
matched with one another." One way to do this is by "breaking vast 
school systems into smaller and more manageable units," says 
Greenawalt. "Consolidation in many areas has gone too far [resulting in] 
numerous school districts that are too large . . . to educate students 
effectively."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For our educational system to be successful again, there must be 
reasonable standards of performance for students and teachers, genuine 
competition among the schools, and a renewed sense of professionalism 
among educators. Standards must "spell out in clear, unambiguous terms 
what students should learn and be able to do before they graduate," says 
Greenawalt. For standards to be effective, there must be "reliable and 
accurate assessments of student and school performance vis-a-vis those 
standards [which presupposes] trustworthy information about student 
performance [and] accountability mechanisms that will invoke 
meaningful consequences for all school personnel."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Noting that "children differ substantially in learning styles, temperament, 
and personal preference," Greenawalt argues that, "rather than attempting 
to standardize all schools, the state should welcome and promote 
educational diversity or pluralism. Let schools compete with one another 
based on their distinctive programs." According to Greenawalt, "School 
choice is an essential element for any comprehensive educational reform 
that is to be meaningful and long-lived. Families must be able to select 
their children's schools from a broad and varied array of choices."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Greenawalt says that teachers need to start thinking of themselves as 
individuals again. "Uniform salary schedules that treat everyone alike, 
regardless of performance, have no place in a true profession," he argues. 
"Likewise, the ability to strike and the presence of lifetime tenure are also 
antithetical to true professionalism. Schools must be operated for the 
benefit of their consumers -- the students -- not their producers."

<h2>Flat Tax </h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
"Americans are tired of our oppressive tax code and they want a new 
system. But to get there, they need an honest and open debate. They're 
not getting it from the politicians and the media."
</i></blockquote>


<P> 
Having recognized that they could no longer ignore the subject of the 
flat tax, the mainstream media have recently resorted to their second-
favorite tactic: misrepresenting the issue. They claim that the flat 
tax will hurt homeowners by eliminating the deduction for mortgage 
interest. They suggest that the flat tax will send philanthropy into a 
free fall by eliminating the deduction for charitable giving. They say 
that the flat tax isn't even a tax cut -- and, if it is, well, then, 
it's a tax cut that favors the rich! 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 Congressman Dick Armey of Texas thinks it's time to set the record 
straight on the flat tax. The House Majority Leader insists that, no 
matter what the media may say, the flat tax is indeed a tax cut: "With 
a flat tax the middle class will pay less in taxes, their wages will 
increase, and they will keep more of what they earn to save and invest 
in their families." If that's not a tax cut, what is it? 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The media attempt to foment class envy, but that doesn't change the 
fact that the flat tax does indeed tax investment income. "What it 
doesn't do," says Armey, "is tax it twice." Businesses will continue 
to pay taxes under a flat tax system. Since corporate income taxes are 
paid, ultimately, by investors, the current tax on investment income 
is actually a second tax on the same income. "Under a flat tax," says 
Armey, "all income, including investment income, is taxed once and 
only once." Why should investors be required, as they are now, to pay 
tax on income that's already been taxed? 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The media resort to scare tactics to unnerve the middle-class 
mortgage-holder, but the fact remains that "the flat tax is good for 
homeowners." Armey argues that the flat tax will "lower interest 
rates, reduce mortgage payments, and put more money in the pockets of 
working Americans." Lower rates, lower payments, more money left over 
-- how can that be bad? 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The media cynically assume that deductibility drives donations, but 
Armey argues that "the flat tax will not reduce charitable giving. 
Americans don't consult their tax tables and accountants before 
helping their neighbors in need. As our family incomes increase, so 
too will our generosity." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It doesn't matter what the mainstream media say, because the flat tax 
is an idea whose time has come. Congressman Dick Armey maintains that 
the flat tax is "bigger than any politician. It's bigger than any 
political party. And it's bigger than the Washington establishment. It 
belongs to the American people." Armey argues that "class-warfare 
rhetoric" and "narrow, special-interest propaganda" will only delay 
the day of reckoning. "The American people," he says, "deserve an 
open, honest debate on tax reform. Right now."

Duplantier</a> <br>December 4, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Anti-religious Bigotry Rampant in Hollywood</h2></center><P>
[A new documentary offers numerous examples of the anti-religious 
bigotry that is rampant in Hollywood.] 
 <p>
"For years now, the entertainment industry has attacked our faith and 
undermined our value system," observes Dr. James Dobson of Focus on 
the Family, in his introduction to a new documentary entitled Hollywood 
vs. Religion. "The entire Judeo-Christian tradition is ridiculed." The 
hour-long video tape is narrated by Michael Medved, New York Post 
film critic and co-host of the PBS program called Sneak Previews.  He 
examines more than 50 contemporary films that lampoon the religious 
beliefs of the American people. Unfortunately, this is just a sampling.  <p>
"There are a great many other movies that also mock our faith," says 
Dobson. 
 <p>
According to Medved, Hollywood's hostility toward religion is a fairly 
recent development. Showing heartwarming scenes of Spencer Tracy in 
Boys Town, Bing Crosby in The Bells of St. Mary's, and Julie Andrews 
in The Sound of Music.  Medved notes that "this tradition of taking a 
positive view of the clergy and the faithful continued well into the l960s." <p>
But the film world has lost its fondness for the faith.  "Today, by contrast, 
moviemakers will stretch to insert images of vicious clergymen or crazed 
killer Christians,'' says Medved.  They'll even go so far as to introduce 
vicious stereotypes into remakes of old films -- such as The Blob and 
Cape Fear -- where none existed before. 
 <p>
What are the stereotypes? Here's how Hollywood views the world of 
religion: "The Catholic Church is linked to the Mafia. Evangelical 
believers are suckers and dupes. In their hearts, many Christians want to 
take over the country and establish a dictatorship. Orthodox Jews are 
hypocrites.  Agnostics, on the other hand, are wise, wonderful people." <p>
Hollywood will bend over backwards not to offend the fringe elements of 
society, but the cherished beliefs of the vast majority of Americans are 
fair game. "Only the sensibilities of mainstream Western religious groups 
are repeatedly ignored." says Medved. "And many films send the 
unmistakable message that higher truth can only be found outside the 
teaching of all organized faith." 
 <p>
Everything in Hollywood is carefully calculated, says Medved, and that 
includes the anti-religious imagery that we are seeing more and more of: 
"It's no accident when filmmakers show us so many villains who happen 
to be religious," he observes.  Why do they do it?  Directors and 
producers like to claim that they're only giving the public what it wants, 
but the box-office failure of such offensive movies as The Last 
Temptation of Christ puts the lie to this claim. More than three dozen 
films featuring repugnant religious stereotypes have come out of 
Hollywood in recent years. "Almost all of these movies ended up losing 
money," says Medved. The real reason that such films continue to be 
made is that they reflect the mindset of a "tightly knit community whose 
members happen to share some similar, unspoken values and biases. And 
one of those biases involves sincere and deep-seated contempt for 
organized religion."

<html><head><title> Duplantier:  MULTICULTURALISM A STEP BACK</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><center><h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES </h4><i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/duplbio.html">F.R. Duplantier</a> <brNovember 14, 1995 <br></i><hr><h2>Multiculturalism is A Step Back</h2></center><P>



[Multiculturalism is the new pet theory of academicians and policy 
planners, but the evidence indicates that cultural diversity often leads to 
social conflict, retards economic progress, and restricts personal 
freedom.]
<p>
                      

The freedom that leads to economic growth is more likely to be found in 
a homogenous society, says Gerald Scully of the National Center for 
Policy Analysis. "Economic freedom and rule of law are fundamental for 
high levels of economic growth," contends Scully. "Security of property, 
freedom of contract, and free market exchange promote capital formation 
and, hence. economic growth. A legal system based on law rather than 
men's whims stabilizes the rules under which resources are allocated." 
<p>Without individual freedom and a legal system that protects it, 
"transforming poor nations into rich nations is virtually impossible." 
says Scully. Poor nations are often characterized by cultural diversitv. 
which leads to "social conflict," a loss of freedom. and a stagnant 
economy.
<p>
All the various immigrant groups that came to America brought with 
them their "own culture, some elements of which were thought to be 
inconsistent with American values." Scully notes that. until recently, our 
national policy was "to homogenize immigrants -- to make them speak 
English and disabuse them of radical political beliefs." As long as we 
maintained this policy. we "managed cultural conflict better than the rest 
of the world." says Scully. "The tension of absorbing different cultures 
through immigration has been partly diffused because of institutions that 
protect individual freedom. and because attempts have been made to 
bring immigrants into the cultural mainstream."
<p>
The problem with multicultural societies is that "the ethnocentric 
differences of race, religion, ethnicity and language often lead to 
enmity." The violence in Northern Ireland. the separatist movement in 
Quebec. the terrorism in Palestine, the ethnic rioting in India -- all are 
manifestations of multicultural madness. "Even if different groups live 
together peacefully," Scully contends, "the lack of a common language 
and common norms reduces cooperation" and drives up the cost of 
commerce.
<p>
Imposing socialist policies can retard economic growth in any society, of 
course, but in multicultural societies "intergroup conflict may result in 
additional economic inefficiency, lower the growth rate, and even turn 
violent. Hostilities make property insecure. which slows the rate of 
capital accumulation. Eventually, in culturally diverse societies, one 
cultural group tends to dominate and to suppress violence and manage 
enmity." That domination generally takes the form of "discriminatory 
restrictions on occupational choice? denial of educational opportunities, 
licensing of trade, confiscation of land, nationalization of business, 
restrictions on property [and] exchange and mobilitv restrictions," all of 
which have an adverse economic impact on society as a whole.
<p>
Scully laments the passing of America's "melting pot" method of 
assimilating immigrants, which combined "disparate elements into a 
common substance." The common rights we shared as individuals, no 
matter what our ethnic origin, are now being replaced by "group rights." 
<p>This is a dangerous development, "because emphasizing our cultural 
differences may exacerbate intergroup enmity and lead to social 
breakdown."

<a href="#conc">Conclusion</a><br>
<hr>

If the budget battles with Congress do not keep him in Washington, President 
Bill Clinton will travel to Osaka, Japan, this weekend to meet with leaders 
from Asia and the Americas to discuss trade and investment in the Asia 
Pacific region. They will meet under the auspices of the forum for Asia 
Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC, an organization of Asian and 
Pacific Rim economies dedicated to liberalizing trade and investment.   The 
members of APEC have pledged to create a free trade and investment area in 
Asia and the Pacific Rim by 2020.
<P>
However, this dream may be shattered if China, Japan, and some other APEC 
members get their way. Their unwillingness to open their agricultural markets 
may suffocate the once-bright promise, made by APEC in 1994, to achieve 
"free and open trade and investment in the Asia Pacific" region. This would 
represent a severe setback for regional trade liberalization. President Clinton 
and the other leaders at the APEC summit should agree that liberalization will 
be comprehensive, including the liberalization of agricultural trade, or the 
hope for free trade in Asia may wither.
<P>
APEC's backsliding is mainly the fault of the Japanese. Unlike President 
Suharto of Indonesia, who hosted the Leaders' Meeting in 1994, Japanese 
Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama has been unwilling to develop a 
consensus plan for making good on the promise of free trade which APEC 
made at its last meeting in Bogor, Indonesia, in 1994. Instead, the Japanese 
government has proposed that APEC members be permitted to exempt so-
called sensitive sectors of their economies from trade liberalization. 
According to the Japanese, the most sensitive sector of all is agriculture. 
China and some other Asian countries are siding with Japan against the U.S., 
while Australia and Canada, among others, support the American position.
<P>
APEC is critical to America's economic future. It serves an institutional link 
between the U.S. and the fast-growing Asian economies. It also is a hedge 
against the formation of an Asia-only trading bloc. APEC encompasses nearly 
50 percent of the world's population, 60 percent of its gross domestic product, 
and 40 percent of its trade flows. U.S. two-way merchandise trade with APEC 
members was $772 billion in 1994 -- 65.6 percent of worldwide U.S. trade or 
11.4 percent of U.S. gross domestic product. In 1994, American investment in 
APEC economies was $202 billion, and APEC foreign investment in the U.S. 
was $163 billion. APEC's goal of free and open trade and investment is 
consistent with long-standing American policy supporting trade liberalization 
around the world.
<P>
Free trade and investment is too important to America's future to let APEC die 
because of irresponsible behavior in Japan and protectionism in other 
countries. Therefore, while in Osaka, President Clinton should:
<ul>
<li>Tell Japanese Prime Minister Murayama that selective exemptions to APEC 
trade liberalization are unacceptable and threaten America's vital national 
interest in trade liberalization in Asia.
<P>
<li>Work closely with the leaders of Australia, Canada, Chile, Indonesia, and 
New Zealand to block Japan's protectionism. These leaders should urge Japan 
to accelerate implementing Uruguay Round trade liberalization commitments 
while seeking new agreements on antidumping, competition policy, product 
standards and testing, and investment protection.
<P>
<li>Make clear that blocking or delaying comprehensive APEC trade 
liberalization would undermine APEC's institutional credibility. Backsliding 
on free trade at Osaka could ring the death knell for APEC as an organization.
<P>
<li>Support Taiwan's accession to the World Trade Organization if the issue is 
raised bilaterally by the Taiwanese.
</ul><P>
<a name="bogor"></a>
JAPAN'S ACTIONS SINCE BOGOR
<P>
As host of this year's APEC Leaders' Meeting, Japan must chair all 
preparatory meetings and work with senior officials from all APEC members 
to develop a consensus on the summit's agenda. The main challenge is to 
decide how to implement the Bogor Declaration for free and open trade and 
investment in the Asia Pacific region for developed members by 2010 and for 
developing members by 2020.
<P>
The performance of Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama in fulfilling 
this vital role has been unsatisfactory. Murayama's unpopular Socialist-Liberal 
Democrat coalition government has been unwilling to undertake any bold 
trade liberalization initiatives to move the APEC agenda forward. The 
Japanese government sought to deflect APEC away from trade liberalization 
in February 1995 by proposing a "Partners for Progress" scheme that would 
turn APEC into little more than a regional conduit for foreign aid. The 
proposal would have established a new secretariat that would coordinate 
foreign aid by advanced APEC members to less developed members such as 
China or Papua New Guinea. Senior officials from other APEC members 
condemned Japan's "Partners for Progress" scheme as an unnecessary 
duplication of existing aid programs and as a distraction from trade 
liberalization. As U.S. Ambassador to APEC Sandra Kristoff remarked in 
February 1995, "the proposal raised in our minds some questions about 
whether it was duplicating ODA  activities already happening elsewhere." 
<P>
Japan later withdrew its "Partners for Progress" proposals, but it has failed to 
offer concrete proposals for APEC trade liberalization. Instead of taking 
action this year, Japan has suggested merely that APEC members wait until 
1996 to table their proposals for "concerted unilateral" and "collective" action 
at the Leaders' Meeting in the Philippines. 
<P>
More ominously, Japan has proposed that APEC members be permitted to 
exempt sensitive sectors of their economies, such as agriculture in Japan or 
clothing manufacturing in the U.S., from APEC trade liberalization. The 
Japanese proposal has become a flash point dividing APEC into two warring 
camps. One camp is led by Japan, which is unwillingly to open its agricultural 
markets beyond the concessions made in the Uruguay Round agreements. 
Supporting Japan is China, which not only seeks to maintain agricultural 
sector barriers, but also wants to protect broad sectors of manufactured goods. 
In the other camp are Australia, Canada, Chile, New Zealand, and the United 
States. These countries have vehemently rejected the Japanese proposal for 
exempting sectors from APEC trade liberalization. Most of the ASEAN 
countries, especially Indonesia and Singapore, also oppose Japan.
<P>
<a name="em"></a>
THE EMINENT PERSONS GROUP
<P>
During the last three years, the Eminent Persons Group (EPG) has provided 
APEC with a free trade vision and shaped its successful agenda. The EPG is 
an APEC-appointed advisory panel composed of one person from each APEC 
member and chaired by C. Fred Bergsten, a former U.S. Treasury official and 
executive director of the Washington-based Institute for International 
Economics.
<P>
In its first report, the EPG recommended "a bold, forward-looking and 
realistic vision for APEC: the progressive development of a community of 
Asia Pacific economies with free and open trade and investment."   The 
Leaders' Meeting near Seattle, Washington, in November 1993 accepted this 
challenge as APEC's goal. In its second report, the EPG recommended that 
"APEC now adopt a comprehensive program to realize the vision of free and 
open trade in the region... and complete the liberalization process by 2020."   
Responding to this challenge, the leaders agreed at their meeting in Bogor, 
Indonesia, on November 15, 1994, that APEC should achieve free and open 
trade and investment in the region by 2020.
<P>
On August 25, 1995, the EPG delivered its third annual report, Implementing 
the APEC Vision, recommending a series of practical steps to begin 
implementing the Bogor Declaration.
<P>
Step #1: Accelerating Uruguay Round Liberalization. The EPG suggests that 
all APEC members agree to accelerate the implementation of their Uruguay 
Round commitments based on the following principles:
<ul>
<li>Principle 1: Unlike preferential trade agreements such as the European Union 
or North America Free Trade Agreement whose trade liberalization benefits 
accrue to their members, APEC should offer the benefits of an accelerated 
liberalization timetable to all members of the World Trade Organization 
(WTO), including those that are not members of APEC. In other words, 
APEC members would not discriminate against other countries in trade 
policy.
<P>
<li>Principle 2: APEC members should adopt a "50 percent rule" under which 
they would cut in half the time for lowering tariffs, removing non-tariff 
barriers, or reforming domestic laws. For example, developed APEC 
members could speed the timetable for Uruguay Round tariff cuts from the 
current four years on most products to two years. Developing APEC members 
could slash the period for phasing out non-agricultural subsidies from eight to 
four years. 
</ul><P>

Step #2: Broadening and Deepening the Uruguay Round Agreements. The 
EPG recommends that Uruguay Round agreements be broadened in the 
following four areas:
<ul>
<li>Antidumping. The EPG finds that antidumping laws have been abused to 
protect domestic firms at the expense of consumers. Antidumping 
proceedings are biased because they consider only the interests of import-
competing firms and their workers, but not the interests of consumers and 
domestic firms dependent on imported supplies for production. They also 
penalize foreign competitors for normal business practices. For example, the 
legal standard for proving a domestic firm guilty of predatory pricing is far 
more stringent in most countries than the legal standard for finding a foreign 
competitor guilty of dumping cheap goods on a domestic market. Thus, the 
same pricing policies that are legal for domestic firms may be held illegal for 
their foreign rivals under antidumping laws. This is pure protectionism. The 
EPG recommends that APEC leaders commit themselves to eliminating such 
abusive uses of antidumping policy.
<P>
<li>Competition Policy. Competition policy encompasses the regulation of 
monopolies, mergers, cartels, and government aid to business firms. Many of 
the trade disputes in Asia arise from differences over competition policy. For 
example, the recent automotive trade dispute with Japan centered on whether 
the keiretsu system of interlocking equity, debt financing, and personnel 
sharing among Japanese companies prevented American suppliers from 
selling their auto parts and cars to Japan. Because the WTO does not deal with 
competition policy, the EPG has called on APEC members to cooperate in 
applying competition policy laws to reduce their differences over time.
<P>
<li>Product Standards and Testing. Product standards and testing can be used as 
protectionist devices. For example, Japan has refused to accept U.S. test data 
on medical equipment and requires American suppliers to conduct another 
round of tests in Japan before certifying their products. Multiple testing can be 
expensive and may deter manufacturers from offering some products in 
certain markets. The EPG recommends that APEC should negotiate 
agreements on standards and testing. It also suggests that all APEC members 
should accept the test data and product certification of any one member, so 
long as they are based on internationally recognized standards.
<P>
<li>Investment Protection. Private-sector investment has produced rapid 
economic growth in the Asia Pacific region. Improving protections for foreign 
investors will help to sustain this growth. The EPG recommends that APEC 
members strengthen their protection of investment in the areas where they fall 
short of international norms. For example, APEC economies should adopt the 
rules followed by NAFTA countries that prohibit imposing restrictions on the 
transfer of funds related to foreign investment such as profits, dividends, 
royalties, loan payments, and liquidations in freely convertible currencies. 
Moreover, APEC should minimize the use of performance requirements such 
as local content or trade balancing rules.   Such rules are inconsistent with the 
new WTO Agreement on Trade Related Investment Measures, which bans 
local content or trade balancing requirements. The EPG urges each member to 
adopt these accommodations and affirm them in a binding agreement among 
all APEC members.
</ul><P>
Step #3: Dispute Mediation Service. The EPG also has recommended that 
APEC create an official mechanism to settle regional trade clashes, to be 
known as the APEC Dispute Mediation Service. The EPG recognizes that 
many of the recent trade disputes in the Asia Pacific region involve subjects 
not covered by current WTO rules. One such subject is competition policy. 
The WTO has no jurisdiction to settle disputes in competition policy and 
other subjects that its rules do not cover. Had an APEC Dispute Mediation 
Service already been established, it could have helped diffuse the Japan-U.S. 
automotive trade wrangle that occurred earlier this year. By resolving disputes 
that the WTO cannot handle, an APEC Dispute Mediation Service would 
supplement and strengthen the WTO.

RESCUING THE OSAKA MEETING
<P>
The Japanese proposal for exempting certain sectors of the economy like 
agriculture would undermine the comprehensive free trade and investment 
regime envisioned by the Bogor Declaration. Once one member is permitted 
to exclude a sensitive sector, other members will follow suit with their own 
protectionist demands. If Japan gets its way, APEC free trade would be more 
the exception than the rule.
<P>
President Clinton must not let any country undermine APEC's bright promise. 
Therefore, he should:
<ul>
<li>Tell Japanese Prime Minister Murayama that selective exemptions to APEC 
trade liberalization are unacceptable and threaten America's vital national 
interest in trade liberalization in Asia. The U.S. cannot accept an APEC trade 
liberalization regime that excludes sectors such as agriculture where 
Americans excel. In an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald on 
November 6, U.S. Ambassador to APEC Sandra Kristoff said, "To provide for 
sector exclusions because of domestic sensitivities would be to turn Bogor on 
its head and to call into serious question the continued interest of many of us 
to participate." 
<P>
<li>Work closely with the leaders of Australia, Canada, Chile, Indonesia, and 
New Zealand to block Japan's protectionism. The U.S. is fortunate that most 
other APEC members disagree with the Japanese proposal. President Suharto, 
who views the Bogor Declaration as his legacy, once again may play a key 
role in bridging the division and building a consensus in Osaka. The U.S. 
should support his efforts if he does.
<P>
<li>Make clear that blocking or delaying comprehensive APEC trade 
liberalization would undermine APEC's institutional credibility. Asia's 
economies have benefited greatly from trade liberalization since World War 
II. Without credible international institutions promoting free trade, 
liberalization and the ensuing economic boom in Asia would not have 
occurred. Calling for special exemptions would rob APEC of needed 
credibility in pushing for free trade in the Asia Pacific region.
<P>
<li>Support Taiwan's accession to the World Trade Organization if the issue is 
raised bilaterally by the Taiwanese. The WTO accession issue likely will not 
be raised by Taiwan in the plenary session of the APEC Leaders' Meeting. It is 
possible, however, that Taiwan's representative will do so in informal bilateral 
meetings with the U.S. In that case, the U.S. should be supportive. Taiwan's 
membership in the WTO should not be held hostage to the People's Republic 
of China's membership in the WTO. Once Taipei meets the WTO's standards, 
it should be allowed to join. Taiwan's membership in the WTO would 
contribute to the overall goal of trade liberalization in the Asia Pacific region.
</ul><P><a name="conc"></a>

CONCLUSION
<P>
APEC is at a crossroads. If Japan is successful in gaining selective 
exemptions to trade liberalization, APEC will lose credibility as an institution 
and will be unable to achieve its dream of "free trade and investment in the 
Asia Pacific" by 2020. President Clinton must fight the Japanese proposal for 
granting selective exemptions and insist upon comprehensive trade and 
investment liberalization in APEC. The U.S. has a number of allies in this 
dispute, especially President Suharto of Indonesia. If the U.S. can join with 
Australia, Canada, Chile, Indonesia, New Zealand, and Singapore to 
overcome the reluctance of Japan, China, and some other countries, APEC 
may lead the world toward a bright future of growing trade and economic 
prosperity.<hr>

<h2>Crime Decline</h2>


<i><blockquote>
It's an article of faith among liberals that prison sentences are no 
deterrent to criminal behavior, but statistics prove that would-be 
lawbreakers do consider the likelihood of punishment before resorting to 
crime.</blockquote></i>

<P>
Attorney Bruce Fein reports that "punishing and stigmatizing criminals 
is working. Violent crime is tumbling as prison populations swell, chain 
gangs are returning for serious offenders, three-time felons confront 
mandatory life sentences, juveniles are treated as adults for the 
commission of murderous crimes, shame is a growing feature of novel 
punishments, and parole is falling into disrepute."


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
That's the good news, says Fein, in a recent Washington Times editorial. 
"The bad news is that the mass media and so-called penal experts are 
generally displaying fierce resistance to the good news." They don't want 
to relinquish their moral superiority. They can't bear to admit that the 
soft-hearted and fuzzy-headed policies they supported for so many years 
were monumental failures. They refuse to concede that common sense 
really does work. Fein says these superior beings are infatuated with 
rehabilitation programs and committed to fighting "the alleged 'root' 
causes of crime, i.e., poverty, unemployment, malparenting, ill 
education, and discrimination." Ideology keeps them from 
"acknowledging the obvious" and forces them to resort to 
"unconstructive whining" over get-tough policies.


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Bruce Fein concedes that "violent crime remains intolerably high." But 
the recent decline is "a welcome relief" from the skyrocketing rates of the 
1960s and 1970s. "During those Great Society decades, treatment and 
rehabilitation were [misrepresented] as inexpensive and enlightened 
answers to crime, and criminal behavior was generally blamed on 
societal ills or psychiatric ailments." Fein contends that these misguided 
notions led to lighter sentences for convicted felons, and that such 
leniency served only to embolden the criminally inclined. Gradually, this 
sentimentalized view of the criminal as victim infected the general 
population, undermining the "cultural deterrence of crime" as manifested 
by "ostracism or community debasement of criminals for choosing evil." 
Fein says that such social penalties have a tremendous impact on crime 
and cites Japan as a nation where they continue to be used effectively.


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But stiff sentences and societal condemnation are making a comeback. 
"Unforgiving prison terms for felons work to reduce crime because an 
enormous proportion is attributable to recidivism," says Fein. Needless to 
say, repeat offenders commit no crimes while incarcerated. The longer 
they stay in prison, the fewer crimes they commit. Holding criminals 
responsible for their own behavior is back in style. Fading fast is the idea 
that criminals "deserved indulgence and sympathy because their 
depravity was engendered by societal wrongs or imperfections, or the 
happenstance of environmental factors."


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Fein argues that the "community devastation wrought by such imbecility 
concentrated the minds of ordinary citizens, legislatures, and judges 
wonderfully. No longer are criminals viewed as victims of fate," he says, 
"but as evil creatures who have chosen to indulge their anti-social vices 
and passions; they should be shamed and disgraced."

FLYNN</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><center><h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES </h4><i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/duplbio.html">F.R. Duplantier</a> <br>November 17, 1995 <br></i><hr><h2>The Enduring Wisdom of John T. Flynn</h2></center><P>


[Noted journalist and author John T. Flynn warned more than 50 years 
ago that America was headed down "the road to Socialism. " His 
recommendations for averting disaster are just as valid today as they 
were then.]
<p>
In a book called The Road Ahead, published decades ago, the late John 
T. Flynn argued that Americans committed to fighting the creeping 
advance of socialism in our country must first "rid themselves of the 
moral intimidation which has been imposed on their minds." An excerpt 
from that book appears in a new compilation of Flynn's writing entitled 
Forgotten Lessons. published by the Foundation for Economic 
Education. Flynn noted that "the American system has been painted as 
something wicked. bungling. even brutal. while the Planned New World 
of the future will be filled with sweetness, light, and plenty." This false 
picture has had an impact not only on naive Americans, but also on 
those who ought to know better.
<p>
John T. Flynn observed that the choice before us is not "between a 
perfect system called Socialism and an imperfect system called 
Capitalism. It is a choice between two human systems both of which will 
inevitably have their imperfections because they are human. But the 
Socialist Planners do not concede this. Capitalism they present to us only 
in terms of its defects. But Socialism is painted only in terms of the 
wonderful things it is going to do some day." Citing the disastrous effects 
of Socialism in Russia. Germany. Italy. and Britain. Flynn reminded his 
readers that "the greatest and most efficient producing machine in the 
world is in [America]. This did not happen by accident " he asserted. "It 
is the result of the soil of freedom in which it grew."
<p>
Socialism was far advanced in America even in Flys day, and it has 
gained ground since then. Fort years later we are still confronted with 
the need to counteract what Fly called "the social disease that is 
destroying us." Flynn urged his countrymen to "stop apologizing for our 
Capitalist society." We should take no more steps down the road to 
Socialism. he said. and we should turn out of office any politician who 
tries to lead us in that direction. Flynn pointed out. Iong before Dan 
Quayle and Pat Buchanan. "that we are in a social war. and that we must 
fight it as such." He said we should "put an end to the orgy of spending 
that is rapidly bankrupt the nation," quit trying to plan our economy, and 
instead let "our free system of private enterprise operate at its fullest 
capacity."
<p>
John T. Flynn was a founding member of America's Future, the producer 
of this series of broadcasts, and a man of great wisdom and vision. Flynn 
advised his readers to rediscover their principles in the U.S. 
Constitution. the Declaration of Independence, and American history -- 
and use those principles "to dismantle the tyrant State in America and to 
build up once again the energies of a free people."

 <h2> MOTHERHOOD II</h2>
<P>
<blockquote><I>

 
Early in December of 1947, Dr. J.A. MacDougall promised a young  
woman dying of tuberculosis that, if she lived long enough, he'd let her  
leave the hospital for a few hours to celebrate Christmas at home with  
her family. </I></blockquote>
 
The numerous medical procedures the doctors had tried in an effort to  
seal the tubercular cavity in the lower lobe of this 23-year-old woman's  
right lung had failed. "Amazingly, she was still alive on Christmas Eve,  
but just barely," Dr. MacDougall recalled, so he kept his promise to let  
her spend Christmas Day at home with her husband and their only child.  
She was grateful for that brief respite, but continued to decline. By the  
end of February, she was down to 80 pounds, and "new complications  
developed. She became nauseous -- even without food in her stomach." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Dr. MacDougall dismissed as "ridiculous" a colleague's suggestion that  
his patient might be pregnant. "Everything I knew about medicine added  
up to one conclusion: she was so ill, so weak, that she couldn't possibly  
have conceived. Her body wasn't up to it. Nevertheless, I ordered a  
pregnancy test. To my astonishment, it was positive." The doctor and his  
colleagues were confronted with a moral dilemma. "Legally, medically,  
we could have taken the child through abortion; it imperiled a life that  
was already in jeopardy. But we didn't do it," Dr. MacDougall confided.  
The doctors shared the woman's religious objections, but they also were  
convinced that "the operation would kill her [and that] her body would  
reject the child anyway." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Somehow, the woman clung to life -- her own and that of her unborn  
child. "And in late June, 1948, an incredible thing happened," said Dr.  
MacDougall. "She began to eat, and to gain weight. A chest X-ray  
showed that the growth of the TB cavity had stopped. Not long after,  
another X-ray showed why: the diaphragm was pushing up against the  
lower lobe of her diseased lung to make room for the child she was  
bearing. Nature was doing exactly what we'd failed to do: it was pressing  
the sides of that deadly hole together. The child was saving the mother." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

What prompted Dr. MacDougall to recount the details of this amazing  
incident forty years after it occurred? "I'm concerned about the  
liberalization of abortion laws and the growing clamor for even greater  
liberalization," he explained. "I'm against it on medical grounds: a  
doctor doesn't exist to take life, but to save it. I'm against it on religious  
grounds: I believe that human life is sacred, that only He who creates life  
has the right to take it away. I'm against it, finally, because of the case  
I've described. The child didn't destroy the mother. It saved her. Call it  
the will of God; call it human love; call it the mystical quality of  
motherhood, the turning in upon herself to fight still more because she  
had still more to fight for; call it what you will. It happened." 
 <BR>

<title>U.S. Gets Pitiful Returns on U.N. Investment -- Duplantier</title></head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center><h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES </h4>
<i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.<br>
F.R. Duplantier <br>
October 19, 1995 <br></i>
<hr>
<h2>U.S. Gets Pitiful Returns on U.N. Investment</h2></center>
<P>
 
 
The United States spent more than three and a half billion dollars on the  
United Nations in 1994, which included a billion dollars just to support  
the UN's so-called "peacekeeping" operations and nearly two billion  
dollars' worth of military support services. What did we get for all those  
billions? Not much! 
        <P>
"The UN has been, and will continue to be, of only marginal relevance to  
international peace and security," says Thomas Sheehy of the Heritage  
Foundation. "Suggesting otherwise only sets the stage for future policy  
debacles involving the U.S. military." Sheehy argues that "UN  
peacekeeping turns disastrous when it takes the form of 'peacemaking."'  
That's because "UN forces quickly become just another group of  
combatants," fighting at a tremendous disadvantage under UN rules of  
engagement. 
                         <P>
Sheehy points out that "the countries providing peacekeepers have  
considerably less interest in the conflicts than do the forces their troops  
are fighting. As casualties are incurred, pressure mounts to bring the  
troops home," he observes. "The result is often a half-hearted and  
ultimately futile operation that suffers casualties in vain, as the U.S. did  
in Somalia." Sheehy adamantly rejects suggestions that "U.S. hesitancy to  
intervene in Bosnia and elsewhere . . . is immoral. The 'immoral' policy,"  
he insists, "is to suffer casualties in a conflict with no bearing to  
American national security and soon after to abandon the U.S.  
commitment, as was done in Somalia." 
                                  <P>
The Clinton administration argues that the U.S. would be forced "to act  
alone or not at all" if it refused to participate in UN operations. This is  
simply not true. "The U.S. has acted in concert with allies in most of its  
international conflicts," Sheehy observes. The main concern of UN  
boosters like the President is obviously "not for American security, but  
for the prestige of the UN, which suffers considerably without active  
American participation." According to Sheehy, "Collective action on a  
regional basis, such as in NATO and during the Persian Gulf War,  
whether or not it is sanctioned by the UN, undoubtedly is the best way to  
maintain international peace and stability." 
                                               <P>
Charles Lichenstein, also of the Heritage Foundation, warns that the UN  
"is reinventing what used to be called 'peacekeeping.' In the last several  
years, that do-good concept has been stretched to encompass a range of  
UN operations that typically involve the use of force, even the waging of  
war." The term "peacekeeping" now means "almost anything . . . that the  
UN wants it to mean." Lichenstein says as many as 70,000 U.S. military  
personnel currently participate in this misnamed process. "Some are  
serving in war zones, some are offshore or in aerial surveillance and  
interdiction missions, some are in support roles. But all are serving under  
the authority only of UN Security Council resolutions as implemented by  
the U.S. commander-in-chief." Lichenstein concludes that it would be  
better for the U.S. to "act alone" than to get caught up in "ill-defined,

Duplantier</a> <br>December 7, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Political Chaos and the Decay of Language</h2></center><P> 
[British writer George Orwell is best remembered for the novels 1984 and 
Animal Farm, two of the most prophetic satires about 20th Century 
socialism ever written. But Orwell was also a prolific journalist and 
essayist. A short piece he wrote entitled "Politics and the English 
Language" should be required reading for anyone who wants to explore 
the connection between degraded language and political tyranny.] 
 <p>
The quality of our language and the quality of our thought are 
inextricably linked. Our language "becomes ugly and inaccurate because 
our thoughts are foolish," said George Orwell, "but the slovenliness of 
our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts." Orwell was 
convinced that we could improve the quality of our language and the 
quality of our thought if we would just pay more attention to what we say 
and write. "Modern English," he said, "is full of bad habits which spread 
by imitation and which can be avoided if one is willing to take the 
necessary trouble. If one gets rid of these habits, one can think more 
clearly, and to think more clearly is a necessary first step toward political 
regeneration." 
 <p>
Among the bad linguistic habits Orwell identified are worn-out 
metaphors, pretentious diction, and meaningless words. Many metaphors 
"have lost all evocative power and are merely used because they save 
people the trouble of inventing phrases for themselves." Who today can 
even recall what it originally meant to "toe the line" or "ride roughshod 
over"?  Pretentious diction, particularly the use of polysyllabic words of 
foreign derivation, is a nasty habit favored by "scientific, political and 
sociological writers" who are "haunted by the notion that Latin or Greek 
words are grander than Saxon ones." The worst habit of all is to use 
language, our tool of communication, in such a way as to communicate 
nothing.  "In certain kinds of writing, " said Orwell, "particularly in art 
criticism and literary criticism, it is normal to come across long passages 
which are almost completely lacking in meaning." 
 <p>
Orwell observed that "modern writing at its worst does not consist in 
picking out words for the sake of their meaning and inventing images in 
order to make the meaning clearer. It consists in gumming together long 
strips of words which have already been set in order by someone else. <p> 
"This allows us to avoid the difficult task of thinking.  If we get out of the 
habit of thinking, however, we become susceptible to all sorts of 
foolishness. 
 <p>
Political writing nowadays is invariably "bad writing," said Orwell, 
because it is used primarily for the "defense of the indefensible." 
Euphemism, evasion, and vagueness are its main characteristics. Every 
conscientious citizen must be in the habit of thinking, and pay close 
attention, if he is to avoid being victimized by the obfuscations of 
demagogues. Orwell encouraged all true patriots to "recognize that the 
present political chaos is connected with the decay of language."  He 
urged us to defend our liberties by defending our language.

Duplantier</a> <br>

<h2>"No-Win Situation" in Bosnia </h2></center><P> 
 
[Syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer says that sending U.S.  
troops to Bosnia is a "serious mistake" and a "no-win situation."]  
  <P>
In a recent issue of The Weekly Standard, Charles Krauthammer argues  
that U.S. involvement in Bosnia will have one of two unacceptable  
outcomes. Either it will end in "a humiliating retreat . . . after some  
incident involving a major loss of American life and cries from the  
Congress and the American people for withdrawal. Or, more likely, we  
will persevere, indeed escalate our involvement, send more troops to  
protect existing troops and be caught in a long-term, static, and defensive  
deployment with painful losses, ambiguous rules of engagement,  
escalating friction among NATO allies . . . and no way out."  
  <P>
Krauthammer says American troops are going into Bosnia with "no  
definable objective, no identifiable enemy, no exit strategy." Being the  
"sole remaining superpower" and having the "finest, most powerful  
military" do not obligate the United States to be the world's peacekeeper.  
"It is decidedly not the role of a superpower to place itself between the  
combatants in a civil war of marginal importance to the world balance of  
power . . . among unreconciled parties who have already shown a  
propensity for killing and kidnapping peacekeepers."  
  <P>
"Peacekeeping is the job of small countries with no particular interest in  
the outcome of a conflict," says Krauthammer. "It is far harder for a  
superpower to remain neutral, and even harder to be perceived as neutral,  
in most conflicts. And, in the Bosnian war, in particular, the United States  
has been decidedly not neutral. We have made our sympathies with the  
Bosnian Muslim side abundantly clear in our declarations, in our use of  
air power, and indeed in our promises to arm the Bosnian government  
even as we act as peacekeepers."  
  <P>
"If the combatants in Bosnia are serious about ending the fighting and  
accepting roughly the distribution of territory and roughly the balance of  
power now on the ground, then they should do it and enforce it  
themselves," says Krauthammer. "If they are not, then there is no peace to  
keep. And between such antagonists is no place to interpose American  
troops."  
  <P>
Krauthammer concedes that "reneging" on the promise to deploy troops  
"would be a blow to NATO," but contends that "following through and  
actually sending the troops would be worse." He describes as "nonsense"  
the argument that "we must intervene in Bosnia because of the  
continuing, indeed intensifying, threat the war poses to European  
stability." He says "the war is in fact contracting" and that the great  
nations of Europe have no reason to make war "over the control of this  
cursed, tragic piece of land." While acknowledging that American  
credibility is damaged "whenever the United States makes a commitment  
and then reneges on it," Krauthammer insists that the blame belongs to  
"the administration that made that foolish promise without proper  
reflection." Congress, on the other hand, should be applauded for "trying  
to avert the consequences of that ill-considered promise."

<h3><i>ABOLISH AMERICA'S COSTLY ANTI-DUMPING LAWS</i></h3>

Backgrounder Update No. 261<br>
October 3, 1995<br>

(Updating <i>Backgrounder</i> No. 906, "A Guide to Antidumping Laws:  America's Unfair Trade Practice," July 21, 1992.)<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>
	America's nearly century-old anti-dumping trade laws have outlived their usefulness. Anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws, which prevent the import of low-priced and subsidized foreign goods, have become the protectionist weapon of choice. The U.S. government should not be enforcing laws that impose higher prices on American consumers. Nor should the U.S. be taking steps that undermine the competitiveness of some of America's largest exporters.
<p>
	But that is exactly what the federal government is doing when it demands that special duties be placed on imports that supposedly are priced "too low."  U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Mickey Kantor in June 1993 asked the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) to conduct a study of America's anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws. The ITC study, published in June 1995, found that the overall cost of anti-dumping and countervailing duties to the U.S. economy far outweighs any benefits.1 For example, the ITC discovered that anti-dumping and countervailing duty protection cost the U.S. economy $1.59 billion in lost gross domestic product (GDP). Moreover, the study concluded that when anti-dumping and countervailing duties are imposed on imports, prices for those products, and for their domestically produced counterparts, increase. As a result, the U.S. consumer has to pay more for all these goods, regardless of whether they are imported or produced in the U.S.
<p>
	<b>Findings of the ITC Study.</b> The International Trade Commission has conducted the most comprehensive study ever undertaken on the economic effects of anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws.2 The ITC reviewed all cases initiated between 1980 and 1993, conducted detailed case studies of eight representative domestic industries that won anti-dumping or countervailing duty rulings against foreign competitors, and assessed the overall impact of all anti-dumping and countervailing duties on the U.S. economy. The study found that:
<p><ul>
<li> Anti-dumping and countervailing duties caused a net loss of $1.59 billion in U.S. gross domestic product in 1991;
<p>
<li> While domestic companies and their workers receiving anti-dumping and countervailing duty protection earned $658 million more in profits and wages, terminating this protection would have increased overall American business profits and wages by $1.85 billion in industries that were not receiving such protection;
<p>
<li> When these duties were applied to the items examined in the study, U.S. prices for those goods rose. For example, solid urea fertilizer prices increased by 19 percent, lamb meat prices went up by 10 percent, and domestic steel pipe and tube prices rose by 10 percent.3
</ul><p>
While protected firms and their workers may benefit from anti-dumping and countervailing duties, their benefits come at the expense of consumers, other American firms, and their workers. In 1987, for example, U.S. consumers paid $138 million more for ball bearings because of anti-dumping laws. The overall cost to the economy was $70 million. In 1985, U.S. consumers paid $23 million more for brass sheet and strip, for a net cost to the economy of $19 million. In the 1984-1985 crop year, U.S. consumers paid $11 million in higher prices for frozen orange juice concentrate, while the net cost to the economy was $8 million.
<p>
	These findings demonstrate conclusively that the anti-dumping and countervailing duty cure is far worse than the disease. While these laws may protect some jobs and provide some higher profits for selected businesses, they cost far more overall in higher consumer prices, lower production, and lost jobs in other industries. The ITC's findings support the case for abolishing these laws. There is no rational economic case for the claim that selling at below cost is an unfair practice; in a free market, prices are determined by what consumers are willing to pay for a product, not by what producers spent on making a product.
<p>
	Proponents contend that anti-dumping law protects American consumers from the "predatory" tactics of foreign firms. (Predatory pricing is an illegal scheme in which one firm seeks to drive its rivals out of business by pricing its product substantially below production costs for a long period of time.) However, U.S. antitrust law allows domestic firms to sell their products at below-cost prices. U.S. firms actually can sell their products at less than the historical production costs to liquidate obsolete, deteriorating, or unpopular products, to maintain production and sales during a recession or seasonal downturn in demand, or to introduce new products to the market.
<p>
	Why should U.S. law declare this type of pricing behavior legal if performed by a domestic firm but illegal if undertaken by a foreign competitor?
<p>
	The U.S. government's war on low prices is not justified. Anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws benefit a select few companies while doing significant damage to the entire U.S. economy. The U.S. should end these practices. It should:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Repeal the U.S. anti-dumping law.</b> This law is found in Title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended. Repealing it would protect American companies dependent on imported components from costly import duties.
<p>
<li><b>Repeal the U.S. countervailing duty law.</b> This law also is found in Title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended. Some countries will continue to subsidize their businesses. In such cases, the U.S. should use the World Trade Organization's Dispute Settlement Mechanism to enforce the agreement limiting government subsidies. This agreement, part of the recently concluded Uruguay Round, over time reduces the subsidies government may provide to various industries. If a signatory country continues to provide subsidies beyond the limits set in the agreement, other member countries can initiate an investigation, after which special duties can be applied to the guilty country's exports.
</ul><p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
	One of the principal government agencies in charge of implementing America's anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws, the International Trade Commission, has found that these antiquated laws do more harm than good. They should be scrapped. Doing so would save American consumers billions of dollars in lower prices and and would cause the entire U.S. economy to grow. This is a good deal for the majority of Americans. It is essential for the U.S. economy.

<h2>
Creeping Socialism
</h2>



<P><blockquote><i>  
Socialism is based on "a simple assumption: that certain people know 
better what is best for all other creatures, and that such people possess the 
right to enforce their 'enlightened ' beliefs because they shall lead the rest 
of us to a 'perfect' world."
</blockquote></i>




<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When they drafted the U.S. Constitution, our Founding Fathers "created a 
framework which sought to limit secular laws, rules, and regulations to 
the necessary minimum," notes Balint Vazsonyi in an essay titled "The 
Battle for America's Soul," published in the Winter issue of a journal 
called "Common Sense." "They recognized that the fewer the rules, the 
broader the potential agreement. Broad agreement, in turn, results in less 
strife. Less strife leaves people free to create and accomplish. The fewer 
obstacles placed in the path of individuals, the less energy wasted in 
trying to overcome them."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Today, however, individual opportunity has given way to group 
entitlement. "Instead of increased productivity, efforts are always directed 
toward increasing demands. These demands are for unearned 
participation in, and distributions from, the accomplishments of those 
who produce the nation's goods," says Vazsonyi. What results is "a 
downward spiral. With incentives shrinking, less and less is produced; 
consequently, there is less and less to distribute. This, in a nutshell, is 
why welfare states invariably increase poverty."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Why don't Americans recognize creeping socialism for what it is? 
Socialism "persuades its intended victims that it has people's best interest 
in mind, that it seeks peace, justice, and equality, that it is motivated by 
caring and compassion. Its ability to camouflage true intent and adapt to a 
specific scenario is matchless," says Vazsonyi. It doesn't prohibit free 
speech; it establishes a "politically correct vocabulary." It doesn't impede 
individual opportunity; it promotes "affirmative action." It doesn't 
confiscate private property; it protects "the environment "
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The evidence of creeping socialism is all around us. "The Constitution 
does not provide for group rights," says Vazsonyi. "Yet, a steadily 
growing number of groups is being granted an increasing number of 
rights. Defense, for which the Constitution does provide, has been 
surrounded by an atmosphere of derision and hostility; the effectiveness 
of our armed forces is being diminished through inappropriate use." The 
executive and judicial branches of our federal government have usurped 
legislative power. Laws defining so-called "hate crimes" have narrowed 
the boundaries of free speech. Environmental regulations have 
circumscribed private property rights.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Education used to be based on the best available information, the 
consensus of generations, and rewards designed to extract the best effort 
from all participants," observes Vazsonyi. "Currently, information is 
being replaced by propaganda, consensus by the whim and din of activist 
groups, best effort by primitive egalitarianism." Americans are no longer 
judged by their abilities, but by membership in favored classes. Our 
traditional standards of morality "are being displaced by doctrines which 
do not even recognize the existence of values; the spirit of voluntarism is 
being choked by coercion." Sadly, says Vazsonyi, all these symptoms of 
creeping socialism are endorsed by American liberals.

Duplantier</a> <br>December 1, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>NAFTA Bad for American Workers</h2></center><P>

[It is estimated that nearly one million Americans lost their jobs this year 
as a direct result of the North American Free Trade Agreement (known as 
NAFTA). How many more American workers will have to suffer the 
same fate before our leaders admit they made a mistake?] 
 <p>
NAFTA has taken a terrible toll on the American economy, and the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (known as GATT) will only 
make matters worse, says William Gill of the American Coalition for 
Competitive Trade. Gill points out that "the United States is currently 
running record trade deficits with Mexico, after years of chalking up 
trade surpluses against that country." Of even greater concern is "the 
continued migration of our industrial plants to Mexico, which every day 
robs us of more jobs." An estimated one million jobs will have been lost 
by the end of this year. In spite of their rosy, pre-NAFTA predictions, 
giant American companies like Mattel, Allied Signal, General Electric. 
Procter & Gamble, Scott Paper, and Zenith have failed to create the 
thousands of new jobs in the United States that they promised. Instead, 
they have laid off American workers. 
 <p>
NAFTA hasn't done Mexico and Canada any good either, says Gill. "In 
Mexico, hundreds of thousands of poor farmers are being driven off the 
land and the middle class is collapsing under interest rates which in some 
cases are well over 100 percent. Conditions have become so bad in 
Canada that several western provinces . . . are threatening to secede." Gill 
says that Mexico is in "a state of chaos since NAFTA." Drug trafficking 
is on the rise, crime is burgeoning, farmers are in revolt. "The collapse of 
the peso drove hundreds of small businessmen into bankruptcy," says 
Gill.  "The job losses have been tremendous, in spite of the growth of 
exports to the U.S." Nearly 60 percent of the Mexican workforce is 
unemployed. 
 <p>
As Mexico's internal problems worsen, they pose a growing threat to the 
health and security of the United States. "Even before NAFTA, Mexico 
was the principal conduit for cocaine coming into the U.S. from 
Columbia and other Latin American countries," and the volume has 
increased substantially ever since. "Crime, rampant in Mexico for 
decades, has spilled across the border like a tidal wave in the last two 
years." 
 <p>
William Gill contends that "the American people, like the Mexicans and 
Canadians, have all been made the victims of a gigantic fraud -- the 
biggest scam in history." He argues that there is "only one way to halt the 
insanity  NAFTA and GATT are spreading across America and around 
the world. And that is to roll back both of these fraudulent treaties." Gill 
insists that "NAFTA must be abrogated. America and Mexico cannot 
keep on absorbing the terrible punishment this treaty has inflicted upon 
the people of both countries." 
 <p>
Gill's group, the American Coalition for Competitive Trade, is filing 
several legal challenges to NAFTA and GATT and the $53 billion bailout 
of Mexico. The Coalition wants to block the implementation of these 
treaties before they cause any more damage to our sovereignty and to our 
economy.

<title>Ross Perot's Medicare Rx -- du Pont</title>

<h2>Ross Perot's Medicare Rx </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>
 

Ross Perot has a knack for identifying those issues that are important 
to voters.  Just a week after congressional leaders said that Medicare 
reform would be the biggest policy issue this fall, his book on 
Medicare hit the stands.  Intensive Care is a book about the crisis 
facing Medicare and Medicaid, the federal and federal/state health 
insurance programs for the elderly and poor.   <p>
 
 Medicare and Medicaid have evolved into enormous, wasteful and 
inefficient government programs that must be reformed before they 
financially break the country.   How big is the problem?  Mr. Perot 
points out that Medicare and Medicaid will take up 17.4 percent of the 
federal budget in 1995, or about 35 percent of all entitlement 
spending.  According to Medicare's board of trustees, without 
fundamental change the program will go bankrupt by 2002.   <p>
 
Something has to be done, and it has to be done soon.  But as Mr. 
Perot points out, historically Congress has been reluctant to resolve 
the federal government's penchant for excessive spending.  "Our 
elected leaders have ignored the clear signals that the greatest 
nation in the history of man has been spending itself toward 
bankruptcy."  <p>
 
Medicare is probably the only large health insurance plan in the 
country that has not undergone fundamental change over the past 
decade.  Many employers have increased deductibles and copayments - 
requiring employees to manage more of their own health care dollars.  
More frequently, employers have begun directing their employees to 
lower-cost doctors and actively managing health care costs.   <p>
 
Medicare has moved in the opposite direction.  In recent years the 
deductible for Part A (hospital insurance) has not changed in real 
terms, and the deductible for Part B (other medical expenses) has 
actually decreased in real terms.  While there has been some 
experimentation with managed care, in most places Medicare is still a 
wide-open, fee-for-service plan in which patients can see almost any 
doctor for any service.   
 
Reforming Medicare and Medicaid and balancing the federal budget will 
force us to make some tough choices, and when there are tough choices 
to be made Ross Perot hears his entry cue.  He believes that "we 
should view the coming debate over Medicare and Medicaid as an 
opportunity rather than a dilemma."  It's an "opportunity for creative 
minds to update old systems that have served their purpose, but are 
now in need of an overhaul to function properly in the next century." <p>
 
What direction should reform take?  "A properly designed system based 
on market principles will do more to initiate positive change than any 
government rules and regulations that attempt to monitor the profits 
of the health care industry," Mr. Perot tells us.  <p>
 
As mentioned earlier, many employers are actively managing their 
employees' health care costs or are moving them into managed care 
plans.  Mr. Perot discusses this solution and points out that Congress 
is already moving in this direction for Medicare.  Current law allows 
some Medicare beneficiaries to withdraw from Medicare and join a 
health maintenance organization (HMO) instead.  While seniors should 
be free to remain in Medicare, we should build on this precedent and 
allow Medicare beneficiaries to withdraw from Medicare Parts A and B 
and choose any alternative private plan.   <p>
 
Perhaps a more attractive option than managed care is also discussed 
by Mr. Perot:  Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs). This option would 
permit Medicare recipients to use their Medicare funds to purchase a 
catastrophic policy coupled with a Medical Savings Account.  For 
example, private insurance might cover all health expenses over a 
$3,000 deductible, and place any premium savings in an MSA.  MSA funds 
would then be used to pay for expenses below $3,000.  In case a gap 
remained between the MSA deposit and the catastrophic deductible, 
retirees could top up their MSA by contributing amounts they otherwise 
would have used to purchase private, Medigap insurance or pay out-of-
pocket expenses.  <p>
 
Of course, to hear Democrats and liberals complain about MSAs, you'd 
think it was positively un-American to let people keep some of the 
money they are now giving to insurance companies.  It's that same 
mentality we've seen from Washington for years: "Heaven help us if we 
let taxpayers keep some of their own money.  They might not spend it 
like we bureaucrats would like." <p>
 
Ross Perot has always believed in the ability of the American people 
to respond properly when adequately informed - and that's what this 
book is meant to do.   While his book will not be the last word on 
Medicare, Intensive Care has succeeded as a sound analytical 
beginning. <p>

<h2>
America's Future's Record
</h2>

<i>America's future depends on Americans who believe in America. That's 
why America's Future was founded fifty years ago!</i>
<p>
When America's Future was founded, fifty years ago, the Second World 
War had just concluded and the United Nations had just been born. The 
Cold War had not yet begun, and neither had the conservative movement. 
Fifty years ago, there were only a handful of conservative, 
constitutionalist, free-market-oriented organizations and publications. But 
the number of liberal, leftist, and crypt )communist groups in America 
numbered more than a thousand.
<p>
Our nation was in transition in 1946, and our enemies were well-
organized. Stouthearted individuals and intrepid organizations were 
needed to defend the American way of life. And so, on April 24, 1946, 
America's Future, a nonprofit educational organization, was founded in 
New York City by a group of businessmen dedicated to the preservation 
of two great fundamental American principles: the competitive, private 
enterprise system that has made our country strong and prosperous, and 
the constitutional form of government that has kept us free from the 
tyranny of dictators or factions.
<p>
From the very beginning, America's Future concentrated its educational 
efforts on the proverbial man-on-the-fence, the uncommitted millions, 
students eager to learn about their country and its traditions, educators 
and ministers (who are the prime targets of the collectivists), parents 
concerned about the future of their children, workers who have benefited 
from the free enterprise system, and voters who control the destiny of our 
nation. Beginning in 1946, America's Future sponsored and produced 
over the ABC Radio Network a Sunday afternoon commentary featuring 
Congressman Samuel Pettengill, a renowned constitutionalist. We also 
began publishing and distributing pro-American books, pamphlets, and 
reprints (now numbering in the millions).
<p>
In the 1950s, one of the country's most influential print and broadcast 
commentators, John T. Flynn, joined forces with America's Future. Flynn 
was a frequent contributor to prestigious national magazines; and his 
book, The Road Ahead, which showed how socialism was creeping 
across England and the United States, sold more than one million copies. 
Flynn pulled no punches. He went behind the headlines to explain the 
real significance of events and personalities. He attacked Big 
Government and Big Business with equal vigor, always from the 
perspective of an unwavering, unapologetic Americanism. His 
commentaries for America's Future, aptly named "Behind The 
Headlines," were soon being broadcast on more than 300 radio stations in 
the Mutual Broadcasting System. Commentaries by Flynn were also 
distributed to thousands of newspapers across the country, with an 
estimated readership of twenty million.
<p>
That's how America's Future began, fifty years ago. Today, with the vast 
majority of Americans now identifying themselves as conservatives and 
the liberal welfare state discredited, we like to think that we can claim 
some of the credit, and we invite you to join us in celebrating the Golden 
Anniversary of America's Future.

<title>Duplantier: Free Trade Follies -- 03/11/96

<h2>
Free Trade Follies
</h2>

<blockquote><i>
Did you think that the breakup of the Soviet Union and the liberation of the  
Captive Nations of Europe had tolled the death knell  for socialism? Well,  
one trade expert predicts that international treaties such as NAFTA and  
GATT will ultimately destroy the middle classes throughout the world and  
lead to a resurgence of the welfare state. 
 </blockquote></i>

<P>  

The World Trade Organization, created by the General Agreement on  
Tariffs and Trade, is now in operation. Its first major act was to order the  
United States to change its rules on the quality of imported gasoline or face  
sanctions by the international community. The governments of Venezuela  
and Brazil had appealed to the World Trade Organization to compel the  
U.S. to accept their gasoline, which does not meet U.S. environmental  
standards. Congress will now have to revise our Clean Air Act regulations  
regarding gasoline emissions or U.S. industries will face "cross-retaliation"  
trade sanctions. 
 


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


This ruling is an omen of things to come, predicts William Gill of the  
American Coalition for Competitive Trade. Gill and his group were the  
first to warn that the North American Free Trade Agreement (known as  
NAFTA) and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (known as  
GATT) "were the first big steps toward a world government that would rob  
America of our cherished independence as a nation." NAFTA and GATT  
threaten our prosperity as well as our sovereignty. Gill says nine million  
jobs "have been lost in the corporate downsizing" of the 1990s, one million  
of which are "directly attributable to NAFTA." 
 



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The damage doesn't end there. NAFTA "and other free trade efforts to  
erase all national borders" have unleashed an invasion of illegal drugs and  
illegal aliens into the United States. Infectious diseases are also entering  
our country at increasing rates. "The death rate from this invidious source  
rose . . .58 percent between 1980 and 1992," observes Gill, who describes  
this 12-year period as an "era when trade tore down virtually all the  
traditional defenses of our borders." 
 




<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Ironically, NAFTA has not done our neighbors south of the border any  
good either. Gill reports that "the middle class in Mexico is being wiped  
out, joining the hundreds of thousands of Mexican farmers driven off their  
land by NAFTA in the tragic trek downhill into abysmal poverty and  
despair." He warns that "free trade is sowing the seeds of revolution"  
throughout the world. "There have already been uprisings in Mexico and  
violent strikes in France," Gill observes, and this is only the beginning. He  
predicts that the unrest will rise, resulting in "a worldwide resurgence of  
socialism as the chaos caused by open borders forces governments into  
restoring and expanding welfare programs for the poor." The American  
Coalition for Competitive Trade intends to keep publicizing the defects of  
NAFTA and GATT and other free trade follies until public opinion finally  
forces our government to repudiate what William Gill calls an "insane  
policy that is strangling America."

<title>Any U.N. Treaty is a Treaty We Can Do Without -- Duplantier</title></head>

<hr>
<h2>Any U.N. Treaty is a Treaty We Can Do Without</h2></center>
<P>

 
Any United Nations treaty is a treaty we can do without, because it will  
surely threaten the rights of Americans . 
 <P>
One of Douglas MacArthur's famous lines was, "Old soldiers never die,  
they just fade away." Unfortunately, old treaties not only never die; they  
don't even fade away. Old treaties retain their life forever. Also,  
unfortunately, the United Nations has some old treaties lying around, and  
we must be ever-vigilant if we are to be sure they are never ratified. 
             <P>
The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights would change  
the marriage laws of most of our states in the name of equality and  
thereby repeal the fundamental legal rights possessed by American wives.  
This Treaty would give carte blanche to some future international  
tribunal by insisting that all persons are "entitled without discrimination  
to equal protection of the law," without defining what that means. The  
Treaty would allow any foreign government, friendly or unfriendly. to  
accuse the United States of violation. It wouldn't take very long for the  
envious nations of the world to begin their feeding frenzy. How much  
sympathy do you think we would receive from a UN human rights  
committee stacked against us? 
                       <P>
The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial  
Discrimination would require the United States to "prohibit and bring to  
an end, by all appropriate means, including legislation as required by  
circumstances, racial discrimination by any persons, group or  
organization." This provision would override our First Amendment right  
to freedom of association in private clubs and other private action. A UN  
Committee would hear complaints against us, without revealing the  
identities of the complainants. The Treaty's enormously broad  
descriptions of racial discrimination would offer endless opportunities for  
mischief as the Committee demands explanations and remedies for our  
alleged transgressions. 
                              <P>
The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights  
would require the United States to "recognize the right of everyone [in  
the world] to an adequate standard of living for himself and his family,  
including adequate food, clothing and housing, and to the continuous  
improvement of living conditions." It would further require that we  
"ensure an equitable distribution of world food supplies in relation to  
need." How would we recognize that "right," and how would we ensure  
that "equitable distribution"? With an ever-increasing transfer of 
American wealth, that's how! 
                                        <P>
The worst aspect of the UN Treaty on Economic, Social and Cultural  
Rights is its refusal to include the fundamental right to own property.  
This is why the Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon. and  
Ford Administrations consistently took the position that the United States  
would not sign it. President Jimmy Carter reversed this position and  
signed it, which means this UN treaty is sitting around in the bottom  
drawer waiting for a chance to be ratified. 
                 <P>
All these UN treaties are bad news for the United States, and a threat to  
our constitutional liberties. If you hear that any UN treaty is being  
considered in the U.S. Senate, be sure to tell your Senator to vote no.

<P> 

[There 's something shy about the 1993 death of White House Counsel 
Vincent Foster. Could he have known too much about the scandals 
dogging the President?]
<P>
Investigative reporter Christopher Ruddy has identified numerous 
inconsistencies in the official investigations of Vincent Foster's so-called 
suicide. First, there was no suicide note. Then there was a suicide note, 
only it didn't actually mention suicide or bid farewell to family members. 
The 28 torn pieces of the note were found in a briefcase that had been 
searched at least once already, the note had no fingerprints on it, and 
three handwriting experts have declared it a forgery.
<P>
The condition of the body was odd, to say the least. Ruddy says two 
paramedics observed that the slain White House official appeared to be 
"ready for the coffin,'' with arms and legs neatly arranged and head facing 
straight up. There was less blood than might be expected "from a gunshot 
wound to a living person's head." There was no trace of soil on Foster's 
shoes, as there surely would have been had he walked through dense 
brush to the secluded spot where his-body was found. The FBI found 
carpet fibers all over Foster's clothing, but never bothered to determine 
where or why it had come into contact with carpeting.
<P>
The gun was found in Foster's hand, a rarity for suicides. Nevertheless, 
there were no fingerprints on the weapon, says Ruddy. Although Foster 
supposedly shot himself in the mouth, there was "no visible blood 
splatter" on the gun, the recoil did not "chip or damage teeth," and no 
gunpowder was found on his tongue. No one heard the fatal shot, and the 
fired bullet was "never found, despite exhaustive searches."
<P>
Ruddy says Park Police did not "bother to interview park neighbors or 
regular visitors." They failed to "take statements from all persons found 
in the park." They misrepresented the statement of at least one witness. 
They failed to seal Foster's office and "gave away key crime scene 
evidence, such as his beeper and papers, within hours of his death." They 
neglected to have the gun tested "until one week after" the death was 
ruled a suicide. All of the 35-millimeter crime scene photos have 
disappeared, as have seven Polaroids taken at the scene by a Park Police 
officer. The X-rays mentioned in the autopsy report are also missing.
<P>
During the first official investigation of the Foster death, a witness who 
discovered the body was allegedly badgered by- the FBI "to alter his 
testimony on critical issues." Ruddy says another witness charges that the 
FBI lied in claiming he "could not identify a man he saw in the park." 
Investigators simply ignored the statements of other witnesses "who said 
two men, not Foster, were in and around his car just before the body was 
found." The lead prosecutor in the second official probe "resigned after 
being thwarted" in his efforts to conduct a comprehensive investigation. 
Somebody pretty powerful must not want us to know what really 
happened to Vincent Foster.

<TITLE> TIME FOR A MORATORIUM ON NEW REGULATIONS -- Heritage </TITLE>

<CENTER><H3><I> TIME FOR A MORATORIUM ON NEW REGULATIONS</I></H3>

   Backgrounder #1017<br>

<B> INTRODUCTION</B>
 <P>
In an effort to ease the burden of federal red tape, Representatives Tom 
DeLay (R-TX) and David McIntosh (R-IN) and Senators Don Nickles (R-
OK), Christopher Bond (R-MO), and Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) have 
introduced legislation (H.R. 450/S. 219) to place a moratorium on executive 
branch regulatory activities. The purpose of the bills is to provide for a "tim
out" period, during which the Congress and the Administration can debate and 
study the large number of regulations currently being written and consider 
pending reforms aimed at improving the way in which rules are written. 
<P>
Congress is right to be concerned about the heavy burden of regulation on the 
economy. The departing Bush Administration estimated in 1993 that 
regulation cost the economy $542 billion in 1991 and that the cost would 
increase to $662 billion by the year 2000. Using different calculations less 
than a year later, the Clinton Administration placed the cost of federal 
regulation to the economy at the still very high figure of "at least $430 billi
annually." Despite these figures, the Administration's November regulatory 
agenda indicates plans to issue 872 final rules in the upcoming months. 
Private sector analysis of just two of eight proposed rulemakings from one 
agency, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 
estimates these rules would cost business billions of dollars annually to 
implement. 
<P>
Before introducing the legislation, the Republican leadership first asked the 
President in a letter to declare a 100-day moratorium himself. The 
Administration refused, calling the freeze a "blunderbuss that could work in 
unintended ways." A moratorium, however, would not stop rules that would 
ease unnecessary federal red tape or address imminent threats to public safety.
The moratorium legislation is designed instead to provide both the 
Administration and the Congress with two important opportunities: 
<P>
Congressional committees and the Administration will gain a review period to 
examine rules that are in the pipeline and the chance to determine whether the 
Administration's own regulatory review processes are working. 
<P>
Congress will have an opportunity during the moratorium period to debate the 
regulatory process reforms included in such measures as the House 
Republicans' Contract With America, including risk assessment and cost-
benefit reform, paperwork reduction, a regulatory budget proposal, and 
private property rights reform. 
<P>
<B> HOW THE PROPOSED MORATORIUM WOULD WORK</B>
<P>
The Regulatory Transition Act of 1995 would halt agency rulemaking dating 
back to November 9, 1994, and extending until June 30, 1995. Rulemaking 
activities that would be covered by the moratorium thirty days after the bill's
enactment include substantive or interpretative rules, statements of agency 
policy, notices of inquiry, and advance notices and regulatory notices of 
proposed rulemakings. 
<P>
The moratorium also would include regulatory actions covered by statutory 
and court deadlines. Any deadline would be extended for five months or until 
July 1, 1995, whichever is later. So the public would know what rulemakings 
and deadlines would be covered by the moratorium, the President would be 
required within thirty days to publish the list in the Federal Register. 
<P>
The purpose of the legislation, however, is to suspend only burdensome 
regulations. Thus, it exempts from the moratorium those rules that would 
streamline or reduce regulatory or administrative actions and license and 
registration approvals. It is no "blunderbuss." Despite Administration official
claims, it is not intended, for example, to block the Administration's proposal
to streamline federal procurement rules. The legislation also would allow the 
President, through executive order, to waive the moratorium for actions 
necessary because of imminent threats to public health and safety. 
<P>
<B> THE REGULATIONS THAT WOULD BE COVERED</B>
<P>
A principal stimulus for the regulatory moratorium is the large number and 
wide scope of federal regulatory actions now under way. The moratorium 
would allow these regulations to be examined, while lawmakers at the same 
time could streamline and improve the regulatory process itself. The actions 
listed below, which have been estimated to cost close to $50 billion, are only 
a sample of the pending rulemaking actions that would be covered under the 
moratorium: 
<P>
Indoor Air Quality. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
(OSHA) would be prevented from promulgating a rule to require restaurants, 
retailers, office building owners, and others to implement comprehensive 
indoor air and ventilation plans. The rule would require these businesses, as 
well as manufacturers, to ban cigarette smoking unless smoking takes place in 
separately ventilated rooms. OSHA estimates that the rule would cost 
employers $8.1 billion annually. 
<P>
Ergonomics (Also Called Repetitive Motion Disease). OSHA currently is 
working on a rule that would require employers to take a number of actions to 
address repetitive motion injuries. These are injuries due to repeated hand, 
wrist, or other physical motions that cause or aggravate musculoskeletal 
disorders. Employers would be required not only to have written plans to 
prevent these injuries, but also to take actions to redesign work areas, such a
desks and computer set-ups, to slow assembly lines, and potentially to pay for 
medical bills. Private industry estimates that a similar rule proposed by 
California-OSHA would cost $3.1 billion annually in that state alone. Other 
sources estimate the federal rule would cost $21 billion to implement. 
<P>
Race and Gender Disclosure Rules. The Federal Reserve Board would be 
prevented from issuing final rules under the Community Reinvestment Act. 
Specifically, the moratorium would stop work on a requirement that banks 
and thrifts report race and gender data of small businesses and farmers 
seeking loans for $1 million or less. This proposal, incidentally, contradicts 
another Federal Reserve rule that prohibits institutions from collecting such 
data on loan applications. 
<P>
Labeling of Sunglasses. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would be 
stopped from any further work on a rule to require labeling of sunglasses. 
According to the Administration's regulatory agenda, the purpose of this 
proposal (which is still in the pre-rule stage) is to make sure consumers are 
aware that overexposure to ultraviolet radiation could hurt their eyes. 
<P>
Paper Industry "Cluster Rules." The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
has proposed what it terms "cluster rules" for the paper industry. Basically, 
these rules combine requirements under the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts. 
While the EPA claims the new rules would simplify existing regulations, 
many businesses say they actually complicate them. According to the paper 
industry, the rules would cost $11 billion in capital expenditures. According 
to the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the EPA admits "the new rules would force 
33 mills to close; 21,000 people would lose their jobs." 
<P>
Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative. The EPA's Great Lakes Initiative would 
impose uniform standards for water quality on eight different states in the 
Midwest (Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, 
Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin). The EPA first proposed the initiative on April 
16, 1993, and is required by court order to issue the rules on March 13, 1995. 
The EPA estimates that the proposal could cost from $80 million to $500 
million annually. But in a study conducted for the Council of Great Lakes 
Governors, DRI-McGraw Hill estimated that it would cost over $2 billion per 
year and up to 33,000 jobs lost. According to the Great Lakes Water Quality 
Coalition, which consists of local governments, businesses, and agricultural 
interests in the region, the initiative will not "significantly improve" water 
quality and "does not address the predominant sources of chemical pollutants 
into the Great Lakes Basin -- air deposition and stormwater runoff." 
<P>
Clean Air Act: California Federal Implementation Plan (FIP). The EPA is 
required by judicial deadline to issue in February its final federal plan to pu
three areas in California (Los Angeles, Sacramento, and Ventura) in 
compliance with the air quality requirements in the 1977 Clean Air Act. The 
1,700- page draft plan would impose draconian limits on emissions, ranging 
from factories to automobiles and trucks and even to lawn mowers. The EPA 
estimates that the FIP could cost Californians between $4 billion and $6 
billion annually. According to the State of California, when the FIP is fully 
implemented in 2010 the "losses will total at least $8.4 billion in direct cost
$17.2 billion in output, and 165,000 jobs." This estimate does not include the 
impact on transportation firms in the rest of the state that are affected by th
rule. 
<P>
<B> RECOMMENDED ACTIONS DURING THE MORATORIUM</B>
<P>
These proposals are only a sampling of the hundreds being worked on by 
federal agencies which together would impose many billions of dollars in 
regulatory burdens on the economy. A regulatory moratorium would allow 
Congress and the Administration to review the justifications for these rules to
see whether they follow the standards set by the Administration and should be 
allowed to move forward. Even more important, Congress also should use the 
interval to work on legislation that would roll back burdensome rules and 
overhaul the regulatory process. 
<P>
Clinton's Regulatory Review. According to President Clinton's executive 
order on regulatory review, the White House Office of Information and 
Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) and the federal agencies are supposed to weigh a 
number of factors when deciding to regulate. Specifically, the executive order 
requires that agencies planning to issue "significant rulemakings" (those 
estimated to cost more than $100 million annually) must analyze their costs, 
benefits, and possible alternatives.Although not a specific requirement, 
agencies are encouraged when setting regulatory priorities to consider the 
risks posed by "various substances or activities within its jurisdiction." 
Agencies also are required under the order to have a process by which they 
can review existing regulations. 
<P>
During the moratorium period, Congress and the Administration should 
review at least the ten or fifteen proposals expected to impose the largest 
burden on the economy to see whether agencies actually are following the 
Administration's own requirements to conduct cost-benefit analyses, consider 
risks, and look for less costly alternatives. The high cost of the regulations 
mentioned above raises questions about how closely the agencies are adhering 
to the executive order. In addition, Congress should review issues brought up 
in the Clinton Administration's own six-month review of the order. For 
example, although OIRA Administrator Sally Katzen stated that they had 
"made a very good start in implementing" it, she admitted that "the start-up 
time for various provisions of the Order has taken longer (and in some cases a 
lot longer)" than anticipated, such as agency review of existing regulations. I
addition, the report listed items for further consideration, such as how 
agencies determine which rules are "significant" and whether the definition 
needs to be clarified; whether executive branch review time limitations are 
sufficient -- especially for significant rules; and post hoc evaluation of rule
determine whether initial estimates were correct and the results expected 
achieved. 
<P>
OSHA's proposed rulemaking on indoor air quality is one example of a rule 
that would benefit from closer scrutiny. According to the Administration's six-
month review, OIRA spent only nine days reviewing an $8 billion-a-year 
regulation. Given OSHA's propensity for past regulatory excesses, this rule 
warrants more study. In addition, the agency's scientific justification for the
rule relies heavily on a controversial EPA second-hand smoke study. 
Congress, last year, almost passed legislation that would have given the EPA 
authority to conduct further studies and to educate the public and inspectors 
regarding "indoor air quality" or "sick building syndrome." Although the 
legislation states that the EPA is supposed to coordinate with OSHA, in 
certain cases the two agencies' responsibilities appear to overlap. 
<P>
The "Contract" Regulatory Reforms. Placing a freeze on most regulatory 
activity also would give Congress an interval within which to consider 
regulatory reforms such as those included in the House Republicans' Contract 
With America, as well as others introduced in the Senate. The unifying 
purpose of these proposals is to establish a more thorough system of scrutiny 
for proposed regulations than exists under current law and the Clinton 
executive order. 
<P>
The Contract With America contains major regulatory reforms which have 
been introduced by Representatives Bill Archer (R-TX), Tom DeLay (R- TX), 
Billy Tauzin (D-LA), Lamar Smith (R-TX), and others as the Job Creation 
and Wage Enhancement Act of 1995 (H.R. 9). The reforms include putting in 
place risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis procedures for regulations, a 
regulatory budget to control the cost of regulations, improvements in the 
Paperwork Reduction and Regulatory Flexibility Acts, and compensation for 
private property owners for government "takings" of their property. Most of 
these provisions were introduced in both Houses last year as separate pieces 
of legislation and came close to passage. 
<P>
Three reforms, in particular, would dramatically improve the current 
regulatory process: risk assessment/cost-benefit analysis, a regulatory budget,
and private property rights reform. Specifically: 
<P>
Congress should require agencies to base rules on sound science and to 
prioritize. 
<P>
Action should be taken to stop government from restricting private property 
to enforce environmental regulations. Out of simple fairness, the government 
should be required to reimburse property owners if a regulation restricts their
right to use their land. 
<P>
Debate over these measures, moreover, would help lay the needed 
groundwork for enactment of a regulatory budget. This reform would place a 
ceiling on the total estimated cost that could be imposed on the economy each 
year by all federal regulations. The agencies must improve their ability to 
estimate the cost of regulations and to prioritize before a regulatory budget 
can work or be enacted by Congress. 
<P>
<B> CONCLUSION 
</B>
<P>
Both the Clinton Administration and the new leadership in Congress have 
called for improving the regulatory process and easing the burden of red tape. 
Neither branch of government, however, has acted either to curb the volume 
of new rules or to lower the cost of regulations now in the pipeline. A 
regulatory moratorium would give both the Administration and Congress time 
to rethink current regulations and enact reforms to ease the impact of future 
rules.
