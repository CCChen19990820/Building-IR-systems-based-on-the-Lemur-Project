<b>The Week in Review</b><br>
<i>The last week's columns</i>

<b>AIR GUNS, INFANTICIDE AND ABORTION'S DEMENTED DOGMA</b></a><br>Last week, a Canadian court dismissed charges against an Ontario woman who chose to exercise control
     of her body by putting a pellet from an air gun in the brain of her unborn child. 
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/fields/fiel010697.html"><img src="/thcc/images/fields.gif" border="0" align="right" alt="SUZANNE FIELDS">
<b>AN EBONICS PLAGUE ON RACE RELATIONS</b></a><br>Ebonics has not been helpful to race relations. It brings out the worst thoughts if not the worst
     words from both black and white. Whites who defend ebonics as a second language, or even a place for
     it in the classroom, sound patronizing and condescending. 
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/greenberg/gree010697.html"><img src="/thcc/images/greenberg.gif" border="0" align="left" alt="Paul Greenberg">
<b>EBONICS</b></a><br>Today's lesson: You dis somebody's language, you be in trouble. 
 
         This caveat needs to be kept in mind as a national debate with a lot more heat than light erupts out
     of Oakland, Calif., where a school board seeking the usual federal grant set out to get one for the study of
     something called Ebonics.
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/novak/nova010697.html"><img src="/thcc/images/novak.gif" border="0" align="right" alt="ROBERT NOVAK">
<b>INSIDE REPORT</b></a><br>Rep. Linda Smith, who clashed with Newt Gingrich over campaign finance reform as
     a freshman Republican in the 104th Congress, could end up voting against his re-election as speaker of
     the House.
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/snow/snow010697.html"><img src="/thcc/images/snow.gif" border="0" align="left" alt="TONY SNOW">
<b>THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH</b></a><br>Scandal has crept upon the U.S. Capitol on little cat's feet. The "mindless
     cannibalism" Jim Wright prophesied nearly eight years ago has arrived: Democrats are turning
     Gingrich-bashing into an Olympic sport, and Republicans are preparing to conduct Torquemada-like
     inquisitions of Richard Gephardt, David Bonior, Bill Clinton, Hillary Rodham Clinton and anybody who
     has purchased so much as a frozen yogurt in the state of Arkansas. 
<p><br>

<b>EXIT BRYANT GUMBEL, UNPROFESSIONAL JOURNALIST</b></a><br>

Pop the champagne corks: The 15-year tenure of arrogant liberal Bryant Gumbel
     as host of NBC's "Today" show is over.
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/chapman/chap010397.html"><img src="/thcc/images/chapman.gif" border="0" align="right" alt="STEPHEN CHAPMAN">
<b>THE DRUG WARRIORS VS. MEDICAL MARIJUANA</b></a><br>

Federal drug czar Barry McCaffrey appeared at a news conference Monday to
     proclaim his "absolute trust in the judgment of the American people." He did this
     in the middle of a tantrum over two ballot initiatives approved by the people of
     California and Arizona, who last time I checked were still Americans.
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/novak/nova010397.html"><img src="/thcc/images/novak.gif" border="0" align="left" alt="ROBERT D. NOVAK">
<b>BUILDING NEWT'S LYNCH MOB</b></a><br>

Nothing in the assault on Newt Gingrich is more
     preposterous than the claim that he diverted funds from poor, hungry children to
     his scheme for a right-wing America.
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/snow/snow010397.html"><img src="/thcc/images/snow.gif" border="0" align="right" alt="TONY SNOW">
<b>BONIER V. GINGRICH</b></a><br>

David Bonior's crusade against Newt Gingrich has battered
     the speaker and splintered Republicans. Yet, few people realize it threatens to
     inflict even heavier damage on Democrats.
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/sowell/sowe010397.html"><img src="/thcc/images/sowell.gif" border="0" align="left" alt="THOMAS SOWELL">
<b>BRAINWASHING CONTINUES</b></a><br>

During a recent visit to Australia, a friend told me that he is going into debt to pay
     for private schooling for his children -- mainly to keep them away from the
     counter-cultural brainwashing that goes on in the public schools there. Of course,
     the same things go on in the public schools here.
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/tyrrell/tyrr010397.html"><img src="/thcc/images/tyrrell.gif" border="0" align="right" alt="R. EMMETT TYRRELL JR.">
<b>PUBLIC NUISANCES</b></a><br>

The most serious task facing American politics has moved beyond ministering to
     the material needs of the citizenry. In that pursuit, our government has failed
     spectacularly.
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/bozell/boze010297.html"><img src="/thcc/images/bozell.gif" border="0" align="left" alt="L. BRENT BOZELL">
<b>HOLLYWOOD'S WINNERS AND LOSERS, 1996</b></a><br>

Perhaps no industry is more happy to see 1996 come to an end than Hollywood. From
     start to finish, the year found the entertainment world embroiled in one controversy after
     another, under assault for its negative impact on the cultural well-being.
<p><br>

<b>PAUKEN WOULD TAKE TEXAS TRIUMPH NATIONAL</b></a><br>

The chairmanship of the Republican National Committee usually goes to one of the
     party's movers and shakers -- power brokers who are shaky on principles and primarily
     concerned with the forward movement of their careers.
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/huffington/huff010297.html"><img src="/thcc/images/huffington.gif" border="0" align="left" alt="HUFFINGTON">
<b>A BREAK IN THE RANKS</b></a><br>

"We have seen no
     erosion whatsoever," House Majority Whip Tom DeLay said on "Meet the Press"
     Sunday, echoing Majority Leader Dick Armey, who has been predicting with "no doubt"
     that all 227 Republican members will vote for the speaker.
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/saunders/saun010297.html"><img src="/thcc/images/saunders.gif" border="0" align="right" alt="DEBRA J. SAUNDERS">
<b>THE NEWTSTER IS SOUNDING LIKE HILLARY</b></a><br>


     "He screwed up, and he's admitted it," House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich
     told ABC News' "This Week" -- obviously referring to Speaker Newt Gingrich and his
     acknowledgment that he provided the House Ethics Committee with false information.

<b>THE FEDERALIST PAPERS REVISITED</b></a><br>

One of the small but hopeful changes that will come in with the New Year is a California
     law requiring high schools to include "The Federalist Papers" among their assigned
     readings.

<b>NEW YEARS RESOLUTIONS</b></a><br>We are once again at that time of the year when it is customary to confess our shortcomings and formulate our resolutions for
     overcoming them. In that spirit, I must confess to having written bad things about various liberal heroes and icons.

<b>POLITICS 1996: A BRIDGE TOO FAR</b></a><br>It's time for one last look at 1996 before we say goodbye -- a few final words (promise!) on the woeful political year behind
     us. And then a quick peek at 1997.

<b>LOSING IT AT THE MOVIES</b></a><br>Hollywood's obsession with violence and sex is well known, but maybe we ought to start paying attention to the ways certain movies twist sensibilities, not only making mush of moral issues, but depriving the audience of the slightest sense of thoughtful complexity and aesthetic cohesion.

Subject: C-NEWS: April Education Reporter [8 of 8]<P>

Education Briefs<P>
          Goals 2000 legislation may not be completely voluntary<BR>
          for the states after all. When Alabama Governor Fob<BR>
          James announced he would return the state's share of<BR>
          Goals 2000 funding ($6.6 million) and cease all<BR>
          participation in it, U.S. Education Secretary Richard<BR>
          Riley replied that dropping out is allowed only "if the<BR>
          appropriate authorities so decide." Riley has<BR>
          determined that the unelected State Superintendent<BR>
          Edward Richardson, who is "actively considering"<BR>
          spending the money, rather than Governor James,<BR>
          possesses the proper authority to make the decision <BR>
          to reject the funds.<P>

          Alabama Governor Fob James sent 800 copies of <BR>
          Darwin on Trial by Phillip Johnson to all the state's <BR>
          science teachers as a scientific counterbalance to<BR>
          controversial biology textbooks. The Alabama Course <BR>
          of Study for Science now requires that explanations of <BR>
          the origins of life be taught as theory rather than fact.<BR>
          (See Education Reporter, Dec. 1995.)<P>

          Republican legislators in California would like to<BR>
          penalize high schools for grade inflation as a form of<BR>
          consumer fraud. A 1993-94 study of freshmen at the 22<BR>
          campuses of the California State University system<BR>
          showed that nearly 50% of first-time freshmen need<BR>
          remedial courses in math, English, and writing. Many<BR>
          students graduate from high school with above B<BR>
          averages but still need remedial classes. Legislators<BR>
          proposed that high schools pay 100 percent of the cost<BR>
          of remedial work for students who receive a 3.8 or<BR>
          higher grade point average in college prep classes.<BR>
          Proponents of the legislation blame the remediation<BR>
          problem on the emphasis on self-esteem and the <BR>
          failure of bilingual education.<P>

          College freshmen are more conservative on certain<BR>
          issues than in years past. According to the Higher<BR>
          Education Research Institute, student support for<BR>
          legalized abortion and casual sex has dropped over the<BR>
          past 7-10 years. An all-time high attended a religious<BR>
          service during the past year.<P>

Capitol Hill Eagle Alert<P>

                           Phone: (202) 544-0353<P>

                                                         April 27, 1996<P>

                       ARE YOU OPPOSED TO CAREERS???<P>

                          THE TIME TO ACT IS NOW!!<P>

CAREERS, H.R. 1617, and its Senate counterpart, S. 143, the Workforce
Development Act, are still in conference and the conferees are hurrying to
finish the final bill (conference report) as quickly as they can. The House
Leadership plans to bring the conference report to the floor for final
passage as soon as it is ready. This means it can come up at any time! The
situation is critical!!! Many Members think there is little grassroots
opposition to the legislation, and that the opposition is being driven by a
few Washington, DC conservative leaders.<P>

The final version of the bill is not available, but because both the House
and Senate approve of and agree on the provisions we find most
objectionable (the "national data base" called the Labor Market Information
System, and the Workforce Development Boards), it is unlikely that the
conference report will be one we can accept. If this is ONLY a consolidation
bill, why are these provisions NECESSARY?<P>

If the CAREERS bill is to be stopped, the time to act is now. The House
Leadership must hear from real" voters today. The message is simple: NO
CAREERS THIS YEAR!!<P>

                        ---------------------------<P>

ACTION: Call and fax the following Members of the House the message:<P>

NO CAREERS THIS YEAR!<P>

Let them know that the conservative, grassroots voters are adamantly
opposed to this bill, and do not want it passed into law. Please contact
five friends who will also make the calls. Make the same calls again
tomorrow!<P>

These Members need to get hundreds of calls IMMEDIATELY!!<P>

1.) Speaker Newt Gingrich: phone - 202-225-0600; fax - 202-225-7733
     (Dan Meyer, Chief of Staff).<P>

     Message: Conservative voters do not want this bill to become law.        
     This bill is wholly inconsistent with the "Republican Revolution" 
     and we need Speaker Gingrich to stand with the grassroots in 
     opposition to the bill. NO CAREERS THIS YEAR!<P>

2.) Majority Leader Dick Armey: phone - 202-225-4000; fax- 202-226-8100
     (Mr. Kerry Knott, Chief of Staff) At a speech at the Heritage
     Foundation last month, Rep. Armey pushed CAREERRS as one of the 
     good things this Congress will do in the next several months. Mr.
     Armey is responsible for scheduling bills to be voted on, and he
     has tentatively scheduled this one for the first week in May.<P>

     Message: DO NOT LET THIS CONFERENCE REPORT COME TO THE FLOOR. The 
     bill is opposed by the conservative base and has been applauded by
     Bill Clinton. Let the bill remain in conference, and die in
     conference. NO CAREERS THIS YEAR!<P>

3.) Budget Chairman John Kasich: phone-202-225-5355; fax-202-226-5483.
     According to reliable sources, Mr. Kasich has been one of the most
     vocal supporters of CAREERS behind the scenes. He has been urging
     other Members of the leadership to pass this bill. Apparently, he
     is attracted to the (small) savings that come from "consolidating" 
     the various job training programs. He needs to hear that CAREERS is 
     bad policy, and Congress must reject bad policy no matter how much 
     savings are involved.<P>

     Message: Stop pushing CAREERS!! We do not want CAREERS THIS YEAR!<P>

           These Members must hear TODAY from real, live voters!<P>

Ultimate celebrates one-year anniversary<P>

        With the end of April, the Internet's one-stop source for right to
life information celebrates its first highly successful year.<P>

        Since its inception in April 1995, the Ultimate Pro-Life Resource
List has assisted thousands in finding up-to-date information and has
quickly become the most comprehensive listing of right to life resources
on the internet. It offers information including educational factsheets,
adoption resources, abortion alternatives, opinion pieces, timely news
items, the Ultimate Political Corner, and much more.<P>

        By virtue of its high-quality presentation and plethora oof
resources, Ultimate has received several net-related awards. Calling it
"remarkable for its depth and diversity," Point Communications named it as
one of the top five percent of all internet sites. It also highlighted
Ultimate's lack of "virulence" and sensationalism. Other awards include
mention of Ultimate in the Internet Clearinghouse and awards as the
Political Site of the Day and the Conservative Site of the Day. Ultimate
received a featured billing in Town Hall and has been listed on scores of
political and other internet sites.<P>

        Thanks to those who have stopped by Ultimate and who have written
to me to offer their comments about it. We will continue to offer the
highest quality right to life information in a positive and user-friendly
manner.<P>

<CENTER>                         CONGRESS ACTION                April 28 1996<BR>
                         ===============<BR>

STUPID IS AS STUPID DOES: Has the republican party decided it does 
not like leadership, or has it simply decided that, as worn out and 
useless as liberal ideas are, they are preferable to the hard work 
necessary to restore our nation to some semblance of the 
Constitutional republic it once was?<P>

   Unable to muster the courage needed to control wasteful and 
unconstitutional spending by stopping wasteful and unconstitutional 
spending, the republican majority, with the happy concurrence of 
many democrats, passed a Line Item Veto, and effectively passed the 
legislative buck to the Executive, giving the president even more 
power to blackmail congress and perhaps even increase pork spending. 
("Give me my billion for midnight basketball or I'll line out that 
road project in your district.") If Congress is unable to legislate 
the hard decisions they were sent to Washington to make, they should 
all just pack up and go home, and stop inflicting their arrogance on 
the rest of us who pay their salaries. They might as well do so 
anyway, having declared themselves superfluous with the Line Item 
Veto.<P>

   Then there is the Balanced Budget Amendment. Spending other 
people's money (ours) with profligate abandon, and like a drunk 
unable to resist just one more for the road, the beltway geniuses 
have hit upon the perfect solution: pass a Constitutional Amendment 
which will result in the federal courts deciding what they can and 
cannot spend money on. After all, the courts don't have enough 
autocratic power as it is, so give them some more. Then the 
president can pack his bags along with congress and they can all go 
home, and let the country be run by nine lifetime tenured potentates.<P>

    Next in the grab-bag of the absurd is Term Limits. They tell us, 
"Since we cannot be trusted to retire when we have outlived our 
usefulness, and since you voters are too stupid and complaisant to 
throw us out when we need throwing out, we'll just put the 
government on automatic pilot and let the law throw us all out, 
good, bad, and indifferent." And we voters, living down to the low 
opinion our legislators have of us, clamor, "Yes, please stop us 
before we vote again." Why? Because We, the People are incompetent 
to exercise our votes intelligently, for the greater good of the 
nation rather than for our own narrow self interest. This is the 
opinion our ruling elites have of us, and in our demand for Term 
Limits prove they are correct.<P>

   And what about the glowing promise of the conservative 
revolution, the promise to shrink the bloated federal government, to 
return self government to the States and the people? Which major 
program or agency has actually been eliminated? Which 
unconstitutional exercise of federal power has been curbed? Which 
oppressive federal regulations have been cut? What tax reform has 
been enacted, which taxes have been cut? What authority has been 
returned to parents to raise and to educate their children? On the 
plus side, a little noticed bill passed which mandates Congressional 
review of all regulations and allows affected businesses to take 
federal agencies to court. On the downside, a GOP response to the 
democrat minimum wage push, which would get the IRS even more deeply 
involved in wage decisions through EITC reform, and result in two 
equally qualified employees working side by side doing the same job 
getting different wages, because one has 1 child and the other has 2.<P>

   Far from seeing government shrink, we have seen an actual 
expansion: censoring the Internet and television content, violating 
our privacy and impairing our Constitutional rights in the guise of 
fighting terrorism, and policy surrenders ranging from AmeriCorps to 
funding for overseas abortion programs. The only real deficit 
reduction has come from the temporarily reduced funding while the 
government operated under the continuing resolutions of last winter. 
But no structural changes in big-cost entitlement programs.<P>

   Compare today's citizens with the character of the citizens of 
those 13 colonies who decided they were entitled to the right to 
control their own lives, and no longer wanted to cede that control 
to some distant bureaucrats. Imagine their courage and personal 
integrity as they pledged, and often sacrificed, everything they 
held dear to throw off the burdens of an oppressive government and 
"...to provide new Guards for their future Security", a new 
government deriving its just powers from the "Consent of the 
Governed." Unlike the beltway anointed who upbraid us for not 
putting our faith in government, the Founders viewed government with 
profound suspicion, and reserved their faith for other objects.<P>

   Now imagine the reaction of the Founders if they returned 209 
years later to survey the results of their handiwork of 1787, and 
they are told they would pay half of every dollar they earned to, 
for, or as a result of mandates from government; that they would see 
their land stolen and their livelihoods destroyed by the dictate of 
a government bureaucrat; that they would no longer have the right to 
control the education of their own children; that they would not be 
permitted to defend themselves and their loved ones from criminal 
predators intentionally loosed in their midst by their own 
government; that they would be vilified if they tried to bring 
religious piety to their public duties; that if they desired to 
start a business they would first have to seek permission from some 
bureaucrat who would, if permission were granted, tell them who they 
could hire and how much they had to pay; that their personal 
communications would be subject to oversight by faceless bureaucrats 
who could put them in prison if they said things deemed 
unacceptable; that the government created by the Constitution they 
adopted would daily, arrogantly, and with impunity ignore the limits 
placed on it by the very document which gave it legitimacy. Is this 
truly the country they created, or would they think their beloved 
America had been taken over by some foreign tyrant? How would they 
reconcile the fact that we in this country still pay lip service to 
that same Constitution, yet live as we do under a government as 
hostile to the liberties they thought they had safeguarded as any 
eighteenth century monarchy?<P>

   What would that Founding generation think of their heirs living 
thus? Would they deem us to be a stupid people? Maybe, seeing the 
billions we spend on pre-natal care, yet wantonly killing our unborn 
by the millions, often by methods which the Spanish Inquisition 
would consider barbaric; seeing the loony left adopt the Unabomber 
as their hero and the loony right adopt the Freemen as theirs; 
seeing how we have squandered the heritage of Freedom they fought and 
suffered and died for. The Founders warned of the dangers of a 
government which defined the limits of its own power, for the powers 
of such a government have no limits. They adopted a written 
Constitution for the express purpose of imposing external limits on 
the new government they created, limits which were not to be defined 
by that government itself but by the People from whom those powers 
were derived. Our federal government has arrogated to itself the 
sole authority to define, through one of its own subdivisions -- the 
Supreme Court -- the limits of its own powers. Is it any wonder that 
our federal government has rarely found its own exercise of power to 
be improper?<P>

   "A constitution is a thing antecedent to a government, and a 
government is only the creature of a constitution. The constitution 
of a country is not the act of its government, but of the people 
constituting a government. It is the body of elements, to which you 
can refer, and quote article by article; and which contain the 
principles on which the government shall be established, the manner 
in which it shall be organized, the powers it shall have...and the 
principles on which it shall act and by which it shall be bound. A 
government on the principles on which constitutional governments, 
arising out of society are established, cannot have the right of 
altering itself. If it had, it would be arbitrary. It might make 
itself what it pleased; and wherever such a right is set up, it 
shows that there is no constitution." -- Thomas Paine (The Rights of 
Man, 1791)<P>

WHERE CREDIT IS DUE: In the 1960's liberals conceived a variety of 
social programs designed to eliminate poverty, crime, drug use, 
illegitimacy, and broken families. That every one of those problems 
is worse now, by any measure, than when liberals set out to fix them 
is beyond dispute. The architects of that massive social engineering 
claim that unforseen factors and outside events caused the failure 
of their vision, and deny that it was their vision itself which was 
misconceived, counterproductive, and wrong-headed from the start.<P>

   Imagine for a moment that we looked around today and saw that 
poverty, crime, drug use, illegitimacy, and broken families had all 
been eliminated. Can anyone deny that the liberal social architects 
would claim full credit for their successes, and deservedly so? 
However, when we survey our society today we do not see successes, 
we see instead abject, monumental failures. Liberal social 
architects, and their liberal democrat allies in the Congress, a 
Congress which they controlled over that entire period of time and 
which enacted all the laws and created all the programs demanded by 
the social architects, bear full responsibility for the dismal state 
of our society. Good or bad, we must give credit where credit is 
due: the social decay we see all around us is their doing, and 
theirs alone.<P>

**Hill Watch:  Update on Budgetary Issues on Capitol Hill <P>

*Battle Over Moving Transportation Funds Off-Budget Moves to Senate<P>

While the American Automobile Association runs an ad in Roll Call saying 
"thanks!" to "the 284 Members of the House of Representatives who voted 
for the Truth in Budgeting Act (H.R. 842)," which passed the House April 
17, Senators Don Nickles (R-OK), Pete Domenici (R-NM), Charles Grassley 
(R-OK), Slade Gorton (R-WA), Mark Hatfield (R-OR) and John Chafee (R-RI)  
are circulating a "Dear Colleague" letter announcing that they "strongly 
oppose" H.R. 842 and "will work for its defeat if this issue comes before 
the Senate."  H.R. 842 would take transportation trust funds off-budget.  
The Senators say they oppose it because "activities taken off-budget 
would no longer be held to budget discipline, such as budget caps which 
limit discretionary budget authority and outlays and pay-as-you-go rules 
which contain direct spending programs."  Opponents of H.R. 842 consider 
it to be a clever attempt to raise federal transportation spending.

*Forget Raising the Minimum Wage: There's a Better Way<P>

Members of Congress concerned about the job-killing aspects of raising 
the minimum wage but looking for a no-down-side way to help low-income 
families should consider sponsoring a bill drafted by a New York 
investment group to help people finance additional job training and/or 
tuition for higher education.  Human Capital Resources Inc. wants to find 
investors to finance 100% of a student's job training or tuition expenses 
in return for a fixed percentage of the student's future earnings 
(subject to a cap).  The HCR proposal shows great promise as a means to 
help people stuck in low-wage jobs finance the job training they need to 
be eligible for better jobs, and it would require no taxpayer funds: just 
a minor change in the tax laws.  Contact Roy Chapman or Gerard Wendelken 
at (212) 587-8977.  <P>

**Waste Patrol:  Where the government can slim down <P>

*Taxpayer Funds Used to Promote Social Security System Student Curriculum 
Uses Horror Stories to Broaden Social Security's Appeal<P>

The Social Security Administration is distributing materials designed to 
indoctrinate the nation's youth on the virtues of the current social 
security system in an effort to broaden public support for the mandatory 
system.  Entitled "Social Security and You," the materials consist of 
five lessons, a 25-minute video, fact sheets, quizzes and handouts geared 
to high school students -- those most likely to experience social 
security "sticker shock" as new entrants in the labor force. To bolster 
the case for Social Security as is, "Social Security and You" employs 
resorts to such fear-mongering tactics as describing life in America 
during the Great Depression -- before the Social Security system existed. 
 Here's how the teacher's guide for "Social Security and You" describes 
the premise of the course's 25-minute video: "Members of a band composed 
of high school students saving money from part-time jobs to make a demo 
find the deductions from their checks to be a stumbling block.  They 
decide to start a movement to abolish Social Security, partly as a 
publicity stunt... partly a serious effort to mobilize public opinion 
against the program.  They run into personal difficulties as they find 
that members of their families and friends are collecting Social Security 
or counting on it as part of their financial planning.  A stranger in a 
wheelchair challenges their knowledge of what Social Security is all 
about... A grandfather describes what it was like living during the Great 
Depression and the promise that the passage of the Social Security Act 
meant to millions of Americans... A schoolmate tells what Social Security 
benefits mean to her since her father died.  The band members become 
aware that everybody has a stake in Social Security..." With their 
new-found enlightenment, the band members presumably lived happily ever 
after.  "Social Security and You" also suggests that teachers conduct the 
following exercise: "Ask female students to stand and form groups of four 
and male students to form groups of three.  Have one student in each 
group sit down... Then state that one out of four females will become 
severely disabled or die before reaching retirement age... Show 
videotape: 'Social Security: The Real Story.'"  The "real story" of 
Social Security is that taxpayer funds are being used for political purposes.<P>

**Hill Watch - Regulatory relief initiative on Capitol Hill  <P>

*DOT Regulations: A Highway of Overregulation.  <P>

The U.S. Department of Transportation's hazardous materials regulations 
may well qualify as the most complex, broad, and in many cases 
unnecessary regulations in the whole panoply of federal regulation.  For 
example, any business that ships any quantity of relatively benign 
materials like spray paint or nail polish remover is required to carry 
complicated shipping papers, mark containers, provide DOT- mandated 
training to employees every two years and retain records for a least one 
year.  House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-TX) and Representative Gary 
Condit (D-CA) filed H.R. 3153 on March 22 to exempt small vehicles 
carrying relatively small quantities of hazardous materials from DOT's 
HazMAT regulations.  The bill, which has been referred to the 
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, now has some 50 cosponsors.  
If you are concerned about this issue or would like more information, 
contact Bob Rosenberg at the National Pest Control Association @ 
(703)573-8330, Monica Vegas in the Majority Whip's office or Robert 
Guenther in Representative Condit's office. <P> 

**Resource Center - Ideas, materials and strategies for effective

*Modernization of Clean Water Act Key to Environmental Progress New 
Info-Pak Released. <P>

The Clean Water Industry Coalition (CWIC) has developed new materials on 
the Clean Water Act that emphasize the environmental benefits of 
modernizing the current law.  "Over the past year, the debate about how 
to extend our nation's environmental laws has been marred by extreme 
rhetoric...  The issue is not and never has been whether we protect the 
environment, but rather how we protect it," says the coalition.  The CWIC 
argues that while the current Act has been successful in controlling 
pollution of the nation's streams since it was enacted in 1972, new 
problems have arisen that it can not adequately address.  For copies of 
the Info Pak, contact Charlie Ingram at (202)463-5533.  <P>

*Environmentalist Becomes Victim of Environmental Distortion<P>
  
John Viehman, Executive Editor of Backpacker, got a good taste of how 
environmentalists can distort the truth.   Late last year, he travelled 
to Johnstone Strait (British Columbia) -- where Killer Whales are known 
to congregate -- for an episode of his public television show, Trailside. 
 He asked a Canadian official for permission to film the orcas, but the 
request was denied.  That didn't stop environmentalists who overheard him 
making the request from broadcasting over their radios that a "rabid 
television group was diving inches from the... orcas."  Said Viehman, 
"Who among us would want to live in a world filled with wilderness and 
whales but blanketed in lies?"  For more information, call The National 
Center at (202)543-1286.  <P>

*Environmental Resource Locator Where You Can Turn for Help on 
Environmental and Regulatory Issues<P>

The National Center for Public Policy Research's Environmental Policy 
Task Force has

   Welcome to the FRC information line. This message will be updated on
   Friday, May 3 at the close of business.<P>
   
   Appropriations for the FY 96 finally pass. A bill is introduced to
   promote adoption. A hearing is called on the implications of Roe v.
   Wade on the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban.<P>
   
   
   
  Issue One.<P>
  
   
   
   Omnibus Appropriations bill. On Thursday April 25, Congress passed and
   the President signed HR 3019, a bill to fund a variety of federal
   agencies whose appropriations had previously been vetoed by President
   Bill Clinton or stalled in Congress. There were several provisions in
   the bill that the Family Research Council supported. A permanent
   protection for medical schools that decline to provide abortion
   training. The House accepted the Senate's Coats amendment which will
   protect these teaching institutions from a loss of federal funds that
   would have occurred as a result of a directive issued by the
   Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). The
   omnibus funding bill also contributes to the attainment of $23 billion
   in savings from FY 1995 levels. These savings have reduced federal
   borrowing obligations and contributed to the lowering of interest
   rates, thus increasing the purchasing power of millions of American
   families. This legislation also sustained the reductions in funding
   for the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) and the limitations on LSC
   activities that were contained in the Commerce-Justice-State
   Appropriations Conference Report (H.R. 2076), a bill that had earlier
   been vetoed by President Clinton. Given the LSC's track record,
   however, we remain highly skeptical that these limitations will be
   properly enforced. FRC will continue to call on Congress to eliminate
   funding for this seriously flawed program. Despite these very laudable
   components, we are very disappointed with some of the provisions in
   H.R. 3019. The restoration of funding for the intrusive Goals 2000
   program constitutes an inappropriate use of federal funds, although
   the funding level is slightly lower than in FY 1995. We disagree with
   the conferees' decision to drop a House provision relating to adoption
   petitions submitted by unmarried individuals in the District of
   Columbia. We also find it ironic that the conferees overturned the law
   calling for the discharge of HIV-positive military personnel even
   though Congress has not yet passed legislation to ensure treatment of
   newborn babies who are HIV infected.<P>
   
   
   
  Issue Two.<P>
  
   
   
   Adoption Promotion and Stability Act of 1996, HR 3286. Susan Molinari
   (R-NY) introduced HR 3286 on Wednesday, April 24. The Adoption
   Promotion and Stability Act of 1996 will include three main provisions
   to relieve the backlog of unadopted children in America today. A
   $5,000 Adoption Tax Credit, prohibitions on racial considerations
   being used to delay or deny adoptions and Reform of the Indian Child
   Welfare Act so that the rights of children, adoptive parents and birth
   parents are given proper consideration. The $5,000 Adoption Tax Credit
   provision had already been passed in a larger bill, the welfare reform
   bill (HR 4), that President Clinton vetoed, so there is hope that in
   this stand alone bill the credit will be successful. Congressman Jerry
   Solomon (R-NY) said the package "provided long overdue reform and a
   welcome emphasis on the strength and value of the family in today's
   society." At present there are over 500,000 children currently in the
   foster care system, and as it exists now, only about 50,000 children
   are cleared for adoption each year. The goal of this legislation is to
   break down the bureaucratic barriers and encourage families to adopt
   to help get these children out of the foster care system and into
   homes with loving families.<P>
   
   
   
  Issue Three.<P>
  
   
   
   Roe v. Wade Hearing. On Monday, April 22 House Judiciary Subcommittee
   Chairman Charles Canady (R-FL) called for hearings to examine the
   argument put forward by President Clinton in his veto message that the
   Constitution, as interpreted by Roe, protects the partial-birth
   abortion procedure. Canady said Roe only deals with fetuses, not with
   "partially born children." President Clinton vetoed the Partial-Birth
   Abortion Ban on April 10, 1996 making the argument that Roe v. Wade
   requires Congress to allow this procedure. However, congressman Canady
   and others argue that Roe v. Wade does not legalize this horrific
   procedure. In Texas a statute that was left intact by the Supreme
   Court outlawed killing a child "in the state of being born." This
   statute still exists. An incredibly moving witness in this hearing was
   Gianna Jessen, a 19 year-old survivor of an abortion. Miss Jessen
   stated, "My biological mother was 17 years old and 7-1/2 months
   pregnant when she made the decision to have a saline abortion. I am
   the person that she aborted. I lived instead of died, at 6:00 a.m. on
   the morning of April 6, 1977 ... Some have said that I am a 'botched
   abortion' -- a result of a job not well done.... I was just as much a
   person when I was aborted as I am today." Unfortunately this hearing
   was not well attended. Pro-abortion Rep. Pat Schroeder (D-CO)
   boycotted the hearing, saying it was only designed to "undermine the
   public's consistent and overwhelming support for Roe v. Wade." Ms.
   Schroeder and others continue to ignore the fact that 80 percent of
   Americans think abortion should either be legal only in the first
   trimester or should be prohibited except in very narrow cases like
   rape and incest or life of the mother (Nov. 94 Wirthlin Poll). Rep.
   Charles Canady states, "Americans never consented to, or indicated
   support for, abortion on demand -- but Roe v. Wade instituted it.<P>

<H2>ONLY EIGHT OF 150 WORLD ECONOMIES RATED "FREE" ON 1997 "INDEX OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM"</H2></CENTER>
<p>
	<B>WASHINGTON</B> -- If the economy of Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest countries, keeps growing at its current rate, living standards there won't reach those currently enjoyed by the Western nations for another 102 years. But if Bangladesh frees its economy and achieves growth rates on par with those of, say, Singapore, the people of Bangladesh would be living as well as Americans do today in just 40 years.
<P>
	That's just one of the findings from the 1997 "Heritage Foundation/<I>Wall Street Journal</I> Index of Economic Freedom," a 520-page book that rates economic freedom -- or the lack of it -- in 150 of the world's 191 countries. 
<P>
	The major finding of the "Index" -- a joint publication of The Heritage Foundation, a prominent Washington-based think tank, and <I>The Wall Street Journal</I>, the global business newspaper -- is clear: "Countries with the most economic freedom have higher rates of economic growth than those with less economic freedom," say co-editors <A HREF="/heritage/staff/holmes.htm">Kim Holmes</A>, Heritage vice president for foreign policy studies, <A HREF="/heritage/staff/johnson.htm">Bryan Johnson</A>, Heritage policy analyst, and Melanie Kirkpatrick, assistant editor of the Journal's editorial page. 
<P>
	The problem is, only eight countries have economies that can be classified as "free," according to the study.  This is down from 11 last year, but up from seven in 1995, the first year the "Index" was published. All told, the 1997 "Index" shows that 78 countries have economies that are either "mostly unfree," like Bangladesh, or "repressed," like Libya and Cuba, but only 72 countries whose economies earn ratings of "mostly free" or "free." 
<P>
	The British colony of Hong Kong (which reverts to Chinese control on July 1, 1997) is credited with having the freest economy in the world, thanks to its low taxes, almost non-existent trade barriers, world-class banking system and minimal regulation. The other seven countries with "free" economies, in descending order, are Singapore, Bahrain, New Zealand, Switzerland, the United States, the United Kingdom and Taiwan. Of the 18 countries that earned the label economically "repressed," the five worst (starting at the bottom) are North Korea, Laos, Cuba, Iraq and Vietnam.
<P>
	The "Index" scores the relative freedom of economies based on 10 factors -- trade policy, tax policy, government consumption of economic output, monetary policy, foreign investment, wage and price controls, property rights, regulation, and the size of the black market. In each category, a country's economy is assigned a score on a scale from one (best) to five (worst). 
<P>
<B>Economic Freedom Sparks Growth</B>
<P>
	Besides providing an annual snapshot of economic freedom around the world, the Heritage Foundation/<I>Wall Street Journal</I> "Index" is a powerful tool to explain why some countries (and their people) prosper, while others lag behind. In a new chapter added this year, Heritage Foundation economist <a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William Beach</a> examines the relationship between the degree of economic freedom in a country and its rate of economic growth and finds a statistically significant correlation between the two (at the 99 percent confidence level). "Our analysis strongly suggests that countries with free-market public policies grow faster than countries that discourage economic freedoms," Beach says. 
<P>
	While this may seem obvious, Beach takes pains to stress that it is a country's degree of economic freedom -- not its population growth, access to natural resources, or pace of technological change -- that appears to determine its potential for significant economic growth. He is joined in this conclusion by many economists who espouse what is called "new growth theory," which rejects the view that long-term economic growth happens only by accelerating a country's technological change. Instead, these economists believe a country's "institutional setting" -- its economic freedom, if you will -- most strongly influences growth rates. As Mancur Olson, a leading growth-theory economist quoted by Beach, puts it: "The only ... plausible explanation is that the great differences in the wealth of nations are mainly due to differences in the quality of their institutions and economic policies."
<P>
	This has obvious implications for the world's poorer countries, which need not resign themselves to sub-par economic growth rates, Beach says. "There is no reason that Bangladesh, or other poor countries, can't achieve economic growth rates that would put their living standards on par with those of developed countries within a generation," he says. "The key is economic freedom."
<P>
<B>An Investor's Tool</B>
<P>
	In another new chapter added this year, <I>Wall Street Journal</I> Deputy Editor (International) George Melloan examines how the "Index" can be used by those engaged in "country risk analysis," a rapidly emerging field spawned by the rush of Western capital into foreign markets. Americans alone, for example, purchased $51.2 billion in foreign stocks and $46.8 billion in foreign bonds in 1995. Foreign direct investment in developing countries totaled $90 billion.
<P>
	While Melloan concedes that country risk analysis involves a lot of guesswork, he says "it goes without saying that open systems where there is a high degree of economic and political freedom are easier to assess than closed or partly closed systems."  It is here that the "Index" shows its value, pointing risk specialists toward countries whose economic freedom makes them more attractive investment opportunities. 
<P>
	For example, the countries in the upper regions of the "Index" -- such as the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Germany -- also receive straight A's from the bond-rating firm of Standard & Poors, marking them as sound investments. 
<P>
	But there are also cases where countries that score poorly on the "Index" are viewed by risk analysts as worthy investments. China is a case in point. Ranking only 125th on the "Index," China has nevertheless attracted a flood of foreign investment in recent years -- $27.5 billion in 1993, up from $4.3 billion in 1991.  Melloan says this in no way invalidates the importance of economic freedom to a country's development, but rather reflects both the attractiveness of China's sheer size and its skillful ability to capture foreign investment. Moreover, he says, China's economic resurgence almost certainly will not last unless its leaders further reduce government intervention in its economy.
<P>
	In the end, country risk analysis is "a little bit like critiquing art," Melloan says. "Most of the specialists think they know a good risk when they see it, and the more freedom of decision-making they see in any given system, the more likely they are to judge it favorably. That is why the 'Index of Economic Freedom' is a valuable tool for the investor."
<P>
<B>Foreign Aid: More Harm Than Good</B>
<P>
	If the "Index" explains what works in moving countries up the economic ladder, it also explains what doesn't: foreign aid. In fact, the data demonstrate that "instead of helping poor countries lift themselves out of poverty, development aid often impedes their economic growth," says co-author Bryan Johnson. 
<P>
	Because many long-term U.S. foreign-aid recipients have unfree or repressed economies, Johnson says, the money spent on them is useless or even harmful. Consider:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Haiti</B>, which has relied on U.S. foreign aid for 52 years, remains one of the world's poorest countries. Despite nearly $1 billion in U.S. aid, Haiti's per capita gross domestic product (GDP) fell from $360 in 1965 to $225 in 1994.
<P>
<LI><B>Peru</B> has also received U.S. foreign aid for 52 years, nearly $2 billion worth. Yet its per capita GDP dropped from $1,307 in 1965 to $1,103 in 1994.
<P>
<LI><B>Somalia</B> has taken nearly $1 billion in U.S. aid during the past 41 years, yet its per capita GDP declined from $123 in 1965 to $111 in 1993.
</UL>
<P>
	All told, of the 78 countries ranked as mostly unfree or repressed on the "Index," 34 have received U.S. foreign aid for more than three decades, Johnson says. Of these 34 countries, 23 are no better off today than they were in 1965; and of these 23, 13 are actually poorer today than they were in 1965.
<P>
	Johnson notes that countries graduating to the developed world in the last 20 years -- such as Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea and Chile -- have done so largely without the crutch of foreign aid. At the same time, he says, countries in sub-Saharan Africa, a region receiving large amounts of foreign aid, have remained impoverished. The difference, again, is economic freedom: The "Asian Tigers" and Chile embraced the free-market reforms necessary to spark economic growth, the African nations haven't. 
<P>
	A comparison of two countries -- Niger and Singapore -- makes the point. While the African nation has received half a billion dollars in U.S. aid during the past 37 years, its per capita wealth shrank from $617 in 1965 to $272 in 1994 -- a drop of more than 60 percent.  Singapore, by contrast, was cut off from most foreign aid by the late 1960s, yet its per capita GDP has exploded from $1,863 in 1965 to $23,360 in 1994 -- a twelvefold increase. 
<P>
	"If development aid is essential to economic prosperity," Johnson asks, "why has there been so little progress by the countries most dependent on foreign aid? The fact is, poverty is largely a condition imposed on people by ill-conceived and repressive economic policies." 
<P>
<B>Regional Breakdown</B>
<P>
	Some of the key findings of the 1997 Heritage Foundation/<I>Wall Street Journal</I> "Index" concerning specific regions and countries include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B> Europe.</B> Switzerland remains the economically freest country in Europe (and fifth overall), followed by the United Kingdom (seventh), the Netherlands (ninth), and the Czech Republic, Denmark and Luxembourg (all tied for 11th). While some formerly communist countries continue to advance toward economic freedom, with the Czech Republic and Estonia (25th) leading the way, others are making little progress, including Bulgaria (108th), Russia and Albania (tied for 115th). Interestingly, Germany (20th) is the only country in Europe to receive a worse score in each successive edition of the "Index," the latest drop stemming from a failure to complete its privatization of state-owned industries.
<P>
<LI><B>Latin America.</B> Chile (22nd) has surpassed Panama (31st) as the freest economy in Latin America, due largely to progress on reducing trade barriers and eliminating price controls, Johnson says. By contrast, little progress has occurred in Mexico (94th), which continues to have a mostly unfree economy. Colombia (78th) and Venezuela (108th) both have received worse scores in each successive edition of the "Index," while Guatemala (50th), Peru (64th) and Ecuador (75th) have each recorded successively better scores. Cuba's economy remained repressed.
<P>
<LI><B>Asia.</B> Despite enthusiasm from the investment community, Vietnam (143rd) remains economically repressed, owing to corrupt border officials, inadequate foreign investment laws, and minimal protections for private property. Japan's score remained unchanged from last year, as did its status as one of the world's 11 freest economies. Overall, the countries of Asia remain a striking mix of the economically free -- Hong Kong (first), Singapore (second), Taiwan (seventh), Thailand (23rd) -- and the unfree -- North Korea and Laos (tied for 148th), Myanmar (formerly Burma, 140th), and China (125th).
<P>
<LI><B>Africa.</B> Of the 40 African countries graded, not one received a score of free, seven received scores of mostly free, 26 scored mostly unfree, and seven were repressed. Morocco was the freest (46th) while Somalia and Libya (tied for 143rd) were the most repressed. Of the 18 repressed countries worldwide, more than a third are in Africa.

<H2>FOREIGN AID CAN IMPEDE ECONOMIC
GROWTH IN POOR COUNTRIES, 1997
"INDEX OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM" SHOWS</H2>
</CENTER>
<p>
        <B>WASHINGTON</B> -- If there's one thing poor countries don't need, it's more U.S. foreign aid.
<P>
	That's the conclusion of the 1997 "Heritage Foundation/<I>Wall Street Journal</I> Index of Economic Freedom," a global survey that measures economic freedom -- or the lack of it -- in 150 of the world's 191 countries. On this point the "Index" is clear: It is the level of economic freedom enjoyed by citizens and businesses in a given country, not foreign aid, that matters most in achieving economic growth. 
<p>
	If anything, the study argues, foreign aid does more harm than good. "Instead of helping poor countries lift themselves out of poverty, development aid often impedes their economic growth," says Heritage Policy Analyst <A HREF="/heritage/staff/johnson.htm">Bryan Johnson</A>, co-editor of the "Index" along with <A HREF="/heritage/staff/holmes.htm">Kim Holmes</A>, Heritage vice president for foreign policy studies, and Melanie Kirkpatrick, assistant editor of <I>The Wall Street Journal</I>'s editorial page. 
<P>
	Economic freedom, by contrast, produces high rates of economic growth. For example, the 10 economically freest countries on the "Index" -- Hong Kong, Singapore, Bahrain, New Zealand, Switzerland, the United States, the United Kingdom, Taiwan, the Bahamas and the Netherlands -- all have high standards of living. But the 10 least economically free countries -- North Korea, Laos, Cuba, Iraq, Vietnam, Somalia, Libya, Iran, Azerbeijan and Angola and Myanmar -- all suffer from chronic poverty. "The 'Index' demonstrates unequivocally that countries with the highest levels of economic freedom also have the highest living standards," the editors say.
<P>
	A joint publication of <A HREF="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</A>, a prominent Washington-based think tank, and <A HREF="http://wsj.com"><I>The Wall Street Journal</I></A>, the global business newspaper, the "Index" scores the relative freedom of economies based on 10 factors: trade policy, tax policy, government consumption of economic output, monetary policy, foreign investment, wage and price controls, property rights, regulation, and the size of the black market. In each category, a country's economy is assigned a score on a scale from one (best) to five (worst). The 10 least-free economies listed above are not alone. All told, the 1997 "Index" finds, 78 countries are either "mostly unfree" or "repressed," while only 72 countries are "mostly free" or "free."
<P>
<B>The Fruits of Foreign Aid</B>
<P>
	Of the 78 countries ranked as economically unfree, 34 have received U.S. foreign aid for more than three decades, Johnson found. Of these 34 countries, 23 are no better off today than they were in 1965; and of these 23, 13 are actually poorer than they were in 1965.
<P>	"The facts show that no amount of foreign aid can correct conditions caused by economically repressive policies," Johnson says. As evidence, he offers some particularly glaring case studies:
<P><UL>
<LI><B>Haiti</B>, which has relied on U.S. foreign aid for 52 years, remains one of the world's poorest countries. Despite nearly $1 billion in U.S. aid, Haiti's per capita gross domestic product (GDP) fell from $360 in 1965 to $225 in 1994.
<P>
<LI><B>Peru</B> has also received U.S. foreign aid for 52 years, nearly $2 billion worth. Yet its per capita GDP dropped from $1,307 in 1965 to $1,103 in 1994.
<P>
<LI><B>Somalia</B> has taken nearly $1 billion in U.S. aid during the past 41 years, yet its per capita GDP declined from $123 in 1965 to $111 in 1993.
</UL>
<P>
	By contrast, those countries that have graduated to the developed world in the last 20 years -- Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea and Chile -- have done so largely without the crutch of foreign aid. The difference, Johnson says, comes down to economic freedom: The "Asian Tigers" and Chile embraced the free-market reforms necessary to spark economic growth, the aid-dependent nations haven't.
<P>
	A comparison of two countries -- Niger and Singapore -- makes the point. While the African nation has received a half a billion dollars in U.S. aid during the past 37 years, its per capita wealth shrank from $617 in 1965 to $272 in 1994 -- a drop of more than 60 percent.  Singapore, by contrast, was cut off from most foreign aid by the late 1960s, yet its per capita GDP has exploded from $1,863 in 1965 to $23,360 in 1994 -- a twelvefold increase. 
<P>
	Similar findings from the first edition of the "Index," published in 1995, led Congress to re-examine how the U.S. government dispenses foreign-aid dollars. In the fiscal year 1996 Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill, lawmakers included a provision that requires the Agency for International Development (AID) to report to Congress each year on the relative economic freedom of recipient countries.
<P>
	"If development aid is essential to economic prosperity," Johnson asks, "why has there been so little progress by the countries most dependent on foreign aid? The fact is, poverty is largely a condition imposed on people by ill-conceived and repressive economic policies." 
<P>
<B>Economic Freedom Sparks Growth</B>
<P>
	The evidence that economic freedom leads to prosperity is more than anecdotal. In a new chapter added to the "Index" this year, Heritage Foundation economist <a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William Beach</a> examines the relationship between a country's degree of economic freedom and its rate of economic growth and finds a statistically significant correlation between the two (at the 99 percent confidence level). "Our analysis strongly suggests that countries with free-market public policies grow faster than countries that discourage economic freedoms," Beach says. 
<P>
	While this may seem obvious, Beach takes pains to stress that it is a country's degree of economic freedom -- not its population growth, access to natural resources, or pace of technological change -- that appears to determine its potential for significant economic growth. He is joined in this conclusion by many economists who espouse what is called "new growth theory," which rejects the view that long-term economic growth happens only by accelerating a country's technological change. Instead, these economists believe a country's "institutional setting" -- its economic freedom, if you will -- most strongly influences growth rates. As Mancur Olson, a leading growth-theory economist quoted by Beach, puts it: "The only ... plausible explanation is that the great differences in the wealth of nations are mainly due to differences in the quality of their institutions and economic policies."
<P>
	This has obvious implications for the world's poorer countries, which need not resign themselves to sub-par economic growth rates, Beach says. "There is no reason that Haiti, or other poor countries, can't achieve economic growth rates that would put their living standards on par with those of developed countries within a generation," he says. 
<P>
	By way of example, Beach notes that if the economy of Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest countries, keeps growing at its current rate, living standards there won't reach those currently enjoyed by the Western nations for another 102 years. But if Bangladesh frees its economy and achieves growth rates on par with those of, say, Singapore, the people of Bangladesh would be living as well as Americans do today in just 40 years. "The key is economic freedom," Beach says.

<title>Gary Palmer -- Labor Union Politicking</title>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<blockquote><blockquote>

<center>
<h3>
Labor Union Politicking
</h3>
</center>
<p>
<HR Size=3 Width=30%>
<p>
While watching the Democratic National Convention, I noticed that a 
disproportionate number of the delegates were wearing or holding 
emblems of the National Education Association (NEA).  
<p>
I can't say that I was surprised.  I had just read a report from the 
Alexis de Tocqueville Institution (AdTI) on the political influence of 
various groups, particularly labor unions.  According to AdTI, labor 
political action committees (PACs) are by far the most partisan of all 
PACs.  Based on the latest Federal Election Commission data for the 
1995-96 campaign cycle, the study found that, while the leading 
business groups have been pro-Republican in their contributions, they 
have still given more than 20 percent of their funds to Democratic 
candidates.  The partisanship ration of business contributions to 
Republicans over Democrats is four-to-one.
<p>
But when it comes to trial lawyers, big labor, and the teacher's 
unions, big business is out of its league.  Trial lawyers contribute 
to Democrats over Republicans by seven-to-one.  In the 1995-96 
election cycle the trial lawyers gave $1,359,475 to Democratic 
candidates but only $188,500 to Republican candidates, hardly enough 
to buy an election for one judge in Alabama.  
<p>
Big labor is even more partisan.  Labor unions contributed barely two 
percent of their funds to Republican candidates, or $1 for every $44 
to Democrats.  The NEA and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) 
are the most blatantly pro-Democrat with 99 percent of their funds 
going to Democratic candidates.  The NEA gave Democrats $1.2 million 
and only $5,350 to Republicans; the AFT gave the Democrats $446,375 
and only $4,250 to Republicans.
<p>
What is so odd about all of this is that in the last couple of 
elections, with the exception of the trial lawyers, a near majority of 
the labor union members and teachers have voted for Republican 
candidates.  School teachers and union workers are routinely far more 
conservative in their social, cultural, and political views than the 
candidates whose campaigns their dues money supports.  Based on this 
information it is pretty obvious that the leadership of big labor and 
the teachers' unions are forcing a liberal agenda on their members and 
paying for it with the members' own money.
 <p>
Many teachers and union members are not aware that they do not have to 
give political money to the NEA or their union.  According to a 1988 
Supreme Court decision in Beck v. Communications Workers of America 
unions are only allowed to collect dues for the purpose of collective 
bargaining.  Other dues for political purposes can only be taken with 
the employee's permission.
<p>
Under the Beck decision, teachers and union members in states without 
right to work laws can prevent a portion of their paycheck from going 
to fund political candidates who may or may not represent their views.  
In fact, teachers and union members can request that all dues that 
have been deducted from their paychecks for political purposes be 
refunded.  In right to work states such as Alabama , teachers can 
refuse to pay dues at all.  
<p>
As I understand it, all teachers in Alabama who are members of the 
Alabama Education Association (AEA) are also members of the NEA whose 
liberal social and political agenda is far outside that of mainstream 
America.  For instance, the 1996 NEA Resolutions support such things 
as statehood for the District of Columbia, abortion on demand, 
acceptance of homosexuality, comprehensive sex education, early 
childhood education from birth through age eight, nationalized health 
care, gun control, and multicultural education.  On the other hand, 
the NEA opposes standardized testing of students, minimum competency 
exams for teachers, random drug testing for teachers, and English 
being made our official language.  
<p>
If anyone doubts that the NEA's primary focus is their social and 
political agenda, they need only consider the 1991 Supreme Court case 
Lehnert v. Ferris in which the NEA could only prove that ten percent 
of dues money was spent on collective bargaining.  This means that 
Alabama teachers' membership dues are subsidizing the NEA's political 
and social activism with little input from rank and file.  Members may 
not realize that their NEA dues subsidize the NEA's political activity 
even if their dues money does not go directly to candidates.  
Consequently, taking NEA membership dues out of AEA dues may be the 
only way the NEA could get most  Alabama teachers to join.  
<p>
The NEA, AFT, the big labor unions, and the trial lawyers have a right 
to support any one or any policy they want to, but it is wrong to 
intimidate their members into financing politicians and agendas with 
which they do not agree.   
<p>
Maybe it is time for the teachers and the union members to  ask for 
their money back.

The Lights Went Out... Again

<p>
<HR Size=3 Width=30%>
<i>
<br> By Mark Genrich
<br> Deputy Editorial Page Editor
<br> The Phoenix Gazette
</i>
<p>
President Clinton's memo to Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary demanded an
explanation for the power outage on July 2.
<p>
He noted that the outage in the Western power grid disrupted electric service
to hundreds of thousands of customers in 15 Western states and had a "ripple
effect" as power stations across the vast grid automatically shut down as the
result of experiencing a surge.
<p>
The president said that the "outages caused numerous problems throughout the
region, including disruptions of train service, traffic problems, loss of
air-conditioning, interruption of telephone service and interference with
water supplies," and he directed Secretary O'Leary to provide him with a
report that analyzed the cause of the outage, described the extent and
duration of the outage and analyzed whether the outage could have been
prevented.
<p>
The president wanted to know whether the Western Systems Coordinating Council
(WSCC) electric reliability system responded as anticipated to the initial
outage.
<p>
The council was formed in 1967 by 40 electric-power systems in a region
encompassing nearly 1.8 million square miles. The WSCC is the largest of nine
regional councils of the North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC).
<p>
NERC formed in the aftermath of the Nov. 9, 1965, blackout that affected the
Northeast and Ontario, Canada with a mission "to promote the reliability of
the electricity supply for North America."
<p>
A not-for-profit corporation controlled by the nine regional councils, NERC
includes investor-owned, municipal/state/provincial, cooperative and federal
electric utilities in the United States, Canada, and a small part of Mexico,
plus all major independent power producers and electric-power marketers. 
<p>
Its basic mission is to keep the lights on, which is why President Clinton
reasonably inquired as to the adequacy of North American electric-reliability
systems and recommendations for any operational or regulatory changes.
<p>
"I have directed that these steps be taken to assure the reliability of the
nation's electricity infrastructure," said the president, adding, "A steady
supply of power is a vital factor in both the local and national economies
and is essential for the safety of all Americans. The swift implementation of
this directive will assure that these interests will be protected."
<p>
On Aug. 2, Secretary O'Leary answered the president, conceding that the July
2 incident was "preventable."
<p>
She went on to say that "in concert with industry, we are taking action to
strengthen the nation's electric reliability systems." 
<p>
Here is her official explanation for the July outage:
<p>
<blockquote>
"A transmission line sagged too close to a tree, creating a short circuit and
causing the line to disconnect automatically. A protective device on a
parallel line misinterpreted the short circuit and disconnected its line."
</blockquote>
<p>
Loss of the two lines triggered a procedure to shut down two generating units
at a nearby power plant served by the two lines because the generators'
output otherwise would overload remaining transmission lines.
<p>
Mrs. O'Leary explained to the president that bulk electric systems in the
West are designed and operated to be able to absorb the stresses of such a
combination of events without further cascading of the local outage.
<p>
But in the July incident "the initial event propagated a sequence of events
rippling across the entire Western power grid, interrupting service to over 2
million customers in 14 states. While the service was restored to customers
within periods ranging from a few minutes to over six hours, the scope and
speed of the outage were disturbing in their implications."
<p>
In a July 31 report to address the reliability of electricity supply and
delivery systems in North America, NERC said the system "as existing and
planned, will be adequate to meet customer electricity demands in the near
term and are capable of being operated reliably under a wide range of system
conditions. Unanticipated equipment problems and extreme weather in any
region can combine to strain the bulk electric systems even when projections
and assessments show these systems to be adequate."
<p>
There were two specific areas of reliability concern, including limited
operable generating capacity in New England and delays in the completion of
the proposed line between West Virginia and Virginia.
<p>
But, NERC said, "The transition to more competitive wholesale electricity
markets has significant implications to the continued reliable operation of
bulk electric systems in North America, which NERC is addressing. In the long
term, the adequacy of generating capacity and transmission systems is less
certain because the industry is moving to a more fully competitive
electricity supply market."
<p>
Meanwhile, the WSCC's report identified specific equipment failures and
operational deficiencies that contributed to the July outage, "which already
have been corrected. These corrective actions have substantially reduced the
possibility that a similar sequence of events could occur in the region."
<p>
Then the lights went out . . . again.
<p>
The August 10 incident struck homes and businesses from Oregon to Mexico.
<p>
"Actually, this may be a blessing because it's a wake-up call to say that
reliability is not a mere detail - it's critical," says Renz Jennings,
chairman of the Arizona Corporation Commission.
<p>
Commissioner Jennings is absolutely correct.
<p>
Reliability is critical, especially as the country prepares for competition
among providers of power. 
<p>
So, the question could reasonably be asked, despite all these reports and
assurances and pronouncements about reliability, why do the lights keep going
out?
<p>
Arizona is home to the largest nuclear power plant in the nation. Yet this
massive electrical generating station was knocked off line . . . by a tree .
. . in Oregon? 
<p>
What is wrong with this picture?
<p>
Regulators are correct to be concerned about the reliability of power, but
they cannot escape their own measure of responsibility for ensuring that
reliability.
<p>
If the grid in which a regulator's state participates is insufficient to
allow for disturbances in other parts of the region, that should be a clue
that something is amiss with regulatory oversight.
<p>
Did the nation's regulators sit by while utilities downsized and
re-engineered to a point beyond where customers could be assured dependable
service?
<p>
Was it a tree in Oregon that was responsible for the August outage or was it
rank utility greed? That is, were utilities pumping power along lines of the
Western grid, knowing full well that they were pushing the limits of its
capacity, for the sake of additional profits?
<p>
And, what responsibility does the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission bear?
It has stewardship over wholesale electric rates and service standards, as
well as the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce. Has it given
the green light to competition without first ensuring the integrity of the
transmission system?
<p>
A power outage - two power outages - of proportions great enough to capture
the concern of the president suggest U.S. utility regulators need to be far
more attentive to the infrastructures in their states and what future demand
will mean to an already overloaded system.
<p>
Oversight, after all, whether it is in Arizona or Washington, should be
focused on reliability of service for the people who pay the bills - the same
people who are wondering how long the lights will stay on this time.

<b>Stop The Browne-Out!</b>   
<br> by David F. Nolan
</i>
<p>
     Numerous polls have shown that a large majority of U.S. voters would like to see a credible third party as an alternative to the Republicans and Democrats. The choices offered by the Big Two often seem like a choice between spinach and broccoli, especially to anyone who sincerely desires a major reduction in the size, cost and intrusiveness of government at all levels.
     <p>The current presidential election is a case in point. Bob Dole has been aptly described as "the tax collector for the welfare state," and his new-found devotion to tax cuts seems forced and hollow.  Every poll shows Clinton beating Dole by 13 to 22 percentage points, with an equivalent edge in the Electoral College. Consequently, nobody seems very excited about the Clinton-Dole contest or a series of debates between the two men.
	 <p>Yet the supposedly "non-partisan" Commission on Presidential Debates seems determined to exclude all other candidates from any debates that may take place. They argue that once they start admitting third-party contenders, there's no place to draw the line. Janet Brown, Executive Director of  the Commission, recently stated that there are "150 candidates" for President, and that if anyone beyond Clinton and Dole were invited to participate, the result would be chaos.
	 <p>This contention, to put it politely, is a bunch of hooey.
<p>In fact, there are only four or five third-party presidential
candidates on enough states' ballots to win a mathematical majority of the Electoral College, and only two -- Ross Perot and Harry Browne -- who will be on all 50 ballots. Three others -- Howard Phillips, Ralph Nader and John Hagelin -- will be on the ballot in more than half the states. That's it.
	<p> Of these five, only Perot and Browne represent serious alternatives: Perot because of his money, and Browne because he's the standard bearer for the Libertarian Party, generally acknowledged to be America's only real third party. The Libertarians already have close to 200 elected office-holders, nearly 1,000 candidates, and 50-state ballot status. The non-partisan Congressional Quarterly has described the LP as "the most significant third party in decades".
	<p> And yet, the Commission on Presidential Debates seems determined to ignore Browne, even as they grudgingly discuss Perot's participation. Their reasons are purely political; the Dole campaign wants Browne kept out because they're afraid that he'll take votes away from Dole, and thus aid Clinton. Indeed, Dole operatives have floated the suggestion that lefty Ralph Nader ought to be considered for inclusion, in the hope that he will draw votes away from Clinton!
	<p>News Flash from the Future: Dole's gonna lose anyway, guys! Big-time. And in the long run, the cause of cutting back big government will be served far better by including Browne and bringing his message to the electorate than it will by reducing Dole's drubbing.
	<p> This point is not lost on many in the media. As of September 5th, some 23 newspapers have carried columns or editorials calling for Harry Browne's inclusion. Those writing in favor range from Joseph Sobran (conservative) to David Broder (liberal); the newspapers advocating Browne's participation include the Denver Post, Cleveland Plain Dealer and Orange County Register. The Register's editorial summed things up nicely, saying that Browne's inclusion would "blow some fresh air through the stale smog of statism that passes for political discourse between the major parties."
     <p>Additionally, some 177 talk radio hosts, including Michael Reagan, Gene Burns and Bob Grant have already spoken out in favor of Harry Browne's inclusion. Of these, one-third say they plan to vote for Browne themselves, while two-thirds simply feel that his inclusion would lend substance to the debates.
     <p>Ultimately, however, Harry Browne will be included in the debates only if there is massive public demand for his inclusion. You can help, if you are so inclined, by writing to 
the Commission on Presidential Debates at 601 Thirteenth Street, NW, Suite 310S, Washington, DC 20005 and urging them to include Harry. Or, you can e-mail them at <a href="mailto:debates96@usa.pipeline.com">debates96@usa.pipeline.com</a>. But time is of the essence; the decisions regarding the debates will be made by no later than September 15th. The time to act is now!

<H1>Lessons of the Affirmative Action Campaign</H1>
<H2>A Look at the Future From California</H2>
<p>
  <H3>By Larry P. Arnn</H3>

</center>

As usual, the eccentricities of California, both good and bad, open a window on the future of the whole nation.  We entered the election holding our breath, took a beating, and came out glad it wasn't worse. Conservative losses were more severe here than in most places, but on the other hand they were offset by a grand, potentially decisive victory. 
<p>
That victory is the heavily debated Proposition 209, the California Civil Rights Initiative. Prop. 209 passed 54% to 46%. It ran sixteen points ahead of Bob Dole, who broadcast about $2 million worth of advertisements in its favor in the last ten days. It ran 3 points ahead of Bill Clinton, who opposed it throughout the campaign, actively at the end when his own victory was certain. The opposition campaign spent about as much as all proponents together, excluding the amount the CCRI campaign spent gathering signatures, mostly in 1995. 
<p>
The initiative was therefore very strong. Read its operative language to the voters today in any state, and more than 60% of them will support it. A good campaign on its behalf by the Republican Party would have helped them substantially in California even in this bad year.
<p>
The battle was at the end as stormy as its subject matter foretold. The opposition finally got some support from the president both in fundraising and in public statements. They used the money to show advertisements featuring David Duke, side by side with Newt Gingrich, as the key supporter of 209. Of course a cross burned brightly against a deep night in the background. In another ad, a male hand stripped a uniform off a police woman while a voice said, "take it off, take it all off." David Duke had in fact been invited into the state to speak for 209 by--naturally--the opposition, personified in this case by Blenda Wilson, administrator at California state university Northridge, who paid Duke $4,000 to come.
<p> 
This ranting was neither unexpected nor effective. Alas, the Republican campaign in favor of 209 was also crude, and much less heart felt, than these opposition ravings. In this failure is found the clearest lesson for the future. That lesson is easy to understand, and with a little virtue of the kind that statesmen must possess, easy to implement. 
<p> 
The lesson is clear from the history. The California Civil Rights initiative was conceived in 1992-93 by Glynn Custred and Tom Wood, who were driven by a commitment of principle, which led them to a brilliant practical insight. Their work began to get national press attention in late 1993-94; by early 1995 it was a highly celebrated cause. Polls showed right away that the language of the initiative was popular. This was no surprise, as race and gender preferences have never been liked by ordinary people.
<p>
In early 1995, Wood and Custred began the hard job of making the initiative happen. They recruited help, among those who came along was Arnie Steinberg, myself, and eventually Ward Connerly, who would carry heavy burdens very far. Gradually an excellent team was assembled.
<p>
It should be noted that these people favored the initiative for its own sake. They did not think it their job to make it a partisan matter. They sought to place it first upon the March 1996 primary ballot, which would give maximum possibility for bi-partisan support. They sought to make a coalition with the Democratic Leadership Council in California. They knew, of course, that Democrats would mostly oppose the initiative. They knew that the Democratic Party is deeply invested in the preferences and quotas that Proposition 209 will eliminate wherever it reaches. Therefore the Republican opportunity would be there, if the Republican Party were able to seize it. 
<p>
By the second quarter of 1995, CCRI was a national issue. In July 1995 President Clinton made a major address endorsing affirmative action: "mend it, don't end it." The following week Senator Dole put his name on a bill written in the House by Florida Congressman Charles Canady and his committee staffer William McGrath. Dole had called Canady to ask to be co-sponsor of the bill. Canady, who hoped to put that bill on the desk of Bill Clinton within a year, could not refuse the Senate majority leader. Dole thereby stole a march on Phil Gramm. He had the advantage and the power to use it to produce legislation, at least in the Senate. He could make the bill move. Would he? 
<p>
He did not. In both the House and the Senate, the Dole-Canady Equal Opportunity Act was trapped in committee, and despite gallant efforts it never got out. Together with welfare and partial birth abortion (another Canady initiative), it could have formed the core of a national debate reaching to the fundamental differences between the parties. 
<p>
The Republicans in Congress needed this debate, even if they were not ready for it.  Our Constitution is not so arranged as to permit one branch of government to alter major policy by itself. The obvious conclusion is that Republicans, if they are in fact the party of change, must seek to control both houses of Congress and the presidency. The urgent work therefore is not partial solutions in Medicare. The urgent work is to demonstrate to the people where they differ in principle, upon central matters, from the president. If these differences are clear, then the people will be able to make an informed choice the next time they get to vote. This strategy was not followed generally, and it was not followed in particular upon civil rights.
<p>
Bill Clinton was ready. In his July 1995 speech he gave a ringing endorsement of "affirmative action," the useful term that means either outreach or preferences, depending upon the hearer and the speaker.  Consider these finely crafted phrases from the president:
<p>
<blockquote><I>Let me be clear about what affirmative action must not mean and what I won't allow it to be. It does not mean--and I don't favor--the unjustified preference of the unqualified over the qualified of any race or gender. It doesn't mean--and I don't favor--numerical quotas. It doesn't mean - and I don't favor -- rejection or selection of any employee or student solely on the basis of race or gender without regard to merit.</I></blockquote>
<p>
With these words the president sets his limits upon race and sex preferences in government action. The first sentence means that favoring the unqualified over the qualified on account of race and sex can be justified. The second sentence means "quotas" that are not "numerical" are fine. The third means that race and sex can be a factor, even the main or overwhelming factor, even when they have nothing to do with the matter at hand, so long as they are not the "only" factor. 
<p>
President Clinton was then passionate and strong--and utterly equivocal. The surest way to clear up the equivocation was to present him with a bill and force him to sign it or veto it. That opportunity was lost by the inaction of the Congress, led of course by Senator/candidate Bob Dole.
<p>
Back in California, the CCRI struggled to qualify. Speaker Gingrich, resisted by his staff, did good anyway by signing a fundraising letter on its behalf.  Finally the resources of all the key participants came together to get the initiative qualified.  Ward Connerly, generous Californians such as Darrel Issa, Dusty Rhodes from New York and others across the country, joined the campaign team and the Republican Party to make qualification and a vigorous campaign possible.
<p>
But the party and Dole treated the initiative in just the same way that they treated the Dole-Canady bill in Congress. They made sure it was there, as a place holder. But they made no commitment to argue for it. 
Candidate Dole endorsed CCRI in late March 96. Shortly thereafter he published an article in its favor in the <I>Los Angeles Times</I>. Then. . .nothing. The press began to notice that preferences had no place in Dole speeches. His California strategist, Ken Kachigian, stated at a press conference that the campaign might have little to do with the issue. On June 20, the <I>Times</I> wrote a front page story about Dole's moving away from it. This continued through the summer until past the convention, at which Connerly was not allowed to speak.  The accession of Kemp to the ticket brought his endorsement, but thereafter Dole was almost silent and Kemp was equivocal.
<p>
Throughout this long period, the Dole campaign had little money that it could spend legally on its own behalf. It tore its hair out trying to generate favorable media to offset the large advertising budgets of Clinton and his union friends. It failed, partly because the candidate had little to say. 
<p>
Dole might have spent the summer bringing up case after case of preferences.  He could have started with the wonderful case of Cheryl Hopwood in Texas, in which an appellate court ruled that the University of Texas had excluded her from law school admission because of her color. The Clinton Administration appealed the case, to attempt to get the Supreme Court to rule that race and gender preferences are lawful. Thus he took a plain and open position. Dole said nothing. 
<p>
The Hopwood case illustrates what is in fact happening in public bureaucracies all over America. In truth and in demonstrated fact, the government systematically categorizes and selects--and also necessarily excludes--on the basis of race and gender. It also hides what it does. When it is found out, its officials often lie. When they are confronted, they employ intimidation, then bribery, then finally compromise covered by the assertion that this particular case is an anomaly.  This is the behavior revealed in case after case arising when a stubborn and tough person sues against the system of official preference. This is the pattern of behavior that is proved by these cases to be common in government bodies in every part of the country. 
<p>
The pattern of action does not occur by any accident. Race preference today is a government practice built upon the idea that human beings are clay, molded by past experience into distorted shapes, needing some shaping up by government to put them right.  It is a despotic idea. It makes us objects to be acted upon. It destroys the idea of the citizen, inviolable in his rights, to be governed only by consent. It makes the officials of the government sovereign.
<p>
Dole might have spent some time, then, arguing in favor of his own position, which God bless him for having, but about which he was mute.  He might even have used his massive power to raise funds to help CCRI put up its own advertisements, which were made to argue the case on the highest ground. All of these steps would have won him news.  They would have shown voters he was serious about the issue.  They would have established an argument that he could pursue in the debates and during the heat of the campaign. 
<p>
Dole and the Republican Party squandered these months, which were rich with opportunity. The consequences were fatal. Having no strategy in Congress except to stall, no strategy in the public debate except to duck, they were driven at the end to film television spots with ten days to go. The work was ham fisted and had to be redone at least twice. The people of California had every right to think that this fundamental issue was being used out of desperation as a tool of low politics. 
<p>
We can draw a lesson from the election in California. In a bad year, when an able president of the left ran a splendid campaign to the right and got away with it, an issue of high principle was fought and won. This issue does not appear to the voters primarily as a question of money or interest. It raises in simple form the question what is government for, and what is the standing of the citizen before it. It has proved more useful than all the clever stunts and strategems, all the polls and focus groups that millions can purchase. 
<p>
 We should continue this debate. We should advance it in the Congress and in every state. We should not think of it or speak of it as a wedge issue, but rather as a matter of right and justice. We should build a great political movement upon this plain idea that we are equal before the law, that government is limited, and that the rights of all are to be protected by it equally. 
<p>
Finally, we should search until we find politicans who can speak up for it. The art of statesmanship is the application of principle to policy. Here is a chance to practice that art, difficult but decisively rewarding.

<p>
 August 11, 1996
<p>
Among the more interesting issues this campaign season is free airtime. 
Advocates argue that is the TV industry will just let presidential 
contenders have a few unpaid and unmolested minutes on the tube each 
night, the American political process will be mightily improved.
<p>
In the interest of full disclosure, I should note that I host a TCI news 
program that does give candidates free airtime on cable and public 
television channels around the country. In the interest of fuller disclosure, 
I should add that ardent free airtime proponents dont give a hoot. They 
want the free time to be on the big networks smack in the middle of prime 
time when Americans will have to watch - or face the dismal alternative: 
conversing with members of their family.
<p>
It now appears that the networks are going to comply, albeit reluctantly. 
One reason for their reluctance: The project will eat into time that is 
normally devoted to the nets most profitable sitcoms and dramas.
<p>
Heres a compromise. Have the candidates do guest appearances on the 
regular prime-time shows. As a public service, let me suggest a few script 
ideas:
<p>
<b>The Nanny</b>:
<p>
Clinton asks the Nanny to babysit Chelsea (who has come down with 
chicken pox) until the end of the presidential campaign. The president 
takes a keen interest in the new White Housekeeper. Look sweetie, she 
whines, Im no Annette Bening and you, tubby, aint exactly Michael 
Douglas! Soon after, the Nanny finds herself the target of an FBI 
investigation for misfeasance. Is that anything like Miss Flatbush? she 
wonders. In the climactic final moments of the show, Hillary Rodham 
Clinton tells a congressional subcommittee she does not recall any direct 
involvement in the Nannys dismissal. The irrepressible Nanny laughs 
her annoyingly nasal New York laugh.
<p>
<b>Murphy Brown</b>:
<p>
The famous newswoman invites Bob Dole to be interviewed on <i>FYI</i>. 
Come on, Senator, Murphy jabs inquisitorially, surely you dont 
expect us to believe youve become a supply-sider at this late stage in 
your career?
<p>
Dole goes ballistic: Listen, Murphy or Candy or whatever your name is, 
Ive been tested and tested and tested. You beat up on Danny Quayle 
back whenever that was and now you want to beat up on Bob Dole. Well, 
no siree. Ive had it with you and that namby-pamby liberal goo-goo girl 
Katie Whats-Her-Name, too! So stop lying about my record!
<p>
<b>Seinfeld</b>:
<p>
Kramer signs on as Ross Perots campaign manager, Im telling you, 
Jerry, he says, this guy is the greatest thing since frozen yogurt! Hes 
George Washington and Millard Filmore and Gerald Ford all rolled into 
one!
<p>
Yeah, Jerry replies, With a little <i>My Favorite Martian</i> thrown in.
<p>
Enter Perot who tells Jerry: Son, I need a crackerjack speech writer, one 
who can inject some humor, know what I mean? Humanize me, OK? Ill 
give you a million dollars, what do I care? And you can handle my 
foreign policy, too? Know anything about NAFTA?
<p>
Dont they sell auto parts?
<p>
Close enough, says Perot. Youre hired.
<p>
<b>E.R.</b>:
<p>
At a joint appearance with Ross Perot, Dick Lamm is knocked off the 
stage - Whoops! Sorry, says Perot - and has to be rushed to the 
emergency room. If Im a hopeless case, he tells the George Clooney 
character, dont waste expensive resources on me. Consider the next 
generation.
<p>
And here are a few more ideas I dont have sufficient space to flesh out:<br>
<b>Unsolved Mysteries</b>: Ross Perots daughters wedding.<br>
<b>Americas Funnies Home Videos</b>: Ross Perots daughters wedding.<br>
<b>The X-Files</b>: Aliens crash Ross Perots daughters wedding.<br>

<h3> Mephistopheles For President

<br>Editor and Publisher
<br> <a href="http://www.pacg.com/pvbr/">Wednesday On The Web</a>
</i>
<p>
<br><center><h4>Americans appear to be getting ready to sign a compact with Satan.</h4></center>
<p>On the <i>McLaughlin Group</i> the other night Fred Barnes described the voters' seeming 
willingness to overlook Slick Willie's sleazy character because they think he's good at 
providing bread and circuses &quot;a Faustian bargain.&quot; </p>
<p>Host McLaughlin explained for the less literate viewers in his audience that Barnes was 
referring to Dr. Faust's sale of his soul to Mephistopheles, who McLaughlin identified as 
the devil. </p>
<p>When you think about it, it's a hell of a good metaphor for what the voters are about to do 
next Tuesday (unless there's a mass outbreak of sanity and a sudden epidemic of virtue). </p>
<p>In return for America's soul, the Mephistophilean <font color="#FF0000">Clinton</font> promises the world. So who 
cares if he's got horns and cloven hooves? It's expansive government programs that 
count, and Bob Dole wants to get rid of all that federal largesse. Better to stick with the 
devil you know than the angel you don't know. </p>
<p>To mix literary illusions, Clinton is seen as the beneficent statesman who delivers 
sleighfulls of goodies to the ordinary people while Dole comes across as a Scrooge who'd 
take the crutches away from poor Tiny Tim, deny him needed medical care, and throw the 
whole Cratchet family out into the street to fend for themselves. </p>
<p>In selling their souls to the devil in return for his bribes, the voters are forgetting that they 
will someday be called upon to pay the devil his due, much as the German people who sold 
their souls to Adolf Hitler for autobahns and Volkswagens and a booming economy paid 
first with their freedom and then amid the ashes and rubble of crushing defeat in World 
War II. </p>
<p>They may think that life under a re-elected Clinton will be Heaven. They will learn in time 
that it was really Hell. </p>
<p>The pro-Clinton media openly admits, in their own words, that Slick Willie is no angel. But 
they won't take the next step, which is to identify him for what he <i>is</i> -- evil personified. </p>

Don't Even Mention It

<HR Size=3 Width=30%>
<p>

<i>by John-Peter Pham</i>
<p>
Americas political conventions take on the air of a religious tent 
meeting worthy of the Great Awakening. Speakers take to the podium to 
solemnly catechize the faithful and admonish the unbeliever about the 
"real issues" at stake. Yet voters have a history of turning on 
candidates who dare speak truly unpleasant truths. Like many a modern 
Milquetoast preacher, the major parties tend to agree to remain silent 
about certain hard issues.
<p>
The following is my list of ten such issues, five domestic and five 
foreign. While not all admit political solutions, they are questions 
of major national and international concern. They deserve a reasonable 
consideration in the public discourse.
<p>
<b>1. Divorce.</b> Both presidential candidates will pay homage to 
"family values"; Republicans denouncing abortion and Democrats 
skewering deadbeat dads. But what about divorce itself, the primary 
assault on the family? Tragically, over 600,000 families with minor 
children break up each year. The children of divorced parents are more 
likely to suffer from physical and emotional problems than children of 
married parents.
<p>
<b>2. Teen sex.</b> Both parties decry increased births to unwed 
mothers. However, no one will even raise the far more fundamental 
issue: teen pregnancies don't happen without teen sex. Nearly thirty 
years of progressive sex education in schools has done worse than 
nothing. Teen sexual activity has increased several-fold. Solutions 
require frank discussion.
<p>
<b>3. New Tactics in the war on Drugs.</b> Both parties call for 
better enforcement of drug laws and increased funding. But isn't it 
time to admit that there is more to the problem? Billions have already 
been spent, prisons are overflowing, yet more lethal drugs are 
available than ever before. Legalization may not be the solution, but 
it deserves to be at least calmly and rationally discussed.
<p>
<b>4. Fundamental legal reform.</b> What is wrong with a judicial 
system that awards millions to a woman who spills hot coffee on 
herself? A system that releases legions of guilty offenders because 
fleeing from the police does not constitute "suspicious behavior"? The 
trial lawyers have contributed millions in cash and in kind, meanwhile 
serious reforms of the judicial system is not being discussed.
<p>
<b>5. Government and individual responsibilities.</b> The national 
consensus is that there should be less government interference with 
the lives and businesses of citizens. But what about the necessary 
corollary of individual responsibility? Farmers plant on flood plains 
and expect government grants when flood waters rise. Smokers light up 
packs a day and then lobby for assistance when they come down with 
cancer. No national renewal is possible until there is a national 
consensus that we are responsible for our own actions.
<p>
<b>6. Nuclear and conventional arms proliferation.</b> Nuclear weapons 
(and know-how) are spreading after the breakup or the Soviet Union to 
a frightful coterie of pariah states, including the likes of Iran and 
Libya. Sophisticated conventional weapons are traded with the tacit 
encouragement of governments who think only of keeping weapons 
manufacturers in business. Pray it wont take a catastrophe to awaken 
us to this danger.
<p>
<b>7. China.</b> In 1992, Bill Clinton attacked President Bush for 
being "soft" on communist China. As president, however, he was no 
different from his predecessor. And Bob Dole? He has remained 
conspicuously silent. China is a potential multi-billion dollar market 
for U.S. products and cheap labor -- some of it, as Harry Wu 
demonstrated at great personal risk, is prison labor. China has the 
worst human rights record in the world. But politicians wont upset 
the apple cart of the multinational business lobby.
<p>
<b>8. Vietnam.</b> A year ago, the U.S. restored diplomatic relations 
with communist Vietnam amid much fanfare. The balance sheet? No trade 
agreement, no great new markets. Instead, the old dinosaurs were 
returned for another five-year term by the recent congress of the 
Vietnamese Communist party, which continues to repress any political 
dissent and to prosecute religious groups. Vietnam is still too 
emotional or an issue to be bantered about in any American electoral 
season.
<p>
<b>9. Foreign Aid.</b> Video clips of starving children and flooded 
villages tug at our heartstrings. However, compassion for victims must 
necessarily include a concern for their future. The public forum has 
yet to seriously engage the debate which is now at least a decade old 
among scholars: in the long run, does foreign aid help or hinder its 
beneficiaries?
<p>
<b>10. Realpolitik.</b> American policy makers tend to reflect the 
general public's desire for a kinder, gentler world. Potential 
international conflicts are ignored in a wish to have no enemies. 
Shouldn't there be a rational analysis of our strategic interests in 
NATO and Pacific Rim security, especially with their new and shifting 
alliances? In the long run, ignoring the march of history in favor of 
an idyllic pipe-dream may be the ultimate tragedy of this year of: 
"dont even mention it."

Too Important for Freedom

<p>
<HR Size=3 Width=30%>
<i>By Vin Suprynowicz<BR>
Assistant Editorial Page Editor<BR>
Las Vegas Review-Journal.</i>
<p>
<DD>    A.W. from Tennessee writes: "If we do not now provide for education at
the reading and writing level, a member of society could not function as a
contributing member. What is the proper structure for providing that
educational base, and the proper mechanism for funding? I submit that
government is a reasonable system for that kind of collective effort. I am
not opposed to the exploration of alternatives. ... It's just that
education is too critical to leave totally to individuals."
<blockquote>
<I> "Too critical to leave totally to individuals." To how many of their
endeavors have the collectivists now applied this velvet rationale for the
mailed fist?</I>
</blockquote>
<DD>  What's so odd about seeing it here, though, is that learning is a process
so (start ital)ill-(end ital)adapted to collectivism. How on earth can a society 
"collectively" educate a child? When you come
right down  to it, one student learns from one teacher. Surely most of us
have watched a child "get it" while sounding out her first strange printed
word, watching steam condense, or realizing the glass cracked because the
water expanded when it froze.
<DD>This learning process happens naturally, and nearly constantly. For
government to take credit for the fact that learning continues to transpire
under its supervision (though at a far slower rate than otherwise) is a
fraud only slightly less brazen than collecting a huge "oxygen tax" on the
threat that we'd soon be unable to breathe if the state didn't keep
manufacturing new oxygen, at secret factories which of course we're never
allowed to see for security reasons.
<DD>To assume that you could line up 100 kids on a parade ground, arranged by
height and age, and require that they all experience the revelation of
"getting" something at the same scheduled moment, is patently absurd. Yet
we keep trying.
<DD> Walk into the average 10th grade classroom today (not some specially
selected class for the gifted) and you'll see the result: While the young
scholars will likely guess than John Locke and Thomas Paine might by NFL
place-kickers, your main feedback will be a sneering, demonstrative
insolence, expressed in clothing, self-mutilation, posture and voice. Smug
mockery of the Dead White "Founding Fathers." A heartfelt avowal to never
crack another book "once I get out of this place."
<DD>To the extent that the transaction of "education" is effected by
shanghaiing the subject to a place he doesn't want to be (boys are far more
severely damaged than girls, as was first seen with captive Indians), and
then funding the enterprise with money looted from the unwilling, of course
the little prisoners will become progressively more resistant, progressing
from spitballs and pigtail-dipping to firearms and cocaine.
<DD>As more and more resources are diverted into security and discipline,
it's the wardens more than the inmates who will come to shudder at a
mention of the "old-fashioned academic core curriculum," since parents
could easily recognize how far behind the little charges were slipping if
they were allowed to directly compare today's progress against how far mom
had gone in the same book in 1973, or grandma in 1946.
<DD>So, the curriculum has to be tarted up and changed enough to become
unrecognizable every generation, throwing out the good with the bad until
eventually the trendy equivalents of bright, shiny object (AIDS, recycling,
turning in your parents for drug use) supplant any studies that could be
objectively measured.
<DD>Every experiment needs a "control." The "control" group here are
home-schoolers. If only a government ant farm bigger than the Manhattan
Project can educate children, why do home-schoolers taught by "amateur"
housewives consistently place two to three years ahead of the
government-kidnapped cohort by the seventh grade?
<DD>If only massive, tax-funded prison/factories can save "the next
generation" from crushing illiteracy, why did Alexis De Toqueville find
this the most literate, best-educated populace on earth, at a time when
there were no tax-funded government schools here, at all?
<DD>The assertion that we "dare not get rid of the Department of Education,
because education is so important," will someday sound as absurd as a
Russian ululating that "We dare not get rid of the Ministry of Vegetables,
because food production is too critical to leave totally to individuals."
<DD>There is (I sincerely hope) no longer any Ministry of Vegetables. No
central government authority (at least, none that can enforce its absurd
pronouncements) any longer checks to make sure the "right quantity" of
cantaloupe are planted each year across the vast Russian steppe.

<h3>Let's Think About It
</h3>
</center>
<p>
<HR Size=3 Width=30%>
<p>

<i>by Lari McDonald</i>
<p>


Let's think about how some of the major social problems our state and 
nation faces have come about. I'm a conservative, activist citizen. 
I'm a Christian. I'm a registered Republican. Foundationally 
conservative citizens are usually Republicans. I believe we need to 
conserve the strong nation and society into which my generation was 
born and raised. I'm not an Ozzie and Harriet fan, but families were 
stable then. Education in public schools produced literate graduates 
prepared for productive lives in the workplace. And, they could read, 
write and cipher' Children weren't encouraged to be sexually active; 
few were parents in their early teens. A student would not kill a fellow 
student to get a fancy jacket or a pair of sneakers. Folks did not 
assume that neighbors should be forced through taxes to pay for 
government programs providing their "free" food, clothing, shelter 
and health care.
<p>
Liberal academic elitists and elected officials have conditioned you 
and me, our families, our schools, our communities, our nation to 
accept these kinds of social problems as a norm of some sort, with 
more taxes and programs to cure the ills. Conservatives say "no way"; 
these are all symptoms of a very sick society and the illness must be 
faced and treated. Liberal academic elitists and elected officials are 
selling America's future to the United Nations' world government where 
our lives would be supervised by agencies and laws totally apart from 
the American Constitution and its protection of our freedoms. Bit by 
bit, liberals have phased out the strengths and integrity of the 
United States with their do-good programs and massive taxes against 
our pocketbooks to pay for it all.
<p>
Who are these liberals? To be sure, there have always been liberals in 
the Republican party establishments on the state and national levels. 
Mostly, however, the ideas and laws out of which our social and 
political chaos have grown since the 1930s, with a real jump start in 
the 60s Great Society, were passed by Congresses and state 
legislatures, and county commissions, controlled by liberal Democrats.
<p>
It's fascinating that in just the past few years roughly 250 elected 
Democrats across the nation have changed to the Republican party 
because the ideas and practices of the Democratic party have deserted 
virtually all of the principles in which they believe and on which our 
American nation is founded. So, if you feel that you should have more 
take home pay and lower taxes, that families must be encouraged and 
strengthened for the most adequate raising of children, that public 
education must be systematically changed for improvement and freed up 
from unionized control, that parents killing their unborn children is 
wrong, <b>YOU ARE A CONSERVATIVE</b>.
<p>
If you're a conservative and registered as a Democrat, understand that 
there is no place in the Democratic party's thinking for you, your 
ideas and your value system.
<p>
Aha, you say, but your grandfather would turn over in his grave if you 
switched parties and registered as a Republican. Perhaps. But, he 
would have turned over years ago if he knew how close to destruction 
the American system has been brought by liberal Democratic control of 
legislative bodies for far too long.
<p>
Historically the Republican Party was founded in 1854 with the primary 
purpose of eliminating slavery from the United States. The number of 
hard working, taxpaying, upward mobile African American citizens who 
have changed party because of disagreement with liberal Democratic 
positions on critical issues affecting their lives and freedom, is 
exciting, very encouraging, and critical to the restoration of the 
stabilizing effect of conservative values to this state and nation.
<p>
Thank you.

<H3>Dear Mr. Dole:</H3>
Don't Wait, Introduce Your Tax Cut Now!
</center>
<p>
<HR Size=3 Width=30%>
<P>
<I>Richard Lessner<BR>
The Union Leader<BR></I>
<P>
<BR>
<DD>That 15 percent across-the-board tax cut you and Jack Kemp are booming across the country just isn't cutting it with the voters.
<P>
Most Americans believe they're overtaxed.  And in the last six years a half-dozen states under the leadership of Republican governors have aggressively reduced taxes with results typically described as "spectacular" and "miraculous." 
<P>
So why hasn't your tax cut caught fire with the voters? Because a majority, doubtless recalling Bill Clinton's broken promise of a middle-class tax cut, believe your proposal is "just a political ploy."
<P>
Unless you can overcome this voter skepticism, the centerpiece of your campaign, the chief wedge issue between yourself and Bill Clinton will continue to fizzle. Standing up and telling the voters, "Look, people, Bob Dole really, really means it!" won't get the job done.
<P>
So, how do you get the voters to believe your tax cut is real? Easy. Have Newt and Trent introduce it in Congress -- right now!
<P>
This would have two good effects: First, it would take your tax cut out of the realm of insubstantial campaign promise and make it concrete. Second, it would drive the Democrats and Bill Clinton straight up the wall and make it the key issue in the campaign. Introducing the cut now would give it instant credibility.
<P>
Clearly, your campaign needs to do something dramatic -- and do it soon -- to begin closing the gap. So far, the initiative has been all the President's, as almost daily he unveils another federal goody. As Fred Barnes put it the other day, Mr. Dole, it's time to panic!
<P>
Doubtless you're getting plenty of unsolicited advice these days, and there's little reason to believe you'll pay much attention to ours. But so far all the wisdom of your high-priced Washington consultants hasn't amounted to a hill of beans. Unless you can figure a way to turn this around and put Mr. Clinton on the defensive, you're going to lose and lose badly.
<P>
Well, that's how we see it.
<P>

<h3>
The 'Peach Juice Shot': A New Media Low
</h3>
</center>
<p>
<HR Size=3 Width=30%>
<p>

<i>by C.H. (Max) Freedman</i>
<p>
Longtime readers know there's no more vociferous opponent than I of 
frivolous lawsuits and runaway awards. Were I in charge, most such 
litigants and their lawyers would get zilch if they were lucky, jail 
if they weren't.
<p>
But there's one supposed "nuisance" lawsuit where the defendants, 
David Letterman and company, are just fortunate I won't be on the 
jury. Because I would award the plaintiff, Jane Bronstein, no less 
than $10 million in actual damages -- and enough in punitive damages 
to retire a healthy chunk of the national debt.
<p>
Miss Bronstein, an ordinary spectator at the last U.S. Open tennis 
tournament, was innocently eating a peach when a CBS camera happened 
to pan her way. The fruit apparently was a juicy specimen and some of 
the moisture dribbled down her chin before she could dab it away.
<p>
It was at that luckless instant the CBS camera caught her.
<p>
That humiliating footage was gleefully pounced on by David Letterman's 
producers and shown repeatedly on the Letterman show, presumably as a 
symbol of American uncouthness.
<p>
To raise the derision level still higher, Letterman put Miss 
Bronstein's picture on a huge Times Square billboard and referred to 
her in his "Top Ten" feature as a "seductive temptress."
<p>
Miss Bronstein is middle-aged and overweight. According to her lawyer, 
Harvey J. Rothberg, she suffered polio in childhood, went through two 
spinal fusions and has a thyroid condition. Quite enough troubles for 
one individual without some unfeeling louts turning her into a 
national laughing stock.
<p>
But her overweight condition doubtless made her especially attractive 
to those anything-for-a-laugh vultures. Fat lady with peach juice 
slobbering down her chin, and all that.
<p>
I've never talked with Miss Bronstein but, as the original self-
proclaimed bleeding-heart conservative, I might well be even more 
anguished and outraged than she herself over such heartlessness.
<p>
Indeed, my initial fantasy had me avenging this gross violation of 
human dignity by punching Letterman's face into an unrecognizable 
pulp, then having it photographed and shown on national TV -- with an 
equally derisive theme. Maybe something like "Top Ten Happy Faces."
<p>
If suffering were measurable, we might well discover that what the 
Letterman people put Miss Bronstein through far exceeds the suffering 
we allow to be imposed on drug pushers and child molesters.
<p>
One cringes at the thought of this unfortunate woman having to 
encounter numberless strangers on the street and subway who look at 
her and perhaps snicker. Or, even worse, the constant torment of 
wondering if that staring stranger might be snickering inside.
<p>
And those whose moral antennae aren't particularly attuned to the 
distress she's been put through would do well to consider this: It 
could happen to them, too.
<p>
Every one of us, at some time, comes into an ordinary public-place 
situation where an unseen high-tech camera could snare us in a 
potentially mortifying lapse in propriety: an unbuttoned or unzipped 
article of clothing, a hairpiece or bridgework unexpectedly coming 
loose a nose that suddenly runs before we can grab a tissue, etc., 
etc.
<p>
The reader is asked, then: How would you feel if millions of TV 
watchers were made to point and guffaw over that image of you frozen 
at the precise instant of maximum humiliation?
<p>
A South Carolina caller to the "Barry Farber Show" (where we were 
discussing the case) said he'd seen that juice-dripping shot on 
Letterman. He described Miss Bronstein's image as "gruesome"-looking.
<p>
Certainly, there's a First Amendment right to photograph anyone in 
public -- just the way they appear. If that tennis-tournament camera 
had panned across the crowd and Miss Bronstein and her dripping juice 
happened to be part of the shot, so be it. No one can expect to be 
protected from such routine coverage, however unflattering.
<p>
But there's a galaxy of difference between such legitimate incidental 
coverage and intentionally singling someone out just because they look 
fleetingly ridiculous.
<p>
One needn't be a constitutional scholar to reason that if the right to 
privacy means anything at all, it means the right of ordinary citizens 
to be free of the dread of unseen high-tech cameras forever locking 
them into their most awkward instant with the express intent of 
mocking and degrading them in front of the masses.
<p>
Twenty-three years ago, our Supreme Court in one of its most disputed 
decisions ever, decreed that "the right to privacy" extended to the 
right of women to kill their unborn babies.
<p>
That was indeed a remarkable stretch of language and jurisprudence, 
one that this constitutional strict-constructionist deplores.
<p>
But given that our judicial system has indeed stretched privacy rights 
so very far, it would be the height of injustice to deny people like 
Miss Bronstein redress for a privacy invasion incomparably more 
obvious than any involved in abortion cases.
<p>
Defense counsel, in justifying the cruel, shameful exploitation of 
this woman, will doubtless invoke that ancient catch-all, "The 
public's right to know!"
<p>
And if they are allowed to get away with such judicial and verbal 
flim-flammery, then we as a society are no better than those Letterman 
lowlifes who, quite obviously, rationalize that their own career 
ambitions override all humane considerations.

<P>
Since 1981, the Vietnam Veterans Institute has been offering
panels, workshops, and publications on issues related to the
Vietnam legacy and the legacy of all veterans.  The <U>American
Veterans Journal</U> has been issued each year for the last five
years and brings together papers from the annual conference plus
important information from other sources.  
<P>
The journal has published critiques of the CBS documentary
which attacked Gen. Westmoreland (and was the basis of "the
Westmoreland trial"); analyses of such important works as Neil
Sheehan's <U>A Bright Shining Lie</U>; surveys of veterans' employment
issues; and over twenty essays on the McNamara book entitled <U>In
Retrospect</U>.  In these efforts, we have attempted to create a
paper trail of importance to future generations needing
perspective on the Vietnam legacy.
<P>
Board members for VVI include General Westmoreland, Admiral
U.S. Grant Sharp, Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, Dr. William Detweiler
(former Commander of the American Legion), Col. Harry Summers,
Jr, M. Gen. George S. Patton, Jr.  Our scholars and professional
writers are also veterans -- many of them decorated combat
veterans -- who are concerned that the record uphold the honor and
patriotism of those who served when their country called.
<P>
VVI is happy to work with schools, conferences, and other
institutions to supply speakers and panels for public symposia.
This program represents the kind of scholarly work we do and we
hope that you will take an interest.
<P>
Please contact Rudi Gresham or Dr. Peter Rollins at the
addresses indicated elsewhere on this flyer.

<title>The Hearthstone Press: Two Fair Tax Changes</title>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<blockquote><blockquote>

<center>
<h3>
Two Fair Tax Changes
</h3>
</center>
<p>
<HR Size=3 Width=30%>
<p>

Bob Dole has consulted his economic gurus on his policy strategy for 
the presidential election, and by the time this editorial appears in 
print, he may have signed onto a slate of tax cuts, including a 
capital gains tax cut and making social security taxes deductible.  
Both of these changes steer toward making income taxes fairer, and 
that is the source of their political appeal.
<p>
Capital gains taxes are especially unfair because those gains are 
often a result of inflation, inflicted on us by the same federal 
government that has the audacity to tax those gains.  At the very 
least, capital gains taxes should be indexed, using the consumer price 
index as a surrogate for the inflation rate just as it is used in 
government COLA's or in the government's own budget baseline.  If 
cost-of-living adjustments are fair on the spending side of 
government, then similar adjustments are due the owners of assets that 
appreciate because the government spends more than it takes in. 
<p>
Capital gains taxes can also be especially unfair under a graduated 
income tax when they treat the gains one accumulates over a long 
period of time as if it were income produced in one year.  Consider 
this: if you sell your small business, the gain you reap might push 
you up into the dreaded rich-man's tax bracket, even though you may 
have spent most of your working years living modestly so your business 
could grow.  While advocates of high tax rates for "the rich" might 
claim that the Clinton tax increases of 1993 affected only upper-
income taxpayers, one has to remember that income tax laws now do not 
differentiate between capital gains and regular income, so there is a 
special, bitter surprise for anyone who tries to cash in on his life's 
work. 
<p>
Allowing social security taxes to be deductible is also fair.  First 
of all, employers get to deduct their half of the tax (remember, the 
real rate you pay for Social Security and Medicare is double the 
amount indicated on your paycheck!); why shouldn't individuals get the 
same opportunity?  Also, income taxes should only tax people on their 
NET income, and FICA taxes always come straight off the top, no 
questions asked.  Just as state and local taxes are deductible, so 
should FICA taxes be deductible.  What is the argument for not making 
them so, except to say that the government wants your money and not 
letting you deduct FICA taxes is just a way of the government getting 
more of it.  
<p>
As for how Bob Dole might "pay for" these tax changes, he should 
assert from the start that high capital gains rates make many people 
find ways to avoid paying them.  Lower rates would flush out capital 
that is currently tied up in "mature" investments and let that capital 
flow to new enterprises, where most of our economic growth comes from.  
Letting working Americans keep more of what they earn not only fuels 
economic growth but it also makes them less dependent on government 
handouts.  Bob Dole should know that it is Congess's lack of 
discipline on spending that causes deficits, not their failure to suck 
more blood from the neck of the economy. Dole should embrace these two 
tax changes for the good of his party and for the good of his 
campaign.

<br>Monday, November 4, 1996 editorials
<br>by Lee Anderson, Editor and Publisher, <a href="http://www.chatfreepress.com">Chattanooga Free Press</a>
</i>
<p>
     Four years, or maybe eight. That's how long the next president of the United States will stay in office.
<p>
Terms are limited. Presidential power is limited.
<p>
Not so with justices of the United States Supreme Court.
<p>
Those nine ladies and gentlemen are appointed to their posts by presidents. They are confirmed by the Senate. Then they have
terms of "life,' on good behavior. And while a "life' term rarely means that for a murderer, it may really mean "life' for a
Supreme Court justice, unless he or she chooses to leave.
<p>
And power? The power of a president after four or eight years may be little more than that of an over-the-hill movie, TV or
sports star--if that much.
<p>
But the power of a justice of the Supreme Court is tremendous. And it will go on for many more years than his or her lifetime.
It may go on "forever' as a legal precedent.
<p>
Laws passed by Congress are often amended or repealed. But it's rare that a major ruling by the Supreme Court is reversed.
The court doesn't lightly make major change. And it takes two-thirds of the members of both houses of Congress and
ratification by three-fourths of the states to amend the Constitution legally to undo a judicial "amendment' of the Constitution
that five justices have decreed unconstitutionally.
<p>
Whoever is elected president on Tuesday may have the responsibility to name two, three or maybe even four Supreme Court
justices in the next four years!
<p>
Do you think you would like to have our country live virtually forever under the kind of rulings that appointees of Bill Clinton
would make?
<p>
If the Supreme Court and its justices operated as they should --as dispassionate referees of the law as it is written _ it wouldn't
matter who named the members of the court. All we would want would be intelligence, knowledge of the law and willingness
to work fairly. But that's not the way the high court does business.
<p>
The current Supreme Court is divided among three general segments, with occasional "migration' of some justices one way or
the other. One segment is conservative, tending to stick to the Constitution and law, ruling in protection of individual rights.
Another is liberal, tending to write what it "wishes' the law said to effect social change, increasing government intervention,
promoting "group' rights rather than individual freedom. The third group swings one way or the other, depending upon the case
and circumstances.
<p>
If Mr. Clinton is elected Tuesday, he is not going to appoint justices he knows will swing the court to the conservative side on
the Constitution and individualism.
<p>
If Sen. Dole is elected Tuesday, he is not knowingly going to name justices who will "make up their own law.'
<p>
In four years if Mr. Clinton wins or in four or eight years if Sen. Dole wins, both of them will be out of government. But two,
three or four Supreme Court justices--or even more--that one of them has appointed will still be there. And their rulings will
live long after them.
<p>
Think about that. We are electing more than a president on Tuesday.
<p>
We are indirectly "electing' some powerful Supreme Court justices.

Politicians Are Experts At Playing The Kiddie Card

<p>
<HR Size=3 Width=30%>
<i>by Michelle Malkin
<br>Seattle Times
<br>August 27, 1996
</i>
<p>
Did you happen to catch the GOP's brazen exploitation of children as 
political stage props earlier this month? The indignant twittering of 
liberal pundits on this subject crescendoed when Republican National 
Convention keynote speaker Susan Molinari cuddled her 3-month-old baby 
on prime-time television. Shameless! Crass! Maudlin! Deceptive!
<p>
Ah, my dear liberals, I feel your disdain. I felt it four years ago 
when Al Gore Jr. paraded his family's private grief onstage at the 
Democratic National Convention in New York. Remember? Vice President 
Gore shamelessly spun a personal tragedy into political spectacle 
before a TV audience of millions. In 1989, the script went, Gore's 
then-9-year-old son was struck by a car and recovered only after 
painful therapy.
<p>
Young Al Gore III's eyes, recounted his father, "were open with the 
empty stare of death, and we prayed, the two of us, there in the 
gutter, with only my voice." A sniffle here, a sigh there, a 
choreographed nod to little Al for the cameras - and then back to the 
words on the TelePrompter. "Our democracy is lying there in the 
gutter," Daddy Gore analogized, "waiting for us to give it a second 
breath of life."
<p>
Gag me with a pacifier.
<p>
Two years ago this month, I felt that feeling again as I watched a 
fragile little girl named Jennifer Bush pleading for the Clinton 
health-care reform plan on Capitol Hill. Jennifer allegedly suffered 
from chronic digestive problems. Her medical bills totaled more than $ 
2 million and exhausted the family's health-insurance benefits; only 
Clintoncare could save them. Soon, the sick youngster was posing with 
first lady Hillary Clinton, lobbying with the Children's Defense Fund, 
and smiling for promotional posters touting Clintoncare.
<p>
It was a moving letter from Jennifer's devoted mother that caught the 
White House's attention. "Do you know what it is like to choose 
between purchasing groceries for the week to feed your family or 
buying needed medications for your chronically ill child?" Kathleen 
Bush wrote.
<p>
Well, apparently, Mrs. Bush didn't. Florida officials arrested the 
caring mom this spring and charged her with aggravated child abuse and 
fraud in connection with obtaining more than $ 50,000 in medical care 
or charitable donations.
<p>
Independent pediatric specialists conducted extensive tests on 
Jennifer and found no evidence of digestive disorders. Prosecutors 
charged Mommy with deliberately making her child sick to gain 
attention. They also discovered that while the Bush family publicly 
appealed for donations and government aid to pay for Jennifer's 
hospital debts, they were racking up huge credit card bills - for 
trips to the Bahamas and Disney World, kitchen and pool remodeling, 
and a new Harley-Davidson motorcycle.
<p>
Politicians have been kissing babies since time immemorial, but the 
crass infantilization of public policy is new, sickening and scary. 
There is now an almost insurmountable temptation to advocate policy 
initiatives that restrict adult liberties by playing the kiddie card. 
And why not? Whether they advocate a crackdown on television violence, 
censoring of the Internet, health-care reform, or expansion of 
government's role in any other area, activists can effectively 
neutralize serious debate by claiming to speak for The Children.
<p>
Perhaps the mother of all kiddie ploys came last week, when President 
Clinton announced sweeping Food and Drug Administration regulations of 
tobacco for the sake of - who else? - The Children. A multiculturally 
correct brood of youngsters, who each donned a Crayola red T-shirt 
proclaiming the wearer to be a TOBACCO-FREE KID, formed a necklace 
around the First Father in the Rose Garden.  Federal public health 
officials insist that the new rules, which give the FDA unprecedented 
authority to regulate cigarettes and smokeless tobacco (but not cigars 
or pipe tobacco) as drug-delivery devices, won't infringe on adult 
civil liberties. But grown-ups who aren't drooling mindlessly over 
this massive regulatory scheme know better.
<p>
If the feds can argue that cigarettes are regulable drug-delivery 
devices, why not caffeinated beverages? Like tobacco products, soda 
pop contain an addictive ingredient marketed aggressively to young 
children for its pharmacological effects ("Do the Dew," "Just for the 
taste of it - Diet Coke," "Mug Root Beer - the foam goes straight to 
your brain").  Or how about chocolate, which neuroscientists in San 
Diego have discovered contains marijuana-like qualities?
<p>
And why not crack down on fatty-snack advertising, too? According to 
Yale diet specialist Kelly Brownell, the average child sees 10,000 
food commercials per year using sports heroes and cartoon characters 
to peddle addictive - and life-threatening - soft drinks, candy and 
sugar-coated cereals.  Anti-smoking activists answer that the teen 
smoking epidemic is uniquely devastating. It is a problem, no 
question, but not an epidemic.
<p>
The most oft-cited data on youth smoking, from the University of 
Michigan's Monitoring the Future project, do show a small increase in 
pre-teen smoking over the past four years. But overall daily smoking 
among 12th-graders has been steadily declining over the past two 
decades. Heavy smoking (a half-pack a day or more) by these high-
school seniors plunged from 17.9 percent in 1975 to 11.2 percent in 
1984, remaining flat for the past decade.
<p>
But never mind all that. There are butts to kick, kids to save, and 
elections to win. The infantilization of America presses forward. 
Shameless, isn't it?

Current:		Dole tax brackets:
     39.6%                   33.67%
     36.0%                   30.60%

<UL>
<LI>$500 per child tax credit.  This tax credit allows parents
to subtract $500 off their tax bill for each child under 18 years
of age.  
<LI>Cut capital gains tax rate from 28% to 14%.  In 1992, 56%
of capital gains were from households with incomes of $50,000
or less.  Households with less than $100,000 income accounted
for 83% of the returns reporting capital gains.
<LI>Repeal the 1993 tax hike on Social Security benefits.  Due
to the 1993 Clinton tax increase on Social Security, 85% of Social
Security benefits became subject to federal taxation.  Retiree
incomes as low as $34,000 saw their taxes on Social Security benefits
rise.
<LI>American Dream Savings Accounts.  These accounts would expand
IRA's.  They would allow after-tax contributions and earn interest tax-free.
 They would also allow penalty-free withdrawals to help finance a first home, pay for
college expenses, or defray medical costs.  
<LI>IRA's for spouses who choose to stay at home.  A $2,000 per
year contribution can be 
put into an IRA on behalf of a spouse who works at home.
<LI>Education Investment Accounts.  These accounts allow up to
$500 per child per year to be put into tax-free account.  Parents who placed $500 per
year into the account would accrue $18,689 tax-free after 18 years.

<UL>
<LI>America is experiencing the slowest expansion in 100 years.
 The Clinton expansion is averaging 2.4% growth - not exactly
the best economy in the last 30 years.  The last five expansions
produced average growth rates of 4.4%.  The Reagan expansion during
the 1980's averaged over 5% growth.
<LI>Tax Freedom Day is now the latest ever.  The day Americans
work until to pay their share of federal taxes is now May 7, the
latest it's ever been.
<LI>Cost of Government day now July 3.  In 1996 Americans worked
until July 3 to earn enough money to pay off all direct and
hidden taxes (total federal, state, local government spending
plus the cost of regulation).
<LI>Real Median Household Income lower during Clinton than the
previous decade.  From 1983 to 1992, real median household income
was $33,119.  Under Clinton, it shrunk to $32,153.
<LI>Federal, State, and Local taxes account for 38% of a family's
budget (more than food, clothing, and health care combined). 
Today 26% of a family's budget goes to federal taxes, 12% to state
and local taxes, while 9% goes to food, 4% is spent on clothing,
and 10% goes for medical care.
<LI>Worker's real hourly wages have gone down under Clinton.  Bill
Clinton, the alleged protector of the working man, has presided
over a .4% drop in real hourly wages.  Wages went up 5.6% during
the decade before Clinton.  <BR>

<CENTER><B>How to Balance the Budget with the Dole Tax Cut</B></CENTER>
<P>
The economic plan of Republican Presidential nominee Robert
Dole promises to enact a major tax reduction plan and to balance
the Federal budget by 2002.  Some have argued that the lost revenue
from the tax cut plan would make balancing the budget by 2002
impossible.  The following facts show that this is untrue.
<UL>
<LI>Even counting the reduced tax revenues from the Dole tax cut
plan, the budget can be  balanced by 2002 by holding the growth
in government spending to 2.1% per year.  This is only slightly
less than the rate of increase in Federal spending since 1992,
which has been 2.4%.
<LI>Between now and 2002, the Federal government would spend $10.8
trillion overall under current law.  Counting the reduced revenue
from the Dole tax cut plan, the Federal budget can be balanced
by 2002 while still spending $10.2 trillion between now and then.
<LI>Counting the reduced revenue from the Dole tax cut plan, the
budget can be balanced by 2002 if the government spends just 4%
less than it now plans to spend between now and then.
<LI>Counting the reduced revenue from the Dole tax cut plan, the
budget can be balanced by 2002 while increasing annual Federal
spending by 14% by that year compared to this year.  Under current
law, annual Federal spending will be 20% larger by 2002 compared
to today.

	Cost of Government Day is the date of the calendar year, counting from January  1, that Americans have earned enough money to pay off the  total financial burden of government, including all state and federal spending and  regulatory costs.<P>
	The money we send to the government on April 15th is only the visible tip of a much larger iceberg.  Politicians have learned to circumvent the watchful eye of anti-tax voters by enacting hidden taxes--regulationsand government mandates.  Costly government programs, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act and family leave legislation, do not show up in the federal or state budgets.  But they do cost money.<P>
 	This year, every American taxpayer will work until July 3rd--more than half way through the  year--to pay off his or  her share of government imposed financial costs. The total cost of government in 1996 is estimated at
 $3.38 trillion. That's $13,000 for every man, woman and child in 
America. Of this total, nearly $1 trillion results from federal and
state regulation. The federal government is responsible for more than
 $739 million in hidden regulatory taxes this year alone. That's more
 than $2,800 for every man, woman and child in America.<P>

*Leap Year makes TFD, SFD, and COGD appear one day earlier
<UL>
<LI>1  Based on Tax Foundation figures
<LI>2  SFD measures the cost of total government outlays (taxes plus borrowing)
<LI>3  COGD incorporates total (federal, state, and local) government expenditures, federal regulatory costs, and state workers' compensation and tort law costs.  COGD data is based on information compiled by Americans for Tax Reform Foundation from data in the President's January 1996 budget baseline; Thomas D. Hopkins, "Costs of Regulation:  Filling the Gaps" (report prepared for the Regulatory Information Service Center, Washington, D.C.), August 1992; "Tort Cost Trends; An International Perspective" (report prepared by the Tillinghast Company), 1992; and independent data provided by the Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis.</UL><P>






<FONT SIZE=+1><BOLD><a name="DEFINITION">Introduction to Cost of Government Day
</a></BOLD></FONT><P>
<BOLD>Definition</BOLD><BR>
Cost of Government Day is the day of the calendar year, counting form January 1, on which the average American worker has earned enough in gross income to pay off his or her federal, state, and local government-imposed financial obligations--total spending plus the cost of regulation.<P>

<BOLD>Methodology</BOLD><BR>
The cost of government is determined by adding the figures for government spending (all federal, state, and local outlays) and an estimate of the cost of government regulations.  A 1992 report prepared for the Regulatory Information Service Center by Rochester Institute of Technology Professor Thomas D. Hopkins provided the framework for determining the cost of regulations.  His figures were updated to include the cost of new regulations from information provided by economist Dr. Robert Genetski and estimates by Cost of Government Day director Alan Philp.  State workers' compensation and tort costs were included in the COGD figure as well, from information provided in a report produced by the Tillinghast Company.

<BOLD>What COGD Does/Does Not Include:</BOLD><BR>
<UL>
<LI>  All federal, state, and local outlays (taxes plus borrowing) are included in COGD.
<LI>  Most federal regulations are incorporated.  Exceptions include costs associated with minimum wage laws and anti-trust laws.
<LI> At the state level, only workers' compensation and tort costs  are incorporated.  Costs associated with state and local environmental protection, worker safety, and consumer protection are not included.  These costs, which are not included because the measurements cannot readily be quantified and broken out, can be substantial.
<LI> Indirect costs of regulation--resources diverted from other activities (e.g., decreased time with families, less leisure time) -- are not included.  Compliance costs, paperwork costs, and transfer costs are included.</UL></p>




<BOLD>Overview of the Cost of Government</BOLD><BR>
 
<P>
 <UL>
<LI> Cost of Government Day has moved forward for three straight years due to (1)sharp cuts in defense spending, (2)the defeat of Bill Clinton's government take-over of the health care system, and (3)a lessening in the number of major new regulations.  Had the Clinton health care plan passed, Cost of Government Day would have moved back approximately 30 days.  Americans would be working for the government an additional month.
<LI>  Because the 1996 House Republican budget became law, at least in 
part , Cost of Government Day came earlier than in 1995.  By 2000, Cost of Government Day will arrive at least 11 days earlier than scheduled under the Clinton plan.
<LI>  By 2002, the GOP budget will make Cost of Government Day arrive at least 17 days earlier than scheduled under the Clinton plan.  (This figure does not include additional savings from proposed Republican regulatory and legal reforms.)
<LI>  Republican legal reforms, if passed, will help rein in soaring civil justice costs, which now consume $300 billion per year, according to Citizens for a Sound Economy.<P></ul>





<A NAME="Facts About Regulation"><bold><font size=+1>Facts About Regulation</font><br>
Quantifying the Costs<bold><p>

<bold>Regulation Costs Jobs.</bold>  Economists Michael Hazilla and Raymond J. Kopp concluded that environmental regulations alone had by 1990 reduced the overall employment level by 1.18 percent.  According to economist Bill Laffer, that translates into 1.1 million to 1.4 million fewer jobs.  Laffer estimates the cost of all federal regulations numbers between 3.6 million and 9.6 million jobs.<br>
<ADDRESS>Sources:  Michael Hazilla and Raymond J. Kopp, "Social Cost of Environmental Quality Regulations:  A General Equilibrium Analysis," Journal of Political Economy, Vol. 98, No. 4 (1990), p.869; and William G. Laffer, "How Regulation is Destroying American Jobs," The Heritage Foundation:  16 February 1993, pp.6-7.</ADDRESS><p>

<bold>The Costs of Affirmative Action:</bold><br>
A projection based on a Forbes magazine model finds that the direct compliance costs of affirmative action programs cost the nation $25 billion per year.  But indirect costs -- paperwork, loss of efficiency, etc. -- could exceed $100 billion per year, according to the study.  According to the Congressional Research Service, about 160 federal programs, statutes, regulations, and executive orders grant some measure of "preference" to women or minorities in the areas of hiring, federal contracts, educational opportunities and grants.<br>

<bold>Losses to Farmers:</bold></br>
The American Farm Bureau  Federation estimates that U.S. agricultural interests spend between $18 billion and $20 billion per year complying with federal regulations.  To put things in perspective, that figure is roughly 35 percent of total net farm income in the United States.  If this estimate is in the ballpark, farmers spend $2 complying with government-mandated regulations for every $1 they receive in price supports.<br>
<ADDRESS>Source:  Thad Cochran, "Regulatory Relief for Farmers," The Washington Times, April 4, 1995.</ADDRESS><p>

<bold>The Cost of Cleanliness:</bold><br>
According to the U.S. Commerce Department, pollution abatement and control expenditures consumed more than 18 percent of gross private domestic nonresidential investment in 1992, or $102 billion.  Over the past 20 years, U.S. businesses have been forced to divert almost 15 percent of their total fixed investment to nonproductive equipment.<br>
<ADDRESS>Source:  Bruce Bartlett, "The High Cost of Turning Green," The Wall Street Journal, September 14, 1994.</ADDRESS><p>

<bold>Automobile Prices:</bold><br>
The cost of emissions-control equipment added to a new car through the 1994 model year averages $2010, according to data supplied by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and corrected to 1993 dollars.  Californians face a major dilemma in the coming years.  Regulators there have issued quotas of zero-emissions cars that they must build and sell, starting with 2 percent of the vehicles sold in California in 1998, then rising to five percent in 2001, and to 10 percent in 2003 and beyond.  This regulation promises almost no discernible benefits.  Every new car sold in the state today is 97% clean.  Most smog is produced by the dirtiest 10% of cars.  The 100 percent clean cars will replace the 97 percent clean cars, not the worst polluters.<br>

<bold>The Price Tag:</bold><br>
Government regulators regularly under-estimate the true cost of their proposed regulations.  The <ADDRESS>Federal Register</ADDRESS>  estimated that obtaining a stormwater discharge permit under the Clean Water Act would cost $76,681.  Gregory S. Lashutka, mayor of Columbus, Ohio, reports that his city's actual cost was $1.5 million.<br>

Smoking Regulations:</bold><br>
In what is estimated will cost $8.1 billion in the first year alone, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has marching order to go out and require restaurants, retailers, office buildings owners, and others to inspect and maintain their indoor ventilation systems and ban cigarette smoking unless it takes place in separately ventillated rooms.  Government regulators have launched a crusade to stamp out smoking, based on "studies" showing secondhand smoke to be a health menace.  But the 1.19 risk ration for intensive, 40 year, day-in-day-out, pack-a-day exposure to secondhand smoke is by virtually all measures insignificant.<br><ADDRESS>Source:  Susan Eckerly, "Seeking a Regulatory Respite," The Washington Times, February 12, 1995; and Jerry Taylor, "Cancer Risks for Thee, but Not for Me," The Wall Street Journal, January 3, 1995.</ADDRESS><p>

<bold>Water Quality Standards:</bold><br>
In March, the EPA's Great Lakes Initiative imposed uniform standards for water quality on eight different states (Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin).  A study conducted for the Council of Great Lakes Governors says this will cost more than $2 billion per year and destroy up to 33,000 jobs.<br>
<ADDRESS>Source:  Susan Eckerly, "Seeking a Regulatory Respite," The Washington Times, February 12, 1995.</ADDRESS><p>

<bold>Air Pollution Standards:</bold><br>
Californians face $4 to $6 billion more to federal air quality regulatory costs each year.  Environmental Protection Agency regulators are marching into Los Angeles, Sacramento, and Ventura to enforce compliance with the 1977 Clean Air Act.  The state of California estimates that by 2010, "losses will total at least $8.4 billion in direct costs, $17.2 billion in output, and 165,000 jobs."<br>

<bold>Ethanol:</bold><br>
Bill Clinton frequently chooses to use regulatory dictates to reward favorite industries and constituencies.  Bowing to the powerful corn lobby, Clinton last year adopted the so-called ethanol rule, guaranteeing ethanol a 30 percent share of the oxygenate market for the reformulated gasoline program.  Ethanol is typically more expensive than its alternative, an ether known as MTBE.  Clinton's ethanol mandate was on track to cost consumers as much as $350 million per year at the gasoline pump (on top of his gas tax) and would have deprived the National Highway Trust Fund of millions of dollars of revenues because ethanol is partially tax exempt.  In April, 1995, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals delivered Clinton at least a temporary setback, ruling Clinton exceeded his authority with the ethanol mandate.<br>

<bold>The ADA's Legal Quagmire:</bold><br>
By December, 1994, nearly 40,000 complaints were filed under the Americans with Disabilities Act.  But mounting evidence suggests massive abuse.  Eighty-five percent of complaints came from people who had jobs, one-fifth of complaints came from people with back trouble, and nearly 12 percent from those with emotional or psychiatric impairments.  These figures suggest a large amount of administrative and legal activity for an apparently modest return, considering that Congress intended to design an incentive-based approach to broadening opportunities for the disabled.<br><ADDRESS>Source:  Claudia Winkler, "Reality Check on ADA's Results," The Washington Times, April 20, 1995.</ADDRESS><p>
<bold>FDA Tyranny:</bold><br>The Food and Drug Administration will soon require food manufacturers to notify the FDA before marketing foods manufactured with new biotech techniques -- high precision recombinant DNA, or gene splicing techniques.  This move reflects a two-year trend at the FDA toward stricter scrutiny of biotech products, relying more on "risk considerations" than real science.<br><ADDRESS>Source:  Henry Miller, "Dr. Kessler's Regulatory Obsessions," The Washington Times, December 15, 1994.</ADDRESS><p>

In Sacramento, California, residents are reeling over a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ruling last fall which added three varieties of the fairy shrimp to th endangered species list.  The agency relied upon a one-paragraph petition submitted by a Davis, Calif., botanist in 1990, even though millions of the hardy shrimp can be found in California, Europe, Asia, Australia and Africa.  The decision has shut down a pony ranch that housed a Sacramento program for needy and disabled children and could cost the Sacramento-area housing industry $550 million.<br>

Pushing forward with the next stage of the 1990 Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has created a new paperwork nightmare for companies in high smog urban areas called the Employee Commute Option (ECO).  Employers in these regions are forced to find ways to cajole a designated percentage of their workers into carpools -- or face devastating financial penalties that can reach as high as $25,000 per violation.  Eric Peters, an automotive writer for <ADDRESS>The Washington Times</ADDRESS> observes that "the real genius of the ECO mandate is that it turns employers -- not the government or the EPA -- into the bullyboy."

The EPA also announced new emissions standards for marine engines, one of the last unregulated emissions sources.  Since marine engines are responsible for only about three percent of total emissions, the new standards are unlikely to have any noticeable effect on air quality.  But consumers will notice.  The high-performance, fuel-injected marine engines necessary to comply with the mandate can cost $1,200 (15%) more than conventional engines, a nationwide cost of as much as $300 million per year.<br>

Food and Drug Administration rules implemented by FDA head David Kessler are costing lives.  In 1991, Dr. Kessler prohibited pharmaceutical companies from informing doctors of new uses for approved drugs.  In one instance, the FDA stopped a pharmaceutical company from distributing free copies of "The Chemotherapy Source Book"--even though the company had already received FDA approval to give away thousands of copies.  The FDA claims that when a drug company gives doctors free textbooks that mention an off-label use of its products, the drugs become subject to seizure.<br><ADDRESS>Source:  James Bovard, "First Step to an FDA Cure:  Dump Kessler,"  The Wall Street Journal, December 8, 1994.</ADDRESS><p>

Bob Floyd of Muncie, Ind., had a "wetland" mysteriously appear on his property when a local business accidentally cut a drainage pipe.  Federal regulators swooped in to protect this "wetland" and forced the 80-year-old farmer to stop farming.  The so-called wetland has since dried up, but Mr. Floyd may have to sell the land his family has farmed for a half century.

Bob Lindberg, president of Young Co. in Seattle, thought his small metal firm had a decent diversity record -- with a work force that included about 35 percent women and minorities -- until the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) came knocking on his door.  The agency accused the firm, which is a subcontractor for a company that supplies anchors to the Navy, of a number of charges including failing to hire qualified Asian applicants.  Young opened his books to the auditors, spent thousands of dollars on a consultant, and finally settled in part by paying $47,000 in back wages to some minority workers.<br>

John Thorpe's plans to build on his own property were thwarted by the Fish and Wildlife Service, which demanded to know what steps he had taken to preserve the salt marsh harvest mouse.  Though Mr. Thorpe only wanted to develop mostly on the dry, upland portion of his propery, an agency of the U.S. government theorized that when golboal warming melts the polar ice-caps, the Pacific will rise and inundate the habitat of the salt marsh harvest mouse on his lowlands, forcing it to seek refuge on Thorpe's highlands.  For this science fiction story, Thorpe was denied permission to develope his land.<br>

Richard Enthoven's family-owned Kwik Wash Laundries Inc. in Dallas says it is facing damage claims totaling more than $2 million in two suits.  In a high-crime neighborhood in San Antonio three years ago, a man was murdered near the entrance of one apartment building launderette, where he was washing a friend's clothes at about 2 a.m.  E.B. Barretto, the attorney representing the victim's father, alleges that Kwik Wash failed to provide adequate security at its launderette.  He further claims a security light was out and Kwik Wash violated the apartment building's safety guidelines, which called for closing the launderette at 10 p.m.<br>

In an example of the lawsuit frenzy borne of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act, in July, 1992, GTE Data Services in Tampa discovered that one of its computer programmers had been stealing money from other employees and had brought a loaded derringer to work.  When he was fired for having the gun, he sued for reinstatement under the ADA.  He said he was the victim of a mental illness aggravated by improper medication , and thus disabled under the language of the act.  The first court ruling - later overturned -- went in the programmer's favor:  "When poor judgment is a sympton of a mental or psychological disorder, it is defined as an impairment that would qualify as a disability under the ADA," the court said.

David and Florence Isbell -- well known in activist legal circles in Washington -- teamed up with the Washington Lawyers' Committee to force Washington area theaters to install special assistive listening devices.  Cineplex theaters, the unfortunate target of the Isbell's crusade, had been installing the equipment in theaters around the nation when the Isbell's filed suit.  In response, Cineplex accelerated the installation plan for the Washington area and had all theaters equipped by August 31.  Thinking the problem had been solved, Cineplex asked the U.S. District court to dismiss the suit.  The lead attorney for the Washington Lawyers' Committee refused to back down.  Cineplex ageed to pay $60,000 in attorneys' fees and accept the supervision of a court appointed monitor.  Howard Lichtman, executive vice president of the Cineplex chain, says the rate of requests for the devices "is infinitesimal."

The Republican Congress should set specific goals for the movement of Cost of Government Day.  Specifically, legislators should target a Cost of Government Day 1996 on or before July 4th, so that Americans can truly enjoy their liberation from the government on Independence Day.  Likewise, Congress should aim for a Cost of Government Day 2005 on or before April 15th so Americans can truly enjoy the fruits of the labor by the time they file their taxes.<p>

Heighten public attention about "bureaucratic tyranny" by establishing a monthly "Corrections Day" and holding public "show trials" of wasteful government programs and abusive regulations.  "Corrections Day," as dubbed by Speaker Gingrich, would help stem "self-evidently stupid," "profoundly dumb," "stupidly legal" and "silly" regulations flowing from federal agencies.
<address><br>Source:  Kenneth Cooper, "Speaker is planning a Bash for Bureaucratic Boondoggles, "The Washington Post, May 3, 1995.</address><p>

Bar unelected federal bureaucrats from making laws.  Ultimately, no law should go into effect without the consent of a majority of the House, a majority of the Senate, and the signature of the President.  Lawmakers should take direct responsibility for laws by enacting them themselves.  Agency bureaucrats can make recommendations, conduct risk assessment, and propose legal language, but should not be allowed to make laws themselves.<br>

Reduce the number of government regulators.  From 1985 to 1992, staffing of federal regulatory agencies increased by over 20 percent.  By 1992, the federal government employed almost 125,000 regulatory employees, and that total has increased under Bill Clinton.  One way Congress can reduce "bureaucratic tyranny," as Speaker Gingrich has described it, is by reducing the number of government regulators.  Too often, regulators seek to justify their own existence by implementing time consuming and overly bureaucratic mandates on state and local governments and private businesses. <p> Congress should send regulators a message:  Overzealous regulatory behavior will be punished, not rewarded.  State and local governments must follow suit.  During the 1980's, state-level bureaucracies increased by almost 20 percent.  Whereas the federal government employes about two million civilian employees, state and local governments employ more than six times that amount.<br>
<address>Source:  Jonathan Adler, "On a High Regulatory Roll,"  The Washington Times, April 4, 1994.</address><p> 

Demand proper risk assessment of all proposed regulations.  Government regulators are notorious for devoting huge resources to relatively insignificant risks -- like asbestos exposure in schools -- at tremendous cost to companies and consumers.  For example, look at EPA's risk assessment for a Superfund site.  You will learn about hypothetical children who eat dirt 250 days a year from the bottom of contaminated brooks and ponds.  Likewise, the Safe Drinking Water Act mandates that local governments get rid of virtually all chloroform in their water, even though the best available science suggests that chloroform does not pose a danger in the biological mechanisms associated with drinking tap water.  Risk assessment should quantify the cost of all proposed regulations and rank risks in order of priority.  Target risks should be compared to several ordinary risks that people confront in their daily lives.  In addition, regulators should be required to consider competing risks -- dangers induced by regulators.  For example, Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards requiring "fuel efficient" automobiles are resulting in smaller, less safe cars and more deaths and injuries on the road.<br>

Enact a federal regulatory budget.  Such a budget would establish a maximum total regulatory burden that government could impose on the economy.  Any new regulations that would exceed the budget based on risk assessment reports would require the repeal or modification of some other regulations to ensure regulatory burden neutrality.<br>

Overhaul the Clean Air Act and allow states to use remote-sensing detectors to identify high-emission vehicles.  Just 10 percent of the cars on the road produce half of all hydrocarbons.  But current law subjects the 90 percent of clean auto owners to cumbersome, expensive, time-consuming, bureaucracy-intensive mandates such as inspections, reformulated gasolines, car-pooling requirements, alternative fuels, and even soon-to-be mandated production of inefficient electric cars in California.  Remote-sensing technology can identify dirt cars, reducing the role of government and freeing most auto-owners from bureaucratic harassment.<br>

Reform the 1974 Clean Water Act to specifically and reasonably define what constitutes a wetland.  Under current rules, federal regulators have construed the Clean Water Act to classify huge tracts of land as wetlands for protection from development, even though the 1974 statute says nothing about welands protection.  Bipartisan legislation sponsored by Rep. Bud Shuster calling on the Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Agriculture to classify all existing welands based on function and environmental importance into categoies A (high priority), B (modest priority) and C (low priority)  would put an end to egregious bureaucratic regulatory "takings" from private land-owners.<br>

Repeal the Delaney Clause, a provision of the 1958 Food Drug and Cosmetic Act that allows only additives deemed to have zero risk of causing cancer to be used on processed foods.  Passed at a time when cancer risks were far more difficult to determine, the statute is grossly outdated at best and an example of hyper-regulatory overkill at worst.<br>

Enact Long-awaited Banking Reform.  Existing banking laws -- largely incorporated in the 1930's-era Glass-Seagall Act -- are woefully outdated, sharply restricting or prohibiting the ability of banks to expand across state lines, sell insurance, or provide investment underwriting.  As a result, American banks are at a tremendous disadvantage in the world market.  Congress should repeal antiquated laws such as the Glass-Seagall Act and promote competition in the American banking industry.  A recent McKinsey & Co. study found that the annual costs of interstate banking under today's cumbersome regulatory structure can range from .5 percent to almost one percent of a company's noninterest expenses -- a total in the billions of dollars.  And these savings are dwarfed by those that will come from the nationwide consolidations of operations.

Repeal market regulations on telecommunications providers.  The long distance and local telephone markets, as well as the cable television market, should be opened up to competition.  Current law, based on the 1934 Communications Act based on 19th century railroad regulation, imposes restrictions which ensure virtual monopolies in existing phone and cable markets.  These antiquated regulations should come to an end, and the cable-telco ban, which prevents telephone and cable firms from competing against each other, should be repealed.  Competition between long distance and local phone companies and cable television providers will reduce prices and ensure better service for consumers.  The 1992 Cable Act should be repealed.

Enact Civil Justice Refomr.  The more than 70,000 product liability lawsuits filed in the United States each year cost Americans $300 billion per year, according to Citizens for a Sound Economy.  It's no wonder 47 percent of U.S. firms in a recent survey said they had withdrawn products from the market over fear of lawsuits.  Congress must pass comprehensive legal reform, including partial institution of a "loser-pays" rule to encourage settlements, a cap on "pain-and-suffering" awards in all civil suits, higher standards of proof for punitive damages in all civil suits, and limits on the liability of manufacturers.<br>

States around the country have been forced to reform their budgeting and tax policies due to their deficit spending.  Many states have been successful in trimming their deficits without raising taxes.  The method used by the most successful states has been supermajority tax limitation laws and spending limitation laws. <b>One third of all Americans live in a state withe supermajority constitutional tax limitations.  In most of the states supermajority requirements, the idea of requiring a greater than fifty percent vote of the legislature to increase taxes grew out of the tax revolt movement and the initiative process.</b>  These states offer a successful model for the Federal Government's budget and tax reform efforts.  The following states have supermajority tax limitation requirements:

<a name="3"></a>
<small>ii</small>  This amendment is found in H.B. 2459 sponsored by Representative
Ward. As of early 1995 it is in the House Finance Committee. There
are two other provisions requiring supermajority approval in the
Hawaii legislature. H.B. 1403 and H.B. 1448, both sponsored by
Representative Yonamine. 
<a name="4"></a>
<p><small>iv</small>  H.C.A. 14 (1995). H.C.A. 18, another bill, provides a
constitutional amendment requiring that passage of any revenue
bills that result in an increase in the revenue received by the
state may become law only after approval of 3/5 of each house
of the legislature. 
<a name="5"></a>
<p><small>v</small>  This measure passed the lower Idaho house but was rejected
by the Idaho Senate by a vote of 21-14. 
<a name="6"></a>
<p><small>vi</small>  1996 IN H.J.R. 5. Sponsored by representative Turner.

<a name="7"></a>

S.B. 689.
<a name="8"></a>
<p><small>viii</small> H.B. 2482 (1995).
<a name="9"></a>
<p><small>ix</small>  1995 MN H.B. 2548. Sponsored by Representative Van Dellen.
The bill also requires the vote of two-thirds of the members of
a local government's assembly or local voters by a majority of
those voting for the adoption of a new tax, an increase in the
tax rate or an extension of the application of a tax by a local
unit of government.

<a name="11"></a>
<p><small>xi</small>  1996 N.M S.J.M. 12. Sponsored by Senator Scott. The
determination of whether a bill levies a new tax, increases the
rate or base of an existing tax or creates or raises a fee shall
be made to resolve reasonable doubt in favor of requiring the
three-fifths vote. Taxpayers are expressly given standing to bring
an action to enforce the provisions of S.J.R. 12. After adoption
by both houses of the New Mexico legislature the amendment must
be approved by the people at the next general election. 
<a name="12"></a>
<p><small>xii</small>  A.B. 2197 creates a constitutional amendment requiring
approval by a 2/3 vote of the Senate and Assembly voting separately
to increase or decrease any tax rate, impose a new tax, extend
a new tax, extend or delete existing taxes. A.B. 6575, A.B. 8589,
A.B. 2861 and S.B. 1432 create constitutional amendments to require
a vote of 2/3 of all members elected to each branch of the legislature
to impose, continue or revive a tax. S.B. 5597 and S.B. 5615 require
a 2/3 vote of the legislature for any bills that increase taxes
by fifty million dollars.

<title>SUPERMAJORITY REQUIREMENTS IN THE U.S. CONSTITUTION -- ATR</title>

<p>

From the early days of the Republic to the present, supermajority voting requirements have been part of the U.S. Constitution. Supermajority requirements are found in the following sections of the Constitution:
<p>



<TABLE BORDER>

<TH>Article                        </th>

<th>Applies To:                  </th><tr>

<td>Article 1, section 3, clause 6</td>

<td>Conviction in impeachment trials</td><tr>

<td>Article 1, section 5, clause 2</td>

<td>Expulsion of a Member of Congress</td><tr>

<td>Article I, section 7, clause 2</td>	

<td>Override a presidential veto</td><tr>

<td>Article II, section 1, clause 3</td>	<td>Quorum of two-thirds of the states to elect the President</td><tr>

<td>Article II, section 2, clause 2</td>	<td>Consent to a treaty</td><tr>

<td>Article V</td>	<td>Proposing constitutional amendments</td><tr>

<td>Article VII</td>	<td>State ratification of the original Constitution</td><tr>

<td>Amendment XII</td>	<td>Quorum of two-thirds of the states to elect the President and the Vice President.</td><tr>

<td>Amendment XIV</td>	<td>To remove disability of those who have engaged in insurrection</td><tr>

<td>Amendment XXV section 4</td>	<td>Presidential disability</td><tr>





</table></body></html>

<P><P>
	
The Framers' decision not to impose additional constitutional supermajority requirements does not mean that they opposed extending the concept. It simply means that at the time of ratification they did not see a need for other supermajority requirements. However, they did recognize that circumstances change and that the Constitution would need to be flexible to change with the passage of time. Consequently, they provided a mechanism to amend the Constitutionan amendment mechanism that itself requires two supermajority voting requirements: Congressional adoption of the proposed amendment by a 2/3 supermajority and then approval by three-fourths of the states for ratification.
<p>
	Finally, a supermajority requirement for increasing the U.S. tax burden is not unprecedented. The 16th Amendment to the Constitution, which provides for the income tax, had to be approved by a vote of two-thirds of Congress and three-fourths of the states. It is only logical that we should extend this protection to increases of the tax burden that are far in excess of the small burden first imposed in 1913.airness Restoration Act" introduced by Texas Congressman and House Majority Leader Dick Armey.  Most people call it "the flat tax" for short.<P>

<P>

<DD>Candidates and elected officials began taking the pledge in 1986. After President Reagan's Tax Reform Act of 1986 was passed,
many taxpayers feared that some politicians would raise income tax rates. With President Reagan's support and endorsement,
Americans for Tax Reform and a broad-based coalition of groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National
Federation of Independent Businesses and hundreds of taxpayer groups throughout the nation began to ask all candidates for
public office to "take the pledge." Every year, all Members of Congress are asked to take the pledge by Americans for Tax
Reform, and all challengers are asked to take the pledge during each election cycle.

<p>

The Family Research Council is a nonprofit, nonpartisan educational 
organization operating under the provision of Section 501C-3 of the 
Internal Revenue Code.  It was originally founded in 1983, merged 
with Focus on the Family from 1988-1992, then reorganized as a separate 
501C-3 and incorporated as such in the District of Columbia in October 
1992.  The Council is supported by voluntary donations and grants.  The 
bulk of its contributions are received from individuals.  Donations to 
FRC are tax-deductible.
<P>
The Family Research Council exists to reaffirm and promote nationally, 
and particularly in Washington, DC,  the traditional family unit and 
the Judeo-Christian value system upon which it is built.
<P>
To accomplish this task, the Council will:
<P>

<UL>
<li>Promote and defend traditional family values in print, broadcast and 
other media outlets.
<li>Develop and advocate legislative and public policy initiatives 
which strengthen and fortify the family and promote traditional values.
<li>Establish and maintain an accurate source of statistical and 
research information which reaffirms the importance of the family in our 
civilization.
<li>Inform and educate citizens on how they can promote Biblical 
principles in our culture.
</UL>

<P>

In Washington, D.C., a city often estranged from heart and home, the 
Family Research Council is an unparalleled organization which focuses 
its efforts solely on defending the interests of the American Family. 
FRC provides an alternative voice in the media -- a voice for the family 
and family values.  A unique and multi-faceted team has united to meet 
these challenges.

<p>

For more details about FRC's stance on issues that affect the family, 
make sure to read our <a href="/townhall/FRC/faq/">FAQ (Frequently 
Asked Questions) List</a>.

Below we have provided an assortment of links for your benefit

frequently, so be sure to check back often.
<p>
In the future we plan on adding other lists that will help you

<title>Daily Commentary - January 7, 1997</title>

<body>

<center><h1>Daily Commentary<br>
January 7, 1997</h1></center>

<p><hr width=75% size=3><p>

I'm Gary Bauer for Washington Watch.

<p>

House Republicans are deciding whether or not Newt Gingrich will
remain Speaker.  Few think the GOP will fail to keep the leader
who brought them out of forty years in the political wilderness.
Whatever details eventually emerge on this continuing saga, one
thing should be clear:  We have a <I>double</I> standard in Washington
when it comes to ethics.

<p>

The charges against Speaker Gingrich need to be fully explained.
We believe that no official, Speaker or President is above the
law.  But let's be fair.

<p>

Liberals crucified Judge Bork.  They tried to lynch my friend
Clarence Thomas. They nearly ran Ed Meese out of town for ethical
violations so minor that today no one can even remember what they
were.

<p>

Yet serious charges against liberals often go without investigation
and without prosecution.  Why, even now, all the president's men
are in federal court arguing that Paula Jones' credible sexual
harassment charges should not even be heard.

<p>

The motto at the Supreme Court is &quot;equal justice under
law.&quot;  We need to see justice for conservatives as well as 
liberals.  It's only fair.

<p>

For Family Research Council, this is Gary Bauer with today's
Washington Watch.  For more information about us, call 1-800-225-4008.
That number again:  1-800-225-4008.

<title>What Is Policy Review -- Heritage</title>
<META name="keyword" content="Policy Review: Journal of American Citizenship, community, conservative, journal, families, family, local, civic, religious, schools, education, citizens">
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<img src="/heritage/revpo.gif" width=169 height=79 alt="Policy Review" border=0></a>
<h2><i>POLICY REVIEW: The Journal of American Citizenship</i></h2></center>
<p>
<i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i>, the flagship magazine of <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>, is published 6 times per year. 
<p>
<i>Policy Review</i> specializes in the study of private-sector and local-government alternatives to the bureaucratic, centralized welfare state. We are dedicated to rebuilding the institutions of American citizenship -- families, neighborhoods, religious institutions, public and private schools, voluntary civic institutions, businesses, and local governments.
<p>
<i>Policy Review</i> profiles great American citizens: Houston constable Victor Trevino is reducing crime with his "zebra squad" of volunteer cops; Sister Connie Driscoll is helping young urban mothers in Chicago; <a href="/heritage/p_review/spring95/tolerth.html">Rev. Frank Reid</a>, of Baltimore's AME Church, is promoting black Christian manhood to the members of his community.
<p>
We study "what works": <a href="/heritage/p_review/spring95/glassth.html">DeVry Institute of Technology</a> sets the standard for career training; Rhode Island's privatized school lunch program tastes better and costs less; private security officers reduce crime around New York's Grand Central Station. 
<p>
We tackle tough subjects, and propose common-sense policy prescriptions, for issues such as <a href="/heritage/p_review/fall95/thegg.html">crime</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/summer95/thfost.html">taxes</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/fall95/thhood.html">environment</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/fall95/thfinn.html">education</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/fall95/thsher.html">religion and culture</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/summer95/thcraig.htm">adoption and foster care</a>, and <a href="/heritage/p_review/summer95/thbear.html">Social Security</a>. We publish articles by influential people on the major issues of the day. Newt Gingrich, Phil Gramm, <a href="/heritage/p_review/summer95/tharmey.html">Dick Armey</a>, Bill Bennett, Ralph Reed, Bill Kristol, Kate O'Beirne, Grover Norquist, and other key policy makers all contribute to <i>Policy Review</i>.
<p>
<i>Policy Review</i> provides practical, constructive thought -- the best of conservatism-in-action.

<P>
	The Heritage Foundation was founded in 1973 "to formulate and promote conservative public policies based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values, and a strong national defense."   A non-partisan tax-exempt institution, it is now one of the largest and most influential research and educational foundations in the United States, providing national, state, and local decision-makers with information that is concise, timely, and relevant to the current policy debate.<p>

	In the early 1980s Ronald Reagan described Heritage as the "feisty new kid on the block." Today, according to House Speaker Newt Gingrich, "Heritage plays a major role in developing the ideas that are going to make America's success possible in the 21st century."<P>

	Located in the nation's capital, The Heritage Foundation offers both summer and academic year internships.  These programs are intended to introduce bright and innovative undergraduate students to the policy-making process, involve them in the important questions and issues of the day, and encourage them to become active and effective participants in public affairs.<br><center>

<P>
<a name="polrev"></a><p><i><b>Policy Review</b></i> is Heritage's quarterly journal of conservative opinion and debate.

<b>The Heritage Foundation: Providing Practical Ideas for America's Future</b>
</center>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As the nation's leading think tank, The Heritage Foundation's impact on public policy is more pronounced than ever. As <I>The Wall 
Street Journal</I> wrote recently, "No policy shop has more clout than the conservative Heritage 
Foundation."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Indeed, many of the 104th Congress' plans for balancing 
the budget and scaling back big government began at Heritage. By providing official Washington 
with timely research and analysis, Heritage has become a primary information source for America's 
lawmakers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Heritage's people are more than just well-informed and 
well-educated. Many have hands-on government experience. They are doers as well as thinkers.  
Players, not just spectators. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	If you need a thought-provoking, articulate expert to 
discuss today's important issues, The Heritage Foundation is the place to turn. Contact 
<a href="mailto:moebiusw@heritage.org">Wanda Moebius</a> at (202) 675-1761 to book a speaker.

Welcome to the Town Hall CyberPersonality site!  I can assure you that this is certainly a new venture for me.  I've heard of "talking heads" from the likes of "Capitol Gang," and what used to be "MacNeil-Lehrer," but an on-line Internet personality is one of newest ways The Heritage Foundation would like to get past the limited amount of media coverage of hot issues and tell you what is really happening in Washington, on Capitol Hill, in the White House, and in policy circles.
<P>
A little bit about me -- I'm <a href="/heritage/cyberbio.html">Karen Czarnecki Miller</a>, and I'm primarily responsible for maintaining contact with the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov">Clinton Administration</a>, educating the presidential campaigns on important policy issues, and overseeing The Heritage Foundation's <a href="/heritage/jobs/jobs.html">Job Bank</a>. I also serve as a spokesman for the Foundation on Heritage proposals and research findings in all areas of the Foundation's study.<p>


I'd like to tell you a little bit about what you can expect to see when you come to this site.  Of course, over the next several months, I'll be doing some fine-tuning to make this as interesting and informative as possible.  I'd like to hear your thoughts on what you'd like to see, and what would help you to keep on top of current issues. 
<p>
Twice a week -- on Tuesday and Friday -- I will be on-line to discuss hot topics on the Hill and elsewhere, and answer your questions.  I am also planning to post research materials, discuss what opinion leaders are saying, interview guests on politics and policy, and much more!  
<p>
What would you like to see? Please <a href="mailto:gabrona@heritage.org">email</a> your thoughts to me, or to <a href="mailto: gabrona@heritage.org">Andy Gabron</a>, who helps me with research
 for this page. I look forward to hearing from you!

The purpose of the Heritage Job Bank is to try to match conservative job seekers with government/public policy-related positions.  Due to the volume, we do not conduct interviews and can not take any phone calls.  The recommendations you use are important so please list people who can speak to both your professional qualifications and your conservative ideology. For more information contact <a href="mailto: jobbank@heritage.org">Krissy Ganong</a> at (202) 546-4400.

Founded in 1973, The Heritage Foundation is a research and educational institute -- a think tank -- whose mission is to formulate and promote conservative public policies based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values, and a strong national defense.
<P>
<A HREF= "/heritage/staff/stafftoc.html">Heritage's  staff</A> pursues this mission by performing timely accurate research addressing key policy 
issues and effectively marketing these findings to its primary audiences: members of Congress, key congressional staff members, policymakers in the executive branch, the nation's news media, and the academic and policy communities. Heritage's products include publications, articles, lectures, conferences, and meetings.
<P>
Governed by an independent Board of Trustees,The Heritage Foundation is a non-partisan, tax exempt institution. Heritage relies on the private financial support of the general public -- individuals, foundations, and corporations -- for its income, and accepts no government funds and performs no contract work. Heritage is one of the nation's largest public policy research organization. More than 200,000 contributors make it the most broadly supported in America.

<p>
Dear fellow conservative,
<p>
The Leadership Institute (LI) educates conservatives like you for participation in the public policy process.<p>
In 1995 2,426 people enrolled for LI schools all across the country. <p>
Most young men and women who come to my schools are already philosophically committed to the conservative values which keep America free and strong.  The staff and faculty of my schools reinforce that committment.<p>
But it is not sufficient to have the right ideas if you do not implement them.  As a conservative, you owe it to your philosophy to study how to win.<p>
Over the years I have learned that victory in a public policy contest is largely determined by the number and effectiveness of the activists on the respective sides.<p>
That's what the Leadership Institute is all about -- building responsible conservative leadership today, for the challenges of tomorrow.<p>
You should prepare yourself now to be effective in the public policy process.<p>
You could be one of the new leaders I train in 1996.<p>
You're welcome to attend any program listed on this Web site.  You may decide to attend more than one.  Many of the schools and services build on each other.<p>
<!--
If you are a high school or college student I urge you to start with my <a href="sc-yl.html">Youth Leadership School</a>.  This school, which I have conducted in various forms since 1968, provides the "nuts and bolts" technology needed to succeed in politics at all levels.<p>
-->
Many of today's leaders, including Senator Mitch McConnell, Governor Terry Branstad, Congressmen Jack Fields, Steve Stockman, Mark Souder, David McIntosh, and Virginia Attorney General Jim Gilmore, used the leadership Institute to launch their careers.<p>
Now it's your turn.<p>
The <a href="school.html">Student Publications School</a>, trains conservative students to start and run successful campus publications.  Attending this school will allow you to provide a forum for conservative views on your campus and gain valuable journalism experience as you fight the liberal monopoly of the college media.<p>
If you're graduating or have already begun a public policy career, I have several other programs that will interest you.  This Web site, will introduce you to  my <a href="sc-brj.html">Broadcast Journalism School</a>, <a href="sc-ch.html>Capitol Hill Staff Training School</a>, Foreign Service Opportunity School, <a href="sc-cd.html>Candidate Development School</a> and <a href="sc-pr.html">Public Relations School</a>.<p>
Your interest in public policy may take you far.  Please let me help you as you invest your time and effort in America's future.<p>
Thank you for considering what the Leadership Institute can offer you.  Listed below are brief descriptions of many of the Institute's programs.<p>
These programs are all made possibe by the generous support of the LI's donors.  The revenue from school tuition accounts for a tiny percentage of the total cost of the Institute's efforts.<p>
If you would like to help advance the work of the Institute via a <a href="donate.html.cgi">contribution,</a> you can do this on-line with your credit card or by mail to: The Leadership Institute, Steven P.J. Wood Building, 1101 Highland Street, Arlington, VA 22201.<p>
Please mark "Town Hall" in the memo field of your check.<p>
I look forward to hearing from you soon.<p>
Cordially,<p>

</i>
<P>
Founded by Morton C. Blackwell in 1979, the Leadership Institute (LI) actively identifies,
recruits, trains and places principled conservatives in the public policy process.<p>

The Leadership Institute's Free Employment Placement Service is one of the oldest, longest
running, and most successful conservative job banks in Washington. LI's program has placed hundreds of conservatives
in all levels of the public policy process. In addition, its counseling service and educational programs
provide countless other conservatives with the leads, advice and training necessary to succeed in
public policy.<p>

Currently, LI's free Employment Placement Service offers three main placement options.<p>

The main Employment Placement Service program helps conservatives secure full and part-time
work in the public policy, government and private sectors.  A heavy emphasis is placed on filling
positions in Capitol Hill offices, special-interest groups and trade associations. After the 1994 fall election
cycle, special attention was given to Congressional placements and training of prospective Capitol Hill staff.

<p>The Broadcast Media Placement program helps conservatives locate and secure positions in
broadcast and print journalism, as well as public and media relations.<p>

The Intern Placement program helps interested individuals gain experience though
quality internships, volunteer work or temporary positions.<p>

Two full-time placement directors offer career counseling, tips on resume writing, job-hunting,
interviewing techniques, and networking advice to job-seekers.  To set-up an appointment, contact Emily Kertz at (703) 247-2000.<p>

In addition, LI offers a variety of one-day, two-day, three-day, and week-long professional
training programs to help conservatives become effective in the public policy process.<p>

Specialized schools such as the <a href="sc-ch.html">Capitol Hill Staff Training School</a>, the <a href="sc-cd.html">Candidate Development
School</a>, the Foreign Service Opportunity School, and the <a href="sc-brj.html">Broadcast Journalism School</a> teach job-
seekers how to land and succeed in positions within these professions.<p>


Technology-oriented schools including <!--the <a href="sc-yl.html">Youth Leadership School,--></a> the <a href="sc-pr.html">Public Relations

School,</a> the Rhetoric & Campaign Communications School, and
the <a href="sc-sp.html">Student Publications School</a> help conservatives enhance their public policy skills.<p>

<i>"Your program of finding jobs for conservatives is the most effective I have seen. I have recommended the Institute to my friends."</i><br>
-- Joseph Cramer
<p>
<i>"Thank you very much for all the time and effort you put into helping me find a job in public policy."</i><br>
-- John Lill
<p>
<i>"Although I had been told by three separate individuals that the Leadership Institute is a good place to go when looking for a job, I never expected to see results so quickly. I would not have known where to start without your help. It was great to be on the receiving end of the  phone line for a change."</i><br>

<p>
The mission of the Salvatori Leadership Speakers Bureau is to promote on campus America's first principles and to defend the values of the Founding Fathers: the ideas of free enterprise, limited government, strong national defense and traditional family values.<p>

Although these speakers would not agree on all issues, each of them represents aspects of the winning conservative coalition in the United States, values and ideas which are over looked on most campuses.<p>
<p>
Currently, we are in the process of updating
our Salvatori Leadership Speakers Bureau web page. All of the speaker descriptions are being updated and new speakers are being added. The new web page will be
posted as soon as the updates are finished. If you would like information on

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT></B>he alienation of African-American men from the churches of their communities 
is perhaps the single greatest tragedy facing black America. "While 75 percent of the 
mosque is male, 75 percent of the black church is female," laments Jawanza Kunjufu, 
author of <I>Adam Where Are You?: Why Most Black Men Don't Go to Church</I>. It wasn't 
always so: In earlier generations, black men were much more involved in the church, and 
their religious faith bolstered their commitment to families and neighborhoods. The most 
effective way to reduce black crime, and to strengthen black families, may be to return 
African-American men to their spiritual roots.</P>
<P>	A church in Baltimore that is itself returning to its roots is making great headway 
in its ministry to men. Bethel AME Church, founded in 1785, is the second-oldest church 
in the African Methodist Episcopal denomination and a venerable institution squarely in 
the black political mainstream. Bethel hosted much of the NAACP's national summit last 
year. Its pastor, Frank Madison Reid III, is the son and grandson of AME bishops, and his 
step-brother is Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke. Reid was educated at Yale University 
and Harvard Divinity School. A veteran of the civil-rights movement, he served later as 
pastor of Ward AME Church, an important congregation in Los Angeles. He has earned a 
black belt in karate, a prominent image as a local television personality, and a position as 
an intellectual leader of the African-American church.</P>

<H3>A Growing Concern</H3>
<P>	When Reid, 43, was named pastor of Bethel in 1989, the congregation had 7,000 
members, 25 percent of them men. Today, its membership numbers 10,000, 40 percent of 
whom are men. Each week, 4,400 of the faithful attend one of the two Sunday services, 
and 45 percent of them are men. Secular agencies and politicians who want to improve 
urban life should take note of Reid's ministry. Black men in his congregation have 
reconciled with their wives, resumed responsibilities to their children and communities, 
committed themselves to becoming productive citizens, and dedicated themselves to God.</P>
<P>	Rare among traditional black churches, economic classes mix at Bethel. The 
church is located in the Druid Hill section of Baltimore, a historically working-class 
neighborhood now infested with drugs and dilapidated public-housing projects, but it 
draws its membership from middle-class suburbs as well as the surrounding 
neighborhood. At services, blue-jean-clad youths pray while holding hands with middle-
aged professionals and families dressed in their Sunday best.</P> 
<P>	Reid attributes the growth of his congregation to a return to its Methodist roots. 
The Methodist movement, started by Charles and John Wesley in England in the 18th 
century, was spread throughout America by preachers such as George Whitefield. When 
Richard Allen and other blacks were barred from praying in a Methodist church in 
Philadelphia in the late 1700s, they established the AME church. Early Methodism 
emphasized moral rectitude and discipline, revivalism, the study of Scripture in Bible 
groups, and personal conversion. The movement played a leading role in the national 
crusades against drunkenness and slavery. "We meet the spiritual needs of the people 
because of our focus on prayer and the mystical nature of connection between the 
individual human being and the Holy Spirit," says Reid.</P>
<P>	Worship at Bethel is boisterous; dancing and shouting infuse the atmosphere. 
Reid sees this as a return to the spirit of early Methodism, when religious intensity 
energized powerful campaigns for the betterment of society. Reid points with pride to the 
18th-century English Methodists who "went into the prisons and streets with a revival 
that saved England from the same revolutionary fate as France." And he cites as a model 
the 1870s revival at Philadelphia's Bethel AME Church, which prompted a moral uplift 
in the city's black population.</P>
<P>	Reid's ministry to men is in the early Methodist tradition of vigorous outreach to 
the unchurched, wherever they may be found. As the pastor of Ward AME in the early 
1980s, Reid concluded that the church wasn't addressing the needs of young men on the 
street. He also wondered why black males were joining the Nation of Islam or Los 
Angeles gangs like the Bloods and Crips, but not the Protestant churches. "Jesus said, `I 
will make you fishers of men,' " he says. "But either the church wasn't using the right 
bait or the lines weren't strong enough to bring the fish into the church."</P> 
<P>	How does Reid reel the men in at Bethel?  His television services encourage men 
to visit the church.  Highly approachable, he invites men to attend his church when he 
meets them on Baltimore's streets in his daily travels.  His use of the term "brother" 
suggests kinship and inspires male members to actively urge their friends to accompany 
them to Bethel.</P>  
<P>	Reid also uses a four-step plan that relies on "respect" for black males, teaching 
the "roots" of Christianity, "reformation" of habits, and "resurrection" of lives.  At 
Sunday services, male visitors are welcomed with applause and hugs. "We want to 
express our joy for your presence in the Lord's house," Reid says from the pulpit.</P>   
<P>	 Reid recently invited Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam to speak at Bethel. 
Reid disagrees with Farrakhan's theology and racial and religious separatism. But Reid 
wanted men who are attracted to Farrakhan to be exposed to a church that emphasizes 
Christian manliness.</P>
<P>	Men who visit Bethel also find an atmosphere that is masculine as well as 
feminine, unlike many of the churches they are used to. At age 13 or so, many black 
youths tend to drop out of church. "At that age, black males who were once drawn to the 
choir as youth no longer sing, because robes look like dresses," says Reid. "Their Sunday 
school teacher, superintendent, and youth adviser are women. Their reaction to the 
religious femininity of the church drives them out of the church and into the seduction of 
a gang."</P>
<P>	At Bethel, men as well as women occupy important board and teaching positions, 
and Reid makes sure that men won't have to leave the church to find opportunities for 
brotherhood. In addition to all-female Bible study and family Bible programs, Bethel 
offers weekly all-male Bible classes. There, stories from Scripture inspire men to talk 
freely about difficulties in their relations with women, and--Reid calls this a common 
problem among black men--the resentment they may feel toward absent, domineering, or 
abusive fathers.</P> 
<P>	Every November, Bethel hosts a month-long celebration of men. Last year's 
activities included a retreat, African martial-arts experts, scholarly lectures, a Men's Day 
with noted personalities like talk-show host Tony Brown, and a week-long revival service 
at which 67 men, including some substance abusers, joined the church. </P>
<P>	Reid also attracts men to Bethel by setting strict standards of individual moral 
responsibility. Foul language, lying, cheating, and adultery are simply not tolerated. No 
drinking, smoking, or blasphemy is allowed in the congregation. In his sermons, Reid 
cautions the men against excessive anger, spitefulness, and abusive behavior created by 
high stress and low self-esteem. He advises them to restrain their anger through a close 
relationship with Christ. "If men are unable to handle their emotions," he says, "then they 
become prime candidates for abusing their wives or girlfriends and children, as well as 
their friends and neighbors and, ultimately, the community."</P>
<P>	Reid is convinced that exacting standards of behavior do not drive men away, but 
attract them. Men are empowered by morality, he says; they gain courage and conviction 
when they know they are acting responsibly. He argues that the appeal of Malcolm X and 
Louis Farrakhan comes more from their moral authority than their religion. Christianity, 
too, must emphasize its firmness along with its love and compassion. "Jesus drew strong 
fishermen to him," Reid says. "His moral authority was a magnet."</P>
<P>	Reid challenges the males in his congregation to be men rather than boys. "You 
can be 65 and still be a boy," he preaches. "You can be 45, married with children, and 
still be a boy. The difference between a boy and a man is that a man loves God and takes 
responsibility for himself and others."</P> 
<P>	Many congregants fail to live up to the church's standards. But all men are 
welcome. No stigma is placed on former convicts and drug-abusers. At each service, Reid 
asks men who have been incarcerated to stand and be applauded. Reid preaches that 
everybody in the church is sinful, citing the biblical injunction, "We were born in sin and 
shaped in iniquity, and we all have fallen short of the glory of God." </P>
<P>	Bethel provides wrongdoers with encouragement coupled with discipline. Biblical 
passages are cited to show why the behavior in question is wrong. The church is firm in 
response to wrongful deeds, but forgiving. The man admits his error, and he and Reid 
discuss ways to make restitution and bring healing for the wrongs he has committed. Reid 
strongly emphasizes restitution, arguing that one has a responsibility to bring wholeness 
to that which one has broken.</P>
<P>	Changa Onyanga used to be a lieutenant in the drug culture. When he first entered 
Bethel to visit a former member of his gang, he had no respect for ministers like Reid. "I 
looked him up and down and pressed on." Onyanga says now. "I did not speak to him. 
Besides, preachers had a bad rap because they were not doing anything for people who 
needed a cause to champion."</P>
<P>	Reid noted Onyanga's "terrible disposition" and responded. "No one walks 
around this church and does not speak," Reid said to him. "We are friendly and we speak 
to one another as Christians should." Reid had Onyanga's friend talk to him and teach 
him about the decorum of his church. Onyanga has since joined Bethel.</P>
<P>	In preaching personal responsibility, Reid acknowledges his own errors. Happily 
married with two daughters, eight and two, Reid also fathered a son out of wedlock 
during an earlier pastorate in Charlotte, North Carolina. "I do not deny my 15-year-old 
son," says Reid. "He is a reality." Although his son lives with the mother, Reid remains a 
significant part of his life. He provides monetary and moral support and communicates 
regularly. Reid even has him stand up in the congregation when he comes to visit.</P>
<P>	Reid tells the men that he has been where some of them are. Once they see that 
their spiritual leader is not above temptation, he believes, the men in his congregation can 
grapple more easily with issues of manhood and sexuality. </P>
<P>	Reid argues that spiritual leaders must be honest with men about their own 
failings. Some black men resist attending church because they regard the preachers as 
hypocrites. Reid chides his fellow clergy for not practicing what they preach. "Just 
because they received the calling," he says, "does not mean they are above the struggle or 
the contradictions." Citing St. Augustine and other great religious teachers who have 
acknowledged their sinfulness, he says pastors must realize they are preaching to 
themselves as well as to their congregations. </P>
<P>	Reid's ministry to men includes working with women to restore male authority in 
the home. Men will be better fathers and husbands and will participate more willingly in 
church and community life, Reid argues, if they are allowed to exercise authority as head 
of the household. This does not mean tyranny or dictatorial control, but rather loving 
responsibility. Reid teaches men to be the protector, priest, provider, and partner of the 
household. The Old Testament instructs the man to be "watchman for his family."</P>
<P>	"We teach that the man should be the first person his wife goes to for prayer," 
Reid says. "If there is need for the pastor to come into the household, then it should be to 
pray for the family. But that can only happen if the man takes the leadership in making 
prayer a part of the household. The man should take the leadership for making sure Bible 
study is part of family life." Reid preaches that wives should submit to their husbands, 
but also that husbands must not abuse this authority. "Paul's letter to the Ephesians 
teaches us: `Woman, submit thyself if your man loves you as Jesus loves the church,' "  
he says. "If the husband does not love his wife as Jesus loved the church, then she has no 
responsibility to submit to him. We submit to Jesus out of the fact that he loved us." </P>
<P>	The principle of male headship does not mean that the husband must be the 
primary breadwinner. "We teach the men that wives' earnings should not bruise their 
ego," says Reid. "A husband should be thankful when a woman who earns more, or has 
more education, looks to him as protector and provider." The word "provider," Reid 
points out, comes from the Latin for "seeing." It means supplying a family's vision as 
much as providing its material sustenance.</P>
<P>	Reid also teaches women how to respond to men in the household. Annette 
Brown, for example, used Reid's sermon on "a loving God" to endure six years of 
estrangement from her husband, Kevin. "There were times when my husband was gone 
for four days without contact," says Brown, "but pastor Reid's message told me to look 
beyond his faults and see his needs." Annette and Kevin are back together, and their 
relationship is stronger. He has joined Bethel and resumed his role as father of their two 
sons. He has even begun to prepare for the ministry.</P>
<P>	Brown is the religious leader and disciplinarian of the household. He is also in 
charge of sex education. Brown settles family decisions after family prayer. Matters in 
which he reserves the final say include private school for their children, vacations, family 
transportation, his work hours, visits to relatives, and house-buying. But his wife controls 
the household finances. She submits to him because he submits to the church. "Kevin 
takes the authority in the household," she says. "When there is a decision, he makes the 
final decision." She reserves the right to veto any decision not in the family's best 
interest, but she adheres to Biblical scripture: Better to live on a corner of the roof than 
share a house with a quarrelsome wife. "I always uplift my husband," she says.</P>
<P>	Reid denies that this approach oppresses women. "I have not talked to a single 
African-American woman," he says, "who has said `no' when I have asked whether she 
would gladly submit to a man who loved Christ, who provided for her and her children, 
who would protect her, and was spiritual. They recognize that the submission would not 
be an oppressive submission, but a submission in partnership." </P>
<P>	Reid encourages men to marry or, if they are separated, to reunite with the 
mothers of their children. But he does not always counsel marriage. "It makes no sense," 
he says, "to push together a couple that does not love each other. If the mother has 
become pregnant for the wrong reasons--out of lust, for example, or to get welfare 
payments--then it may not be possible for the father to exercise loving authority as head 
of the household."</P>
<P>	"In an ideal world, it is easy to say, `if you make a baby, then marry the mother,' " 
Reid says. "But as a pastor, I have to deal with the hard facts of family conflict. What 
happens to the child who grows up in a home where the parents hate each other because 
you made them get married? The child will grow up with their hostility and take it out 
into the world."</P> 
<P>	Reid thinks public policy treats African-American men with illegitimate children 
too harshly. He is especially troubled by a court system that cuts fathers off from their 
children. Men are presumed guilty in disputes over child support; visitation can be denied 
at the mother's request. Reid says the system "tortures fathers, who often want to do the 
right thing for their children, and is unfairly slanted toward the mother."</P>
<P>	According to Reid, models of Christian manhood from African and African-
American history are essential in attracting black men to church. Before becoming full 
members of Bethel, men must spend an hour with the pastor, who teaches them about 
Africans in the Bible and African-American church history. In this portion of his 
ministry, which he calls "roots," Reid tries to dispel the notion that Christianity is a 
Eurocentric, slave masters' religion. He teaches about the Africans Simeon (also called 
Niger) and Lucius of Cyrene, who ordained the Apostle Paul and Silas. He talks about the 
black abolitionist David Walker, who in 1829 published an anti-slavery tract known as 
the Appeal. This seminal publication demanded the end of slavery and appealed to the 
"God of the Ethiopians." </P> 
<P>	Another of Reid's models of black Christian manhood is Bishop Henry McNeil 
Turner. Born a slave in South Carolina, Turner became the first black chaplain of the 
Union army, a member of the South Carolina Legislature, and an advocate for the black 
emigration to Africa in 1874. His status as a bishop in the African Methodist Episcopal 
Church allowed him to carry the African-American religious tradition to South Africa 
more than 100 years ago. </P> 
<P>	Reid also likes to point out to his African-American audience that Jesus may not 
have been as European-looking as Hollywood and other forms of  popular culture 
typically have portrayed him--white, blue-eyed, and fair-haired. He quotes a passage 
from the Old Testament book of Daniel that describes the Messiah, whose "feet were like 
burnished brass and his hair was like lamb's wool," and the New Testament book of 
Revelation, which similarly describes Jesus with feet "like bronze glowing in a furnace." 
Some church members, such as Charles Wiggins, say they were greatly affected by 
Reid's more raw, human portrait of Christ. "I had never heard a minister talk about Jesus 
who looked like me," says Wiggins, who joined in 1991. "I have found a home."</P>
<P>	Reid brings in guest lecturers to talk about African-American manhood. In a 
recent program, Na'im Akbar, a Florida State psychologist who is an expert on black 
male psychology, urged men at Bethel to learn from "the courage of Dr. King, the 
defiance of the honorable Elijah Muhammed, the economic strategy of Booker T. 
Washington, and the uncompromising integrity of Paul Robeson."</P>
<P>	Reid encourages the men to spiritually mold young males of the community. 
Through Project RAISE, they mentor teenagers from local schools. The men do not 
pressure them to join the church, but some do, attending Sunday services and Bible study 
with their mentors.</P>
<P>	After a small riot erupted at Booker T. Washington Junior High School just before 
Christmas last year, Bethel began a direct partnership with the school. To prevent a 
reoccurrence, Reid summoned 150 men to the school. They lined the street in front of the 
school and remained watchful for arsonists, gangs, and visiting troublemakers. At the 
request of the principal, the men recently returned to supervise the children in the 
morning and afternoon. The pupils' tranquillity prompted one teacher to comment that 
they were "acting like children again."</P>
<P>	Bethel assists men in running their households. In the class for new members, 
men are shown how to allocate their earnings. The 10-10-80 plan is a voluntary financial-
management procedure wherein 10 percent of the new member's yearly earnings is 
contributed to the church. Another 10 percent goes into a savings account, while the 
remainder is used for living expenses. </P>
<P>	Men who need additional help in managing their finances can attend classes on 
preparing tax returns, taught by a CPA who donates her time. Bethel has helped its 
members form food co-ops and investment clubs for pooling risk capital, purchasing 
bonds and mutual funds, and setting up funds for children's college tuition.</P>
<P>	Reid and members of the congregation also find jobs for men. Some have 
convictions for crack use, weapons possession, or other felonies, while others possess 
little or no high school or college education. But Reid and other officers at Bethel often 
vouch for the character of church members who might not look good on paper.</P>
<P>	Reid himself hires men as security guards for the church. The security team not 
only protects the church and its membership; it gives young men the opportunity to 
"soldier"--to wear a uniform, carry walkie-talkies, use one's physical strength, and 
become close friends with other men. Reid argues that these are the principal lures of 
being in a gang. So why not channel these male yearnings into structures that help build 
spiritual soldiers?</P>
<P>	The security guards are called the Mighty Men of God after the warriors who 
followed King David.  There is no better symbol than these men of Reid's teaching that 
Christianity is a manly as well as a womanly religion. The Mighty Men of God hold 
respected positions in the church, including the leader of Bible study, sexton, and security 
guard. They are responsible for the safety of the congregation and community, and 
combat random crime with periodic community patrolling. </P>
<P>	The M.M.O.G. play an important role in the safety of the children who attend 
Bethel's day school. They greet parents and students each morning as they arrive. During 
the day, they guard against intruders and drug sales. At the end of the day, a Mighty Man 
of God sees each child safely across the street.</P>
<P>	The regimen of the M.M.O.G. requires discipline. They meet for two hours every 
Tuesday and Saturday. Officers open the meetings with a personal inspection. They 
check for fresh haircuts, cleanshaven faces, and shined shoes. Members are not allowed 
to smoke or drink, so officers check for burns and yellow stains from nicotine or 
marijuana. M.M.O.G. maintain two uniforms: a suit and a security outfit for guarding the 
church.</P>
<P>	After prayer, they discuss local and international events. Drilling, marching, and 
commands soon fill the room. An inspirational message from Reid follows, and the group 
closes with hand-holding prayer.</P>
<P>	One member of the Mighty Men of God is Max Taylor. After joining Bethel at the 
age of 18, Taylor joined forces with local drug dealers and descended into the world of 
drugs, guns, and violence. He was responsible for preparing street corners for potential 
drug sales. "I cleaned street corners for drug dealers by any means necessary," says 
Taylor, 29. He reached a point, he says, when he realized that if he continued he would 
soon "be dead or behind bars for a long time if I was arrested."</P>
<P>	In 1992, Taylor rejoined the church with rejuvenated purpose. He walked through 
local housing complexes challenging drug dealers, his old friends, for territory. "I was 
extremely cold and ruthless," says Taylor, "but due to the power of Frank Reid and God, 
I have changed."</P>

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">S</FONT></B>peaking in Galesburg, Illinois, in January, President Clinton proposed a federally 
funded job-training program "to keep the American Dream alive in the 21st century." 
Cost to American taxpayers: $3.5 billion a year.</P>
<P>	If he had driven about an hour north, Clinton could have visited a college campus 
that proves his program is unnecessary. DeVry Institute of Technology, headquartered in 
Oakbrook, Illinois, makes a handsome profit by offering a first-rate technical education to 
working-class students. This little-known school shows how private businesses 
outperform government in providing good job training.</P>
<P>	On 13 campuses from Atlanta to Los Angeles, more than 15,000 students--35 
percent of whom are black or Latino--are earning their bachelor's of science degrees at 
DeVry. Ninety-four percent of the school's graduates land jobs in their fields of study 
within six months, with an average starting salary exceeding $24,000 a year.</P>
<P>	DeVry's alumni enjoy cutting-edge technical careers. At Hughes 
Communications, the nation's largest satellite company, 22 of the 30 engineers 
responsible for orbit maintenance are DeVry graduates. KLA Instruments, which designs 
quality-control systems for the manufacture of microchips, boasts that a fifth of its 1,000 
employees graduated from DeVry. All this at an annual cost per student of $2,500 less 
than similar state-run programs.</P>
<P>	And DeVry posted a $12-million profit on revenues of  $211 million last year to 
boot.</P>

<H3>Selling Job Opportunity</H3>
<P>	Since its founding in 1931 by Herman DeVry, the inventor of the portable 
motion-picture projector, the institute has specialized in technical training that leads to 
lucrative careers. DeVry, which grants accredited bachelor's degrees, is a for-profit 
venture whose stock trades on the NASDAQ exchange. In short, it sells job opportunity.</P>
<P>	Five years ago, when Zaneta Rizzo graduated from a small high school in rural 
Louisiana, she "knew less than nothing" about computers, thought DOS was pronounced 
"dose," and was terrified of automatic-teller machines.</P>
<P>	After two years of bouncing among jobs in fast-food restaurants, Rizzo enrolled at 
DeVry's Dallas campus. Recently she graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer 
information systems and is deciding between several job offers with computer-training 
firms. Before DeVry, Rizzo's salary peaked at $760 a month. Her current offers are for 
$25,000 a year--a 275 percent pay hike.</P>
<P>	When Jeri Gomez graduated from high school near Fresno, California, she 
enrolled in a local community college to study the health sciences and dance, but classes 
were constantly being canceled, so she enlisted in the army. After serving in Desert 
Storm, Gomez enrolled at DeVry's Pomona campus. She is now deciding among several 
job offers in software programming that pay more than $30,000 a year.</P>
<P>	Rizzo's and Gomez's stories are typical of DeVry students, many of whom field 
multiple job offers before their commencement. In fact, more than 95 percent of 
engineering and accounting majors are placed in their fields within six months of 
graduation--a success rate many of the nation's top schools never approach. How does 
DeVry do it? By running the college like a business.</P>
<P>	Unlike most colleges, DeVry receives no direct government money or alumni 
gifts. Nearly all revenues, and therefore profits, come from tuition. And DeVry has found 
that the best way to attract more students--over half of whom are the first in their 
families to attend college--is to secure high-paying jobs for graduates. Dennis Keller, 
DeVry's chief executive officer, says the school avoids anything that doesn't help 
students find careers.</P>
<P>	To this end, DeVry maintains an enormous placement system with more than 100 
staffers and a database of thousands of employers. While most other schools in the 
country assign placement officers to handle a broad spectrum of careers, DeVry has 
found that employers prefer to communicate with staffers who understand their particular 
needs. For this reason, each officer is trained in a specific field. For instance, Motorola--
which is based near DeVry's DuPage County campus in northern Illinois--works closely 
with staffers specializing in telecommunications. The payoff has been tremendous. When 
the electronics giant was planning a major expansion in Illinois, it consulted DeVry 
placement officials in advance to secure an educated labor force.</P>
<P>	DeVry also edges out the competition by studying labor trends, nationally as well 
as in the local markets near each campus. DeVry does not depend on the federal 
government's research, which is mostly retrospective; its researchers analyze new and 
growing fields. Using data from interviews with small and large employers, annual 
alumni surveys, and more than a dozen local-industry advisory panels, DeVry graduates 
can target rapidly emerging areas that traditional schools miss. Relying on data from the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics, for instance, most colleges until recently paid little attention to 
the cellular industry. DeVry officials, on the other hand, adjusted their 
telecommunications curriculum eight years ago to include this technology, and 
subsequently launched the careers of many graduates. "Health care is the next big one," 
says Norman Metz, a senior vice president at DeVry. "We are currently focusing on the 
medical-equipment industry that will handle the graying of America."</P>
<P>	Despite these unsurpassed placement results, the Clinton administration has 
frowned upon for-profit schools like DeVry, insisting the capitalist model leads to a 
useless education. At a 1993 press conference, Labor Secretary Robert Reich told 
journalists to be wary of these institutions, claiming that they mismatch thousands of 
students, and that there is no market for their degrees. Reich's warning was reiterated by 
the media, including the Cleveland Plain Dealer, which urged some for-profit schools to 
carry "warning labels" detailing prospective students' chances of finding employment 
after graduation. In fact, if many state schools had to publish such information, students 
would likely flock to DeVry.</P>

<H3>Blood, Sweat, and Jobs</H3>
<P>	Some for-profit trade schools, to be sure, are little more than diploma mills that 
give gullible students a shlock education. These schools usually go bankrupt when 
students catch on that their degree leads nowhere. But for an institution that is in business 
for the long haul, producing high-quality education for satisfied customers is essential to 
growth and profitability. Keller believes that every graduate represents the school: If an 
employer is unsatisfied with the quality of a single graduate's work, he is unlikely to hire 
from DeVry in the future. That would ultimately harm the bottom line.</P>
<P>	To that end, the school maintains a demanding curriculum that students call 
"brutal" and Keller calls "tough love." It is a no-frills, lots-of-sweat education. The 
rigorous process begins even before the classes start. Although the school accepts SAT 
and ACT test scores--applicants average at the 45th percentile--all students are required 
to take DeVry's admissions test in math. About 14 percent of the applicants fail the exam. 
Of the remaining students, about a quarter are admitted on the condition that they take 
remedial classes. Applicants are also required to take a College Board English test that 
determines their placement in humanities courses.</P>
<P>	From the first day, students follow the curriculum in lockstep. There are no 
electives. Students immediately choose a major from among five fields: electronics-
engineering technology, computer information systems, business operations, 
telecommunications management, or accounting. Each major requires eight or nine 
semesters, and can be completed in three years with summer school.</P>
<P>	Students and DeVry's senior management both prefer this inflexible system. Like 
a manufacturer, the school desires a reputation for providing a consistent "product"; 
students say they enjoy receiving firm direction. "This gets rid of a lot of the time-
wasting filler classes, like underwater basket-weaving, that people take elsewhere," 
recalls Rose Huening, a 1986 graduate.</P>

<H3>Heavy Lifting</H3>
<P>	Here there is no time to waste. Each term, DeVry students take at least four 
classes, plus labs, often exceeding a conventional courseload by four to six credit hours. 
The first-year courseload for computer information systems is typical: five computer-
science classes, four computer labs, two math courses and a math lab, two English 
courses with one writing lab, an economics course, a psychology course, and a business 
course. In addition, since many of the students have never before been pushed to work so 
hard, all freshmen enroll in a class on "success strategies," which teaches study skills and 
time-management techniques.</P>
<P>	George Dean, the vice president for educational planning, believes that many 
traditional colleges waste a great deal of energy embracing new teaching methods. DeVry 
doesn't mandate teaching methods--professors can choose whatever textbooks they 
want--but the level of academic expectations is set at the head office, and it's set high. 
"At the end of the course, the students have to be able to do x and y and z," Dean says. 
"If it works better at the Columbus campus to teach it z then y then x, it doesn't bother 
me."</P>
<P>	Dean is comfortable giving the professors ample latitude because they are 
required to gain real-world experience in their field, and so tend to prefer the most 
practical methods. Although some students earn money for tuition by assisting faculty 
members, they are prohibited from teaching, and are usually limited to grading papers.</P>
<P>	Unlike trade schools that teach specific skills (many of which become obsolete as 
technology changes), DeVry's curriculum focuses on teaching students how to reason. In 
many ways, DeVry offers the liberal-arts version of a technical education: students learn 
how to solve technical problems. They are drilled thoroughly on the basics, and required 
to spend countless hours in the lab to build an educational foundation. On exams, 
students are rarely asked straight-forward mathematical questions; instead, they are 
usually given detailed descriptions of real-world problems, including information they 
must recognize as extraneous. Dean claims that this education prepares students to 
operate efficiently in the business world. Furthermore, teachers will fail students whose 
lab reports are not written in proper English, regardless of the experiment's outcome. 
DeVry doesn't shortchange the humanities, because these non-technical abilities will be 
vital to the students' careers. Alumni routinely tell Dean that the technical skills get them 
hired and the reasoning skills get them promoted.</P>
<P>	 A student with a grade point average below a "C" is placed on academic 
probation, and prohibited from taking a relaxed schedule. If the student's g.p.a. remains 
below a "C" average the following semester, he or she is expelled. Every year, 20 percent 
of the student body flunks out. DeVry does not pamper its students en route to the 
diploma. "We have hard classes, but if that is not met with enough commitment to be 
successful, then it is detrimental to this company for that student to stay," Keller says. 
Huening's class is a perfect example: of the 325 students who started, only 94 graduated 
on time.</P> 
<P>	Just as auto manufacturers are constantly reviewing the efficiency of their cars, 
DeVry maintains strict quality control. About a decade ago, DeVry was reviewing each 
course every three years, which was considered swift compared to traditional schools. 
Now it rewrites each course at least once a year. During the summer term, faculty 
members visit hundreds of employers across the nation and find out what their needs will 
be in five to 10 years. Together with information offered by industry leaders on DeVry's 
dozen or so curriculum-advisory boards, the school sets new course requirements. For 
instance, a few years ago most computer-programming courses only taught a 
programming language called COBOL, but professors noted that firms near some of their 
campuses were switching from mainframes to desktop-based systems that require C 
language. After DeVry adjusted its curriculum, businesses responded by hiring more of 
its graduates. Although industry does not dictate DeVry's curriculum, the school must 
measure success and failure by its placement rate.</P>
<P>	The institute's educational audit is exhaustive. DeVry's central headquarters 
evaluates randomly selected writing samples from students on every campus twice a year 
in order to ensure that writing skills remain high. The institute also administers 
standardized tests in electronics to be certain that technical skills are not dropping. 
Finally, administrators also investigate courses with unusual grade distribution.</P>
<P>	The best evidence of the quality of DeVry's curriculum is the on-the-job success 
of its graduates. Bill Buglewicz, a senior manufacturing manager at KLA Instruments, 
recruits at six of the campuses every year. "DeVry students have a great work ethic, 
higher motivation, and initiative," Buglewicz says. "The courseload, in particular the 
exhaustive lab work, makes them wonderful thinkers and troubleshooters."</P> 
<P>	Gary Nuzzi, a 1983 graduate, says the lab work helped him and 1963 graduate 
Bill Blethen develop a revolutionary lighting system that won an Academy Award for 
technical achievement last year. The portable strobe light allows movie cameras to 
capture detail at high speed. "The education was, at times, very challenging, but very 
practical," Nuzzi adds.</P> 

<H3>The Bottom Line</H3>
<P>	Most remarkable, however, is that DeVry makes a profit. By defining its mission 
narrowly, the school has perfected its product and minimized waste. DeVry's cost-saving 
efforts are immediately evident. There are no ivy-laden academic halls or rolling greens. 
Rather, each DeVry campus holds its classes in an office building that is usually 
surrounded by a parking lot. In such a modern facility, little space is wasted, maintenance 
costs are moderate, and classrooms can accommodate professors from various 
departments. And the school runs three cycles of classes--morning, afternoon, and 
evening--to use the space more efficiently. The institute does not own any dormitories. 
Instead, DeVry leases housing near its campuses from local landlords and sublets it to the 
students at a modest profit.</P>
<P>	DeVry also holds down costs by maintaining a narrow academic focus. DeVry 
does not fund any sports teams or clubs that are not directly related to job placement; on 
some campuses, students independently run intramural leagues by securing outside 
sponsors. "We are not trying to be all things to all people," says Kathy Perdue, head of 
the accounting department at the Atlanta campus. "We figured out what we do best, 
concentrating on the academics to get jobs, not filling social needs."</P>
<P>	The school does not grant tenure to any of its professors, allowing it to respond 
quickly to fluctuating enrollments. Moreover, DeVry is not a research or publishing 
institution, so faculty members carry teaching loads two to three times that of other 
college professors. Finally, since the school operates at full capacity, even in the 
summers, professors are expected to work as they would in private industry: year-round.
<P>	DeVry maximizes tuition revenue by actively recruiting students through 
television and newspaper advertising, direct mail, and recruiters. A traveling sales force 
of 200 visits high schools and Army bases throughout North America, while another 100 
salespeople respond to applicants who call DeVry in response to advertising. DeVry's 
$15-million advertising campaign promotes its focus on careers, profiling graduates with 
senior positions in prominent companies like Coca-Cola.</P>
<P>	The individual cost-saving measures add up. The price tag of a DeVry education 
is $6,015 for two semesters, or $26,730 for the complete degree. By comparison, a four-
year degree at public, non-research universities in the same states where DeVry operates 
costs much more in tuition and taxpayer subsidies: $40,148 in California, for instance, 
and $35,440 in Georgia.</P>
<P>	As an accredited school, DeVry participates in all the same financial aid programs 
as public schools. DeVry's loan default rate is 17 percent--better than many for-profit 
trade schools and far below the government's intervention zone of 25 to 30 percent. 
Industry analysts note that the institute's job placement record and bachelor's degree 
program distinguishes it from trade schools.</P>
<P>	For-profit schools such as DeVry are a model for the future of university 
education. As more adults return to school later in life, they will find they prefer the no-
nonsense DeVry degree, which can be finished in three years. Currently the average age 
of DeVry students is 26. In addition, the number of high-school graduates is expected to 
keep rising through 2013. Combine that statistic with downsizing in the military, for-
profit education's top rival for high-school graduates, and DeVry seems to enjoy a rosy 
outlook. In fact, the results are already beginning to show: Enrollment was up 4 percent 
this year, and the company added two new campuses. "Frankly, the demand is growing 
quicker than our ability to supply it," says Norman Levine, DeVry's chief financial 
officer. And two other for-profit college-education companies announced initial public 
offerings this year.</P>
<P>	Despite DeVry's proven track record in securing jobs for working-class students, 
bureaucrats may prevent the school from expanding. In New York City, for example, the 
state's department of education has not yet approved DeVry's 1993 accreditation 
application. Once the department okays the school's academic standards, government 
analysts will determine DeVry's impact on established local schools. Every college in 
New York City will be invited to comment on DeVry's entrance into the market. If area 
schools fear DeVry will steal students from their tuition rolls, they can urge the 
department to reject the application. The Education Department's Bureau of Planning will 
also analyze whether the local job market can accommodate the future DeVry graduates. 
Department officials note that, due to understaffing, it normally takes several years for a 
school's 300-page application to be approved.</P>
<P>	Even skeptics of for-profit education concede that public schools and private non-
profits are unable to expand to meet the growing demand. Public universities would 
require greater tax subsidies to support a larger student base, and private non-profits 
would have to raise even more through alumni giving. "Time and time again, we have 
seen that the healthiest and best systems in the world involve private enterprise 
competing," says Keller. "We're the future of education."</P>

We must restore a balance between citizen and police responsibilities, [for] effective social control cannot possibly be achieved by hired hands alone.
</blockquote><p>

-- Herman Goldstein, <i>Policing a Free Society
</i><p>
	Americans live in fear. We live in the most criminally violent times in our nation's history. The level of street crime is between three and four times what it was in 1960, and the rate of violent crimes quadrupled between 1966 and 1990. People no longer feel safe walking to the corner store or letting their kids bike to the local park.
<p>	In healthy communities, individuals establish and enforce codes of conduct, both formal and informal. Litterers get a lecture. Speeders get yelled at. Unruly youths get a tongue-lashing. But in unhealthy communities, the fear of crime keeps people shut up in their homes (especially the elderly), cuts off commercial activity, alienates individuals from each other, and surrenders the streets to the very kind of disorderly activity that fuels crime in the first place. Community is eroded, and because individuals are afraid to maintain order, the community loses its lawful environment.
<p>	Until neighborhoods are safe again, they will not thrive economically or socially. Waiting for the government to make it all better is a losing strategy. People have to become more involved in ensuring their own security.
<p>	It is said that for every complex problem, there is a simple and elegant solution that is wrong. For crime, the simple answer is, "We need more cops and we need more prisons." Though extremely popular right now with politicians, this approach will ultimately do little to improve public safety. The best police force in the world cannot make safe a community in which people have no regard for the lives or property of others. Without question, swift and sure punishment of criminal activity is an important component of an effective crime policy. But the best defense against crime is not a thin, blue line, but a community of individuals respectful of others. 
<p>	There is a great deal that the government can and should do to improve public safety, but first it must recognize that it needs help. Restoring public safety demands a renewed partnership between the police and the community. Police must reacquaint themselves with the people in the communities they serve, and communities must recognize that the brunt of the task of policing a free society does not lie with the police, but with citizens themselves.
<p>
<b>Community Policing</b><p>
	From the time of America's founding, law enforcement has had a strong neighborhood foundation. In the early years of the Republic, male citizens in large U.S. cities were required to stand watch at night with no pay. Throughout most of America's history, in fact, citizens were expected to police their communities themselves -- at least part time -- as they went about their daily lives. The job of police officers was to support the community in keeping the peace.
<p>	Alexis de Tocqueville, who was particularly impressed by this, wrote, "In America, the means available to the authorities for the discovery of crimes and arrest of criminals are few. . . . Nevertheless, I doubt whether in any other country crime so seldom escapes punishment. . . . During my stay in the United States I have seen the inhabitants of a country where a serious crime had been committed spontaneously forming committees with the object of catching the criminal and handing him over to the courts. In Europe the criminal is a luckless man fighting to save his head from the authorities. In America he is an enemy of the human race and every human being is against him."
<p>	Direct community involvement doesn't mean vigilantes stringing up violators. Urban anthropologist Jane Jacobs explains, "The first thing to understand is that the public space -- the sidewalk and street peace -- of cities is not kept primarily by the police, necessary as police are. Rather, it is kept by an intricate, almost unconscious, network of voluntary controls and standards established and enforced by the people themselves."
<p>	Except in extremely small geographic areas, it is not economically possible to put a cop on every corner. No police department is large enough -- nor should it be -- to serve as an occupying army. A community must police itself. There is no way that New York City's 37,000 police officers can control the city's 7.5 million residents. The police are there to help. For much of America's history, this was understood.
<p>	In the 1960s, however, the public began to forget its role in controlling crime and grew increasingly dependent on the police. Police departments became more professionalized and shifted their primary mission from peacekeeping to crime fighting. Rather than regular beats, foot patrols, and informal pressure on the unruly, police forces increasingly used motorized patrols, radio dispatch, and rapid response as their main tools. In the terminology of television culture, the "Andy of Mayberry" model was replaced by the "One-Adam-Twelve" approach. 
<p>	Americans began to think of crimefighting as the job of police. The riots of the 1960s showed in violent detail how America's historic partnership between police and community had broken down. Police officers -- often in squad cars or behind desks at headquarters -- were spending more time with other officers than with citizens. The new policing methods had the effect of divorcing them from the community. The divorce was mutual: Many communities stopped policing themselves. <p>
	This alienation left everyone worse off. Americans are more dissatisfied with their police departments than ever before, and the police are straining under the weight of massive problems they are powerless to handle alone. 
<p>	Swift and sure punishment for criminals is important, but we shouldn't fool ourselves into thinking that the courts can make us safe, any more than the police can. We will never really get a hold on crime in America until we move back to a society where kids in trouble can be turned around before they get in more trouble and are sent away to prisons to become hardened criminals. "The total impacts [of public policy on crime] are not going to be that great in a free society," says James Q. Wilson. "A free society depends on the conscience and reputations of individuals and the social norms of communities to maintain order. That is what has collapsed in America."
<p>	To use an analogy from the manufacturing world, we can't afford to depend on an outside referee to detect and fix the defective products of our society; far better to create a system that isn't producing so many defects in the first place. From this perspective, product quality is no longer the exclusive responsibility of the inspectors in the quality department; rather, it's everyone's concern. Families come first, police and courts follow.
<p>	With its emphasis on crime prevention, community policing can be a part of the total picture. "We currently see ourselves as feeding the criminal-justice system," says police chief Daryl Stephens of St. Petersburg, Florida. "What if we saw our primary responsibility as starving it?"
<P>	At its heart, neighborhood policing recreates the partnership between the police and the community. In essence, the police tell the community, "We will help you do your job." Variations of the idea are being introduced all over the country, from Jacksonville to Madison to Seattle.
<p>	For community policing to work, the neighborhoods have to be willing to help themselves. Explains San Diego police officer Jim Coleman, "It is not the teacher's fault, it's not the police officer's fault, it's not the court's fault. The community has to recognize it has a responsibility for governing its own value standards. . . . People choose the way they want to live, and police can't remove that responsibility. The police can't come in and restore order if the community doesn't raise its own value standard."
<p>	San Diego has led the nation in embracing a partnership with neighborhood groups, citizen patrols, and volunteer "officers" (see <a href="#sandiego">sidebar</a>). To be sure, in America's toughest communities, where neighborhood control has been overrun by gangs, drug dealers, and a general sense of lawlessness, community policing of the San Diego model may not be enough. Community policing works best in the communities still controlled by law-abiding residents, not criminals. In the neighborhoods where criminals now hold sway, cops will be needed to help law-abiding citizens -- a majority in even the worst inner-city neighborhoods -- regain control and come out from behind their locked doors to augment the police presence. In the long run, however, community members themselves must take responsibility for making their neighborhoods unfriendly to criminals.
<p>
<b>Street Patrols
</b><p>	A key component of community policing is getting more cops back on the neighborhood beat. "Beat integrity," the practice of charging a small group of officers with responsibility for a small area, has hardly been seen since the 1950s. Patrols can be conducted on foot, on bike, in a car, or some combination of these. The beat system increases the connection between law-abiding citizens and the police and gives citizens opportunities to express their concerns. 
<p>	This sense of connection is evident in the community policing of officer Mike Elder, whose beat for the last two years has been a three-square-mile, lower-middle-class area on Indianapolis's south side. Elder's beat includes numerous vacant lots, some boarded-up buildings, and two of the city's worst public-housing projects. As in many cities, Indianapolis's urban sprawl makes it impractical for Elder to patrol his entire beat on foot. However, he makes up for this by spending a good part of each day walking around the housing projects and the neighborhood parks, checking in with store owners, and maintaining open office hours at his field office in the Clearstream housing project.<p>
	Elder is a reassuring presence to public-housing residents tired of living in fear. Before Elder set up shop at Clearstream, says one resident, "there would be gunfights in the project in the middle of the street in broad daylight." Another Clearstream resident, a single mother, says, "Before Mike came in, I wouldn't dare let my kids play outdoors because of the shootings and drug deals going down at all hours of the day and night. People living in projects want a normal life, too -- and we're getting there." After Elder started his beat, the number of service calls from the Clearstream projects to the police dropped from 1,500 in 1991 to 550 in 1993.<p>
	With an intense awareness of the neighborhood, community-based officers can stop crimes before they happen. The officer on the beat hears gossip from casual, informal contact with people. Elder knows most of the residents at his two housing projects. He can count on a dozen or so residents in each project to keep him informed of impending trouble by calling him on his beeper. If any drug dealing is taking place or any strangers are causing trouble, he'll know within a day.
<p>	Assigning officers to regular beats and emphasizing problem-solving can also prompt residents of troubled minority areas to look more favorably on the men and women in blue. Before Elder was assigned to their beat, residents of Clearstream didn't much trust the police. Residents only saw cops when they were responding to incidents, and viewed them as outsiders. With steady contact, Elder has built a relationship of trust. "If we tried to take Elder out of that beat, the residents would be marching on city hall within hours," jokes Michael Beaver, Indianapolis's director of public safety.
<p>	Most cops loathe beat patrols. Many police officers -- particularly those in middle management -- would prefer the safety of their desk jobs over venturing out onto the streets. Hitting the pavement is seen as a demotion by veteran cops, many of whom have worked hard to get off the beat and win an assignment to a specialty unit or to administrative work. 
<p>	Jersey City Mayor Bret Schundler learned the hard way that the opposition to community policing can be intense. When he was elected in 1992, just one cop worked foot patrol in Jersey City; Schundler wanted 300. The force hardly embraced the idea. "Comfortable jobs in all city departments were given as a reward for political service and loyalty," wrote Schundler in <i>Policy Review</i> (Summer 1994). "The patronage system has made assignments to street patrol intolerable."<p>
	The new mayor found himself battling with Jersey City's police union. When Schundler learned that two police officers spent their days delivering interoffice mail, he had them reassigned to street patrol. The police union filed a lawsuit to prevent the move, citing a contract clause that states: "Police work cannot be diminished except through contract negotiation." Like most people, Schundler can't understand how having officers patrol the street diminishes police work. He is fighting the suit.
<p>	Schundler cites union contracts -- supported by state arbitration rules -- as his biggest barrier to successful policing. "Our crime problem is not the result of our spending too little on policing," he says, "but rather of our getting too little policing for our money -- and the root cause of this problem is non-local government interference in police department management."
<p>
<b>Combating Disorder
</b>

<p>	Many urban areas are marked by evidence of physical decay: boarded-up buildings, vacant lots strewn with litter, and graffiti-covered walls. This sense of community despair creates an aura of lawlessness that encourages criminal behavior.
<p>	In a 1982 <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> article titled "Broken Windows," James Q. Wilson and George Kelling argued that disorder in a community, if left uncorrected, undercuts residents' own efforts to maintain their homes and neighborhoods and control unruly behavior. "If a window in a building is broken and left unrepaired," they wrote, "all the rest of the windows will soon be broken. . . . One unrepaired window is a signal that no one cares, so breaking more windows costs nothing. . . . Untended property becomes fair game for people out for fun or plunder."
<p>	If disorder goes unchecked, a vicious cycle begins. First, it kindles a fear of crime among residents, who respond by staying behind locked doors. Their involvement in the neighborhood declines; people begin to ignore rowdy and threatening behavior in public. They cease to exercise social regulation over little things like litter on the street, loitering strangers, or truant schoolchildren. When law-abiding eyes stop watching the streets, the social order breaks down and criminals move in.
<p>	"Stable neighborhoods can change in a few months to jungles," declare Wilson and Kelling. Disorder also can have dire economic consequences. Shoppers will shun an area they perceive as being "out of control." One study analyzing crime in 30 different areas found that the level of disorder of a neighborhood -- more than such factors as income level, resident turnover, or racial makeup -- was the best indicator of an area's lack of safety.
<p>	For decades, most big-city police departments have devoted little effort to combating disorder. By allowing an accumulation of small infractions, this neglect creates an environment that generates big infractions.
<p>	The community-policing movement is beginning to change this. Community policing emphasizes giving neighborhoods a greater say in determining police priorities, a surefire way to bringing issues of physical and social disorder to the top of the police agenda. An important part of a community patrol officer's job is enforcing a community's norms of tolerable behavior and order. Beat officers can't impose their personal rules on a community, but they can help a community maintain its own standards. "You have to be given the latitude to enforce the laws in different ways in different communities," says Indianapolis's Elder.
<p>	Although calls for order maintenance have historically been associated mostly with white middle- and upper-class neighborhoods, today some of the loudest voices are coming from poor minority communities. Says Ace Backus, a Milwaukee community organizer, "In the nice white communities don't be drunk on the street, don't be throwing down litter, the cops will stop you. In the middle of the black ghetto you can do that and the police will drive past. It's reverse discrimination."
<p>
<b>Problems, Not Symptoms 
</b>

<p>	Conventional policing is incident-driven: A citizen calls 911 to report a crime and then the police show up. Much of the time, all officers can do at this point is take a report. By reacting to crime rather than trying to prevent crime, police treat only the symptoms, not the root causes of problems. The key to improving New York's subway was the emphasis on preemptive problem solving, an example of what policing experts refer to as "problem-oriented policing" (see <a href="#subway">sidebar</a>).
<P>	Former San Diego Police Chief Bob Burgreen frames the issue this way: "Random patrol duty is little better than sleeping on duty."
<p>	In one large city, for example, a trucking company had 32 trailers burglarized in less than 18 months. A predictable routine developed: The owner would report the crime, the police would visit the yard, take a statement, and then wait for the next call from the owner. In desperation, the owner finally threatened to move his $13-million company out of the city unless something was done to stop the stream of break-ins. 
<p>	This prompted the police department to abandon business as usual. An outside consultant was brought in, and police soon determined that the physical layout of the trucking yard was encouraging the break-ins. The officers talked the owner into improving the lighting and raising the fence. Police then worked with other city agencies to erect a barricade between the truck yard and the adjacent vacant city property that was being used as an escape route. Problem solved.
<p>	Some level of problem-solving occurs in every police department, but it is typically done in a haphazard fashion. San Diego is alone in making problem-solving a focal point of each police officer's daily duties. Because it depends on identifying recurring patterns of disruptive activity, problem-oriented policing depends on good information. 
<p>	San Diego's crime analysis unit has set up a sophisticated computer tracking system that officers can tap into to get information on 60 types of problems, previous attempts to solve specific problems, and recurrent problems in different geographical areas. While problem-solving gives police officers some tools and the analytical framework for approaching community safety problems, community involvement is still a key component. "There are no long-term solutions to problems unless the community is involved," says Nancy McPherson, formerly the city's neighborhood-policing coordinator.
<p>	As already noted, people tend to equate the frequency of crime in an area with how the external environment "looks" and "feels." Visible disorder sends warning signals to our brains of impending danger. Disorder is a sign that the social mechanisms of control that characterize healthy neighborhoods have broken down, which in turn encourages lawlessness. To build safer neighborhoods, individuals and communities must exercise control of the physical environment in which they live. 
<p>
<b>Empowering Landlords
</b><p>

 	Police officers appreciate the role that landlords can play in keeping a neighborhood strong and safe. Historically, landlords in low-income, working-class neighborhoods adhered to the neighborhood's set of norms and refused to rent to individuals who, in the landlord's judgment, would not be a positive force in the neighborhood. This is because landlords, for economic reasons, desire essentially the same thing as neighbors do for social reasons: responsible and conscientious tenants who will respect the property of others.
<p>	In recent years, government regulations, civil-rights laws, and court rulings have made it almost impossible for landlords to turn away dubious renters or to evict destructive tenants from their apartments. The unintended consequence? Many working-class neighborhoods have been ripped apart by rental units that become crack houses.
<p>	Giving homeowners control of their property can help reduce crime. Almost by accident, the city of Milwaukee came up with a simple yet effective way for government to assist, instead of frustrate, landlords who want to maintain neighborhood norms. Marty Collins, a 15-year city employee, was looking for a way to improve the city's drug-addiction prevention program. Knowing that most drug dealing in Milwaukee occurred out of rental properties, Collins reasoned that the only people that really could control the situation are the landlords. 
<p>	Collins surveyed Milwaukee landlords and found that 70 percent of them reported having had destructive tenants at one time or another, yet virtually no landlords were using tenant screening techniques. Why not? "For fear of getting their butts sued," says Collins. Milwaukee's landlords were largely unaware that legal methods were available to enable them to discriminate against prospective tenants with destructive histories. By taking simple precautions, such as requiring favorable recommendations from previous owners, running a credit check, and visiting the current home of prospective renters, homeowners can eliminate the bad apples and help keep their neighborhoods safe.
<p>	Most landlords were also unaware of three Milwaukee companies that provide a listing of all tenants who have been previously evicted from rental properties. Milwaukee now informs all landlords how to be more discriminating.
<p>	While Milwaukee deserves credit for giving landlords the legal leverage they need to protect their property, the city sometimes goes too far in holding landlords responsible for the actions of their tenants. If police receive two complaints about drug dealing at a rented property, Milwaukee undercover police will attempt a drug buy. If successful, the city sends a notice to the landlord instructing him or her to take actions to stop the property from being used for drug dealing. If the problem persists, the city takes the landlord to court and can ask for the property to be forfeited. 
<p>	In essence, Milwaukee is asking the landlord to control their tenants' behavior or risk losing their property. Empowering landlords by allowing them to choose to whom they will and will not rent is one thing. Asking them to be responsible for the actions of their renters is quite another. Providing landlords with the legal assistance to screen and evict disruptive tenants is a step in the right direction, but we shouldn't expect landlords to act as chaperones for their tenants.
<p>	This trend toward relying on landlords to discipline tenants is ironic, for in many cases the most irresponsible landlord of all is the government. Much of the worst crime in America takes place in or around government housing projects. When Reuben Greenberg became the police chief of Charleston, South Carolina, in 1982, he thought it ludicrous that the government routinely rented units to the lowliest criminals of society. "No other landlord has to rent to child molesters, robbers, rapists, and arsonists. Why should people in public housing have to live with them?" asked Greenberg.
<p>	Working with city housing authorities, Greenberg set out to make the city's public housing the last place criminals would dare to set up shop. Prospective tenants were screened for criminal records. Tenants who engaged in illegal behavior were swiftly evicted. Through mostly common-sense measures that any sensible landlord would take, Charleston's public housing projects are now "the safest places to live in Charleston," says department spokesman Charles Francis.
<p>
<b>Closing off Streets</b>
<p>	Americans like to control their space. With their long driveways, high walls, and security systems, wealthier neighborhoods have never been known for their accessibility to outsiders. Wealthy city-dwellers have "doormen" that provide security for their apartment buildings. Middle-class suburbs have their own ways of discouraging strangers, including myriad cul-de-sacs and white picket fences. Residential community associations (RCAs) have taken the concept of designing for safety one step further. The typical RCA has walls, gates, cul-de-sacs, security systems, and an endless series of speed bumps. 
<p> 	In contrast, poor city neighborhoods are typically laid out in a grid format. "By allowing for lots of through traffic, grids compromise a neighborhood's integrity," says Judy Butler, the city of Houston's neighborhood coordinator. The grid format, while pleasing to city traffic engineers, makes neighborhoods susceptible to drive-by shootings and random through-traffic. 
<p> 	While some criticize the suburbs and RCAs for having a "fortress mentality," these communities provide residents with the security they desire, providing physical barriers that give people greater control over their living environment. These barriers not only keep strangers out, they mark the physical boundaries that define communities.
<p>	"Why not try to redesign the urban area to recapture the quality of life in the suburbs?" asks Oscar Newman, a city planner and architect. Newman is the country's leading expert on and proponent of creating "defensible space" in urban neighborhoods by closing off streets. Street closures, Newman has found, give residents greater control over the security of their neighborhood. Closures also broadcast a distinct message to potential criminals: This community is profoundly serious about deterring crime and anti-social behavior.
<p>	St. Louis has a long tradition of street closures. Beginning in the late 19th century, many streets in the wealthiest neighborhoods were deeded to residents instead of the city. Each of the streets was represented by an association that often also owned the sewers and water mains. At the time, St. Louis had shoddy public services, so the private streets were a way of attracting homebuyers by assuring them of reliable services such as water supply and street lighting.
<p>	In the 1950s, St. Louis was in decline. Crime was rising, property values were falling, and much of the middle class was fleeing to the safer and cleaner suburbs. Left behind were poorer residents, less likely to be homeowners and more likely to be transient. To stop the flight of middle-class homeowners out of the city, the city began to revive its private street program. Neighborhoods of all income levels were allowed and encouraged to petition the city to convert their public streets to private ownership. Many middle-class neighborhoods took the city's offer: They formed homeowner associations, put up gates, and assumed the costs and responsibilities of maintaining the streets themselves. 
<p>	Since the mid-1970s, more than 1,000 St. Louis streets have been closed off and privatized. By making these neighborhoods more distinct, street closures have made it easier to identify intruders and keep out unwanted visitors. The result: lower crime rates and higher property values compared to adjacent neighborhoods, according to Newman. It also has made the neighborhoods more cohesive, as they become safe places for children to play and conduits for social activity. "With traffic flow limited to an occasional moving car, the street has become an extension of the front yards of the abutting houses: an area where children play and adults can meet and socialize," writes Newman. Street closures can restore the balance between mobility for cars and livability for residents. 
<p>	Until recently, St. Louis was about the only city that made use of street closures in urban settings. But the increasing levels of crime, gang activity, and drive-by shootings throughout urban America are prompting other cities to experiment with street closures. Cities as diverse as Dallas, Chicago, Houston, Dayton, and Fort Lauderdale are aggressively closing off streets. Though St. Louis is unique in allowing a transfer of ownership to residents, these urban enclaves are proving an effective way for a community to regain control of its environment.
<p>	Dayton, Ohio, is home to one of the country's most ambitious street-closure experiments. Like many aging urban communities, Five Oaks, an integrated, lower-middle-class neighborhood in Dayton, found itself in decline. Homeowners were leaving, rental properties were poorly maintained, and drug dealers and prostitutes had set up shop. Located near the freeway, Five Oaks was an ideal location for crack houses. Experts predicted that within two years much of the neighborhood would be a disaster area.
<p>	In 1992, desperate neighborhood leaders turned to street closures. The city called in Oscar Newman to assist. A year later, 34 streets and 26 alleys were closed off in Five Oaks. Neighborhood residents divided Five Oaks into ten mini-neighborhoods to enable law-abiding residents to confront the problems in their immediate area.
<p>	Only a year after the streets were closed, substantial improvement was visible. Cut-through traffic, previously a big problem in the neighborhood, fell by two-thirds. Automobile accidents and traffic speed levels also declined dramatically. After dropping the previous two years, housing sales surged 55 percent, while the average purchase price of a home increased 15 percent. Violent crime was cut in half; overall crime plunged by 26 percent. Most importantly, Five Oaks residents felt much safer and in control of their immediate surroundings. "I have four little kids," said one neighborhood homeowner. "My kids can now play out in the yard. It's been a blessing for my family."
<p>
<b>Reclaiming Public Parks</b> 
<p>	Another problem of "space" in many cities (and some suburbs too) are local parks. Instead of serving as a place for kids to play and families to picnic, many parks have become gathering places for gangs and drug dealers. Instead of serving as a common area that knits the community together, many neighborhood parks are tearing communities apart. 
<p>	City officials refer to such parks as "orphan" parks because there is no real or perceived "ownership" of the park, and so no one takes care of it. City hall cannot possibly provide the same level of attention as the people who use the park every day. Local involvement is needed to make small parks a positive force in the neighborhood; only neighborhood residents, the people who use the park, can provide this. 
<p>	The inspiring story of San Antonio's Lee's Creek Park proves the point. "It's not every 41-year old that can leave a legacy for his children," says San Antonian Bill Lucas as he looks over the plans for Lee's Creek Park, a project that engrossed him for over a year. Lucas does not work for the city planning or recreation department -- he is a sales manager for Bekins Moving Systems. <p>
	Donated by the Lee family to the city, the park is located in a declining area of the city with swelling gang problems. After 10 years, it was still little more than a vacant lot. Then along came Bill Lucas and the local chapter of Optimist Club International, the 75-year-old "friends of youth" organization. In conjunction with around 35 neighborhood families, the Optimist Club transformed the weed-infested vacant lot into a thriving community parkwithout the aid of taxpayer money. Creating Lee's Creek Park was a true volunteer effort. A bridge over the creek was a gift from an Optimist Club member in memory of his wife. A running track was donated by a construction company. The sweat to clear the lot and plant the trees was contributed by neighborhood residents and even some nonresidents, including Mrs. Lee herself. "All we are doing is recreating in a small way neighborhood involvement like it was in the 1800s in America when people used to pitch in and help build their neighbors' houses and barns," says Lucas.<p>
	When the park was finished it was turned back over to the city, which agreed to maintain it. Lucas is confident the park will not fall victim to "orphan park" syndrome. "Our idea is for the neighbors to create ownership opportunities for themselves," he said. To do so, ownership committees were created and vested with control of certain blocked out sections of the park that they are responsible for beautifying and maintaining. The sense of ownership is critical. "If the park were given to us we wouldn't respect it," says Lucas. "We can see it in our own children. Make them earn it, and they own it." 
<p>	Turning over partial ownership or management of city parks to nonprofit groups and neighborhood associations is often the best way to ensure they remain a public asset. New York City's Neighborhood Open Space Coalition has assumed control of hundreds of abandoned lots and parks in this way, turning many dangerous eyesores into gardens. Nearly one-fourth of the city's nearly 1,500 public parks are now cared for by community associations under the Operation Green Thumb program.
<p>	Private groups usually have more success ensuring the park is in constant use, which is the key to keeping a park safe. The nonprofit Central Park Conservancy has raised more than $100 million for New York City's Central Park since its founding in 1980. It has taken over the care of trees, lawns, and plants and provides more than half of the park's operating costs. By 1989, 72 percent of Central Park users said the park felt safer after the conservancy got involved. Crime dropped 59 percent and robberies plummeted 73 percent. The drop in crime is attributed to the large increase in park activities put on by the conservancy. Good uses drove out the bad uses.
<p>
<b>Crisis Point</b> 
<p>	What is the future of public safety in America? One possibility is that we will continue to ask police to attempt the impossible: To create safe communities without the communities' help. Under this scenario, there will be more cops, more prisons -- and more crime.
<p>	The other possibility is more appealing. We can learn from America's most innovative public-safety models -- San Diego's problem-oriented, neighborhood policing; New York's subway-disorder reduction; Milwaukee's landlord empowerment policies; and Dayton's Five Oaks street closures -- to develop a new vision of policing America's neighborhoods and downtowns where police departments are closer to the communities they serve and citizens and communities take a more active role in protecting their safety. 
<p>	Under this scenario, America could see a future with fewer police and more security. We are fast approaching a crisis point in our country as crime and fear of crime paralyze our nation. How we respond will go a long way in determining what we become as a nation.

<a name="sandiego"></a><b>San Diego's Trailblazing Example (sidebar)</b>

<p>	Community policing demands that both police and citizens accept responsibilities. The community's contribution can take many forms, from setting up community watches and getting landlords to screen potential renters to cleaning up vacant lots, reporting suspicious behavior, and making sure teenagers don't roam the streets. If citizens don't take responsibility for the safety of their own community, the police can do little to help. 
<p>	San Diego's bold effort to involve citizens in public safety is unheard of among big cities. One San Diego official related this story: "I told a group of our officers that we were planning to have civilian volunteers take crime reports and collect evidence in cases of petty thefts. About three-quarters of them were nodding their heads, saying, 'Yeah, that makes sense.' If I tried that in New York or Chicago, they'd laugh me out of the room."
<p>	At San Diego's Eastern Division police headquarters, a group gathers around a conference table regularly to discuss better ways to patrol a certain neighborhood. But these blue-shirted peacekeepers aren't police officers. They are gray-haired volunteers of the Retired Senior Volunteer Patrol (RSVP), a major component of San Diego's commitment to neighborhood policing. 
<p>	"The partnership between the community and our department really works," says police captain Dan Berglund. In addition to 272 sworn officers, Berglund's division relies on 115 senior volunteers, 20 reserves, and 40 other resident volunteers. "Their influence in their own community has been extremely beneficial," says Berglund. 
<p>	Neighborhood policing requires a fundamental change in the department's operating philosophy. The police shift their attention from rapid response to putting more officers out on regular beats, where they can help the community solve public-safety problems. Neighborhood policing also entails much greater use of volunteers and soliciting the concerns of the citizens. In the language of Tom Peters, neighborhood policing means "getting close to the customer." 
<p>	San Diego uses volunteers in a wide range of nonconfrontational situations, such as towing cars, collecting evidence (including fingerprinting), and checking on the homes of absent neighbors. Instead of assigning a uniformed officer to spend, say, 45 minutes writing a report for a petty theft, San Diego uses volunteers trained at the police academy. This frees up officers for problems that require their special skills. "So long as volunteers are given meaningful work, and welcomed as a partner in the process, I will have an unlimited number of people in any community in this city to do that," Berglund said. 
<p>	The SDPD is unusual in its openness to citizen input and volunteer assistance. Admittedly, San Diego is blessed with many retirees. Although it's the sixth-largest city in America, San Diego's police force has a small-town feel. In most big cities, powerful police unions would oppose the use of community volunteers for police work. But San Diego welcomes them. 
<p>	This tolerant culture, which took years to develop, is due partly to Police Chief Jerry Sanders's deep commitment to community policing. San Diego is the first large city to adopt a department-wide approach to community policing. Nearly every SDPD police officer belongs to a team assigned to a discrete geographical area and charged with developing a close relationship with that neighborhood. "We are using persuasion rather than coercion to get people on board," says Nancy McPherson, who served as San Diego's neighborhood-policing coordinator before moving on to the Seattle police department.
<P>	Police departments customarily resist community policing because cops fear they will become social workers rather than crimefighters. The department dispelled that idea early on. After getting to know the residents on their beat, two San Diego cops trained in neighborhood problem-solving learned that a gang had taken over a particular section of an apartment complex. Through close relations with the building's law-abiding residents, they gathered the evidence needed to obtain search warrants. The bust that followed -- complete with SWAT teams and swarms of patrol cars -- put an end to the worry that neighborhood policing was soft on crime.

<a name="subway"></a><b>New York City's Subway (sidebar)</b><p>

	For years litter, graffiti, vagrants, and panhandlers had been turning New York City's subway into a vaguely sinister netherworld. The transit agency's first reaction to this problem was standard public-sector misjudgment: Add more "inputs." Additional police officers were assigned to patrol the transit system. The results were unimpressive, and riders remained frightened.
<p>	In the mid-1980s, David Gunn, the new transit authority president, decided to wage a war on the graffiti that covered nearly every square foot of every city subway car. Vast amounts of time and money had already been invested in increasing patrols and surveillance to reduce graffiti -- to no avail. Regardless of how many "taggers" were caught, there were always more. The overburdened courts never gave taggers more than stern lectures.<p>
	A deeper analysis of the graffiti problem revealed that taggers got a thrill from viewing their markings on future trips. Denied the satisfaction of beholding their "art," Gunn figured, many taggers would simply stop. He made the removal of graffiti from subway cars a top priority. The strategy worked. On May 12, 1989, five years after the launch of the Clean Car Program, the last of the graffiti-covered cars was removed from service. The Big Apple's notorious subway cars were among the cleanest in the world.<p>
	But removing the graffiti only solved part of the problem. New Yorkers still feared the disorderly people who always seemed to be hanging around the subway.
<p>	In 1990, the city hired William Bratton (now the city's police commissioner) as the new chief of transit police. "We understood early on that the problems of crime, disorder, and fare evasion were deeply interrelated," Bratton says, "and that therefore we would have to form a coherent strategy to deal with them." Bratton discovered that fare-jumpers not only cost the transit system more than $120 million a year in income, but also committed much of the crime and unruly behavior in the subway. He organized plainclothes "sweep teams" of four to six officers to catch fare-evaders. Says Bratton, "The sweeps produced some interesting results. One of every six fare-evaders we stopped either was carrying a weapon or was wanted for another crime on an outstanding warrant. That was an incredibly high statistic, and it made us realize that by fighting fare evasion, we were also making an impact on crime."
<p>	At the same time, Bratton set out to reduce the intimidating behavior of panhandlers and homeless people in the subways. Monthly ejections from the subway went from 2,000 to 16,000. In Bratton's first two years, the number of felonies in the subway fell 30 percent.

"The flat tax has some serious hurdles to overcome<br> 
before it can go from tax concept to tax code."</i><br>
-- J.D. Foster<br>
</center>
<hr>
<p>
<br>
The flat tax is the vanguard of tax reform, and for good reason. It is  
sound economically and easy to explain. It corrects some long-standing  
problems with the current tax system: complexity, high costs of  
administration and compliance, a depressing effect on the economy, and  
the unfairness of double taxation of income from capital. Its strengths  
have gained the flat tax many ardent fans and have brought it from an  
obscure oddity debated by economists to the forefront of the tax-policy  
debate.   
<p> 	  
Flat-tax advocates are nearly evangelistic in their drive to replace the  
current tax system, often as an integral part of their broader agenda to  
reshape government. They are also often unwilling to acknowledge that,  
despite its strengths, the flat tax also has some weaknesses and some  
serious obstacles to overcome before it can go from tax concept to tax  
code.   
<p>
<center>
<b><a name="Flat Tax">WHAT IS A FLAT TAX?</a></b><br>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
Any tax with a single tax rate could be considered a flat tax. A flat tax on  
labor and business income has been popularized by professors Robert E.  
Hall and Alvin Rabushka of the Hoover Institution. A flat tax on labor  
and business income is also embodied in legislative proposals advanced  
by Congressman Dick Armey, the majority leader in the House of  
Representatives, and Senator Arlen Specter, a presidential contender.  
These flat-tax proposals do not tax income from saving; they are  
therefore a form of consumption tax.  
<p> 	  
One of the great advantages of a flat tax is its neutrality. It taxes all forms  
of income only once and does so at a single rate. It taxes individuals'  
labor income at a single rate after allowing for personal exemptions, and  
it taxes business's net cash flow at the same rate that applies to  
individuals. The flat tax thus gives no relative advantage to any means of  
earning income. It favors neither capital nor labor, neither physical nor  
intellectual capital, neither manufacturing nor real estate. By contrast,  
under current law, the federal government uses the tax code to  
micromanage the economy, distorting the allocation of resources such as   
capital and labor, and thereby diminishing both the level of economic  
activity and the standard of living.  
<p>	  
The flat tax is also vastly simpler than the current system and thus  
virtually transparent to taxpayers -- that is, taxpayers need not become  
lawyers or CPAs to understand the intent and application of the tax  
system. Such transparency is important for individuals and businesses   
making economic decisions, for taxpayers' confidence in the fairness of  
the system, and for assuring taxpayers that the tax code will not become a  
tool of deliberate or accidental oppression by government. Much of the  
distrust bred by the federal tax system derives from a suspicion that it  
conceals traps to snare the unwary taxpayer and torture him with tax  
penalties, interest charges, tax liens, and possibly jail. The flat tax aims to  
be so simple and transparent that taxpayers could shelve their fear of the  
tax man.  
<p>	  
<b>Individuals under a flat tax.</b> Taxable income under a flat tax includes all  
wages and salary, and excludes all capital income such as dividends,  
interest, rental income, and capital gains. In addition, all nonwage forms  
of labor compensation are also excluded, such as employer-provided  
health insurance and subsidized parking. The tax on individuals,  
therefore, is essentially a payroll tax collected at the employee level.  
Most flat-tax proposals also allow the taxpayer to take personal  
exemptions and an additional exemption for each child in the household,  
effectively creating a zero tax rate for low-income filers. Under the   
Armey version of the flat tax, for example, a single filer is allowed a  
$13,100 exemption ($26,200 for married, filing jointly), and the plan  
allows for a $5,300 exemption per dependent. Having calculated taxable  
income net of the personal and child exemptions, a flat tax imposes a  
single tax rate on any remaining taxable income.  
<p>	  
The most striking feature of a flat tax is that it eliminates the special  
deductions, phase-outs, and credits in the federal income tax, ensuring  
that most individuals could calculate their tax liability easily -- hence the  
claims by flat-tax advocates that a tax return could be filed on a postcard.   
(In his plan, Specter retains the two most popular individual deductions,  
the home-mortgage interest and charitable deductions.)  
<p>	  
Simplicity for the individual is indeed one of the flat tax's best selling  
points. It is a point that is often oversold, however. Under the flat tax,  
there are two tax rates -- zero and approximately 20 percent. No doubt a  
reduction in the number of tax rates would make tax planning easier, but  
for most individuals the number of rates is irrelevant to their   
actual tax filing.  
<p>  
The simplification of the calculation of taxable income may also be  
oversold. For the approximately 80 million tax filers who take the  
standard deduction, the difference in tax computation between the flat tax  
and current law is that taxpayers today must add their interest, dividends,   
and capital gains to the tax base. They do not suffer the complexities of  
tax deductions because they opt for the standard deduction. For the  
approximately 32 million itemizers, the flat tax offers a clearly simpler  
system. But taxpayers who itemize do so voluntarily. They itemize   
because it lowers their tax liability. Thus, for itemizing taxpayers, the flat  
tax represents a loss of a preferred option in the way they file their taxes.  
Flat-tax advocates assume that most itemizing taxpayers would happily  
give up their credits and deductions in exchange for a simpler tax system.  
<p>	  
<b>Businesses under a flat tax.</b> The taxation of businesses under a flat tax  
makes even greater strides towards simplicity and neutrality. All  
businesses are treated the same; no distinction is made between  
partnerships, sole proprietorships, corporations, and any other business  
form. There is a single tax rate. And businesses are taxed on their net  
cash flow, not on their net income as under current law, thereby  
eliminating all the complications of attempting to match the timing of  
income and expenses.   
<p>	  
Under a flat tax, a business calculates its net cash flow for the year by  
totaling its receipts from all sources and subtracting all payments made  
to its employees and all payments made to other businesses for such  
things as plant and equipment and inventory. Businesses would deduct  
from income the full cost of their investments at the time of purchase,  
instead of stretching out these expenses according to complicated  
depreciation schedules. Employee fringe benefits would not be  
deductible. Nor would interest payments. The business then calculates its  
tax liability by applying a single tax rate to its net cash flow.  
<p>	  
<b>More than just a tax system.</b> In the current political environment, the flat  
tax is far more than an alternative tax system. The flat tax is also a strong  
political and philosophical statement about the role of tax policy in   
society, as seen most clearly in the strong preference of flat-tax advocates  
for a single tax rate for all taxpayers.   
<p>	  
For decades, the prevailing doctrine of "tax fairness" has dictated a highly  
progressive income-tax system. This means that, as a family's income  
rises, so do its average and marginal tax rates. Under current law,  
progressivity is achieved through a combination of deductions,  
exclusions, phase-outs, and rising tax rates imposed on a comprehensive  
measure of income. For example, in 1994 a married couple with $50,000  
in Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) and two children, taking the standard  
deduction, would pay 10.1 percent in federal income tax, whereas the  
same family with $100,000 in AGI would pay tax at an 18.5 percent rate.  
<p>	  
Under a flat 20 percent tax rate, a family would be subject to a 20 percent  
rate however high its labor income above a certain threshold. Having  
exempted lower-income taxpayers from the tax, many flat-tax advocates  
believe that proportionality, not progressivity, reflects the prevailing   
sense of fairness in America: Taxpayers should pay more tax as their  
incomes rise, but the amount of tax should not increase more than  
proportionally.  
<p>	  
Flat-tax proposals actually include two tax rates -- zero (by virtue of the  
personal exemptions) and about 20 percent. Some critics worry that the  
inclusion of a zero tax rate in the flat tax will maintain a large  
constituency for expanded government. The dangers are apparent in any   
general system of taxation that allows any but the poorest of the poor to  
escape paying at least some tax when they have taxable income. Taxes  
reflect a price we pay for government. Whenever someone escapes  
paying tax to finance government services, the direct cost of those  
services is zero and the amount of services demanded is high. Even a   
minimal tax of a few dollars a month would remind taxpayers                                                                   
that government services are not free.  
<p>	  
Many advocates of the flat tax are using the tax reform debate as a means  
of reshaping the political debate. By directly challenging the doctrine of  
tax progressivity in the federal tax system, they seek to change not only   
established ideas about desired tax burdens, but also the very notion of  
using the state as an instrument of incomes policy. Nor does the challenge  
stop there.   
<p>	  
Armey has included as part of his proposal the elimination of income-tax  
withholding. To many, withholding is simply a convenience whereby  
their employers subtract a certain amount from their paychecks each pay  
period based on an estimate of the total tax due for the year. To Armey  
and others, however, tax withholding disguises the true magnitude of the  
taxpayer's federal individual income-tax liability. By clouding the amount  
paid, they argue, taxpayers object less to the tax burden and to the  
amount of government spending that tax receipts make possible. By  
replacing the withholding mechanism with a monthly payment directly  
from the taxpayer to the Treasury, Armey believes he will bring powerful  
new forces to bear on the size of the tax burden and the size of  
government.  
<p>

<b><a name="Economic Benefits">ECONOMIC BENEFITS</a></b><br> 

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
Tax reform is a long and difficult process. Even the adoption of an ideal  
tax system creates transition costs for taxpayers, economic dislocation,  
and uncertainty. What benefits would justify these costs?  
<p>	  
<b>Saving, investment, and economic growth.</b> The net national savings rate  
in the U.S. has averaged 2.7 percent per year in the 1990s, less than one  
third the rate of the 1950s and 1960s. The savings rate is a prime  
determinant of the growth of incomes and wealth, so a low savings rate  
obviously does not bode well for future growth in standards of living.   
Certainly one contributing factor to the low savings rate is the high tax  
rate on saving and investment, due in part to the double taxation of  
income from capital. The flat tax would tax income from capital only  
once -- in the form of a tax on business income. Dividends, capital gains,  
interest payments, and other forms of capital income received by  
individuals would not be taxed, because they had already been taxed  
before. The flat tax would thereby reduce the tax burden on saving,  
which means, everything else held constant, that a flat tax would increase  
the rate of private saving.  
<p>	  
The flat tax may also reduce the tax burden on investment by eliminating  
the double taxation of corporate income and allowing businesses to  
deduct in full the cost of their plant and equipment purchases. However,  
the flat tax also appears to increase the overall tax burden of businesses   
(more on this later) so the net effect on investment incentives   
may be muted.   
<p>	  
The purpose of  encouraging saving and investment is, of course, to  
promote faster non-inflationary economic growth, boost real wages, and  
raise the nation's standard of living. At a recent conference sponsored by  
the Hoover Institution, Dale W. Jorgenson of Harvard presented a paper,   
"The Economic Impact of Fundamental Tax Reform," showing that the  
adoption of a consumption tax such as the flat tax would increase the  
discounted value of Americans' future income by about $1.3 trillion.  
<p>	  
Such increases certainly justify considering a change in tax systems.  
Projecting increases in economic activity is risky business, however,  
since the projections always depend on the underlying assumptions. At  
the same conference, Laurence J. Kotlikoff of Boston University  
presented results based on a different type of economic model indicating  
that a switch to a consumption tax would eventually increase real wages  
by 7 percent and GDP per capita by 8 percent. These two studies are  
impressive and, because they are based on different types of models,  
credibly imply that the economy would perform significantly better under  
a flat tax or another consumption tax than it would under the current  
income tax.	  
<p> 
It is important to recognize that accelerated economic growth also means  
accelerated tax collections for federal, state, and local governments.  
While congressional and Treasury Department analysts persist in  
ignoring these additional revenues, policymakers should understand that   
additional economic growth will mean additional tax revenue. Using  
Jorgenson's estimates of economic growth, in present-value terms a flat  
tax could eventually raise well over $200 billion in additional federal  
revenues and $150 billion in additional state and local revenues.  
<p>	  
<b>Compliance and administrative-cost savings.</b> According to an analysis by  
the Tax Foundation, the annual compliance costs associated with the  
federal personal and corporate income taxes are roughly $200 billion.  
These costs result from recordkeeping, tax filing, litigation and appeals,   
and so forth. In addition, the federal government spends almost $14  
billion administering the system, for a total annual cost of well over $800  
per person.   
<p>	  
Most compliance costs are borne by the business sector, and most of  
these costs can be attributed to those areas of the tax code dealing with  
the timing of income and expense, and with the taxation of foreign- 
source income. The flat tax is a tax on cash flow, and so at a stroke it  
eliminates the issue of timing. It also exempts from U.S. tax the foreign-  
source income of U.S. citizens, so it eliminates this compliance cost as  
well. And, at the individual level, most compliance costs arise in relation  
to capital income, which would no longer be taxed, so these costs, too,  
disappear. While every tax system imposes some administrative and   
compliance costs, there is good reason to believe the flat tax eventually  
would dramatically reduce this burden on the taxpayer and on the  
economy.  
<p>	  
<b>Thoughts of lower interest rates.</b> Proponents of the flat tax (and of many  
other tax reform proposals) often suggest that lower (nominal, after-tax)  
interest rates would ensue. If a flat tax raises saving levels as promised,  
the amount of capital available for domestic and foreign investment  
would increase and, if everything else were held constant, this could  
reduce interest rates under certain circumstances. Everything else is not  
held equal, however. 
<p>
The flat tax may also improve investment  
opportunities by reducing the marginal tax burden on capital income.  
Recall that the double taxation of corporate income would cease and   
that businesses could, for example, expense their capital purchases. Thus,  
the domestic demand for new investment in plant and equipment may  
also increase. At this point, we cannot say whether saving would increase  
more or less rapidly than investment. 
<p>
However, as the modern mantra  
runs, we live in a global economy, and no markets are more completely  
integrated than the capital markets. This means that, to the extent   
domestic saving exceeds the demands of the economy for capital, the  
excess saving finds its way overseas in search of more profitable  
investments. And, when domestic saving is insufficient to meet domestic  
investment demands, we import capital from abroad. Thus, whether  
domestic saving increases more rapidly than investment following a flat  
tax, or vice versa, no significant effect on after-tax interest rates should   
be anticipated on this score. 
<p>
Pre-tax interest rates are nevertheless sure to  
decline following a flat tax. Interest rates reflect many factors, including  
expected inflation, a real, after-tax required rate of  return, a degree of  
uncertainty and, possibly, a degree of credit-market tightness. Interest  
rates also reflect the taxes the interest income recipient must pay, which  
explains, for example, why there is a significant difference in the interest   
rates paid to taxable and tax-exempt bond holders. Under a flat tax,  
interest income is tax-exempt, so pre-tax interest rates would fall to about  
what are currently the rates paid on tax-exempt bonds. 
<p>
On the flip side,  
interest expense is not deductible under a flat tax, so there would be no  
net reduction in after-tax interest costs to borrowers and hence little or no  
stimulation of growth from lower interest rates.  
<p>
<center>  
<b><a name="Middle-Class">PROBLEM #1: A MIDDLE-CLASS TAX BURDEN</a></b><br>  

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	  
At the tax rates currently discussed, the flat tax appears to impose a  
higher share of the total federal tax burden on middle-class taxpayers and  
appears to raise their taxes in dollar terms as well. Each of these  
represents an enormous political problem for flat-tax advocates.  
<p>	  
A progressive rate structure means that upper-income taxpayers pay a  
higher proportion of their labor income in taxes than do all other  
taxpayers. A revenue-neutral flat tax would shift some of the tax burden  
on labor income from upper-income taxpayers onto the middle class. This  
shift of tax burden to the middle class is exacerbated by the exclusion   
of capital income from the tax base, which on a per-capita basis is a  
larger fraction of a typical upper-income individual's taxable income than  
that of a middle-income individual. Finally, large personal exemptions  
would remove millions of lower-income individuals from the tax rolls.   
Consequently, the middle class would be forced to bear a greater share  
yet of the total tax burden.  
<p>	  
Flat-tax advocates take the fairness issue head on by advocating only one  
(or two) tax rates. Where the flat tax really attempts to redefine tax  
fairness, however, is in the exclusion of capital income from the tax base.  
Justice and tax neutrality are both served by excluding capital income  
since the capital has already been subject to tax at least once, if not   
many times over. Nevertheless, a clear problem of perceptions must be  
admitted.  
<p>	  
Consider two families. The Joneses have a combined salary of $50,000 in  
wages and salary. Under the Armey plan with a 20 percent tax rate, this  
family of four would owe $3,700 in tax. Now consider the Smiths, who  
in retirement consume every dollar of their $1 million in dividend  
income. Under the flat tax, the Smiths owe no tax at all because capital  
income is excluded from the tax base. This is appropriate, because their  
dividend income was taxed at least once before the Smith family received  
it. But the perception would persist that a wealthy family is paying no tax.  
<p>	  
When capital income, which would not be subject to personal income tax,  
is considered along with wage 
<p>
<center>
<hr width="50%">
<Font Size="2"><b>Less progressive.</b>  One potential criticism of the flat tax is that high-income groups appear to pay a lower percentage of their personal income in taxes than middle-income groups.  This occurs because higher-income groups receive a greater share of their earnings from capital income, which is exempt under the flat tax.  <b>Source:</b>  The Tax Foundation.<br>

<p>
income, average tax rates for higher- 
income groups are lower than for middle-income groups under the  
individual side of the flat tax (see chart below). And so this may be the  
Achilles' heel of a flat tax: Are the majority of the American people  
willing to define tax fairness entirely in terms of labor income? Can tax  
fairness be defined in such a way that individuals who consume 
significant  
amounts of capital income would be allowed to pay little or no tax? If so,  
then the flat tax has overcome its biggest hurdle. If not, then a flat tax  
solely on labor income probably cannot succeed.   
<p>	  
Flat-tax advocates can overcome this hurdle through careful analysis. As  
we shall soon see, a flat tax will shift the incidence of taxation sharply  
from individuals to business. While individuals will pay no tax on their  
own capital income, the businesses from which they earn capital income   
will pay higher taxes. The crucial point is this: The burden of business  
taxes is ultimately borne not by the entities that pay them but, one way or  
another, by workers (in the form of lower compensation) or by business  
owners (in the form of lower profits), who tend to belong to the higher- 
income group.  
<p>	  
The chart on page 29 shows the average tax paid at different income  
levels under a flat tax when business taxes are imputed to individuals.  
Following procedures adopted by the Congressional Budget Office, the  
Tax Foundation assumes that half of the business tax is ultimately paid by   
business owners and half is paid through reduced labor compensation.  
The imputation of the business tax shows a disproportionate share of the  
business-tax burden falling on upper-income taxpayers.  
<p>	  
The chart shows the distribution of the tax burden when we account for  
both the individual and business taxes under current law, under the  
Armey proposal with a 20 percent rate (which Armey argues reduces  
revenues by $40 billion annually relative to current law), and under a  
revenue-neutral version of the Armey proposal which the Tax   
Foundation calculates would require a 21.1 percent rate. (The lower rate  
claimed by Armey probably arises because his plan, by design, loses  
revenue relative to current law.) As the chart shows, when income is  
measured comprehensively and both labor and business income are taxed,  
the flat tax imposes a remarkably proportional tax burden (once  
individuals earn enough to pay tax).   
<p>	  
Analysis of the likely distribution of the tax burden also reveals some  
disturbing news for flat-tax advocates, however: At the proposed rates,  
the flat tax would impose a tax increase on middle-income taxpayers.  
This obviously creates an enormous political problem for flat-tax  
proponents. Many middle-income voters may object to a significant tax   
increase in exchange for a simpler tax system and the   
promise of a stronger economy. One solution is, of course, to   
cut spending to reduce the tax rate below 17 percent. This is   
Armey's solution. As noted below, however, this is far easier   
said than done.   
<p>

<b><a name="Business End">PROBLEM #2:  THE BUSINESS END</a></b><br>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	 
Successful tax reform must always originate in the barber shops and  
bingo parlors outside the Washington Beltway. Without sustained popular  
support, the enormous effort of fundamental reform will fall short. A new  
tax principle, having gained the necessary popular support, must then  
gain the support, or at least the acquiescence, of the bulk of the business  
community. Tax reform that fails employers will fail their employees as  
well.   
<p>	 
The simplicity of the flat tax would eventually benefit the business sector  
by reducing both compliance costs and the uncertainty that a complex tax  
code imposes on business decisions. On the other hand, the business  
sector, at least under the Armey flat tax, appears to bear a much higher  
share of the total federal tax burden. Currently, the business sector bears  
about 31 percent of the burden. Under the Armey flat tax, according to  
Tax Foundation analysis, the business sector would bear about 50 percent  
of the burden, an increase of about two thirds. In other words, under the  
Armey plan about 19 percent of the total tax collection is shifted from  
individuals to businesses. The higher burden on businesses is due to  such  
things as the loss of the deductions for state and local taxes and for  
employee fringe benefits. (Some of this burden would eventually be  
shifted back to individuals, as companies convert fringe benefits into  
labor income on which individuals would have to pay taxes.)  
<p> 	 
It is, of course, true that businesses only collect taxes; individuals  
ultimately bear the tax burden. Nevertheless, business leaders are very  
aware of their average tax rate and the after-tax earnings they report to  
their owners. The business community in the aggregate suffered a hefty  
tax increase as part of the 1986 Tax Reform Act, though much smaller  
than that apparent in the Armey flat tax. Many of today's CEOs and chief  
financial officers were tax directors and tax vice-presidents in 1986, and  
they remember how a laudatory tax principle eventually boomeranged to  
their firms' detriment. Business owners are likely to resist any tax  
proposal that would raise their effective tax rates, even if it promised to  
accelerate economic growth.   
<p>	 
At the very least, successful tax reform should probably avoid increasing  
the net tax burden on America's businesses. Even so, such reform would  
still create lists of winners, losers, and uncertains. Traditionally, the  
uncertains oppose tax reform while projected losers fight harder against   
their losses than winners will fight for their gains, so even a revenue- 
neutral tax reform between individuals and businesses is likely to create  
important opposition to a flat tax.

<b><a name="Other Obstacles">OTHER OBSTACLES</a></b><br>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	 
Aside from the basic tax-burden questions, there is a long list of obstacles  
for the flat tax to overcome:  
<p>	 
<b>Charitable contributions.</b> Under the current income tax, itemizing  
taxpayers can deduct amounts contributed to charitable organizations  
(churches, certain civic groups, educational institutions, research  
organizations, etc.) in calculating their taxable income. The charitable  
deduction is defended by politically powerful organizations from Harvard   
University and the Boy Scouts to the Catholic Church and the American  
Association of Retired Persons. For itemizers, contributions to these  
groups under current law are made in pre-tax dollars. Under a flat tax, the  
tax incentive to make a contribution is eliminated, so all such  
contributions must be made in after-tax dollars. Some decline in  
charitable giving should be expected for virtually all charities, at least  
initially, following the enactment of the tax. Over the long run, of   
course, the higher incomes and capital accumulation produced by a flat  
tax will lead to increases in giving that will offset the initial decline. Even  
so, charitable groups, recognizing the immediate threat to their funding,  
will surely lobby to keep the charitable deduction in the tax base.   
<p>	 
<b>Tax receipts under the Armey plan.</b> Flat-tax advocates also often strongly  
favor a smaller federal government, and the arguments in favor of one  
occasionally intermingle with arguments in favor of the other. However,  
a flat tax implies little or nothing about the desired level of government   
spending or taxation. It is a revenue system capable of raising a wide  
range of tax revenue levels depending on the tax rate chosen. Without  
question, a flat tax would be easier to enact and implement if the federal  
government
<p>

<Font Size="2"><b>More proportional.</b>  When income is defined comprehensively to include business income, taxes on higher-income groups remain remarkably proportional.  That's because the flat tax appears to shift some of the overall tax burden to businesses, whose taxes are borne disproportionately by (higher-income) business owners.  <b>Source:</b>  The Tax Foundation.<br>

<p>
needed less revenue. General tax cuts would help avoid the  
contest of winners and losers that typically impede tax reforms. Also,   
all tax reforms impose adjustment costs on the economy as resources are  
re-allocated and re-priced. These costs would be easier to bear in the  
context of reduced overall tax burdens.   
<p>	 
The initial tax rate under the Armey flat tax is set at 20 percent, which  
Armey argues would reduce federal collections by about $40 billion  
annually; the tax rate drops two years later to 17 percent. The Armey plan  
argues forcefully for funding these cuts with spending cuts. Over the   
traditional five-year budget window, setting the flat rate at 20 percent  
means cutting spending by about $250 billion. To put it in perspective,  
the budget passed by the House Budget Committee in May to eliminate  
the deficit called for spending cuts of $459 billion over five years.   
<p>	 
The spending cuts needed to fund the Armey flat tax would be in addition  
to those in the Fiscal Year 1996 Budget Resolution. For advocates of a  
dramatically smaller government, a call for additional spending cuts to  
fund flat-tax reform is more of an opportunity than a problem. But,   
given the difficulties of achieving the cuts in the budget resolution, it is  
fair to question whether additional cuts of this size are possible. At this  
stage, the possible responses of the flat-tax advocates would seem to be  
either that the revenue scoring must include revenue gains from projected   
accelerated economic growth or that the extra spending cuts are possible  
and desirable.  
<p>	 
<b>The flat tax and the health care debate.</b> Under a flat tax, the employer  
would no longer be allowed to deduct the cost of employee health- 
insurance coverage. This arrangement eliminates a serious distortion in  
the current system -- the tax advantage of employer-provided health   
insurance. Denying employers the ability to deduct the cost of health  
insurance will discourage them from continuing to provide insurance as a  
benefit. Instead, they are likely to raise wage and salary income, and  
families would have to buy their own insurance. Eventually, such a  
family-based system should work as well for health insurance as it does  
for any other form of insurance.  
<p>	 
At the outset, the flat tax could expose individuals to much higher  
insurance premiums if they no longer receive the benefit of group rates.  
This is a serious transition issue for the flat tax for which no good  
solution seems available. One could, for example, require employers to  
continue to offer insurance for a specified period following tax reform.   
Another solution would be to require insurers to continue coverage  
indefinitely for previously covered employees, and set insurance  
premiums at the levels applicable to the employee's previous group.   
<p> 
<b>Double taxation and state and local taxes.</b> Alongside tax neutrality,  
avoiding double taxation between tax jurisdictions is a fundamental goal  
of good tax policy. Double taxation occurs when an individual pays tax to  
one entity and must pay tax to another jurisdiction on the tax paid to the  
first. For example, when a taxpayer pays $100 in state tax ad the federal  
government includes that $100 in the taxpayer's income for federal  
income-tax purposes, then the individual is effectively paying tax on  
taxes received by the state. This is unfair to the taxpayer.  
<p>	 
With the exception of sales taxes, state and local taxes are currently  
deductible for itemizers at the individual level and for all corporate  
taxpayers, thereby avoiding double taxation. This deduction is typically  
eliminated under a flat tax, thereby assuring double taxation and bringing  
new pressures on state and local government finances. A flat tax would  
disproportionately raise the costs of living and doing business in high-tax  
states and localities. Recognizing the threat, state and local government  
officials would strenuously oppose this change in policy. On the other  
hand, many advocates of smaller government would applaud the  
additional fiscal pressures on government under a flat tax, even at the  
price of a measure of unfairness.   
<p>	 
<b>Transition issues.</b> They say the Devil is in the details, and that is certainly  
true of tax reform. But the Devil is in his Heaven when dealing with  
transition issues. A complicated economy subject to a complex tax  
system produces extraordinary business and contractual arrangements. A   
simpler tax system may eliminate the need for some of these  
complications going forward, but the old arrangements would still be in  
force and must be addressed. The limited space available here precludes a  
discussion of these issues, but they would include the depreciation of  
previously purchased plant and equipment, the taxation of deferred  
foreign-source income, the use of accumulated Alternative Minimum Tax   
Credits, etc.   
<p>
<center>
<b><a name="Possibility Awaits">A GREATER POSSIBILITY AWAITS</a></b><br>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	 
Tax reform, and the flat tax in particular, is intended to replace a very  
poor tax system with a simpler tax promising better economic  
performance. Once such a system has been designed, the level of  
collections demanded of it is a matter of choosing the tax rate.  
<p>	 
The federal government, however, collects a wide variety of other taxes,  
including sales taxes on gasoline and other items, payroll taxes, and user  
fees which should also be considered for replacement. For example,  
federal sales taxes are highly distortionary, require separate and costly  
collection mechanisms, and are generally thought to be regressive.   
<p>	 
Once a new tax base has been established, strong arguments should be  
required in favor of keeping any of the other existing components of the  
federal tax system. Failing such arguments, we should give serious  
consideration to replacing these other, inferior tax systems, making up the   
revenue with a higher flat tax rate. A flat-tax rate of between 38 and 40  
percent would likely raise enough revenue to allow the elimination of the  
payroll tax and all other federal taxes.  
<p>	 
The nation faces many serious economic problems, including Social  
Security and Medicare systems racing towards bankruptcy, a costly  
private health-care system, and high regulatory burdens. So tax reform  
has some steep competition for national attention. It is all the more   
impressive, therefore, that the flat tax's advocates have succeeded in  
moving tax reform to the forefront so quickly. Replacing the current tax  
system with something significantly better, whether a flat tax or an  
alternative, will not solve all our economic ills. But the more rapid  
economic growth it promises may make finding the other solutions a   
little easier.

<h3><a name="Addendum">Taking on the Mortgage-Interest Deduction</a></h3>
<hr width="60%">

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
If the flat tax is to gain the support of the public, its advocates will have to confront defenders of existing 
deductions head on. The most important deduction for most itemizing individuals is the mortgage-interest deduction. Many observers defend this deduction as encouraging home ownership; some argue that it is necessary for tax neutrality. Under the Armey flat tax, the deduction disappears.
<p>
Many groups believe they would be injured by the elimination of the mortgage-interest deduction. They 
argue, for example, that the loss of the deduction would raise the cost of home ownership, reduce the value of existing homes, and generally cripple the home building industry. In combination, the realtors, the home-builders, the mortgage lenders, and the construction-workers unions make a very powerful lobby, particularly when millions of homeowners are added to the mix.
<p>
The concerns of the mortgage-interest deduction lobby are generally misplaced. As noted above in the 
discussion on interest rates, the tax a saver must pay on interest income is recovered by demanding a higher interest rate. Since a flat tax does not tax individual interest income, pretax market interest rates will fall significantly, just as tax-exempt bonds now pay interest more than 2 percentage points below the rate paid to taxable bonds. Mortgage lenders, seeing their cost of funds fall, will be driven by competition to pass these savings along to mortgage borrowers in the form of lower mortgage rates.
<p>
In after-tax terms, the elimination of the home-mortgage deduction will neither raise nor lower the interest
cost of home-mortgage borrowing. Therefore, that reform should have no affect on the demand for homes or on property values.
<p>
The benefit of lower mortgage rates does not extend to current mortgage holders unless they refinance their mortgages. Thus a legitimate problem is the treatment of mortgages underwritten prior to the enactment of a flat tax. Most of these borrowers assumed they would be able to deduct mortgage interest paid, thereby producing a lower after-tax interest rate and a lower tax burden. Since an estimated 27.4 million taxpayers will claim this deduction in 1995 to the tune of about $238 billion, a potentially huge bloc of voters stand ready to join the ranks of flat-tax opponents. While many or most may be able-to refinance, refinancing may be impractical for many current mortgage holders if, for example, they expect to sell the property in the following year or two.
<p>
A fair (and politically sensible) solution to the old mortgages problem might be to allow homeowners to 
deduct the interest on mortgages taken before the flat tax is enacted. While fairness demands 
grandfathering pre-existing mortgages, the consequence would be a slightly more complicated tax system and a short and medium-term erosion of the tax base, which would have to be offset with initially higher tax rates.
<p>
A loss in the battle over the mortgage interest deduction would not derail the essential effort to develop a flatter, simpler, more saver-friendly tax system. It would, however, require a much higher tax rate initially, and it would make it harder to repeal other popular deductions, like that for charitable contributions.

<h3>The Environmental Benefits of Capitalism</h3>

<b>Policy Review</b><br>

<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</I></center>

<p>

	Profit and the environment are supposed to be enemies. Remember that the next time you visit Yellowstone National Park, one of the crown jewels of the national park system and a popular attraction for tourists, backpackers, and amateur botanists, zoologists, and geologists. Yellowstone boasts some of the most breathtaking sights in all of North America. It also boasts an interesting capitalistic pedigree.
<p>	It was the Northern Pacific Railroad, a private corporation, that funded early expeditions to the Yellowstone region and helped establish the Yellowstone National Park in 1872. "Because it provided the main form of transportation to the region," report economists Terry Anderson and Donald Leal, "the railroad could profit from preservation of this scenic wonder and therefore had an incentive to preserve it." Many other Western parks were promoted and protected by private railroad and development companies for the same reason.
<p>	More recently, some private timber companies have found that, by exploring other uses of the forest lands they own, they can increase their profits. In International Paper's commercial forests in Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas, company biologist Tom Bourland implemented a fee-based recreation program to make money from not harvesting trees. His program charged hunters for access and leased small tracts of land on which families could park their motor homes and enjoy the woods. After three years, International Paper saw its revenues from the program triple, constituting 25 percent of its total profits from the area. Since this valuable use of private land relied on beauty and diverse wildlife rather than ease of harvest, the company had an incentive to preserve habitat for white-tailed deer, wild turkey, fox, squirrel, quail, bald eagles, and red-cockaded woodpeckers.
<p>	Deseret Land and Livestock pursued a similar strategy when its cattle ranch fell on hard times. The firm's managers decided to invest in wildlife habitat, charging hunters for the right to hunt elk and other animals. Herds of elk and mule deer -- now a valuable commodity -- on Deseret land actually grew, and the company thrived. The 1,289-square-mile King Ranch in south Texas now makes 60 percent of its income from business activities other than cattle -- including revenues from hunters and nature lovers.
<p>	Within the corporate social-responsibility movement, there is no more important issue than environmentalism. Often, the call for corporate responsibility and the exhortation to "save the planet" from a host of environmental problems seem virtually to be the same thing. The firms most often honored for their responsibility -- such as the Body Shop, Patagonia, and Ben and Jerry's -- usually exhibit some sort of (highly publicized) commitment to environmental goals. "Corporations, because they are the dominant institution on the planet, must squarely face the social and environmental problems that afflict humankind," states Paul Hawken, a founder of Smith and Hawken catalog company. "How," he asks, "does business face the prospect that creating a profitable, growing company requires an intolerable abuse of the natural world?"
<p>	The notion that profit and ecology must be at loggerheads, and that businesses must place environmental obligations above economic ones, is but one viewpoint among social-responsibility advocates. A different notion, championed most famously by Vice President Al Gore, is that doing business in an "environmentally friendly" way is also to increase the profitability of firms. "We can prosper," he wrote in his book <i>Earth in the Balance</i>, "by leading the environmental revolution and producing for the world marketplace the new products and technologies that foster economic progress without environmental destruction."
<p>	When you think through the complex issue of corporate environmental responsibility, however, neither Hawken's "win-lose" proposition nor Gore's "win-win" proposition ultimately satisfies. Both have merit, but ignore the most important characteristic of environmental ethics: uncertainty. For Hawken, the fact that the world is headed for catastrophe is scarcely debatable. Only if you buy his apocalyptic predictions about overpopulation, global climate change, deforestation, and depletion of natural resources does his recipe for a low-growth, heavily regulated, "sustainable" economy make any sense. 
<p>	In Gore's case, he makes no conceptual distinction between profiting from innovation and profiting from regulation. Throughout much of his book, he argues that governments should make environmental regulations more strict, repeating many of the doomsday scenarios of which Hawken is fond, but then concludes that American firms can make money designing technologies to meet the higher standards. This is no doubt true, but it ignores the firms -- actually shareholders, workers, and consumers -- who clearly lose when regulatory standards change.
<p>	Innovative compliance might reduce the cost of regulation, but it doesn't eliminate it. For example, a state might decide to require that only cars fueled by electric batteries will be sold within its borders. This might well lead to the development of better, cheaper electric cars, as firms struggle to capture as much as they can of the new automobile market, but that's not the only consideration. Under the mandate, consumers would lose access to the products they prefer. Some individuals and businesses would leave the state entirely. The resulting costs and dislocations would far exceed the environmental benefits of lower auto emissions, which are questionable in any event. (The generation of electricity for the cars, for example, would still produce some air or water pollution.)
<p>	Gore, in other words, is essentially arguing that it's worth building a better mousetrap, regardless of how many mice you think may be actually running around in your house. But what if the more pressing problem you face in your home is termite infestation? Then the mousetrap doesn't help you.
<p>	In a different sense, though, Gore is on exactly the right track in charting a course for corporate responsibility on environmental matters. Corporations are not governments. They are not charities. They are unlikely to be successful if they pursue the same sorts of strategies that governments and philanthropic organizations use to protect wildlife habitats and promote clean air and water, such as setting and enforcing standards of health and safety for the public. Corporate America's unique contribution to solving real environmental problems will come from innovation -- finding new ways to produce goods and services, package and deliver them to consumers, and dispose of or recycle the wastes generated by their own production or by consumption.
<p>
<b>Pollution and Profits</b>
<p>	Corporate innovation in the pollution-reduction area is already widespread. The "Pollution Prevention Pays" program begun by Minnesota-based 3M in 1975 has reduced the company's emissions by more than a billion pounds while saving $500 million.
<p>	"At our company, we view a good portion of the environmental problems most talked about today as symptoms of an underlying disease," said 3M chairman Livio D. DeSimone. "That disease is waste -- the wasteful and inefficient utilization of our resources."<p>
	Similarly, Dow Chemical and Westinghouse have implemented waste reduction strategies that have saved millions of dollars since the mid-1980s. One Westinghouse plant in Puerto Rico reduced "dragout" -- the contamination accidentally spread as chemicals flow from one tank to another -- by 75 percent by shaking the tank to remove solids before releasing the chemical on to the next tank. Chevron saved $10 million in waste disposal costs and reduced hazardous waste by 60 percent in the first three years of its "Save Money and Reduce Toxics" (SMART) program.<p>
	Over the past few decades, timber companies have found that "sustainable-yield forestry" -- including preventing fires, spraying for pests, and quickly replanting harvested areas -- produces less waste and higher profits while also preserving habitat for wildlife. In addition, they have reformed their manufacturing processes, for example by using leftovers from lumbering to make paper pulp and to generate steam for paper mills. International Paper saved about $100 million in disposal expenses between 1988 and 1995 by recycling and reusing its manufacturing wastes.
<p>To be successful both at saving money and "saving the planet," however, corporate waste-reduction programs can't be based on rhetoric or ideology or guesswork about what is or isn't environmentally friendly. One of the greatest myths propagated by the corporate social-responsibility movement is that the most environmentally friendly way to produce goods and services is already known, and that all corporate executives need do is embrace the environmental ethic. This is untrue. Often, the consequences of corporate decisions are ambiguous in terms of overall affect on species, health, air, and water quality, and the global environment. In some cases, the very practices advocated by environmental activists harm the environment.
<p>	Consider the historical example of the automobile. Given the attention paid to air pollution and oil spills, one might believe that the environment would be better off if cars had never been invented and mass-produced for widespread use. But such a judgment would be hasty. Although cars created a new source of air pollution, they also virtually eliminated one of the oldest sources of air and water pollution known to man: animal dung.
<p>	A horse, for instance, produces about 45 pounds of manure each day. In American cities before the advent of automobiles, massive amounts of horse manure collected daily on streets, sidewalks, and public property. The resulting mess fouled the air, and contaminated water and food. It had to be collected and dumped or buried, often at great expense. And the horses died. In the late 19th century, New York City had to dispose of some 15,000 dead horses a year. Sometimes this difficult task wasn't performed as quickly as it should have been, resulting in outbreaks of disease.
<p>	In 1885, a British writer described London in the supposedly pristine days before the car. "It is a vast stagnant swamp, which no man dare enter, since death would be his inevitable fate. There exhales from this oozy mass so fatal a vapor that no animal can endure it. The black water bears a greenish-brown floating scum, which forever bubbles up from the putrid mud of the bottom. . . . It is dead."
<p>	Fred Smith, the president of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, in Washington, D.C., and a former environmental regulator, notes that the automobile swept away many of these environmental problems. Besides reducing the need to deal with horse and draught-animal wastes and corpses, the car "encouraged developments that reduce air pollution," he observed in Reason magazine. Before the automobile, most urban homes and businesses were heated with coal, an extremely dirty source of energy that spewed sulfur dioxide, particulates, and toxic ash into the air. As the demand for gasoline stimulated oil exploration, heating oil and natural gas became cheaper and more readily available.
<p>	Did the inventors and early manufacturers of the automobile perceive its potential environmental benefits? Have General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler been run by environmental activists for the past half-century? Hardly. Their environmental records are mixed. Nor have all the environmental problems created by the human need for transportation and fuel been "solved" -- particularly in those unique areas, such as southern California, where topography and climate make auto emissions, regardless of how numerous their source, a continuing problem. The automobile example shows only that economic decisions, motivated by an insatiable demand for higher productivity, lower costs, and bigger profit margins, can have unforeseen benefits for third parties and the environment.
<P>
<b>It's Not Easy Being Green</b>
<p>	One problem for corporate managers is that years of apocalyptic rhetoric and breathless media coverage have created environmental illiteracy among many Americans, including potential consumers and employees. When McDonald's first began to research whether its plastic "clamshell" hamburger boxes posed a significant waste-disposal problem, company scientists came to the conclusion that paper wrappers would actually be harder to recycle. But in a well-publicized 1990 decision, the restaurant chain nevertheless switched to paper.
<p>	The reason wasn't sound environmental policymaking, but public relations. A letter-writing campaign organized by environmental activists and teachers had schoolchildren across the country telling their favorite fast-food outlet (and their parents) that they wanted paper rather than plastic to "save the planet." McDonald's complied. Subsequently, a study in <i>Science</i> concluded that the plastic alternative was less environmentally harmful, once all the relevant costs -- such as the energy expended to make the paper wrappings -- were factored in.
<p>    Not only did McDonald's appear to make the environmentally "wrong" decision, but the company also nipped a promising business venture in the bud. Before the paper-packaging decision was announced, Dow Chemical and seven other plastic manufacturers had formed the National Polystyrene Recycling Company to recycle polystyrene from 450 McDonald's restaurants. The switch to paper nixed the deal, which would have advanced plastics recycling.
<p>	The effect of corporate decisions on the environment are, in other words, extremely difficult to predict with accuracy. Corporations pursuing profit have as much chance of generating environmental benefits as regulators or environmental activists do -- particularly when they are faced with prices for waste disposal that are as close to cost as possible.
<p>	For natural resources over which property rights are relatively easy to establish, such as oil, minerals, or timber, prices serve as an early-warning signal to companies about scarcity. If the price is rising, that suggests more demand for the resource than can be met by available supply. Companies then have a financial incentive either to find new supplies or to reduce its need by developing alternatives or ferreting out waste. This market process amounts to a sort of ongoing environment research project seeking an answer to this question: What is the most efficient and least resource-depleting method of producing the goods and services people need?
<p>	A good example of how this process works can be found in the development by Bristol-Myers-Squibb of a new way to make Taxol, a treatment for ovarian and breast cancer. Taxol had been made from the bark of the endangered Pacific yew tree, but the process killed the tree. Responding to the mounting cost of obtaining Pacific yew bark, the company found a way to make Taxol from the needles and twigs of the more common Himalayan yew tree, thus assuring a continued supply of Taxol while reducing the need to harvest the endangered species.
<p>	For resources over which property rights haven't been established, either because of technical difficulty or because of bad public-policy decisions, the pricing system doesn't work as well. When governments relieve corporations of the need for pay the full cost of disposing of waste, for example, by operating and subsidizing waste collection, landfills, incinerators, and recycling programs, they reduce the incentive for those corporations to find alternative methods that produce less waste.
<p>	
<b>Environmental Surprises</b>
<p>	Some ecological benefits come from surprising places. Man-made pesticides and the companies that produce them, for example, are often reviled for the risks they supposedly pose to humans and habitats. But according to Dennis Avery, the director of global food issues for the Hudson Institute, the Herculean efforts by American companies and researchers to make farming more productive -- by introducing insecticides, herbicides, crop-breeding, and genetic engineering -- have reduced the need for farmland in the United States and other countries. Besides lowering the real price and improving the quality of the foods consumers buy, this happy result has had the side-effect of protecting forests and other sensitive habitats from being cleared for agriculture. "Today's typical environmentalist worries about how many spiders and pigweeds survive in an acre of monoculture corn without giving environmental credit for the millions of organisms thriving on the two acres that didn't have to be plowed because we tripled crop yields," Avery comments.
<p>	Actually, reducing the price and improving the quality of agricultural produce has had its own salutary effects on human health. Throughout human history, most people in most societies have had little to eat. Starvation has until recently been the typical state of much of the Earth's population. Only within the past century, and especially since the early 1900s, has agricultural productivity increased rapidly enough to guarantee a plentiful supply of food at affordable prices in developed countries. 		Much of this productivity is due to the invention and production of agricultural chemicals and the development of new farming practices by American entrepreneurs. Even today, herbicides and pesticides make fruits and vegetables cheaper and more attractive. One study by Texas A&M University researchers found that without pesticides, potato yields would drop 50 percent, orange yields by 55 percent, and corn yields by 78 percent. Prices for these commodities would rise tremendously without pesticides.
<p>	Companies introducing these agricultural innovations have clearly advanced the interests of their shareholders, too. The Monsanto Co., founded in 1901 to produce saccharin in competition with German firms, has since diversified into chemicals, fibers, plastics, and pharmaceuticals. Two of its most profitable products for the past 30 years have been the popular herbicides Lasso (introduced in 1969) and Roundup (1973), one of the best-selling agricultural products of all time. Monsanto continues to introduce new products to increase agricultural productivity, such as Posilac, which boosts milk production in cows and reduces per-unit consumption of feed grains.
<p>
<b>Plastic Pleasures</b>
<p>	If anything symbolizes the irresponsible corporation in the minds of many theorists, it is the manufacturer of that epitome of 20th-century wastefulness, plastic. Typically made from oil, a nonrenewable resource, plastic has come to represent everything that is wrong with American commercial life and our "throwaway culture." But is plastic really a significant environmental problem? Does it provide no benefits to human health and safety or the environment that need to be weighed?
<p>	William Rathje, a professor of archeology at the University of Arizona, has spent years studying solid-waste disposal patterns. His excavations of landfills have found that plastics make up about 7 percent by weight and 16 percent by volume of the typical landfill -- much less than paper or yard waste. Polystyrene plastic, used in drinking cups and those "clamshell" hamburger containers McDonald's abandoned, makes up only 1 percent of landfill volume. Fast-food packaging amounts to no more than one-third of 1 percent. Of course, environmentalists fault plastic for much more than taking up space in landfills. They point out that plastic manufacturing relies on extracting and transporting oil. But since less than 2 percent of the world's petroleum is used to produce petrochemicals of all kinds, from fertilizers to plastics, the impact on oil consumption of using plastic to make consumer products is negligible.<p>
	Consider, on the other hand, the benefits of plastic. Even something as banal as plastic wrap has been a tremendous boon for Americans' health and safety. A hundred years ago, grocery stores had little in the way of prepackaged foods. At the turn of the century, paper packaging began to enter food retailing, but it had limitations. Meat, for example, was still often shipped in the form of whole carcasses only 50 years ago. Consumers would request particular cuts of meat from butchers, who kept carcasses until they were all sold or completely spoiled. The meat was expensive, particularly because butchers spent so much time carving it.
<p>	During the 1950s, however, the advent of plastic packaging began to change food delivery. Dow Chemical of Midland, Michigan, was an industry leader, not only in supplying plastic products to businesses but also by introducing its first major consumer product, Saran Wrap, in 1953. Plastic packaging allowed grocers to sell smaller portions at lower prices, and consumers to store food more efficiently and effectively. One study estimates that the modern system of packaging lowers the price of beef by about 40 cents a pound, while improving its quality.
<p>	Furthermore, the use of plastic and other types of packaging for foods seems to have reduced, not increased, total household waste. When Rathje took his garbage-archeology team to Mexico City in 1990, they found that the average household there discarded 40 percent more refuse each day than the average U.S. household, because Mexicans ate more whole fruits and vegetables and thus had more rinds, peels, and other food debris. In America, food processors sell prepackaged fruits and vegetables in cans, bags, or microwaveable plastic containers. From an environmental standpoint, this has the effect of accumulating the food debris in a central location, thus making it easier to dispose of in the form of compost, animal feed, and other products.
<p>	Today, the American plastics industry is one of the most innovative in the world. By finding new ways to manufacture, package, and store products that cost less, last longer, require fewer resources, and reduce harm to the environment, the industry is constantly improving the way we live. Since World War II, innovations in the manufacture, design, and use of plastics have yielded tremendous benefits for the public in terms of safety, health, economy, and quality of life. Consider these examples:
<p>	Plastic tubing made possible the first disposable, ready-to-use hypodermic needles. Initially introduced for combat use in the 1940s, the disposable needle soon made it possible to conduct safe and effective mass inoculations against disease in America and throughout the world.
<p>	In 1945, Earl Tupper introduced the first flexible plastic storage containers to replace glass, earthenware, and metal containers for storing food and other perishables. His product, Tupperware, vastly improved the freshness and quality of stored food.
<p>	Plastic siphon tubing made mass irrigation possible in the 1940s and 1950s, thus contributing to the Green Revolution that increased agricultural productivity and eliminated famine in much of the world. In the 1960s, plastic pipes began to replace other forms of piping for water distribution and drainage, because they were lighter and easier to install and resisted corrosion better than alternatives.
<p>	Plastic innovations during the past three decades by such companies as Phillips Petroleum, Union Carbide, and Shell Chemical have made possible such life-saving and life-enhancing products as artificial organs, comfortable prosthetics, body armor for law-enforcement personnel, unbreakable but light children's toys, and many automotive parts.
<p>	Cheap, all-temperature performance, flame-retardant, high-impact-resistant plastic parts made the first home computers -- manufactured by Apple Computer and Tandy -- viable products.
<p>	Lingering environmental controversies such as the risks of dioxin -- which many view as a potent human carcinogen -- are being resolved by plastic designers who, just in the past few years, have developed products that reduce or eliminate these real or perceived environmental problems. GE Plastics, for example, developed a new flame-retardant product that doesn't produce dioxin and that is also easier to make and costs no more than the plastic it replaces. Apple Computer is using the product in its Macintosh line of personal computers. Waste-to-energy plants, which dispose of about 60,000 tons of refuse each day and supply electricity to nearly a million Americans, also employ a series of technologies that reduce dioxin emissions to almost immeasurable levels.
<p>
<b>The Recycling Conundrum</b>
<p>	An article of faith among environmental advocates is that recycling will help American business conserve natural resources and demonstrate its environmental responsibility. This assumption doesn't account for the potential costs, including environmental costs, of pursuing recycling regardless of whether it is truly profitable.
<p>	For example, curbside recycling programs usually require more collection trucks. That means more fuel consumption and engine emissions. Some recycling programs produce high volumes of wastewater and use large amounts of energy. When researchers have tried to examine every aspect of the recycling equation -- from energy use to production costs -- they have found that sometimes recycling makes sense from an economic and environmental standpoint, while other times it does not.
<p>	Aluminum cans are a clear example of a commercial package that should be recycled. It takes 10 percent less energy to recycle aluminum than it does to make it from mined bauxite. So aluminum recycling is profitable -- and commonplace. Steel is also relatively economical to recycle. Virtually all products made with steel contain at least 25 percent reclaimed steel. On the other hand, recycling fruit-juice containers probably doesn't make economic or ecological sense. Filling disposable cardboard boxes takes half as much energy as filling recyclable glass bottles. For a given beverage volume, transporting the empty glass bottles requires 15 times as many trucks as does transporting disposable boxes. Transporting the containers once they are filled also costs less when using disposable boxes. Juice boxes don't break like glass bottles can, they are easily packed or frozen, and they seem to encourage juice consumption among the young, with whom they have proven to be popular.
<p>	For some commodities, such as newsprint, it seems that the only way to make recycling profitable is to force manufacturers to use them. Many states have laws requiring that newspapers contain a certain percentage of recycled paper, thus artificially creating a demand for newsprint. Even mandates sometimes fail to make recycling work: In Germany, laws requiring plastics recycling have resulted in a glut of collected plastics with few economical uses. Advocates for such laws point out that market prices don't capture all the costs of alternatives to recycling. But prices nevertheless contain important information. When forest stocks become scarcer, for example, the price of virgin timber rises, thus making recyclables more attractive. Similarly, as long as landfills are run to at least break even, then as they fill up their tipping fees will rise, again encouraging diversion of waste products into recycling or reuse. These price mechanisms already exist to a significant degree, and yet paper and plastic recycling often makes no sense absent government mandates.	

<p>For corporate managers trying to make heads or tails of the economic and environmental issues surrounding recycling, the answer may well be to trust an imperfect system of market prices over an even more imperfect attempt to guess at the ecological impact of various waste-reduction and recycling strategies. In everyday decisionmaking, this means weighing costs and benefits while maximizing shareholder return.
<p>

	Ford saved millions in 1994 when it converted several components of its automobiles into 100 percent recycled plastic. Chrysler is using completely recycled plastic in the interior trim of its popular minivans. Both car companies have made increasing use of these recycled plastics, made by companies such as Washington Penn Plastics and AlliedSignal, because of their cost and performance advantages over "virgin" plastic, not because of an attempt to meet some vague environmental goal. The savings "go straight to the bottom line," said Tony Brooks, Ford's special recycling coordinator. "Ford's position is that we will do everything we can to use recycled materials in our cars, but they can't cost more than virgin and they must perform at least as well as virgin."
<p>
<b>Problem, Innovation, Solution</b>
<p>	Most environmental issues in America today represent not only public-sector controversies but also private-sector opportunities. For companies that can identify a problem and devise a solution, the potential profits are significant.
<p>	In the case of plastics, profit-seeking corporations are experimenting with edible food packaging that offers better protection, lower cost, and few environmental considerations. ConAgra, Inc., the processed-food giant, is working on an edible bag in which to package products such as frozen entrees that currently used plastic bags. "If you could make a boilable, edible bag, you could replace the plastic with something that is part of the food -- ultimately eliminating a source of package waste," says the company's packaging director, Brian Hopkins. Other companies are working along similar lines. Quaker Oats is testing edible coating for breakfast cereals. RJR Nabisco is working on a film made from milk protein that could be used to coat frozen fish products and baked goods.
<p>	These innovations aren't being pursued simply to reduce package waste. Food manufacturers also want to improve food preservation to enhance the taste and freshness of their products. Instead of having consumers buy whole fruits and vegetables, for example, and then slicing or dicing them at home, manufacturers could prepare large quantities of fresh produce -- such as pre-sliced onions or oranges -- and then preserve them with edible coatings. The cost of the foods would be lower, consumers could enjoy the convenience of pre-sliced ingredients, and waste peelings -- currently spread out over the entire population of homes -- would be centralized in manufacturing facilities and thus easier to dispose of. The resulting boon to human health would be significant. "Consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables could be higher if this service were provided," says Attila E. Pavlath, a food scientist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
<p>Other corporations are focusing their innovative energies on hazardous waste spills, hoping to profit from creative solutions to this most serious of environmental dangers. Whether it is the Exxon Valdez oil spill of 1989 or Superfund sites or underground leakage of cancer-causing chemicals, the topic of hazardous waste often generates passionate feelings and great concern about environmental damage. But is the answer to spills to be found in banning substances or jawboning industry to reduce its dependency on them? Many entrepreneurial U.S. companies say no.

<p>The answer, they suggest, is to find new ways to clean up spills quickly, easily, and effectively. Bioremediation -- using bacteria or fungi either found in nature or engineered in laboratories to clean up hazardous wastes -- is a promising technology that offers the prospect of a cleaner economy without sacrificing the modern industrial processes that make our so economy productive. In Seattle, UNOCAL is using petroleum-eating bacteria to clean a six-acre patch of dirt where an oily residue of gasoline and disease fuels had accumulated over 65 years of leaks from its Seattle Marketing Fuel Terminal. Once the site is clean, UNOCAL expects to sell it for a significant price to commercial or residential developers.
<p>	Bioremediation isn't exactly a new idea -- municipal water systems have long used bacteria to purify sewage and paper companies have used them to remove organic matter from industrial sludgesbut a bustling new industry of bioremediation enterprises promises to clean up such hazardous materials as DDT, wood preservatives, toxic petrochemicals, and radioactive waste. Corporate pioneers in the area include Amoco and Du Pont, but most of the new technologies are coming from small, start-up firms such as Remediation Technologies of Concord, Massachusetts, Alpha Environmental in Austin, Texas, and Envirogen of Lawrenceville, New Jersey. Ironically, many bioremediation approaches have come from a close observation of how Mother Nature herself deals with waste. In searching for microbes to clean up oil spills, Alpha Environmental president Eugene Douglas said, "we went to where there are natural oil seeps in the Mediterranean, Central Asia, and North America, but where there isn't what you'd call pollution. Over time, microbes at these sites have evolved the ability to ingest that oil."
<p>	Bioremediation isn't the only solution profit-seeking corporations are working on. For the problem of oil spills, for example, Sea Sweep, Inc. of Denver, Colorado has developed an oil-absorbing, floating material, made from heating sawdust and woodchips, that will absorb 3.5 times its weight in oil. If administered to a spill, Sea Sweep will absorb the oil and then float to the surface for easy collection, after which it can be burned as fuel. Wyoming-based Centech has developed a centrifuge that generates relatively clean water and marketable oil from oil sludge, which is a serious problem around crude oil storage tanks and pipelines. In the area of industrial wastes, Tennessee's Olin Corp. has developed a process for dramatically reducing absorbable organic halides (such as dioxin) from the paper pulp-bleaching process. Martin Marietta Energy Systems, Inc. has a process for dechlorinating wastewater streams.
<p>	It would be impossible to list all of the environmental innovations and inventions one can find in just a single year, ranging from simple reuse technologies at plant sites to machines and acids that remove virtually all known pollutants from energy plant emissions. Some of these technologies have been developed, as Gore suggests, in response to regulatory mandates. Others have come about as companies seek to reduce their waste disposal costs, improve the efficiency of their production processes, or find new areas of opportunity in a growing, constantly changing economy. It is through innovation and productivity gains, not through corporate munificence or a commitment to a theoretical environmental ethos, that American business will make its most important contribution to a cleaner world and the health and safety of the public. 
<p>	For corporate decisionmakers, true responsibility entails a recognition of the uncertainty that often accompanies environmental controversies and an unwillingness to put the interests of shareholders at risk by accepting environmental "truisms" at face value. It is by no means clear that simply recycling more, or substituting paper for plastic, or abandoning profitable enterprises because they require nonrenewable resources will necessarily serve environmental ends. Ultimately, such ends are determined and valued by human beings who also value healthful and reasonably priced foods, high-quality consumer goods, and job opportunities. The chances of making a poor decision are higher when corporate managers try to act like public policymakers or conservation experts.
<p>	Instead, as much as is practicable, corporations should let prices guide their decisions. In most cases, wasteful industrial practices impose measurable costs on firms, be they for waste disposal, raw-materials purchases, or lost customer revenue. Thus firms have every incentive to find alternatives. "For all environmental issues, shareholder value, rather than compliance, emissions, or costs, is the critical unifying metric," said McKinsey & Co. management consultants Noah Walley and Bradley Whitehead in their noted 1994 essay on corporate environmentalism in the <i>Harvard Business Review</i>. "That approach is environmentally sound, but it's also hardheaded, informed by business experience, and, as a result, much more likely to be truly sustainable over the long term."
<p>	An example of how truly responsible companies might make decisions about environmental issues is the case of Eco-Foam pellets, a substitute for Styrofoam peanuts in packing boxes or other containers. Texas-based American Excelsior Co. makes Eco-Foam out of corn starch and markets it as environmentally friendly. "The biggest benefit is that it's manufactured from renewable resources instead of petroleum products," says one local distributor. Should responsible companies concerned about the global environment use Eco-Foam instead of Styrofoam, then? Probably not. Managers need not evaluate all the pros and cons of the two products. They need only watch the price. In early 1995, Eco-Foam cost 25 percent more than Styrofoam. If we ever really start running out of oil, the price of petroleum products, including Styrofoam, will rise -- making alternatives competitive. Until then, the environmental benefits of switching to corn starch won't be worth the cost.
<p>	Public policymakers will continue to develop more efficient ways to regulate waste and pollution, and scientists will continue to gather information about the environmental risks from various substances or practices. As they do, pricing structures will evolve that communicate even more accurate information to manufacturers and entrepreneurs about the true cost of commercial activities and the potential rewards from innovative solutions to environmental problems.
<p>	There are many promising trends in environmental thinking and regulatory policy, from markets for emissions permits to the increased use of cost-benefit analysis to establish public priorities. Once ecological and economic ends are brought closer together, the perceived clash of interests between American business and Mother Nature will largely disappear. For corporations, the complex issues of environmental responsibility will always be challenging. But dealing with them requires no redefinition of the core profit-seeking purpose of economic enterprises.

<b>Policy Review</b><br>
<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</i></center><p>
	Two competing paradigms of education reform have emerged in the United States in recent years, and the differences between them are growing sharper. One, commonly termed "systemic reform," assumes that reform efforts should be led by government and imposed from the top down. Its advocates believe that state (or federal) authorities must set standards not only for student learning, but also for teacher training, pupil assessments, textbooks, and school resources. Though undertaken in pursuit of higher standards and better results, systemic reform relies on uniform strategies to ensure that "inputs" everywhere are equal and all schools undertake similar activities. Government resources and bureaucratic regulation are, of course, its preferred mechanism for making this happen. Much of Goals 2000 embodies this approach.<p>	The second reform paradigm, which we call "reinventing education," embraces decentralized control, entrepreneurial management, and grassroots initiatives, all within a framework of publicly defined standards and accountability. Under this approach, public officials establish standards, make assessments, and hold schools accountable for meeting performance goals but do not themselves run the schools. Public officials also retain the power to cancel charters and school-management contracts on grounds of consistently poor performance, but they do not directly supervise or control the means by which schools pursue those ends.<p>	Under this paradigm, education may be delivered through charter schools (licensed by public authorities such as a state, city, or local school district), "opt out" schools that secede from their local education agencies and run themselves with what amounts to a "block grant" of public funds, "contract schools" (in which a performance contract is negotiated between private educational managers and a public agency), and "choice" programs (in which students use scholarships or publicly-funded vouchers to attend the schools of their choice). In all such situations, the continuing responsibility of public authorities is to establish standards for educational and fiscal performance and monitor progress in relation to those standards. (Those who reject this degree of public accountability may, of course, turn to wholly private schools or home schooling.)<p>	The "reinvention" approach welcomes diverse strategies and schools organized and run by various entities such as teacher cooperatives, parent associations, private corporations, religious institutions, and community-based organizations. It assumes that students and families are different and should be free to match themselves to the schools that suit them best. It requires little bureaucracy and few regulations because it rejects the proposition that schools must be centrally managed according to a single formula.<p>	We strongly favor the "reinvention" paradigm, provided that it contains one key element borrowed from the "systemic" approach: standards and accountability. It is our conviction that only clear and high standards for performance will ensure accountability, both to the marketplace (that is, to families making informed choices among schools) and to whatever public body authorizes the schools to operate.<p>	These standards need not be national, they need not be highly detailed, they should not prescribe pedagogy or resource use, and they need not cover the entire curriculum. (Indeed, the ability of schools to add their own features to the "core" described in the standards is part of what will make them different from one another.) But only when such standards are in place -- and accompanied by good tests and a steady flow of performance information -- can parents make informed choices among schools and public authorities determine which schools deserve to retain their "charters," contracts, or accreditations.<p>	These two approaches are now competing with each other, not only in Washington, D.C., but also in the states. Systemic reform remains the favored strategy of the Clinton administration and of some educators (especially in state departments of education and teachers unions), but the "reinvention" alternative is preferred in many other quarters -- including by many elected officials, business leaders, and parents, as well as by teachers and principals who welcome the possibility of breaking free from the stifling grip of bureaucracy. <p>	The reinvention impulse has even reached Capitol Hill, where the past year saw stirrings of the first major push in memory to "devolve" centralized activities to states, communities, and families and to lift restrictions on the use of federal aid. This impulse arises partly from the quest for better education, but also from a reaction against the regulatory burden of federal regulations and unfunded mandates.<p>	This is the motive behind recent congressional activity concerning "block grants" in areas as diverse as welfare, school lunches, and job training, as well as education aid. To be sure, turning categorical programs into block grants and devolving control to states and communities will not automatically foster reinvention. Indeed, recipients may not do much of anything. But doing away with "Washington-knows-best" approaches and removing strings from federal dollars at least permits reform-minded states and communities to experiment with new strategies for education and other public servicesand closes the easy route of blaming Uncle Sam for poor results.<p>	The federal government is so hamstrung by special interest groups that getting it out of the way of change-minded states and communities may be the most we can expect from Washington on the "reinvention" front. Certainly, all efforts by Uncle Sam to foster such reforms directly have proven halfhearted at best and fraudulent at worst. The so-called "Improving America's Schools Act" of 1994, for example, banned any use of federal aid for privately managed public schools and created a school "choice" program so laden with preconditions and constraints that it must be termed phony. It enables members of Congress to say they "voted for school choice" while ensuring that there is none.<p>	Even rigorous accountability based on testing was discouraged by explicit prohibitions in the Goals 2000 legislation on the use of federal funds for this purpose. Those who believe that such reforms are the main hope for serious educational improvement are learning that Washington is the wrong place to look. But much is happening elsewhere in the nation under the "reinvention" banner.
<p><b>Potemkin Charters</b><p>	The charter school idea has picked up tremendous momentum, as have variants, such as a flock of new, miniature high schools in New York City that are not called charters but share many of their characteristics. Those qualities include a large measure of operational independence from headquarters in return for a promise to achieve certain results over a stated period of time. (New York City's quasi-charters, however, have not agreed to any educational performance goals, and their quasi-independence relies on waivers by the local teachers union, waivers that do not even apply to the schools' many other employees.)<p>	By summer 1995, 19 states had enacted explicit "charter" school laws, including eight during the most recent legislative session (Louisiana, Arkansas, New Hampshire, Texas, Alaska, Wyoming, Delaware, and Rhode Island). Several hundred such schools were scheduled to be open this fall. Charter schools are no panacea -- not in a country with 85,000 public schools -- but this movement is the second-most-exciting development on the educational reform front.<p>	Not all charter laws are created equal, however, and several enacted in recent months are so weak that they are unlikely to do much good. We think of them as "Potemkin" charter programs with an impressive facade but no substance. Some of these laws were supported by people who actually oppose charter schools on principle and had decided to undermine support for them by promoting a bill that pretended to create them. This is currently happening in New Jersey, where the state teachers union is supporting a weak charter bill in the state assembly, although a stronger, competing bill supported by the state education commissioner, the state senate, and Governor Christine Whitman may yet prevail.<p>	Weak charter laws generally suffer from at least one of three serious failings:<p><ul><li>	They require the prior assent of too many "stakeholders," such as a majority of teachers currently teaching in the affected schools, and contain no mechanism for creating new charter schools that do not already possess such stakeholders. Of course, it would be wonderful if existing schools converted to charter status with the support of a majority of teachers and parents working together, and that is sure to happen in some places. But there are also situations in which parents and community leaders want to start a new school, and they should be allowed to do sowith the staff they want to teach in it. (Currently, California's charter law requires the approval of a majority of teachers, as do those in Georgia, Hawaii, and New Mexico.)<p>
<li>	They place local school boards in sole charge of granting charters. (Wyoming, Louisiana, and Texas have recently enacted such laws.) Though such a limitation is invariably a key political goal of school board lobbyists, it can be fatal for charter schools, because the uniform policies of a benighted local board and risk-averse superintendent are usually what charter-seekers are keenest to escape. That is why strong charter laws either lodge the authority to issue charters with a different entity (such as a state superintendent or state board) or -- better yet -- create multiple windows or appeal mechanisms so that no single entity has the absolute power to deny a charter application. In Michigan and Minnesota, state universities have the authority to issue charters. In Arizona, besides vesting this authority in both local and state school boards, the legislature created a new "charter school" board exclusively for this purpose<p>.<li>	They neglect to exempt charter schools from enough of the statutes, regulations, and contractual provisions that burden conventional schools. Thus, the charter school is not truly free to chart its own course. The whole point of such a school, after all, is to gain autonomy of action in return for accountability for results. The only regulations that charter schools should be expected to comply with are those governing health and safety and protections against racial discrimination. But many states leave numerous other rules in place. If a state still requires that U.S. history be taught in the 11th grade, that a school's pupil-teacher ratio cannot exceed 25:1, that 40 minutes a day must be spent on math, that certain textbooks must be purchased, and if there is no respite from seniority rules, salary schedules, or tenure requirements, then we see little point in calling an entity so regulated a "charter school." Such a charter is unlikely to be worth the paper it is printed on -- and few will go to the bother of seeking such a document.</ul><p>
	Why have so many states created these Potemkin charter programs? The explanation, of course, has to do with power and politics, catalyzed by the education establishment's fierce resistance to changes that threaten its monopoly. Though many teachers and principals crave opportunities to "opt out" of the system and run their own schools without the incessant oversight, time-wasting regulations, and innumerable mandates of the bureaucracy, their professional organizations seldom see it this way. Thus teachers unions, school-board associations, and superintendents, if they cannot defeat the charter bill altogether, generally do their utmost to weaken it. So do other advocacy groupsfor example, special educationwhose stock-in-trade is rule-bound uniformity rather than diversity. In fact, the Southwest Regional Laboratory recently leveled a novel criticism: that charter schoolsprecisely because many of them demand a high degree of parent involvementare unfair to children with bad parents!<p>	Obtaining a charter does not end the hazards that await these schools. Most also encounter practical problems when they first launch. One perennial challenge is finding a place to operate a charter school. To our knowledge, no state provides charter operators with buildings or capital financing. Though this is no huge burden for existing schools that convert to charter status, it poses a great obstacle to the creation of new charter schools. Another problem is that many charter school founders and managers have little prior experience in matters such as financial management, purchasing, and marketing.<p>	Our hunch, however, is that these are birthing and growing pains associated with a feisty, infant reform strategy that will, in time, turn into a strapping youth. We doubt that opponents will be able to halt its growth. In England, where "grant-maintained" schools have been in place for several years -- and where almost a fifth of all secondary schools have "opted out" into this independent status -- even the Labor Party is having to come to terms with their continued existence. Indeed, party leader Tony Blair now sends his own child to a grant-maintained school.<p><b>Gains for School Choice</b>
<p>	There was major progress on the choice front in 1994-95, centering on Milwaukee and Cleveland. In Wisconsin, Governor Tommy Thompson succeeded in persuading the legislature to pass his proposal to expand Milwaukee's voucher experiment to include many more children and to permit attendance at church-affiliated schools. As revised, and assuming the courts eventually assent, up to 15,000 low-income Milwaukee children (nearly all of them minority) will be able to attend any school within the city limits.<p>	In Ohio, the legislature agreed to a proposal by Governor George Voinovich to initiate a voucher "pilot" in 1996 for children in Cleveland. That city's catastrophically bad school system was "taken over" by the state under a federal court order in early 1995. Here, too, church-affiliated schools will be eligible recipients of voucher-bearing youngsters -- up to 2,000 of them. And here, too, the primary beneficiaries of this reform will be low-income minority youngsters.<p>	Court battles have already begun, and we do not doubt that choice's foes, having lost two significant political battles, will now throw vast resources into the effort to get vouchers thrown out as a violation of the "Establishment Clause" of the First Amendment. In August, the Wisconsin Supreme Court issued a temporary injunction against the Milwaukee plan. But the governors and legislators of Wisconsin and Ohio deserve hearty applause from those who believe, as we do, that no child should be forced to attend a bad public school against his and his parents' will when a better school -- public, private, or hybrid -- is available close by. Because the families of poor children often lack the wherewithal to exercise such a choice on their own, it is the obligation of elected officials to make it possible for them, as they have historically done in higher education. That this will now happen in two major U.S. cities is a development of immense significance to American education. <p>	A number of other states stepped up to the "choice" plate in 1995 but struck out. In Texas, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Illinois, and Arizona, variations on the voucher theme failed to pass, and New Jersey delayed consideration of Mayor Bret Schundler's Jersey City plan until at least autumn of this year. The original Ohio choice bill, to encompass a broader area than Cleveland, was chopped down by the legislature. Another setback was the ruling by Puerto Rico's Supreme Court that the voucher program there violated the commonwealth's constitution.<p>	Nothing, of course, elicits tougher opposition from defenders of the public-school status quo than voucher schemes (and similar ventures that go by different names), even when such plans are aimed precisely at those disadvantaged children who are most likely to drop out of public school. But the idea is not going away. Meanwhile, privately-funded voucher projects also continue to multiply, from New York's Student/Sponsor Partnership, to the Golden Rule program launched in Indianapolis in 1991. Today 23 programs reach more than 10,000 students. <p>	We believe that it is just a matter of time before children from needy families in most parts of the country will be able to carry their vouchers (or scholarships or whatever they may be called) to any accredited school. We understand that some private schools fear government regulation, and may decline to participate. We recognize that public aid should be targeted toward those students in greatest need (as is now the case in higher education); and we acknowledge that the Supreme Court will have to sort through the constitutional questions posed by inclusion of parochial schools. (Recent Supreme Court decisions in this domain have encouraged voucher supporters.)<p>	Still, it must be noted that, in the meantime, primary and secondary schooling is becoming increasingly anomalous as vouchers come to prevail in most other domains of U.S. domestic policy. Even President Clinton has endorsed vouchers in job training and in public housing. Moreover, much of the rest of the world -- from Australia to Chile to the Netherlands -- treats publicly-subsidized private-school attendance as routine and normal.<p><b>Contract Management</b><p>
	Paul Hill's superb new book <i>Reinventing Public Education</i> sets forth a comprehensive vision of how this approach could work in the future -- and why it is apt to work better than direct operation of all schools by the school system's central office. Meanwhile, Educational Alternatives, Inc. (EAI) continues to manage a number of schools in Baltimore and recently added Hartford, Connecticut, to its portfolio. The superintendent of schools in the District of Columbia has tried to revive his plan to engage EAI to run some of D.C.'s troubled schools. A private management firm is functioning as "superintendent of schools" in Minneapolis.<p>The Edison Project opened its first four schools in 1995, with others due to follow if these succeed. And at least two other companies are already active in this field in the United States. Sabis is an international group that has been running a school in Minnesota and recently added a second (charter) school in Springfield, Massachusetts. Nashville-based Alternative Public School Strategies has reached an agreement with little Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, to run one of three elementary schools in that community -- a school in which 78 percent of students receive free or reduced-price lunches. (The future of this contract, however, is shadowed by ambiguity in the laws of Pennsylvania as to the legality of such an arrangement.) More companies and communities will surely follow, probably including big corporate guns such as Disney, which is creating a school in Florida that many view as a prototype.<p>	Unfortunately, not all the blossoms in this garden are healthy. EAI's relationship with a school in Dade County, Florida, has ended. Baltimore mayor Kurt Schmoke -- whose strong support is the main reason EAI has been able to withstand intense establishment pressure in that city -- has voiced dissatisfaction with student performance in the EAI-run schools after three years and has suggested that the arrangement may need to be rethought. And EAI's bold plan to alter budget priorities in Hartford kicked up such a storm from vested interests -- imagine shifting funds from surplus staff to areas such as technologythat the company and school board have decided to scale back most of the changes, at least for now, from the entire district to six schools that have "volunteered" for the full treatment. <p>	The difficulties of EAI in Baltimore and Hartford suggest that contracting will probably work best with new schools and with existing schools that are receptive. It is difficult to graft a new management program onto a school whose staff is determined to defeat the new managers. Perhaps private management should begin with a single school or manageable number of schools that want to be changed. Otherwise, the new managers will be forced to maintain all the elements of a system that currently does not work for children. And if they do, they will be doomed to fail.<p>	As for Edison, there is incredible pressure on its first four schools to be nearly perfect -- educationally, organizationally, and budgetarily -- from the very outset. The venture's future hinges on how well it meets these immense expectations. Every education journalist and researcher in the Western world is knocking on the Edison schools' door, probing for defects or missteps. No conventionally-run public school in America is likely to be subjected to the same degree of scrutiny or held to the same standards of perfection.<p>	In our view, contract management of public schools holds considerable promise, and these trials should be encouraged. We should also expect bumps along the road as these schools get their bearings; some may even fail. It is well to bear in mind, however, that we currently keep failing public schools open and even reward them when they should be closed down. Therefore, when a poorly run contract school or charter school is terminated, we should see such an action as a victory rather than a setback for the reinvention strategy. If and when that happens, it will prove that school authorities are willing to be held accountable for poor results.<p>	Meanwhile, beware the word "privatization," which is widely used by supporters of the current system to block all movement toward contract management. True "privatization" means selling or otherwise transferring a public asset to private owners who henceforth bear sole responsibility for its existence and are accountable to no one save their shareholders.<p>	That is what is happening to certain big, state-run factories in Eastern Europe, for example, but it is not what firms such as EAI and Edison are doing with the U.S. schools they manage under contract. Those schools remain public in every sense that a student, parent, taxpayer, or voter could think important: They are open to the public, financed by the public, and educationally and fiscally accountable to public authorities for their continued existence (and for the retention or termination of their private managers). Here is a sure test of whether an organization has been privatized: If public authorities can cancel the contract or withdraw the charter, the transaction is not privatization. It is a management contract on behalf of the public, not a transfer of public goods to private ownership.<p><b>Governance Changes</b><p>	The century-old governance structure of American public education is showing signs of change. As a recent <i>Education Week</i> headline put it, "Fervor spreads to overhaul state agencies."<p>	This year, it appears, 30 states carried out or at least considered reorganization or reduction of their education departments, mirroring the popular political trends of reducing government, pushing authority to local officials, and giving power to the elected officials whom the voters are apt to hold responsible at the polls for the effective use of their tax dollars. (Education spending is the largest or second-largest budget item in every state.)<p>	Texas offers a dramatic example. Now the second most populous state, Texas has been long known to have perhaps the most highly regulated school system in the country, with an immensely detailed education code and an all-powerful state education agency. Early this year, the legislature agreed with Governor George W. Bush Jr. that significant changes were needed. In effect, they repealed the entire education code and started afresh.<p>	The authority of the Texas Education Agency has been limited to six basic functions, including recommending education goals, granting campus charters, managing school funds, and administering federal programs. Several new categories of schools and school systems have been authorized, including "home rule" districts that are freed from most state mandates and charter schools that may be organized by individuals or groups outside the existing school system. (Unfortunately, as we noted earlier, almost all Texas charters must be issued by the local school board, and these boards are not likely to welcome dissenting approaches.) Texas also created a new network of alternative schools and made it easier to remove disruptive students from regular classrooms. And it created a powerful new state board for educator certification, to be named by the governor.<p>	Other states have taken different approaches. Minnesota abolished its department of education and merged these functions into a new department of children, families, and learning. Wisconsin took virtually all duties and powers away from its independently-elected state school superintendent, an office that was widely perceived as a captive of the education establishment, and turned them over to a new agency answerable to the governor. New Jersey's governor "froze" the regulatory process and directed the education commissioner and his colleagues to propose a comprehensive overhaul.North Carolina -- another highly centralized, heavily regulated state -- is shrinking its department of education by half and rewriting laws and regulations to give local districts far greater flexibility. The state has established annual performance standards for the state's almost 2,000 public schools based on "reasonable progress" in reading, writing, and math and with various interventions, sanctions (including suspension of principals and teachers), and rewards for success or failure to meet those standards. In other words, the state is moving from a regulatory compliance strategy to one based on standards and results.<p>	Illinois also made a radical change, though it affects only the city of Chicago, whose troubled and deficit-plagued schools have been the object of innumerable reform efforts in recent years. The legislature gave unprecedented control to the mayor, who has appointed (and can remove) all members of a small newly created "board of trustees" and a management team that includes a chief operating officer and fiscal, purchasing, and educational officers. The new law also places school principals in charge of all school employees (previously they had no authority over custodians) and authorizes them to set their own school hours and staff schedules. The Chicago Teachers Union is barred from bargaining over many nonsalary issues such as class size, staff assignments, academic calendar, hours and places of instruction, pupil assessment policies, privatizing services, and decisions over charter schools. It is also forbidden to strike for the next 18 months.<p><b>Will Unions Get with the Program?</b><p>	Chicago is not the only place where teachers unions have run afoul of public authorities. Largely because of their efforts to block state and local reforms, the unions are coming under more intense scrutiny and challenge. School boards, legislatures, and governors are promulgating policies and proposing legislation to abolish tenure, redefine collective bargaining rights, repeal "fair-share" agreements, and otherwise change laws and practices that sustain union interests and undergird their power.<p>	In Indiana, for example, the "fair share" law has been repealed. This law had authorized unions to extract fees from nonunion members in return for "services" performed for them by the unions, regardless of whether the individuals wanted those services. (An obvious example is a wage increase that affects all teachers in the district.) By repealing this law, the legislature made it illegal for unions to negotiate such arrangements with school districts. In another, more localized blow to the Indiana State Teachers Association, the legislature passed a reform bill for the Indianapolis schools that limits collective bargaining to the issue of wages only in that city. <p>	In neighboring Michigan, the state also erased collective bargaining over certain nonsalary issues, empowered school boards to put teachers' health insurance out for competitive bidding (rather than compelling purchase of this benefit from the Michigan Education Association's insurance subsidiary), instituted steep fines against teachers who go on strike, and forbade the union to deduct political contributions from teachers' paychecks without their permission.<p>	Such developments are apt to continue as long as unions throw sand in the reform gears. When education is reshaped around standards and performance rather than inputs and processes, just about every established routine will be affected, including personnel practices. No aspect of a school's management is more crucial to its effectiveness than how it handles staffing, and nothing is more fatal to performance-based innovation than attempts to preserve staffing rules that disregard performance.<p>	In New York City, for example, the contract with the United Federation of Teachers allows a school, if 75 percent of the staff agrees, to be included in the "school-based option transfer plan," which lets it (among other union-rule waivers) select its own teachers rather than having staff assigned on the basis of seniority. Sixty schools, including most of the struggling new, small high schools, have opted to be included in the program.<p>	In the city's 1,000 other public schools, however, which enroll 99 percent of the children in the system, transfers to vacancies continue to be based strictly on seniority. Junior teachers can be "bumped" by more senior teachers from other schools, no matter how much a school may want the junior teacher or how little it wants the more senior teacher. Such practices, of course, make it impossible for a school's staff to develop its own ethos, which is essential to the staff's effectiveness and its ability to work together as a team with shared goals.<p>	The Educational Excellence Network has had a long history of successful association on important projects with the American Federation of Teachers at the national level, and the authors of this report admire AFT head Albert Shanker's defense of high standards and high stakes, his international work on behalf of democracy, and his good sense about curricula issues. His staff has also produced some terrific products, and several AFT locals have pioneered (or at least tolerated) some promising reform strategies.<p>	At the state and local levels, however, far more often than not, the AFT and NEA are the most potent protectors of the status quo. In principle, they could change, abandoning their tired industrial model of unionism and turning to the flexible, responsibility- and accountability-seeking, participatory, professional approach to organizational behavior that modern organizations need, and that many other organizations have. We do not know whether, if only for self-preservation, they will prove willing and able to take such a step. We certainly hope they will.

<h3>Will Conservative Welfare Reform Corrupt Religious Charities?</h3>
<hr size=3 width=50%>
<b>Amy L. Sherman</b><br>
<b>Policy Review</b><br>
<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</i></center>
<p>	Welfare reform, says Governor John Engler of Michigan, is not "just about reforming a broken system, but about reforming what is broken in the human character." Engler is one of a growing number of policymakers who seek to shift responsibility for helping the poor from government bureaucracies to civil institutions -- particularly religious ones -- that can address the underlying moral and cultural aspects of chronic welfare dependency. Indeed, amidst the flurry of federal and state initiatives to scale back the welfare state, religious nonprofits are becoming the new provider of choice for funding and delivering social programs.<p>Engler has approved a multimillion-dollar contract with the Salvation Army to care for the state's homeless population. Mississippi governor Kirk Fordice has established a "Faith and Families" project in which state social-service agencies work with churches to "adopt" welfare families. The federal government provides some 350 grant programs for social-service nonprofits, many of them with religious roots. U.S. Senators John Ashcroft and Dan Coats have proposed legislation allowing individuals a dollar-for-dollar tax credit for donations made to charities, including religious groups, that serve the poor.<p>The enthusiasm for religion-based providers is well-deserved. Christian-based substance-abuse recovery programs, for example, reportedly boast a 70 to 80 percent success rate, whereas secular therapeutic programs report an average success rate of 6 to 10 percent. Research by Roger Freeman of Harvard University shows that black inner-city youth who attend church are 47 percent less likely to drop out of school, 54 percent less likely to use drugs, and 50 percent less likely to engage in criminal activities than those without religious values. Columnist William Raspberry of the <i>Washington Post</i> recently asserted that the most successful social programs "are those that are driven -- even if only tacitly -- by moral or religious values."<p>So it's beginning to look like th
e secular state wants some old-time religion. But what impact will increased state funding have on religion-based programs? Will more money allow them to help more needy people, or will it dilute -- or pollute -- their ability to exert the moral and spiritual influence that makes them uniquely successful? <p>In Michigan, where Engler has aggressively collaborated with religious nonprofits, the results are mixed. State agencies tend to treat these nonprofits not as equals, but as subcontracting functionaries doing the government's bidding. State contracts almost always come with conditions -- regulations that sometimes diminish a religious group's best assets: its personal involvement, its credibility with the community, and its commitment to addressing not only physical needs but spiritual ones as well<p>Moreover, religious nonprofits that contract with the state may, as a result, shift their purpose from the transformation of lives to the mere delivery of services. The most effective groups challenge those who embrace faith to live out its moral implications in every significant area of their lives, from breaking drug or alcohol addictions and repairing family relationships to recommitting themselves to the value of honest work. But state social-service contracts aren't mainly concerned with such outcomes; they focus on the number of meals served, beds available, and checks cashed. <p>
<b>Engler Calls in the Army</b><p>The aim of his welfare-reform efforts, Engler says, is to smash the entitlement mentality, promote the idea that aid entails responsibility, and empower the private sector (particularly the religious community) to deliver welfare services. To accomplish the first two goals, Michigan in 1992 began requiring recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) to sign a "social contract" with the state that committed them to work, job training, or volunteer service for at least 20 hours per week. To accomplish the third goal, Engler has increased collaboration with and funding of religiously based social-service groups.<p>Some public-private partnerships in the state are still too young to afford solid conclusions about their effects. Nonetheless, the most formal and visible partnership in social welfare in Michigan -- the state's annual $9.5 million contract with the Salvation Army to assist the homeless -- sheds some light on the deficiencies of public-private collaboration.<p>In December 1991, the Michigan Department of Social Services (DSS) awarded the Salvation Army a $3 million grant to provide emergency shelter and two meals per day to homeless individuals, either in its own facilities or by "subcontracting" with other private shelter operators. The partnership resulted from the expectation that homelessness would increase following Engler's most dramatic welfare reform: terminating the state's General Assistance (GA) program. Until October 1991, the GA program had provided about $240 million annually to childless, able-bodied, nonworking adults. Critics charged that without assistance, many of these individuals would become homeless. State officials wanted an inexpensive but effective initiative to prepare for such a contingency.<p>	The scale of this partnership is impressive. In the first year, the Army provided over 680,000 "nights of service" (a bed and a meal) to the state's homeless. The initial grant of $3 million has increased each year to reach $9.5 mi
llion in 1995. This works out to $10 per day per client and allows the Army a modest administrative overhead of 3 percent. From the time GA was terminated until March of this year, the Army and its subcontractors provided nearly 2.9 million nights of service to homeless individuals.<p>	From the state's perspective, this partnership has been, in the words of Rusty Hills, Engler's public-affairs director, "absolutely magnificent." In one fell swoop, Engler saved the taxpayers millions of dollars, dealt a significant blow to the entitlement culture, encouraged thousands of individuals to leave the dole and find jobs, and provided homeless people food and shelter far more cost-effectively than ever before. Despite the increase in homelessness that followed the GA cuts, state officials say, the Army and its subcontractors have risen to the challenge. Shirley Nowakowski, the director of energy, housing, and emergency programs for Michigan's DSS, says the Salvation Army partnership is a success because "everyone who wants a bed has a bed." Jerry Miller, the state's director of social services, agrees, noting that the Salvation Army is providing services far more cheaply than the state could.<p>	Leonard Krugel, the Army's director of divisional services and the point man in the Army's contract with the state, is also pleased with the collaboration. He explains that the Army would have had to confront an increased homeless population anyway, and having state dollars helped pay the bills. More importantly, Krugel argues that the partnership has provided the Army "regulatory relief." <p>	For example, city officials in Detroit recently passed a new ordinance requiring homeless shelters to provide, among other things, dietitian-approved menus, quiet study rooms for schoolchildren, and expensive fire-suppression sprinkler systems. The ordinance already has put some private shelter operators out of business, and critics say the regulations are excessive and unrealistic. But for the Army, Krugel explains, "all of [these reg
ulations] are outside the sphere of this contract."Just Send the Checks?<p>	Former Army staffers and outside observers, however, are less sanguine about the partnership. The Army has a long history of providing emergency shelter. But it also knows a lot about how to help the homeless break the cycle of dependency. Salvation Army chapters in Michigan offer drug rehabilitation programs, educational services, and job-training seminars. Nearly every Army center has a chapel on site, and Bible study classes and spiritual support groups are common. <p>   The state contract, however, is limited to emergency services only. It includes neither the practical nor spiritual functions that have distinguished the Army over the years. With state-supplied funds, the Army subcontracts with shelters and certifies that they meet minimum standards of health and safety and provide the basic services of food and shelter. The Army neither provides consulting services to the subcontracting shelters nor assists them in designing programs to serve the homeless. It simply acts as a conduit for state funds, distributing money to 116 shelters (including religion-based ones) throughout the state.<p>	The contract represents an enormous missed opportunity. On the one hand, state officials seemed to focus nearly exclusively on the cost effectiveness of turning over care of the homeless to the Army. On the other hand, Army staffers failed to insist that their emphasis on moral renewal be implemented in participating shelters.<p> 	"The Salvation Army has taken a very myopic approach to its role, that of being a fiduciary -- not a program monitor, just a 'pass through,'" says Dan Piepszowski, the Army's former director of social services in eastern Michigan who is now with the Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit. "I don't think the Army was able to fully integrate their church ministry agenda into the operation of the contract." Piepszowski says, for example, that there has been no clear ministerial role for core officers -- the heart of the Arm
y's religious leadership -- at the shelters. <p>	"They've got to figure out who they are in this collaboration," Piepszowski says. "Do we want to send the checks or do we want to work our magic? They've opted to send the checks."<p>	It appears that the Michigan DSS also had a too-limited vision of what it wanted out of the partnership. Leonard Krugel, for example, does not know why the state chose to work with the Army rather than some other entity. When asked the same question, Shirley Nowakowski of the DSS said that the state selected the Army because it has corporate offices in several Michigan counties. She seemed unaware that the Army, as a religion-based provider, might address moral and behavioral problems underlying chronic homelessness more effectively than typical secular programs. Neither did state welfare director Jerry Miller. He said the fact that the Army is a religious organization never entered his thinking. Rather, according to these officials, they wanted to ensure that every Michigan citizen who needed emergency shelter would get it -- and they believed the Salvation Army could deliver.<p>	Sam Chambers, the director of social services in Wayne County (which includes Detroit), complains that the state was never interested in a genuine partnership in which the Army could pursue its holistic approach to homelessness. "Case planning wasn't part of [the partnership]. Rebuilding people's lives wasn't part of it. . . . All that was bought by the state was direct emergency services -- a 'cot and a hot.'" Critics say the Army's involvement is not helping Michigan transform homeless individuals into productive citizens, but is simply feeding and sheltering a dependent homeless population more efficiently. All that has changed, they maintain, is who signs the checks for the individual shelters.<p><b>The Dole and the Soul</b><p>The drawbacks of state funding go deeper than the loss to welfare recipients of the benefits of a spiritual ministry. The nonprofits themselves risk losing their unique cap
acity to help the needy. For example, a nonprofit's credibility in the eyes of its beneficiaries may be tainted by its association with state agencies. Rev. Eddie Edwards, who oversees a community-development organization in east Detroit called Joy of Jesus, explains: "When we are working with people in the community, helping them become self-sufficient, helping them get off welfare, it would be extremely difficult to tell them to get off welfare if we were on some kind of public assistance."<p>	Other problems, though, exist largely because of the way public-private partnerships are now conducted. The impact of public funds on REACH, Inc., another church-based ministry in Michigan, illustrates several pitfalls into which such groups can stumble.<p>	REACH began as the brainchild of several lay members of Detroit's 12th Street Baptist Church, who started an outreach to senior citizens in the surrounding neighborhood. The group established a day-care center, purchased and rehabilitated crack houses, and even opened up a local restaurant. Rev. Lee Earl pastored the church, and REACH's offices were housed in the church building. As the group's vision for community renewal expanded, some members wanted to pursue government funding. In its early years, church members and private companies had financed the ministry's work. Earl says he was not sure that "the benefits of government funding outweighed the challenges," but his was a minority voice. <p>	In the early 1990s, the church won grants from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Small Business Administration, and the city government to expand its housing-redevelopment efforts and small-business training. But with the dollars came headaches. For one thing, bureaucratic sluggishness delayed their redevelopment program. Earl describes how government bureaucrats held up the processing of contracts because they lacked computer skills. "Their turnaround time might be a month and your turnaround might be a day," Earl says. "But you've got to move by
 their timetable." <p>	Local government officials overseeing REACH's work also lacked "street sense," Earl says. When REACH rehabilitated homes with private money, it negotiated only with the city's building authority. "The building authority was flexible to the realities of rehabbing," he says. "For example, the houses have to have gutters and doors and other parts made of aluminum. But you can't put that stuff on until the house has people in it, because the crack heads will steal the aluminum and sell it for drugs." Building authorities typically approved the inspection as long as the materials were purchased and ready to be put on. Once the home was approved, the family could move in, and church volunteers put on the aluminum within 24 hours. <p>	Once REACH received local, state, and federal funds, other agencies, including the community development department, assumed various responsibilities for oversight. According to Earl, the officials there did not understand the realities of rehabilitation in the inner-city. "They wanted [the aluminum] on the house before they would even come out and inspect it," Earl says. "They said, 'Put it on the house and we'll be out within seven working days.' Well, it wouldn't stay on the house for seven working hours!"<p><b>Up Close and Impersonal</b><p>	One attraction of religion-based social-service groups is that they tend to be more personable than their secular counterparts. Workers in the religion-based providers often come from the local neighborhood and can relate well to clients. Moreover, ministry staff are often volunteers or are underpaid; they are there because they view their work as a calling rather than a job. Nearly everyone in social service agrees that a friendly, supportive environment stimulates improvements in behavior among welfare recipients. Consequently, the "impersonalization" or "bureaucratization" of a ministry can severely undercut its effectiveness.<p>	The process of "impersonalization" unfolds in a variety of ways. Ministries complain th
at government funding brings enormous paperwork that steals time away from face-to-face ministry. In addition, government often dictates that groups receiving public funds hire only staffers with specific educational degrees, such as a masters of social work (M.S.W.), or with certification in professional substance-abuse counseling programs. Such "professionalization" can undermine the informal, relational style that once prevailed between staff and recipients of care.<p>	"Part of the criticism of us now is that we're too professional, too polished; that we can't relate to the things that [local residents] are going through," says Linda Smith, a REACH staff member since its inception. In the organization's early years, says former executive director Charlene Johnson, about 70 to 100 volunteers participated in various aspects of the ministry. Today, REACH's office "volunteers" number three -- all from the federally funded Americorps program. REACH's current director, Pamela Martin Turner, says the organization is "developing personnel policies, formalized job descriptions with job titles and salary ranges, and other things that happen when you become more bureaucratic."<p>	Gary Bayer, who used to oversee a Detroit homeless shelter serving substance abusers, argues that ex-clients who have overcome their addictions make some of the best employees. They have walked the same streets as the drug abusers they now serve; they have the authority to challenge them, and teach them how to get off drugs and stay off them. But under the government's credentialing requirements, such "homegrown" leaders often aren't eligible for employment as counselors.<p>	While credentialing requirements are appropriate in certain kinds of social-service work (no one wants volunteer "doctors" providing them medical care), they may be unnecessary elsewhere. In Detroit, DSS director Sam Chambers and his friends in the religious social-service sector are trying to design more creative programs with a greater role for paraprofessionals and v
olunteers. Unfortunately, such collaboration seems to be exceptional.<p><b>Organizational Drift</b><p>	At its heart, a religion-based service provider aims to transform lives. Such a goal can be difficult to measure by objective, quantitative data. That's why program leaders, when conferring with supporters in the private sector, typically tell stories. Progress in personal transformation is often judged by such things as changed language, faithful attendance in education/training programs, increased punctuality and personal responsibility, willingness to work, improved social relations with staff, reaffiliation with family, avoidance of drugs, commitment to financial accountability, greater reliability, and increasing initiative and enthusiasm. These often intangible and "qualitative" changes are the very ones credited with permanent socioeconomic improvement. <p>	Government, by contrast, focuses on objective statistics, usually to measure the number of commodities provided to a needy person or neighborhood. Consequently, nonprofits receiving government funds start counting numbers and recording statistics. And to ensure continued receipt of state dollars, they may start investing more effort in programs that produce easily quantifiable results rather than in holistic ministry that produces qualitative change.<p>	REACH's Linda Smith reports that the tone of the group's programs has changed. Before receiving major government grants, the ministry emphasized "human development," with great attention to moral and spiritual matters. "Our experience showed that if we didn't do this, we could move people into a house, but they'd trash it and not make the mortgage payments," says former director Johnson. Now the ministry's help is more "commodified" (providing people material goods such as houses) and its work is more project-oriented than relationship-oriented. Under Johnson's tenure, the ministry's largest annual budget was $1 million, distributed across youth, family, and economic-development programs. Today, 
the thrust of REACH's energy is on housing rehabilitation and construction, programs for which they can obtain major federal and state grants. REACH recently secured a $1.7 million grant for a major housing initiative.<p>
"Government funding will not realistically finance your Christian, holistic, or evangelistic purpose. You can't use it for that," says Virgil Gulker, a guru of the religion-based service community who has founded numerous projects in Michigan for the poor. "So you end up evaluating quantitative things -- how many houses did you build, how many meals did you serve, how many jobs did you find -- that will have no impact on your organization's original purposes, other than to diminish that original purpose or mission."<p>
<b>Secularization</b><p>	Gulker's insights touch on the crux of the issue of government funding of religion-based providers: the potential danger of secularization. REACH's current executive director, Pamela Martin Turner, admits quite openly that REACH has "evolved into a more secular, more ecumenical organization than in past years. . . . To some large extent, the work of the past was primarily based on faith, on a commitment to spiritual and religious values. Whereas now, on the staff level, there may be some internal spiritual value that compels people to come to work, but that's not the explicit understanding. People come to work because it's their job and they're expected to do a good job."<p>	The de-emphasis on the spiritual comes with a cost: REACH staffers are less likely to bring their religious convictions to bear in addressing, confronting, and meeting the needs of the needy. "We do not talk about the spiritual needs at all," says Smith. "When we worked out of the church, I knew every day, without a doubt, why I was there." Now, she says, "some days I come to work and people come in and I feel like I can't help them because they need more than to just talk about putting them in a house. It's a struggle for me."<p>	People of faith, of course, are concerned about the threat of secularization. But others ought to be worried as well, for the dilution of a ministry's religious distinctiveness may remove the very element that makes it so effective in addressing social problems. <p>	Even ministries known for their spiritually integrated approach are susceptible. The Detroit-based Joy of Jesus accepts no government funding, but financial problems led it to incorporate a separate, not explicitly religious, nonprofit partner organization called R-3 that solicits state funds. These are used principally in the organization's housing-redevelopment program. The ministry also moved its job training program to R-3 because private donations were insufficient to maintain it. Instructor Kevin Feldman reports that 
he used to integrate biblical principles in the training curriculum and pray with his students, but had to stop once the organization received government funding. In Feldman's view, the result has been that "our success rate has dramatically declined." Fewer individuals are completing the program and fewer are finding and retaining jobs. <P>	After reviewing this ledger of potential pitfalls, some faith-based groups in Michigan have decided that accepting government funds is too risky. "In general, there's a need for collaborative effort between the public and private sectors," says Joel Samy of American Family Hope, a Michigan nonprofit that helps the working poor. "But it's in the best interests of a church-based ministry to have minimal involvement with government at the funding level." Like Virgil Gulker and others, Samy worries that religion-based providers will exchange their original mission -- with its emphasis on spiritual awakeningfor a governmental agenda. <p><b>Exceptions to the Rule</b><p>	Although the problems afflicting religious nonprofits in their collaboration with the state of Michigan are serious, they do not seem to be inevitable. Some religious agencies have been able to work with government entities, accept tax dollars, and avoid the pitfalls identified above. If Michigan builds on these successful examples of collaboration rather than replicating its faulty models, then Engler's goal of transforming lives by cooperating with nonprofits in social welfare could be advanced.<p>	Detroit Rescue Mission Ministries (DRMM) provides substance-abuse programs and emergency shelter for homeless men and women. It enjoys excellent relations with Wayne County's Sam Chambers and has collaborated for decades with the county department of social services. Chambers has established a community-wide planning board, including several religion-based providers, to discuss policy. Chambers welcomes input from the religious nonprofits. These groups, he explains, are closer to the needs, more "user-friendly,"
 and less bureaucratic and intimidating. Noting that Detroit has 4,000 churches but only 33 welfare offices, Chambers says it is obvious he can meet needs more effectively by tapping into the religious sector. Such groups "do a better job because they tend to treat the whole man," he says.<p>	Aware of the church-state issues involved, Chambers says his evaluations of the religious nonprofits his department works with are "outcome-based." His office enforces health and safety regulations and conducts financial audits, but does not interfere with ministries' internal policies and procedures. There is no attempt to force groups to change their holistic approach or extirpate their religious sensibilities. Chambers says he works with DRMM because the ministry's track record is stellar: It has helped turn around the lives of some of the toughest clients in the welfare system.<p>	This partnership works not only because the approach Chambers takes is one of genuine, respectful, and pragmatic collaboration, but also because DRMM has a clear vision for its ministry and strong leadership. Its president, Don DeVos, says he'll refuse any government grant that compromises the ministry's commitment to holistic ministry. So far, it seems, he has.<p>	In Grand Rapids, Bethany Christian Services works with the Kent County Department of Social Services to provide foster care for at-risk children and residential care for abused and neglected children and juvenile sexual offenders. Its relationship with government is, like DRMM's, cordial and long-standing. John Cole, the program manager for the local DSS, is the ministry's principal government contact. Like Chambers, Cole takes a results-oriented and respectful approach to the partnership. Cole says he "doesn't implement any policy without first developing it in draft form and asking the private groups what they think about it." His staff meets with BCS staff monthly, and he meets personally with BCS leaders quarterly to discuss policy design and implementation. <p>	Unfortunate
ly, according to Cole, this kind of genuine and broad-based collaboration is rare in Michigan. He says that, despite the governor's strong support for privatization, most county welfare offices are biased against purchasing welfare services from private nonprofits. Because of the entrenched state bureaucracy, Cole explains, "There's a preference for county departments to provide their own services." And even when local welfare departments do purchase services from nonprofits, they do not do so as part of a broad, genuine, partnership. "They may purchase services but I don't think they really believe that that's the way they ought to go. I've been in meetings where they [government officials] are very critical of the [private] agencies," Cole says. And at the state level, he says, "the arrangements are very much businesslike and one-sided," even "adversarial" at times.<p><b>Redefining the Relationship</b><p>	Some of the most fruitful state collaborations with religion-based social welfare groups in Michigan appear to rest largely on the goodwill of certain government officials who treat nonprofits as equals and are more interested in enabling religiously based organizations to transform lives than they are in rigorously enforcing a church-state divide. This is a shaky foundation for the partnerships, since such individuals could be replaced by less sympathetic officials. Clearly, a stronger foundation for public-private partnerships is needed. And it must be built soon, before, in our zeal for welfare reform and "devolution," a whole superstructure of arrangements between government and nonprofits is erected. <p>	Some religiously rooted groups will, of course, continue to avoid any involvement with state contracts as they offer help to the needy, and their effectiveness bolsters the case for others to do likewise. But some ministries believe that relying on public funds through state and federal agencies is desirable and potentially beneficial. My investigation into private non-profits in Michigan suggests s
everal steps that both government and faith-based providers could take to guard the integrity of groups that seek out government grants and contracts.<p>	To start, state lawmakers and agency officials need to listen more attentively to the good Samaritans on the front lines. When big government imperiously issues decrees from on high, its private "partners" bust their budgets trying to conform. Genuine collaboration would mean, at best, that ministries would have some say in designing the regulations. Or, at least, that government entities would allow their grassroots partners flexibility in achieving the intentions of the regulations, if not the letter of the law. Otherwise, "working together" means that ministries accomplish less with the "help" they receive from government than they would have in the absence of a state contract.<p>	Politicians must redefine "public-private partnership" to go beyond the "delivery system" model, which is principally concerned with saving money, not transforming lives. In this model, the state decides what services will be offered and then pays private groups to deliver them. Some recent initiatives by Engler suggest he is on the right track. For example, Engler's "Clergy Summit" in October shows an awareness not only of the cost-effectiveness of outreach by the religious community, but also of that community's moral authority in low-income neighborhoods. At the meeting, state officials are expected to solicit the help of pastors in publicizing welfare services. Says an Engler spokesman, "If we can tap into the moral authority and trust that the pastors have, we are much more likely to reach people than if we just hope that some bureaucratic edict from the impersonal state government is suddenly going to make things happen." Absolutely right.<p>	In addition, state officials are now discussing how to broaden their arrangement with the Salvation Army. Social service director Jerry Miller says the state now recognizes the partnership should go beyond the provision of emergency 
services: "We need to work to get [the homeless] into transitional housing" -- and, eventually, permanently off the streets. It remains to be seen whether the Army can conduct this additional work in a way that takes full advantage of its strengths as a religion-based provider of social services.<p>	The Engler administration can go even further. It can hold up the work of officials like Sam Chambers and John Cole as examples of a smart way to develop genuine, effective partnerships with religious organizations. It's not enough for Engler to praise collaboration with these nonprofits. His administration must clearly define the kind of collaboration that is desirable -- and it should look more like the partnership between Wayne County and the Detroit Rescue Mission than the current partnership between Lansing and the Salvation Army.<p>Finally, government officials must acknowledge the value of a religion-based, holistic approach to serving the needy, and take the necessary actions to ensure that ministries agreeing to work with the state do not thereby stumble into the traps discussed. The government welfare system has failed, not only because it is a poor deliverer of the standard package of welfare benefits, but because the package itself is flawed. Cash and commodities are not the things that transform poor people's lives. Religious welfare providers have a better record in changing lives not only because they deliver services more effectively, but because their services are different. They provide "goods" like love, emotional support, spiritual instruction, trust, accountability, moral authority, hope, character training, and basic life skillsall in the context of personal relationships with the poor. They suffer with and walk alongside needy people until those people are able to walk out of the underclass.<p>	Any arrangement with state agencies that fails to give this level of autonomy to religiously grounded outreach efforts may serve the interests of government bureaucrats or certain activists for the 
poor. But it will not, in the long run, help the needy to help themselves.<p><b>AMY L. SHERMAN</B>, <i>a visiting fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, is writing a book on urban ministry</i>.

John, 10, is one of America's children who waits. He waits for
a home, and he has been waiting nearly all of his life. When John
was a toddler, his drug-addicted mom lost her parental rights,
and claimed not to know who the father was. John has been legally
free to be adopted since he was three, but instead has lived in
state-run foster homes and group homes. While his childhood slips
away, John's social workers debate his best interests and the
programs they hope will address them. But this skinny kid who
loves baseball knows better: &quot;I'm all wrapped up in programs,&quot;
he says. &quot;What I need is a mom.&quot;  

<P>Across the country,
there are 50,000 foster children like John, who no longer live
with their mother or father and have been declared by courts as
free to be adopted, but who languish for months or years in state-run,
state-funded substitute care. On any given day, nearly 400,000
other children-none of them eligible for adoption-can be found
in government foster homes, group homes, and shelters. Many of
them are kept there by absentee parents clinging to the legal rights
to their children. 

<P>Foster care and adoption in America have sunk
to a state of near-catastrophe. 

<P>
According to the American Public
Welfare Association, the population of children in substitute
care is growing 33 times faster than the U.S. child population
in general. During each of the past 10 years, more children have
entered the system than exited. Every year, 15,000 children &quot;graduate&quot;
from foster care by turning 18 with no permanent family; 40 percent
of all foster children leaving the system end up on welfare, according
to the American Civil Liberties Union.  

<P>
What was for most of America's
history an entirely private endeavor has become a massive, inefficient
government system. State agencies consistently fail to recruit
enough families for the children eligible for adoption every year;
potential parents often are turned down because of racial considerations,
or turned off by protracted and unnecessary waiting periods; cumbersome
state regulations extend to private adoption agencies and can
even prohibit private attorneys from handling adoptions. The result
is that tens of thousands of children are now free to be adopted
but have nowhere to go. 

<P>
This is the dirty little secret of the
welfare state: Every child is adoptable, and there are waiting
lists of families ready to take in even the most emotionally troubled
and physically handicapped children. Government adoption policies
are utterly failing in their most basic purpose-to quickly place
children who are free to be adopted into permanent homes. 

<P>
The
problem lies not with the children. What keeps kids like John
bound to state care are the tentacles of a bureaucratic leviathan:
a public funding scheme that rewards and extends poor-quality
foster care; an anti-adoption bias that creates numerous legal
and regulatory barriers; and a culture of victimization that places
the whims of irresponsible parents above the well-being of their
children. 

<P>
I can identify with these kids. I was a foster child
in a family that cared for 110 children. That family-my family-adopted
me in the early 1970s. Years later, as a student at Harvard, I
happened upon a book of statistics on children in state care.
I was stunned to learn that decades of research, policymaking,
and government funding had only intensified the system's failures.
I was one of the lucky ones, but luck will not stem the tide of
parentless children. By the year 2000, well over a million children
will enter foster care, and tens of thousands of kids will become
eligible for adoption. Unless the government apparatus of foster
care and adoption is dismantled, these children could spend their
childhoods wishing for what most people take for granted: stability,
a family that will last longer than a few months, a last name.

<P><CENTER><B>Subsidizing</B></CENTER><BR>
Failure For years the rallying cry of many children's activists
has been: &quot;More money!&quot; The National Commission on Family
Foster Care, convened by the Child Welfare League of America,
says that &quot;family foster care and other child welfare services
have never been given the resources necessary&quot; to meet federal
standards, and calls for a &quot;fully funded array of child and
family welfare services.&quot; When it comes to child welfare,
rare is the research article that does not call for more money
and further research. 

<P>
America already is spending $10 billion
a year on foster care and adoption services through public agencies.
Federal dollars now account for nearly a third of all foster care
funding, with most of the rest coming from state coffers. California
alone spends at least $635 million a year on substitute care;
the District of Columbia spent $53 million last year on a system
that was so poorly run it recently was taken over by a federal
court. 

<P>
According to the ACLU, a year in foster care costs about
$17,500 per child, including per-child payments to foster families
and administrative costs of child welfare agencies. That does
not include counseling and treatment programs for biological parents
or foster parent recruitment and training. The <I>San Francisco
Chronicle</I> reports that per-child costs for foster home or
group home care have increased more than fourfold in the past
decade. 

<P>
The problem with foster care is not the level of government
spending, it is the structure of that spending. The funding system
gives child-welfare bureaucracies incentives to keep even free-to-be-adopted
kids in state care. State-social-service agencies are neither
rewarded for helping children find adoptive homes nor penalized
for failing to do so in a reasonable amount of time. There is
no financial incentive to recruit adoptive families. And as more
children enter the system, so does the tax money to support them
in substitute care.  

<P>
By contrast, private adoption agencies are
paid to find suitable families quickly, even if it means going
out of state. The public social-service bureaucracy, nearly overwhelmed
by other urban problems, has little to gain by devoting extra
resources to adoption. Private adoption agencies are free to focus
on finding homes for kids and are financially motivated to do
so. Private adoption agencies are paid according to the number
of successful placements; public agencies, in a sense, are paid
for the number of children they prevent from being adopted. 

<P>
There
is a similar reward for foster parents to keep kids in state care.
By law, adoption subsidies cannot exceed foster care payments,
and in practice they are almost always lower. According to the
National Foster Parent Association, foster families in 1993 received
anywhere from $200 to $530 a month for each child under age 10,
plus additional money from states and counties. The subsidies
are tax free, and foster parents receive more money as the children
under their care get older. So the longer the system fails to
find permanent homes for kids, the more money flows to those fostering.


<P>
In some states, payments to foster parents caring for four kids
equal the after-tax income of a $35,000-a-year job. The money
is tax free. It doesn't take much imagination to see that paying
people to parent can lead to mischief. Parents are not held accountable
for how they spend their federal and state allocations; for too
many foster parents, the children in their homes are reduced to
mere income streams. If foster parents don't wish to adopt the
children under their care, what incentive do they have to alert
other parents hoping to adopt?  

<P>
Let me be very clear: There are
many dedicated and compassionate people in the foster care system,
serving as case workers, counselors, and foster parents. My own
experience in foster care was a positive one. But I have seen
and heard of too many that were heartbreaking failures.

<P><CENTER><B>Special-Needs
Stigma</B></CENTER><BR>
I have heard perhaps a thousand times that the children
who wait cannot be adopted because they have &quot;special needs.&quot;
Of course they do-they need parents. They require love and nurturing
that endures. But the &quot;special needs&quot; referred to by
advocates come with federal dollars attached. In 1980, Congress
started offering states matching funds to assist the adoption
of children with special needs, which included children of various
ages, ethnic backgrounds, and those with severe mental and physical
handicaps who may require expensive care. The subsidy was to become
available only after a state determined that it could not reasonably
expect to place a child without it. 

<P>
As with so many other federal
subsidies, states quickly expanded their slice of the government
pie by broadening the criteria for receiving money. Today, nearly
two- thirds of all foster children qualify. In some states, special-needs
children include kids who have a sibling; are black, biracial,
Hispanic, or Native American; are &quot;older,&quot; as defined
by the state; or have been in foster care longer than 18 months.


<P>
Two leading adoption organizations report that there are no national
figures available that break down the type of need, or indicate
the number of children who have physical or emotional handicaps
that would require extra expenses by their new parents. This leaves
the door wide open to all sorts of graft and fiscal abuse.  

<P>But
there are other unintended and unconscionable consequences of
this masquerade. One is that the needs of very vulnerable children
are downplayed. The plight of a teen-age girl in a wheelchair
who requires constant attention is trivialized when she is included
in the same group as children whose &quot;needs&quot; are that
they are eight years old. Another result-one I see often-is that
local social-services departments discourage families from adopting
by telling them, &quot;Oh, these kids aren't for you. We only
have <I>special-needs</I> children.&quot; This emphasis on kids
with the most challenging emotional and physical handicaps unwittingly
contributes to the false notion that foster children are &quot;unadoptable.&quot;
Ironically, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980
that established special-needs matching funds warned that children
must not be &quot;routinely classified as 'hard-to-place.'&quot;
Government funding has had just that effect, and it is helping
to delay the placement of children ready for adoption.  

<P>
I am convinced
that the entire incentive structure for foster care and public
agency adoption helps perpetuate the system's failure. It is a
failure rooted in the notion that government funding is the panacea
for family disintegration. The National Commission on Family Foster
Care claims the foster care crisis is &quot;the logical result
of two decades of national neglect in providing funding and services
for children, youths, and their families.&quot; On the contrary,
as long as these children come with tax money attached-with little
in the way of accountability-those invested in perpetuating the
system will do little to reform it. As one foster child put it:
&quot;Everywhere I go, somebody gets money to keep me from having
a mom and dad.&quot;

<P>
<CENTER><B>Anti-Adoption Bias</B></CENTER><BR>  
Government funding schemes
and inefficiencies that prevent adoption exist within a larger
framework: a steadily growing bias against adoption. Despite all
the sociological evidence of the benefits of adoption, the conviction
that a child does best in a permanent, loving, and stable home
is all but missing from the ethos of state-run substitute care.
How can this be? 

<P>
In both the popular and elite media, a deep suspicion
of adoption is all too evident. Marvin Olasky, a professor at
the University of Texas at Austin, has noted that a New York Times
series on adoption included such headlines as &quot;The Ties that
Traumatize&quot; and &quot;Adoption is Getting Some Harder Looks.&quot;
And what do <I>Playboy</I>, <I>Mirabella</I>, and <I>Good Housekeeping
</I>have in common? As Olasky says, each has joined the offensive
with an article that warns readers against the &quot;distasteful
&#133; bartering of lives&quot; that supposedly is adoption. 

<P>
Television
writers would have us believe that adoption has no happy endings.
TV portrays adoption as shady, risky, and shameful. Over the last
year, a dozen programs featured adoption in their plots, and in
every case the adoption agency was depicted as callously profit-driven.
The adopting families were white, middle-class couples who kept
secrets from the authorities or from each other. Birth mothers
were unfairly portrayed as selfish or disturbed. The programs
paid little attention to the well-being of the children. 

<P>
Groups
such as Concerned United Birthparents (CUB) help give legal expression
to this bias. CUB was behind the &quot;Baby Jessica&quot; case
that led to the removal of a two-year-old from her adoptive family.
Groups like CUB claim that adoption is a feminist issue, that
only the outmoded ideal of a two-parent family makes the notion
of adoption palatable. As Olasky notes, Joss Sawyer's book <I>Death
by Adoption</I> calls adoption &quot;a violent act, a political
act of aggression toward a woman.&quot; 

<P>
Perhaps more significant,
however, is the battle against transracial adoption that has been
waged by the National Association of Black Social Workers (NABSW)
for more than two decades. Its 1972 position paper reads: &quot;Black
children belong physically, psychologically, and culturally in
Black families in order that they receive the total sense of themselves.&quot;
Otherwise, the group claims, black children &quot;will not have
the background and knowledge which is necessary to survive in
a racist society.&quot; Our institute has received letters from
adoptive families in many states who have been barred from adopting
transracially. According to the North American Council on Adoptable
Children, state adoption laws may allow for race-matching, but
 &quot;their preferencing policy isn't written down.&quot; 
 
<P>When
it comes to transracial adoptions, there is no longer much doubt
that current policies are bringing the greatest harm to the very
community they were intended to help: African Americans. Just
consider the numbers: Though black families adopt at very high
rates, black children represent nearly half of foster kids waiting
to be adopted. Fifteen percent of all children in America are
black; but 40 percent of the children in foster care are black.
State delays in finding homes for black children, as case workers
search for &quot;culturally consistent&quot; placements, can keep
kids languishing in state care for years. 

<P>
&quot;These policies
are seriously harmful to black children, requiring that black
kids who could get good homes be left in foster care,&quot; Harvard
law professor Elizabeth Bartholet told the <I>New York Times</I>.
&quot;There is not an iota of evidence in all the empirical studies
that transracial adoption does any harm at all.&#133;There is
plenty of evidence that delay in adoption does do harm.&quot;


<P>
Such policies reveal a profound misunderstanding of the nature
and effects of adoption. To insist that successful adoption means
placing a child in a family of his  racial or ethnic heritage
is to overlook what every adopted child understands intuitively:
Adoption is not easy. No matter how much a child's family looks
like him, it does not alter the fact that someone gave him up.
Having the same skin color as the people in his household doesn't
automatically erase that. Only love does. As someone who grew
up in a multi-ethnic family, I find it incomprehensible when people
tell me that I cannot love my siblings the way I could if our
skin color matched.

<P>
<CENTER><B>The Fallout</B></CENTER><BR>  
Attitudes against adoption, whether
racially motivated or not, share at least two flaws. First, they
ignore all the best evidence indicating that adoption leads to
positive outcomes for kids. Last year, the Search Institute of
Minneapolis released the largest study ever of adopted adolescents
and their families (see table above). The study, in which 881
adopted children and 1,262 adoptive parents were surveyed, found
that children who were adopted fared as well as or better than
a national sample of non-adopted adolescents in self-esteem, mental
health, school achievement-even the amount of time spent each
week helping others. Adopted adolescents were more likely to agree
or strongly agree with the statement &quot;There is a lot of love
in my family&quot; than were non-adopted children. 

<P>
Sociological
studies of transracial adoptions are equally encouraging. Rita
Simon of American University has conducted a 20-year longitudinal
study of transracial adoption. She found that such adoptions cause
none of the problems alleged by the NABSW. Rather, black children
adopted into white families typically &quot;grow up with a positive
sense of their black identity and a knowledge of their history
and culture.&quot; And such children, Simon says, often possess
&quot;special interpersonal talents and skills at bridging cultures.&quot;


<P>
Second, the anti-adoption movement fortifies the legal and bureaucratic
obstacles that are keeping children from finding permanent homes.
There are numerous state laws that needlessly complicate or block
the process. In Minnesota, for example, if filing deadlines and
other technical requirements of state adoption law are not precisely
met, parents can be prevented for months or years from finalizing
a child's adoption. Thanks to horror stories of baby-selling,
four states have laws that ban independent adoptions (though exceptions
are permitted). Despite this, more than 45,000 adoptions in 1992
were conducted through private agencies or independent agents-the
vast majority of them successfully. 

<P>
My office receives numerous
letters from people eager to adopt but frustrated by laws and
bureaucrats. One woman recently wrote: &quot;My husband and I
decided we would like to adopt a little girl, thinking we had
a lot of love, nurturing, and stability to give a child who had
been abandoned or abused. Almost immediately I hit a brick wall.&quot;
Her local department of social services-in a state with more than
5,000 foster children free to be adopted-told her it was &quot;not
taking new cases&quot; of families willing to adopt foster children.
A couple wrote that of their three adopted children, &quot;two
[had] lingered in foster care, one of whom we were not able to
adopt until he was age 18.&quot; 

<P>
<CENTER><B>Adoptable You</B></CENTER><BR>  
There is at least
one other mistaken notion that feeds the legal and cultural bias
against adoption-the idea that many of the children in foster
care are simply not adoptable. My own experience suggests otherwise,
as I was an older child when my foster parents adopted me. And
my experience with parents in and outside the foster care system
tells me that every child is adoptable. 

<P>
For every child who is
ready for a permanent home, there are families waiting. It is
time to shatter the myth that adoptive parents are interested
only in &quot;healthy white babies.&quot; There are waiting lists
to adopt white children, black children, Hispanic children, infants
and teens, children with Down's syndrome and with AIDS. Private
agencies for years have found families for all types of children.
Adopt a Special Kid, a California-based service, receives more
than 1,500 inquiries annually from families interested in adopting
children with disabilities. The National Adoption Center maintains
a computerized listing of 650 qualified families waiting to embrace
disabled &quot;older&quot; children. The center reports that infants,
even the most severely disabled, are adopted almost immediately.


<P>
Outside of the thousands of families who have successfully completed
home studies and have registered with with their states, there
are no hard figures for the number of parents able and willing
to adopt. Certainly there are families who would come forward
if public agencies recruited more aggressively. Beginning in November,
1993, Massachusetts stepped up its recruitment efforts with public-service
announcements, an aggressive media campaign, adoption &quot;open
houses,&quot; and community-based recruitment. Such efforts helped
increase foster child adoptions by 47 percent in one year. 

<P>
Most
people know someone who has gone to heroic lengths to adopt. Americans
adopted more than 7,300 children from other countries in 1993,
according to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.
The INS estimates that the 1994 figure exceeds 8,000. Others have
spent their life savings to offer permanence to a child; domestic
adoption through private agencies or independent attorneys can
cost more than $30,000. It is not unusual for foster parents to
adopt two, five, or even 10 children under their care. Clearly,
the barriers to adoption are neither the characteristics of children
who wait nor the parents who want to care for them.

<P>
<CENTER><B>The Route toFoster Care</B></CENTER><BR>
In addition to the 50,000 children who today are
legally free to be adopted, there are hundreds of thousands more
who drift for days, months, or years within the state-run system-a
system that too often guarantees a parentless future for some
of society's most vulnerable members. 

<P>
Children enter foster care
for a variety of reasons. Mom abuses or neglects one of her kids,
dad is using drugs or is arrested for a felony, or perhaps the
parents are just having a hard time coping with the responsibilities
of parenthood. The American Public Welfare Association reports
that 70 percent of foster children enter the system because of
abuse, neglect, or &quot;parental conditions&quot;-including drug
addiction, incarceration, illness, or death. More than 600,000
kids will spend all or part of 1995 in substitute care, up from
434,000 in 1982. 

<P>
A profile of children in state care belies the
stigma that foster children are mostly &quot;unadoptable&quot;
troubled teens. Researchers at the Chapin Hall Center for Children
at the University of Chicago studied five states whose foster
care children make up about half of the U.S. foster care population.
They found that from 1990 to 1992, nearly 25 percent of all first
admissions to foster care were babies less than one year old.
Between 1983 and 1992, the proportion of 12- to 15-year-olds entering
substitute care in those states declined. The American Public
Welfare Association cites similar trends.   

<P>
Sadly, the youngest
children remain in the system the longest. The University of Chicago
study revealed that, after controlling for other factors, children
who enter foster care as infants remain in the system 22 percent
longer than other young children.  

<P>
The fact remains, however,
that foster care is failing children of all ages. The ACLU reports
that one in 10 foster children remains in state care longer than
7.4 years. At least 40,600 foster children have been in care for
five years or longer; another 51,300 have been in care between
three and five years. System kids, on average, live with three
different families, though 10 or more placements is not uncommon.
&quot;Every new placement is a loss,&quot; says Michael B. Pines,
a psychologist specializing in attachment disorders. &quot;The
result is that these kids begin not to trust anyone.&quot; 

<P>
<CENTER><B>Paidto Parent</B></CENTER><BR>
One of the reasons that foster care tends to ensnare
children in a legal and emotional limbo is that its bureaucracy
and incentive system attract parents who are unable or unwilling
to adopt or help find homes for the children in their care. 

<P>
Whether
adopting through private or public adoption agencies, would-be
parents must undergo a home study.  Private agencies, which must
successfully place children in homes to stay in business, are
free to set higher standards for parents than public agencies
do. Christian or other faith-based adoption agencies typically
emphasize tough standards of behavior. But this is not so for
state-run substitute care. In many states, adults who fail the
adoption home study get a consolation prize: They can become foster
parents. Deemed unworthy to serve as legal adoptive parents, these
adults are then paid handsomely to raise children in state care.

<P>
Foster homes, group homes, and public orphanages share another
vice: Their government money comes with regulations attached.
This often guarantees confusion and conflict. Private orphanages
always have been driven by a mission:  keep girls from getting
pregnant, keep children in school, expose children to the Christian
faith, and so on. They use a combination of rules and rewards,
discipline and love to fulfill their mission. Often, this isn't
allowed in a state-run group home, where it may be against the
law to hug a child, or to lock the door after midnight, or even
to advertise for a married couple to serve as housemasters.  

<P>
If
a permanent, loving family is the surest route to producing happy,
well-adjusted children, then what effect does the foster care
system, at its worst, have on countless kids? The result of the
system's delays, incentive structure, and regulatory grip is that
many former foster children ultimately remain dependent on state
services. They are wildly over-represented among welfare recipients,
the homeless, and in juvenile and adult prison populations. In
Los Angeles County, 39 percent of homeless youth are former foster
children. In New York, 23 percent of the homeless were once in
foster care; in Minneapolis, the figure is 38 percent. According
to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, former foster children make
up nearly 14 percent of America's prison population.

<P>
<CENTER><B>Culture ofVictimization</B></CENTER><BR>  

The financial disincentives to adoption and the
legal and societal biases against it do not exist in a vacuum;
they are rooted in the soil of victimization. More than half of
the children who enter foster care were abused or neglected in
their families of origin. But the current system grants &quot;victim
status&quot; to these parents. It often allows them to cling to
their parental rights as they move in and out of social service
programs. As a result, tens of thousands of children remain trapped
in foster care, never free to be adopted into stable, loving homes.


<P>
Take the case of Halie (not her real name), a two-year-old girl
who one day wouldn't eat her dinner. Her mother and mother's boyfriend
tied her to an electric heater. Hours passed, until Halie's face,
chest, and arm were disfigured. Her mother then threw her into
a cold shower, dressed her, and took her to a hospital-claiming
the child had spilled hot water on herself. After weeks of hospitalization,
Halie entered foster care. For the next 10 years, her biological
mother-coached by the local department of social services-maintained
her legal rights to the child. Case workers helped Halie's mom
to toe the official line to prove she somehow was still capable
as a parent: She married her boyfriend and had a child with him.


<P>
When Halie was 12, her case workers and a judge approved overnight
and extended visits between Halie and her biological mother. Halie's
mother rejected a judge's offer to regain custody. She didn't
want to raise Halie, but didn't want to let her go, and the state
gave her all the legal and financial help she needed. Halie spent
her teen years in group homes and foster homes. She turned 18
in foster care. 

<P>
Most states give biological parents every possible
chance to prove they are fit-while their babies grow up in state
care. A family recently wrote me about their two-year-old foster
daughter: &quot;She is precious beyond belief, and her parents
are being given chance upon chance to clean up their lives-at
her expense, as we see it. She is so adoptable by the right family,
but the system will keep her under lock and key for years if necessary
for her parents' benefit.&quot; 

<P>
In our social-work schools, counseling
centers, and government-funded research, the culture of victimization
insists that the most despicable behavior by abusive parents has
its causes in economics, racism, broken homes-anything but the
consciences and moral choices of men and women. We have devised
a foster care system that puts a vogue pop psychology ahead of
the well-being of children. This helps explain why roughly a third
of all the foster children who are reunited with their families
of origin soon return to state care. Indeed, it is the only explanation
for some of the bizarre attempts I have seen to reunite a foster
child with a parent who is clearly unwilling or unfit. 

<P>
Under federal
law, states cannot obtain federal funds for foster care unless
&quot;reasonable efforts&quot; are made to keep members of the
family of origin together (&quot;family preservation&quot;) or
to reunite the family ( &quot;family reunification&quot;). But
the federal government nowhere defines &quot;reasonable efforts,&quot;
and only a few states have specific statutes. It's a classic Catch-22:
Children are not free to be adopted until every reasonable effort
is made to return them to their biological parents. But almost
no one seems to know what constitutes a reasonable effort, that
is, what services must be offered to parents who need outside
help. 

<P>
When, for example, a public agency reports to a judge that
a mother has failed her drug-treatment program, the judge is likely
to insist that the mom enter every drug treatment program available.
So biological parents are given multiple chances to fail at parenting,
while children may bounce between state care and their family
of origin. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) admits
that the inability to meet &quot;reasonable efforts&quot; standards
is the primary barrier to foster child adoption. 

<P>
From my own experience
in foster care, the most difficult part was watching my brothers
and sisters return to biological parents who had burned or beaten
them, or put out cigarettes on their children's bottoms. I felt
like an accomplice. It must have been hard for my parents, who
could do nothing to stop it. 

<P>
Most foster parents, at one point
or another, must relinquish a child to a home situation that is
precarious. One foster mother of five years wrote: &quot;I have
been seriously reconsidering my position as a foster parent because
when we started this it was to try to help these children, and
I am finding out that I am not able to do that. The pain and heartbreak
of not being able to protect these children is a heavy burden
to bear.&quot; Until the system is reshaped, it is a burden that
every one of us carries.

<P>
<CENTER><B>Assignment: Adoption</B></CENTER><BR> 
It is one thing to
tolerate inefficiencies and bureaucratic delays in other areas
of public life-public toll roads, for example. Such inefficiencies
don't cost children 18 years of their lives. We do not need another
study, or blue-ribbon commission, or congressional subcommittee
hearing. When I was four years old, it didn't matter to me that
someone was getting a research grant to study the effects of foster
care on childhood development. What I wanted was a last name.


<P>
I am convinced that there are more parents willing to adopt than
there are children ready to be adopted. But the market for adoption
is frustrated by the regulatory system now in place. To create
a more efficient system, one with incentives to help rather than
abandon innocent children, we must get Big Government out of the
business of parenting. I do not mean we should create a market
in babies. I am not talking about baby-selling. I am talking about
serving babies and children by removing the barriers to their
enjoyment of stable, loving homes.  

<P>
Where parts of foster care
and adoption are privately run, competition and incentives have
led to better outcomes for children. In Michigan, where two-thirds
of foster care management is privatized, private providers spend
less per child, yet have achieved better social worker-to-child
ratios than those of state-run agencies. Adoption is, in fact,
the ultimate form of privatization: wresting authority over children's
lives from the state and allowing children to be free, to be raised
not by government but by parents.  

<P>
We must reform, state by state,
our system of transferring parental rights-from the government,
which can never be a parent, to parents who are eager and able
to bring these children into their hearts and lives. Congress
recently has taken interest in adoption reform by proposing a
$5,000 tax credit for adoptive parents. But will that tax credit
get children out of foster care more quickly? No. Does it stimulate
a market in private adoptions? No. Does it allow independent adoptions
in states where they are now outlawed? No. 

<P>
Tax credits might make
adoption a little easier for some parents, but they will not make
adoption work. To do that, we need reform at the federal and state
levels-bureaucratic reform that will shatter the incentive structure
that traps kids in foster care, and legal reform that will free
children who already have spent years in substitute care. In Massachusetts,
we call it &quot;Assignment: Adoption,&quot; a comprehensive plan
that our institute is bringing before federal lawmakers and state
governors: 

<P>
<B>Hold states accountable for reporting their progress
in finding homes for children in foster care.</B> Here is one federal
mandate that states ought to be obliged to take on. Washington
should require that states make publicly available, within 30
days of the close of each fiscal year, the following information:
(1) the number of foster children in state care; (2) the number
of foster children free to be adopted and still in state care,
but not in pre-adoptive placements; (3) the number of state-recruited
families with completed home studies. 

<P>
Most conservatives right
now wouldn't touch a federal mandate with a 10-foot pole. I would
prefer to see an entirely private system that includes a strong
charitable element. Until that happens, a few basic requirements
on the states are in order. We're talking about giving children
a mother and a father. And until we know the depth of the problem
in each state, until the number of kids waiting for homes becomes
part of our thinking and vocabulary, state agencies are unlikely
to change. There are people in our state departments of social
services who know these numbers, but we're not hearing them. 

<P>
<B>Prohibit
race-based delays in adoption.</B> Congressional attempts to outlaw
race-matching in adoption have yet to free tens of thousands of
children of color from foster care. This summer, the U.S. Senate
will consider a welfare-reform bill that prohibits race-based
delays in adoption. Even if Congress approves the bill, its impact
could be minimal. 

<P>
Recall that the Multiethnic Placement Act of
1994, sponsored by former U.S. Senator Howard Metzenbaum, had
a similar goal, but it was watered down. Under guidelines released
by HHS in April, the new law allows adoption agencies to consider
the child's &quot;cultural, ethnic, and racial background.&quot;
As reported by the Washington Post, the guidelines &quot;stopped
far short of requiring that adoption must be colorblind.&quot;


<P>
It is at this point that the discrepancies between legal precedent,
public policy, and social-work practices become painfully clear.
The HHS guidelines have not overturned any state laws requiring
that race be considered in adoption. And with vaguely written
state statutes, case workers will continue to have a lot of power
over whether a child will be adopted or languish in long-term
&quot;temporary&quot; care. 

<P>
Suppose every state had adoption policies
that were truly colorblind. We at the Institute for Children are
challenging governors to remove any and all restrictions to adoption
based on race. What would happen if thousands of children of color
grew up in white or mixed-race families? It would produce an amazing
generation of young people who, instead of growing up without
a last name or a permanent home, were raised by loving parents
in a diverse, multicultural environment. Why are some black leaders
so afraid of that? If their real agenda is the well-being of children,
then the evidence is in. Children are infinitely better off in
a loving, interracial home than as virtual orphans in foster care.


<P>
<B>End government funding that creates incentives to keep children
in substitute care for longer than 12 months.</B> Part of the problem
is that government money extends indefinitely, with no sanctions
enforced against  bureaucratic delays. The Adoption Assistance
and Child Welfare Act of 1980 required a &quot;permanency plan&quot;
for every child within 18 months of entering foster care. This
means that case workers decide whether to reunite a child with
his family, place him in long-term fostering, an independent living
arrangement, a group home, or make him  free for adoption. Adoption
is the permanency plan for 100,000 foster children, but no one
knows how often these plans result in permanent homes for children.


<P>
Deadlines for permanency plans come and go, court dates are postponed,
files are lost as children are shuffled among foster families.
A federal study reveals that children spend, on average, 30 to
42 months in foster care before adoption is even decided on as
a permanency plan. Once that happens, the state files a petition
to terminate parental rights; the filing can take another six
months or more. A report by HHS admits that in some states &quot;children
had an official plan of adoption for more than three years, but
no petitions had been filed.&quot;  

<P>The result is that in probably
every state there are children who have been in foster care longer
than 10 years. Meanwhile, the money to support children in state-run
care keeps coming, with no consequences to the state bureaucracies
that fail to place children.  

<P>
<B>Require that states find adoptive
homes for children within 30 days after the termination of parental
rights.</B> The foster child who is freed for adoption typically has
been in the system for at least two years and has had a permanency
plan of adoption for at least one year. Yet, as children become
legally free to be adopted, states claim to need more time to
find families for them! Our institute recommends a 30-day window:
If the state does not have a qualified family waiting, one who
has met the child and is ready to proceed with the adoption, then
state officials must contract out the adoption process to a private
agency. Qualified families exist in large numbers, and private
adoption agencies are pretty good at finding them. Three years
ago, Michigan launched a carrot-and-stick program with public
and private adoption agencies to get kids into permanent homes
more quickly. Since then, total adoptions are up, and the number
of black children adopted has increased by 121 percent-about 700
kids in the past year alone. 

<P>
Critics call this baby-selling and
claim that government should not act like a business. As someone
who has seen the machinery of the state from the inside, I argue
that government could promote children's well-being much more
effectively if it acted more like a business. I am not alone in
noting the failure of foster care management. The director of
the ACLU's Children's Rights Project recently wrote, &quot;If
the foster care system were considered a business, with its profit-and-loss
statements judged in terms of unnecessary human suffering inflicted
by mismanaged systems, in terms of misspent dollars, or even in
terms of how far these systems depart from their own goals, it
would have been forced into bankruptcy long ago.&quot;

<P>
<CENTER><B>Getting
Kids Out of Limbo</B></CENTER><BR> 

All of the above reforms are aimed at getting
the children now eligible for adoption into permanent homes as
quickly as possible. But there are more than 600,000 children
in foster care at some point during the year. Most of those kids
are happily reunited with their parents. Many of them, however,
become trapped in the state-run system-children who are never
free to be adopted, but who will not or should not return to their
biological parents. There are at least three steps every governor
could take to rescue these children from the worst effects of
foster care and help them find a home: 

<P>
<B>Make entrance requirements
for foster families as stringent as those for adoptive families.</B>
In the wake of a wave of child deaths in foster care, people are
beginning to speak out about the need to raise the standards for
being licensed as a foster parent. As one advocate put it, to
be a foster parent &quot;all you need is a clean criminal record
and an extra bed.&quot; People who have failed an adoption home
study can sign up with the state as foster parents. Foster children
deserve better than that. 

<P>
Critics argue that if we raise the requirements
for foster families, there won't be enough qualified people to
take care of the kids. I have more confidence in the generosity
of the American people. I think if you raise the requirements,
you'll see more foster parents and better care. Look, for example,
at private schools with higher requirements and lower teacher
salaries than public schools; they  continue to attract excellent
teachers and deliver a quality education. By maintaining a separate
set of standards for foster parents than those for adoptive parents,
we are saying to a half-million kids that it is not important
where they spend the most formative years of their lives. 

<P>
But
this is not the only disgrace in foster-parent licensing and training
procedures. In state-sponsored training courses, foster parents
are admonished, &quot;Do not get too close to your foster children.
Do not form a bond.&quot; Foster parents are instructed that their
main task is to facilitate a child's return to his or her biological
parents. From day one, good foster parents are discouraged from
adopting. 

<P>
Certainly there is a stigma attached to being a foster
parent-the system has created it. It is that stigma that discourages
many capable and loving people from fostering. If the entrance
requirements for fostering were as high as those for adopting,
foster children would be better cared for. The anti-adoption establishment
wouldn't like it, because it would ruin the standard argument
that foster parents are not adequate to adopt. 

<P>
<B>Allow no more than
12 months for biological parents to prove their fitness to resume
custody of their children.</B> This may be the most difficult law
to pass at the state level, but it also may be the most desperately
needed. State laws can be so vaguely written and so easily assailable
that termination of parental rights is always a last resort and
can take years of court hearings. There are many in the field
who believe it is almost always better to send children back to
their natural parents. The Child Welfare League promotes the notion
that &quot;no one can truly substitute for the family of origin.&quot;


<P>
I agree that nature provides every child with two protectors-a
man and a woman-and that we're meant to be with our biological
parents. But nature didn't design women's bodies to endure crack
cocaine; it didn't design children to be shaken until they suffer
cerebral hemorrhages. Family preservation doesn't work in these
cases because there is nothing left to preserve. 

<P>
State governors
should take the lead in setting tough sanctions against parents
who neglect or abuse their kids. By setting a deadline for parents
to get their lives together-to get off drugs, get out of jail,
find a place to live, and even get a job or go to school-we remind
them that they really are responsible for their actions. But the
deadline must be final and incontestable; otherwise, irresponsible
parents will continue to imprison their children in a labyrinth
of legal battles and parentless foster care. The 12-month limit
has yet to be adopted by any state and is indeed a radical departure
from the years it can now take to legally separate a child from
unfit parents. 

<P>
<B>Allow no more than 30 days from the birth of the
child for biological fathers to formalize paternity.</B> The &quot;Baby
Jessica&quot; and &quot;Baby Richard&quot; cases have demonstrated
the law's allowance for biological fathers who come out of the
woodwork to claim their children after they've been adopted. In
the now pending &quot;Baby Emily&quot; case, a little girl born
in 1992 was soon placed for adoption after the father's rights
were terminated for abandonment (he was doing jail time for a
rape conviction). But now the father is out of prison and has
sued for custody of his daughter. The adoptive family's finances
have been completely exhausted as the case awaits adjudication
in Florida's supreme court. 

<P>
Governor William Weld of Massachusetts
has sent to the legislature a proposal that, if passed, will prevent
such tragic cases in Massachusetts. The proposal requires every
unwed biological father to formalize paternity within 30 days
of the child's birth, and to maintain contact with the child and
provide financial support to the best of his ability-or forfeit
his right to contest the child's adoption. Ideally, that would
mean no appeals, no hearings, no state officials pulling children
out of their adoptive homes. The legislation, if not severely
amended, could serve as a model for state reform.

<P><CENTER><B>A Life That Matters</B></CENTER><BR>
A teenage girl-we'll call her Sarah-who worked for our institute
last summer was a system kid; she had turned 18 in foster care.
This was her first job and she was surprised when she noticed
that taxes had been taken out of her paycheck. She asked me what
the government would do with her money. In my usual non-partisan
spirit, I explained how the federal government would spend the
$300 withheld from her summer earnings. She actually started to
cry. She looked at me and asked, &quot;Will it go to pay for foster
care?&quot; She said it hurt her that she had worked so hard only
to help the government keep some other child from being adopted.
 

<P>
That's what the system is doing to our children. Though my own
experience in foster care was a good one, it opened my eyes to
the real hardships of countless children. My foster brothers and
sisters who might have gone back safely to their families of origin
too often and for too long were delayed from doing so. Others
lived the saddest stories of rejection-they had been burned, beaten,
sodomized or battered, left in a doorway or in a fruit field,
but later sent &quot;home&quot; to their abusers. Like foster
children everywhere, many who could have been adopted were denied
the chance to be loved and cherished by a family who would always
be there. 

<P>
Let's be honest: Adoption is no fairy tale. It is a
risk. Kids don't always go home and live happily ever after. But
every parentless child knows the alternative: the feeling that
there is no one to whom her &quot;case&quot;-that is, her life-really
matters.  

<P>
When parents adopt, they can accomplish something government
cannot: They can convince a child she matters. That's what makes
adoption such a great gift, an expression of unconditional love
and compassion. Don't we, as a society, owe that gift to our children?

At least 90,000 children have been in foster longer than three
years. One in ten foster children remains in care longer than 7
years.
<P>
The population of children in substitute care is growing 33 times
faster than the overall U.S. child population. Every year, 15,000
foster children turn 18 with no permanent family.

<p>
Suppose you are 20 years old and earning $10,000 a year. You and your employer are paying $1,240 a year in Social Security taxes. That's 12.4 percent of your hard-earned income, for benefits that you will never see.<p>
Suppose instead you could invest that same $1,240, as well as an additional $2.50 a week. By the time you are 65, thanks to the magic of compound interest, you would be a millionaire. You would be assured a comfortable retirement.<p>
This isn't a game-show fantasy. This isn't a lottery jackpot. It is a realistic goal. But unlocking this economic opportunity means revolutionizing Social Security. Every American who earns $10,000 a year or more can become a millionaire over the course of one working lifetime45 years. By the year 2000, there will be over 100 million Americans who fall in this category.<p>
In a recent survey, Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 reported they are more likely to see a UFO (46 percent) than their Social Security benefits (28 percent). They're right. The Social Security trust fund starts running out of money, under current projections, in the year 2013. If you're 20 today, that's when you turn 38. By the year 2030, when you turn 55, the fund will be short $200 billion a year and be unable to meet one quarter of its obligations. By the year 2042, when you turn 67 and reach your so-called normal retirement age, the fund will have an accumulated debt of $4.7 trillion. I'm not making this up. This isn't science fiction. These numbers come from the 1994 report of the trustees of the Social Security system.<p>
You could get all your benefits, of course, if there were an enormous tax increase for your children and grandchildren. According to the Social Security trustees, honoring existing promises for Social Security and Medicare benefits will require a rise in payroll taxes from the current level of 15.3 percent to 25.7 percent in 2030. But that simply isn't going to happen. Americans are already overtaxed. Do you think they'll put up with 25 percent payroll taxes, and federal income taxes, plus state and local taxes on top of that?<p>
Some politicians will tell you not to worry: Social Security is building up a big trust fund that will take care of all those promises. By the end of this year, the trust fund will have $475 billion in assetson paper. By 2020, there will be $3 trillion on paper. The trouble is, when the program needs the money, the money will already have been spent on everything the federal government spends money on. To redeem its IOUs to the trust fund, the federal government will have to borrow money or raise taxesby over $36,000 per familyjust as if the trust fund had no assets at all.<p>
So you and your employer are now paying one eighth of your income to pay for the Social Security benefits of current retirees, and to build up an illusory trust fund. Meanwhile, your own retirement is in jeopardy.<p>
No wonder younger Americans fear they are on a treadmill. No wonder there is so much trepidation about the future of the country. No wonder we have a savings crisis: our savings are being spent. No wonder most Americans now say their children will enjoy less opportunity than they do. <p>
It doesn't have to be this way. Social Security can be saved without raising taxes, and without lowering the benefits or cost-of-living adjustments of existing retirees. Social Security can be saved in a way that will open up opportunity for younger peopleso that their standard of living will be better than that of their parents and grandparents. If we use the principles of democratic capitalism to reform Social Security, the 20-year-old making the minimum wage can become a millionaire by the time he or she retires.<p>
Most Americans are on a treadmill because they have but one source of income: wages. The way to get ahead is to earn income from capital. Money makes money. With capital, you can retire in comfort and bequeath a nest egg to your children.<p>
Here is the beauty of capitalism. Any American currently earning $12,580 or more pays $30 a week, or $1,560 a year, into Social Security. Imagine that, beginning at age 20, you invest that $30 a week at market rates. When you retire, you'll be a millionaire. Whoever earns at least the minimum wage can become a millionaire in 45 years.<p>
The secret is compound interest. Let's assume a long-term return on your investments of 8 percent a year. (This is a prudent assumption; the annual return on the Standard & Poor's 500 over the past 70 years, including the Great Depression, is actually 10.19 percent.) If you can save $30 a week ($1,560 a year), after 10 years the value of your portfolio is $29,000. After 20 years, it is $110,000. After 30 years, it is $318,000. Forty years$822,000. And 45 yearsthe normal working lifetime$1.3 million. After 50 years, if you work until age 70, the value of your portfolio crescendoes to an estimated $2 million.<p>
You wouldn't exactly be a millionaire in today's dollars. If we adjust for inflation of about 4 percent a year, your portfolio of $1.3 million after 45 years would be closer to $230,000. That's still a larger nest egg than most working Americans even dream of. With that amount of capital, you could purchase an annuity at age 65 that would give you $18,256 a year (in today's dollars) during your retirement years.<p>
The way to save Social Security is to make the magic of compound interest work for its beneficiaries. I've been developing a proposal that will save Social Securityand enable 100 million Americans to become millionaires. The plan keeps Social Security as a mandatory, redistributive savings program, but it converts the program from the current pay-as-you-go system to a funded system, in which individuals own retirement portfolios at Social Security and choose private investment managers. Individuals would be allowed to set aside portions of their Social Security payments, together with additional voluntary contributions, in their own personal accounts. They could use their accounts for retirement income and pass on the capital tax free to their children. The plan has four basic elements:<p>
Pay existing obligations to all current retirees. Social Security benefits would be paid to all existing retirees, as promised, without changes, and without reductions.<p>
Divide Social Security into two tiers. If you are working now, you and your employer would continue to pay existing Social Security taxes of 12.4 percent on the first $61,200 of your income. Some of that would go to pay the benefits of existing recipients. Some of your payments would go into your own personal account. Payroll taxes would not rise from their current level. They would be cut by 2 percentage points around the year 2040.<p>
The benefits of current retirees would be paid out of the first tiercurrent payroll taxes. When they retire, current workers would draw benefits from two Social Security sources: income from future payroll taxes and income from their personal retirement accounts.<p>
Create personal investment and retirement accounts for the second tier of Social Security. Every worker who earns at least $4,000 would have his own IRA-like account with Social Security. (Unlike an IRA, you could use your account only for retirement, and could not withdraw from it earlier.) The first $500 that you and your employer pay into Social Security every year would be automatically deposited in your personal retirement account. You could increase the deposit in your personal retirement account by up to $3,000 per year by making voluntary contributions that would be matched by Social Security taxes you are already paying. The size of the match would vary according to income.<p>
Here's an example: If you earn $10,000 a year and you contribute $1,240 per year, the first $500 of this money would be paid into your personal account. If you add a savings match of $130, the Social Security program will deposit an additional $610 of tax money you are already paying into the fund into your personal retirement account, for a total of $1,240 per year. In 45 years, your portfolio will be $1,026,524 and you're a millionaire.<p>
If you are making $50,000, you might wish to put the maximum of $3,000 per year into your personal account at Social Security; $1,500 of the $3,000 comes from taxes you are already paying, and $1,500 comes from additional funds you save from your income, that is, from a personal-savings match. In 45 years, your portfolio would be $2.5 million.<p>
This money would be in your name, you would own it, and you would be in charge of picking an investment manager to invest it for you. Social Security would set up a corporation whose only purpose is to certify and approve private-sector money managers. (Criteria would include performance and experience in money management, years in business, and certfiably good character.) You would pick your investment manager from this list, and could switch to a different one any time you wanted. This sort of system is already working well in Chile.<p>
Use your capital account to increase your retirement income, and pass on your assets tax free to your children. When you retire, you would have two attractive choices of what to do with your capital account. One would be to use income from your capital (5 percent a year) for your retirement benefitsand then, when you die, to pass on your entire capital account tax free to your children or heirs. The second would be to purchase an annuity with your capital account, and receive higher retirement benefits during your lifetime but not pass any assets on to your children or heirs. <p>
Based on current life-expectancy charts, when you reach 65 you can expect to live, on average, to age 83, an additional 18 years. With an annuity you could currently receive an estimated 7.9 percent return per year.<p>
If you have a small portfolio when you retire, your Social Security benefits would be paid as promised out of the income from your capital (5 percent a year), as well as payroll taxes from future workers. Suppose, for instance, you have $100,000 in your personal account, and promised Social Security benefits of $10,000 a year. You would receive $5,000 in Social Security income from your capital, and $5,000 through the regular payroll-tax base. When you die, you would then be able to pass your retirement assets on to your children or heirs.<p>
As portfolios grow through compound interest, however, tens of millions of retirees would have the opportunity to increase their benefits. Twenty-year-olds today earning $10,000 a year will retire at age 65 in 2040. If the wages keep up with expected inflation, their final wages will be $15,236. Their promised present-law Social Security benefits will be $9,121 per year (a 59.9 percent replacement level). If payroll taxes are not increased, Social Security benefits would be reduced 24.4 percentfrom $9,121 to $6,892 per year.<p>
Under the Beard system, these retirees would have $1,026,524 in their personal accounts with Social Security ($182,769 in today's money). If they choose an annuity, their Social Security benefits will be $14,511 per year$5,390 higher than present-law Social Security promises. If they wish to pass the $1,026,524 tax free onto their children or heirs, their benefits will be $9,138.<p>
It would be enormously expensive to move from a pay-as-you-go to a funded Social Security system. Annual deposits into personal capital accounts would begin at over $100 billion per year and climb to over $200 billion per year (in today's dollars) by 2040. And this would be in addition to the massive deficits already projected for Social Security beginning in 2013. How can America possibly afford these expenses? The money would come from five sources. <p>
Over time, the largest increase in Social Security revenue would come from the income of the new capital accounts. By 2040, after 45 years in operation, the estimated value of retirees' capital accounts in today's dollars would be $8 trillion, almost double the current value of the private pension system. If we assume 5 percent income from capital to pay retirement benefits, retirees would receive over $400 billion every year from their capital (in today's dollars).<p>
Social Security payroll taxes currently exceed payments by about $25 billion a year. This surplus would go into the personal capital accounts. So would the $475 billion in assets that have supposedly accumulated in the Social Security trust fund. Those assets don't really exist, but workers have paid extra taxes on the federal government's promise that the surplus would go to a trust fund. Amortized over 20 years, the trust fund could be drawn down at the rate of $30 billion a year. In practice, this will mean that other federal expenditures will have to be cut by the same amount, bonds of $30 billion will have to sold to the public, or taxes will have to be raised by $30 billion.<p>
Some $60 billion a year would be saved through a special debt instrument we call the Liberty Bond. The Liberty Bond would be a voluntary 30-year interest-paying instrument. After 30 years, heirs and designees would receive principal and interest tax free. It would be marketed to retirees who do not need all their benefits to enjoy a comfortable retirement, and would gladly forego some of their benefits if they were sure this would help their children.<p>
I anticipate that five to 10 million Americans would purchase Liberty Bonds. Millions of retirees would gladly set aside $1,000 per year to create a $25,000 tax-free education fund for their children and grandchildren. Many would even set aside their full benefits$10,000 to $15,000 a year for their remaining lifetimeto build a nest egg for their children. The government could create a cap of $95 billion per year on the sale of Liberty Bonds, so that no more money is deferred than necessary.<p>
To make the numbers work, benefits will also have to be reduced for future retirees. There are two fair ways to do this. One is to raise the normal retirement age from the current 67 to 70, a change that can be phased in gradually. We are all living longer and we are in better health as we age. It is fair to extend the normal retirement age as our own lifetimes are extended. And in any case, with individual capital accounts in Social Security and the power of compound interest, Americans will want to work longerbecause they'll have the opportunity to build up even larger nest eggs.<p>
The second way to reduce Social Security benefits fairly is to reduce indexation for real wage growth. It is important to index Social Security for inflation. Once you retire, the cost of living continues to rise as a result of inflation. Without cost-of-living adjustments, the purchasing power of your benefits will decrease an estimated 4 percent per year. But Social Security is indexed again for real wage growthabout 1 percent a year. This is icing on the cake for retirees. It is not necessary, and it could be reduced by 50 percent.<p>
The current pay-as-you-go system is an economic, political, and cultural dead end. It will force us to raise taxes, and then raise taxes again to pay promised benefits, or to cut benefits and then cut benefits again to avoid mammoth tax increases. It will create no new capital opportunities. It will drain a growing amount of America's resourcesour savings and investmentout of the private sector. A shrinking private sector damages our ability to create new jobs and new industriesour future strength.<p>
The current system is also a recipe for conflict. If America is a shrinking pie, the young generation and older generation will fight over the crumbs. <p>
Under a funded, two-tier system, we would cut payroll taxes 2 percentage points in 2040 and then cut them again. As the system matures, we would increase retirement benefits by 25 to 35 percent. We would create 100 million millionaires. We would amass unprecedented savings and investment in America by opening the doors of capital ownership to most Americans. We would create a capital pool that no other nation in the world can equal, and use this investment to finance the high-paying jobs and new industries of tomorrow.<p>
By making every American a capitalist, a funded Social Security system would unleash new economic growth, raise the standard of living of our children, and return America to its historic role as the country of tomorrow, with its best days yet to come.

<hr>
<p>
<br>
One of the most refreshing feelings in the new Washington is the growing  
sense that our current tax system is not long for this world.  
<p>	 
Only days after the November election, Congressman Bill Archer, the  
chairman of the House tax-writing committee, boldly declared his desire  
to "tear out the income tax by its roots." House Speaker Newt Gingrich  
and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole have since formed a commission   
to consider entirely new alternatives. Presidential candidates Phil Gramm,  
Richard Lugar, and Arlen Specter want to scrap the system. A half dozen  
congressional panels are holding hearings on the subject. Even  
Congressman Richard Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, has  
floated a major rewrite (albeit without details).   
<p> 
The question is no longer whether America will get rid of its burdensome  
tax system; the question is, what new system should we replace it with? It  
is a question that will likely dominate our politics through the next  
election.  
<p>
<center>
<b><a name="The Contenders">THE CONTENDERS</a></b><br>  

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
There are three main contenders: One is a plan advanced by Senators  
Sam Nunn and Pete Domenici. They were among the earliest to call  
attention to the most economically lunatic feature of the current tax code  
-- the highly destructive double taxation of savings -- and develop a   
way to fix it. Called the "USA Tax," their proposal, while fairly  
complicated, defers taxation on income that is saved, while taxing income  
that is used for consumption. It is a sincere and innovative effort to  
encourage the savings necessary for continued economic growth.  
<p>	 
The second contender, which I strongly favor, is the flat tax. Designed to  
make the tax system as neutral and simple as possible, the flat tax would  
sweep away all loopholes, deductions, and exemptions, and replace them   
with a single generous personal allowance. All other income would be  
taxed at one low rate of 17 percent. As the plan's authors, economists  
Robert E. Hall and Alvin Rabushka, have pointed out, a flat tax would  
allow Americans to figure their taxes on a form the size of a postcard.  
The use of the tax code by would-be social engineers would end. Like the  
USA Tax, the flat tax would also end the double taxation of saving.  
<p>	 
While support for the flat tax is soaring -- almost 60 percent of  
Americans appear to favor a version of it, if polls are to be believed -- the  
Nunn-Domenici plan may have been overtaken by events. Conceived at a  
time when it appeared to many that the redistributionist Democratic Party  
would control Congress indefinitely, the plan contains sharply  
progressive tax rates that would kick in at surprisingly low income levels.  
It addresses the disincentive to save quite well, but it may make the other  
problems in the code, high rates and complexity, even worse than the  
current system. With the new politics in Washington and across the  
country, superior alternatives are now clearly within political reach.  
<p>	 
Then there's choice number three: the national sales tax. This is a  
sweeping plan to wipe away the current system and replace it with an  
unprecedented federal tax on retail purchases. Although it's not as widely  
discussed as the flat tax, it has substantial support among many far- 
thinking conservatives, including Archer and Lugar. Indeed, there are   
few conservative hearts that could not be at least a little warmed by its  
central promise to end the income tax altogether.   
<p>	 
This last choice demands serious examination at the moment. Although  
well-intentioned, the sales-tax option has several serious flaws. Before  
getting into that, though, we must remember that supporters of all these  
plans are allies in a fight to end America's single greatest impediment to  
achieving its possibilities: the IRS code, circa 1995.  
<p>	 
Any American tax system should meet three basic criteria. It should be  
fair, simple, and pro-growth. The current system fails miserably on all  
three counts.   
<p>	 
Is it simple? Not by a long shot. In 1990, American workers and  
businesses spent 5.4 billion hours preparing their taxes for the  
government. That's more time than it takes to build every car, truck, and  
van manufactured in the United States each year. After seven decades of  
amendments, revisions, exemptions, loopholes, and extensions, the code  
has become an incoherent mess. The IRS now sends out eight billion  
pages of forms and instructions each year. Laid end to end, they would  
stretch 28 times around the circumference of the earth.  
<p>	 
Is it fair? Hardly. The tax system is as much an exercise in social  
engineering as it is a way of raising government revenue efficiently.  
Through its exemptions and loopholes, the government tries to guide the  
economic decisions of free Americans in the misguided belief that the   
government knows best. Among other things, the code tells us that it is  
better to invest in a municipal sewer system than the next Microsoft, that  
buying rather than renting a home is a better choice for everyone  
everywhere, that purchasing air compressors is better than buying  
computer software. Government has neither the competence nor the right  
to make those decisions for us. The pretense that "government knows   
best" is an insult to our citizens.  
<p>	 
Is it pro-growth? As written, the tax code actually punishes savings and  
investment, by placing double or even triple tax burdens on capital. This  
lowers wages, destroys jobs, and depresses the living standards of all  
Americans. At the same time, it burdens American workers with  
punishingly high tax rates and overall tax burdens. With state and local   
taxes and other federal taxes, Americans now pay more in taxes than they  
spend on food, clothing, and shelter combined.  
<p>	 
All who have worked to end this system, no matter what plan they  
currently favor, should be welcomed as members of the tax-reform  
movement.   
<p>	 
Now for a closer look at option number three. What follows is my  
assessment of the major arguments advanced in favor of the national sales  
tax:  
<p>	 
<b>A sales tax is not an income tax.</b> The case for a sales tax begins with one  
highly appealing applause line. It will allow us, supporters argue, to  
eliminate the income tax altogether, possibly even repealing the 16th  
Amendment, which authorized it and made Big Government possible in   
the first place.   
<p>	 
Even if that goal were politically feasible -- and I don't think it is -- the  
exchange would come at a high price. We would give up the income tax  
for a more intrusive and pervasive tax system.  
<p>	 
The reason is simple. If the government sets out to collect a new tax at  
the cash register, it will soon have no choice but to extend that tax  
beyond the retailer to every level of production, as it desperately tries to  
stop inevitable and massive tax evasion. Any sales tax will become a  
complex, pervasive, multi-rate, value-added tax. We will soon be living   
under a VAT -- possibly the most insidious tax scheme ever devised.  
<p>	 
Sales-tax backers often oppose a VAT. But that's what they'll get. To  
generate sufficient revenue by taxing goods only at the retail level, the  
government would need to impose a sales tax of at least 20 percent,  
which means that consumers would suddenly find that everything they  
buy appears to be 20 percent more expensive. But people will not pay  
such a high tax. They will either find ways to label their consumer goods  
tax-exempt wholesale items, they will purchase goods in a cash black  
market, or they will evade it some other way. A sales tax, in other words,  
will be immediately undermined by a silent tax revolt, and the  
government -- following the pattern of European countries -- will respond  
by imposing a VAT.  
<p>	 
A VAT is assessed at each stage of production and is much easier to  
collect and enforce for a host of reasons. You can hear the bureaucratic  
lament in a 1993 report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation  
and Development, which noted: "Governments have gone on record as  
saying that an RST [retail sales tax] of more than 10 percent to 12 percent  
is too fragile to tax evasion possibilities, and it is probably not entirely  
accidental that in OECD counties, VAT rates are nearly always above 12  
percent and that, except in Canada and Iceland, RST rates have always  
been well below 12 percent."   
<p>	 
These unhappy governments were speaking from sad experience. In  
1967, 21 developed countries had retail, wholesale, manufacturer, or  
multi-stage sales taxes. Today, 20 out of 21 of these sales taxes have  
become value-added taxes. Every developed country except Australia  
that has had a sales tax now has a VAT. (Even Canada and Iceland,   
mentioned as exceptions when the OECD report was written, have since  
replaced their retail-tax-only systems with VATs.)  
<p>	 
Whether or not the sales tax evolves into a VAT, the government would  
become intimately involved in almost every economic transaction  
between consenting adults. The simplest exchange, from a vegetable  
farmer selling his produce to the corner grocer selling a loaf of bread,  
would be under the shadow of a government tax collector taking his cut.  
In fact, every businessperson in America would become a tax collector  
for the government.  
<p>	 
"But businesses already collect taxes for the government," sales-tax  
supporters counter. There's a big difference. Today, businesses collect a  
relatively small share of the income tax, since three quarters of the  
income in the economy is labor income, paid by individuals. But under a  
sales tax, there is no direct tax on individuals, so businesses will be  
responsible for collecting several times what they collect today. That  
means IRS scrutiny of American businesses could be expected to rise  
proportionately. Since the 10-12 million businesses in America have  
fewer rights under law than individuals, we can expect IRS abuses to rise   
exponentially as well.  
<p>	 
It would be an administrative mess. A national sales tax may well exempt  
many basic necessities from tax --beginning with food and clothing.  
This would lead to bitter disputes over the difference between food and  
candy, between real clothes and costume accessories. Congress and   
the courts would likely find themselves debating the nutritional value of  
Twinkies, the body coverage of sportswear, and much else, just as state  
governments do today, but on a larger scale.  
<p>	 
Worse, the federal sales tax and the dozens of different state sales taxes --  
aside from having different tax rates -- would likely exempt different  
items. That means a small businessperson would need to look up the  
correct state sales-tax rate, apply the federal rate, subtract the state tax  
rate from items exempted only by the state, or subtract only the federal  
rate from items federal-only exempted. Then he would need to do  
separate calculations for each of the states in which he does business.  
(And he would need to catch any mistakes before the tax enforcer  
appears.)  
<p>	 
The likely consequence would be a slowdown in business activity -- and  
a loss of jobs and drop in wages for millions of American workers.   
<p>	 
<b>We could eliminate the IRS.</b> Ignoring or dismissing this inevitable  
tendency for a sales tax to become an all-pervasive VAT -- with a huge  
accompanying bureaucracy -- some sales-tax advocates nevertheless  
argue that the sales tax would allow us to eliminate the IRS altogether.  
<p>	 
The argument is presented with an interesting federalist twist. The states,  
they say, could collect the new federal sales tax through their existing  
sales-tax systems. The federal government, then, could do without its  
own revenue collection agency. We could bring about the ultimate   
devolution of federal authority.  
<p>	 
One immediate problem, however, is that five states do not have a sales  
tax and would not take kindly to enforcing one for Washington. Even  
those that do would consider the costs of collecting a huge federal sales  
tax (the main source of federal revenue) an unbearable federal   
mandate.  
<p>
The enforcement costs for current sales taxes, currently about 5 percent,  
are manageable. However, if you add a 20 percent federal sales tax on top  
of that, the compliance problems grow exponentially. It makes little   
sense for a state government to pay the enforcement costs for a 25  
percent tax when it only gets one fifth of the revenue. Many states would  
simply eliminate their sales taxes.  
<p>	 
But the point is purely academic. For reasons dating back to the unhappy  
years of the Articles of Confederation, the federal government will never  
rely on state governments for its prime source of revenue. It will not  
happen.  
<p>	 
In truth, a sales tax would not eliminate any federal agency. It will  
actually allow a huge increase in the size of the federal government by  
allowing politicians to raise taxes with relative impunity. Why? Because  
sales taxes are hidden from the taxpayers, concealed in the price of the  
goods they buy.  
<p>	 
Try this experiment. Stand outside a grocery store and ask shoppers as  
they leave how much they just paid in sales tax. You'll find that virtually  
no one knows. Can you guess how much you paid in sales tax last month,  
or last year? The problem is, if people don't appreciate how much they  
pay in taxes, it is a lot easier for politicians to raise them.  
<p>	 
<b>Individuals would no longer need to file tax forms with the government.</b>
Since people would pay their taxes whenever they purchase an item,  
some sales-tax advocates argue, the government will never need to know  
a taxpayer's name. There would be no filing of any tax papers at all by an   
individual.  
<p>	 
That's not quite right. Under almost any sales-tax plan, individuals would  
still file with the government -- but for entirely different reasons than  
they do today.  
<p>	 
It's almost certain that one way or another, any federal sales tax would  
need to exempt certain basic necessities in order to make it progressive.  
One way to do this, as I've mentioned above, would be to order retailers  
not to charge tax on food and clothing and whatever else the government   
selects.   
<p>	 
But exempting a handful of items isn't enough. Absent a generous rebate,  
most Americans would face a stiff tax increase under a sales tax. That's  
why most sales-tax proposals provide for a rebate. The truth is, the   
overwhelming majority of Americans would still need to file with the IRS  
to claim their rebate (or else face a substantial tax increase).   
<p>	 
Some have suggested the IRS could simply send out checks to every  
American by Social Security number, obviating the need for taxpayers to  
file with the IRS. This is a fantasy. It wouldn't be long before there were  
more Social Security numbers than citizens. Whether or not Americans   
file directly with the IRS, the potential for fraud is staggering. Even under  
the current Earned Income Tax Credit program, fraud levels are as high  
as 30 to 40 percent. How much fraud would there be if the federal  
government were cutting thousand-dollar checks to every American?  
<p>	  
Of even greater concern is the political dynamic that would develop once  
we couple a hidden sales tax with a highly visible tax rebate. Americans  
would be quietly nickel-and-dimed to death by a sales tax they may  
hardly notice, but every year a very noticeable and generous check would  
arrive from Washington like manna from heaven. Government, and even  
the tax bureaucracy, might become highly popular after all. And in my  
judgment, if there could be anything worse then people hating the IRS, it  
would be for people to love the IRS.	  
<p>	 
<b>A sales tax will tax the underground economy.</b> The notion here is that a  
sales tax will more effectively tax illicit trade in both legal and illegal  
goods and services than any income tax. If true, this would bring in tens  
of billions of dollars in revenue to the government as we collect revenue   
from people who are currently outside the system.  
<p>	 
The neighborhood drug dealer almost always serves as the illustration.  
Since the drug dealer declines to file a 1040 form, the argument runs,  
maybe we could at least recoup some of his income through a sales tax.  
The government may have no record that he exists, but when he uses his  
blood money to buy a sports car, the government will collect tax from  
him.  
<p>	 
That sounds compelling at first, but if we think it through, it doesn't hold  
together. Look at it this way: Both systems will equally fail to tax the  
drug trade for the simple reason that the drug dealer will not play along in  
either one. If there's an income tax in place, he won't report his income. If  
there's a sales tax in place, he won't collect tax from his customers. Either  
way, the government loses exactly the same amount of money.  
<p>	 
Consider the following example. Suppose there is a drug dealer who  
makes $50,000 in sales to his customers every year and then turns around  
and spends it. Under an income tax system, we wish to tax the income of  
the dealer and his customers, while under a sales tax we wish to tax all of  
their purchases.  
<p>	 
Under the income tax, we tax the income of the drug consumers  
(assuming they are law-abiding citizens besides their drug use), but we  
can't tax the income of the drug dealer. Thus we lose $50,000 from the  
tax base. Under the sales tax, we tax the purchases of the drug dealer, but  
we don't tax the purchases of the drug consumers. Loss to the tax   
base: $50,000.  
<p>	 
It has to be the case that neither system taxes the value of the drug trade  
because the amount people spend on drugs must equal the income of the  
drug dealer. And since the drug dealer will not report sales or income tax,  
neither system will capture the value of the drug trade.   
<p>	 
The same would hold true for the underground economy in legal goods  
and services as well -- which, of course, is much larger. The proverbial  
plumber who doesn't report his house-call income today would not report  
it for sales-tax purposes either. At best, it will be a wash.  
<p> 	 
Actually, economic reasoning aside, the whole "underground economy"  
argument for a sales tax is flawed. It's obvious that if we try to impose a  
national sales tax of 20 percent or more on the public, the underground  
economy will explode. The "contraband" involved, though, will not be  
just crack cocaine, but virtually any sort of consumer good. That's   
exactly what happened in Canada when the government imposed its  
goods-and-services tax. The tax raised much less than projected.  
Coincidentally, the Canadian Treasury soon noticed a dramatic increase  
in the amount of real currency flowing through the economy. Why were  
Canadians suddenly using so much cash? Guess.  
<p>	 
<b>A sales tax will reduce the trade deficit.</b> Supporters say that a sales tax  
will increase U.S. competitiveness by taxing imports and not taxing  
exports. As tax-policy people put it, a sales tax is "border adjustable."  
Since exports aren't sold in the U.S., they would escape a domestic sales  
tax; since foreign imports are sold here, they will get hit. This way,  
American firms receive a significant tax advantage over foreign firms,  
and that will favorably alter our trade balance.  
<p> 
There are very few economists who hold this view, however. An  
immutable law of economics holds that trade surpluses and deficits are  
linked to the amount a nation lends or borrows. When savings are low,  
the trade deficit must be high, but if we substituted a tax on imports for  
some other tax, it will not affect the amount Americans save. That means   
the trade deficit not only will stay the same, it must stay the same, as a  
basic principle of economics.  
<p>	 
Economists might explain it this way (simplifying, of course): If there is  
more investment occurring in our economy than can be financed by our  
savings, then foreign investors must be accounting for the difference. In  
effect, they are taking the money we pay them for their cars and VCRs  
and using it to buy our stocks and bonds, thus supplying the investment  
capital that we don't supply ourselves. This difference is the "trade  
deficit."   
<p>	 
The only way to change the trade deficit, then, is to change our savings  
rate. If we increase our savings relative to our domestic investment, we  
will have less need for foreign cash. The trade deficit will then drop, as  
we spend relatively less money buying foreign goods and relatively more   
investing at home.  
<p>	 
But anything we do to tax incoming foreign goods -- including slapping  
them with a sales tax -- will have no effect on the amount of money  
Americans are putting into domestic stocks and bonds or even their own  
bank accounts. There is simply no relationship between them.  
<p>	 
What will happen instead is this: Our exports will increase at first because  
of the new tax advantage. But since our savings will remain the same, the  
dollar will be artificially strengthened. This will make our exports more   
expensive, and the original balance of trade will be gradually restored --  
along with the original trade deficit. The policy will be self-defeating.  
<p>	 
Even if a border adjustment were to work as its proponents claim, it  
would still be a bad idea. It would make the goods Americans buy --  
whether produced here in America or abroad -- more expensive, while  
foreigners could purchase American-made goods more cheaply. It's hard  
to see how Americans benefit from paying higher prices than foreigners  
do to purchase American products.  
<p>	 
Adam Smith makes a relevant point in The Wealth of Nations. Smith  
reminds us, "Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production;  
and the interest of the producer bought to be attended to, only so far as it  
may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer."  
<p>	 
In a border-adjustable system, however, to borrow from Smith again, "the  
interest of the consumer is almost constantly sacrificed to that of the  
producer; and it seems to consider production, and not consumption, as  
the ultimate end and object of all industry and commerce."   
<p>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
All of the above assumes, of course, that we really could replace the  
income-tax system with a national sales tax. But could we? The roots of  
the income tax go back to the 16th Amendment, passed in 1916 to  
authorize the government to levy a tax on individual incomes. In my  
view, repealing the amendment and ending the income tax for good   
is, politically, not in the cards. Conservatives in Congress have tried for  
years to pass a balanced-budget amendment without success. I believe we  
will eventually succeed, but in the midst of that grueling fight, I believe  
the notion of getting 290 members of the House, 67 members of the  
Senate, and three quarters of the states to repeal the 16th Amendment is a   
dream.  
<p>	 
And that is perhaps the best argument against the sales tax. If we try to  
exchange an income tax for a sales tax, we could easily end up with both.  
It would be a tragic irony if conservatives who favor a smaller  
government unwittingly provide the liberals with a comprehensive new  
taxing authority without eliminating the old one.  
<p>

<b><a name="Flat-Tax">THE FLAT-TAX OPTION</a></b><br>  

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	 
We must not lose sight of the commendable motives behind the sales tax.  
Its supporters want a tax code that does not interfere with economic  
decisionmaking, minimizes the paperwork burdens on the taxpayers,  
limits the size of the federal government, avoids excessive taxes on  
savings and investment, and is straightforward and fair.  
<p>	 
For all the above reasons, however, the sales tax is not likely to achieve  
those goals. The flat tax, however, will do so. By placing a single tax rate  
on all income, it will not distort economic decisions. Citizens will be free  
to spend and invest their money as they see fit without taking tax  
considerations into account. The paperwork burden, for most taxpayers,  
will be reduced to filling out a postcard-sized tax return. Americans will  
get an honest bill and know how much their government costs them.  
Savings and investment income will be taxed, but only once. The  
punitive double taxation of savings in the current code will be gone. The  
flat tax meets the tax-reform criteria -- it is simple, fair, and pro-growth.

<hr></center>
<p>
	Our mission is to revive the spirit of American citizenship by recovering the core political principles of our Founding Fathers and by articulating and advancing the conservative vision of civil society.<p>
	<i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i> illuminates the families, communities, voluntary associations, churches and other religious organizations, business enterprises, public and private schools, and local governments that are solving problems more effectively than large, centralized, bureaucratic government. Our goal is to stimulate the citizenship movement -- chronicling its success stories, exposing its obstacles and opportunities, and debating the policies that will best invigorate civil society.
<p>	American citizenship combines freedom with responsibility. These are the two great themes of modern conservatism, and they build on the best of the American tradition. Americans come from all races, all nationalities, all religions. Americans are united in citizenship not by common ancestry but by a common commitment to the political principles of the United States: the Constitution, the rule of law, the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
<P>	Americans are united, too, by the common duties of citizenship: the obligation to protect our country from foreign enemies, to take care of our own families, to participate actively in civic life, to help our neighbors and communities when they are needy, and, in turn, not to take advantage of others' generosity when we can take care of ourselves.       <P><center><hr width=30%></center>
<P>	<i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i> is published by <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>, a research and educational institute that formulates and promotes conservative public policies based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values, and a strong national defense.<P><center><bq>					"Without local institutions, a nation					may give itself a free government,					but it does not have the spirit of liberty."	<br>					Alexis de Tocqueville, <i>Democracy in America</i></bq></center>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<h2>William W Pascoe, III</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
William W. Pascoe, III, is the Political Director of the <a href = "/conservative/">American Conservative Union</a>, based in Alexandria, Virginia.  The ACU, celebrating its 31st anniversary, is the nation's oldest conservative grass-roots lobbying organization, and represents more than one million members and supporters, in each of the 50 states.  The organization lobbies on the entire range of issues before the Congress, and its annual vote ratings -- widely used by the media, academics, and other congressional analysts -- are considered the premier indicator of the Congress' ideological voting patterns.<p>
In his capacity as Political Director, Mr. Pascoe is responsible for overseeing the legislative, communications, and field operations of the organization.  These responsibilities entail gathering, collating, and analyzing information on matters of legislative interest; maintaining liaison with Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, their staffs, and committee staffs; representing the views of the ACU before such officials and staffs; directing the grass-roots lobbying efforts of the organization; compiling and analyzing the annual vote ratings; preparing all outgoing public communications of the organization; and dealing extensively with print and broadcast media to represent the organization's views on the wide range of public policy issues.<p>
In addition to his current duties at the ACU, Mr. Pascoe is also a columnist on national and international political issues for the Washington Times, and is the conservative talking head on "BattleLine," a twice-weekly point-counterpoint debate heard Tuesdays and Thursdays on Gene Pell's "Dateline America" radio show, nationally syndicated by Radio America. <p>
Prior to joining the ACU in 1993, Mr. Pascoe held numerous positions throughout the Washington political and policy-making community:  chief of staff to U.S. Rep. Bob McEwen (1992-93); Managing Partner of his own public affairs consulting firm, Pascoe, Norquist, Jones & Co.

Last week, ABIC pointed the finger at the 67 House members who voted against the Metcalf Amendment -- an amendment offered by Rep. Jack Metcalf (R - WA) to stop the automatic pay increase scheduled for members of Congress.  The House adopted the amendment and under its provisions, Congress would receive no payraise this year.  (Note:  Congressional salaries in 1996 are $133,644 per year.)
<P>
<STRONG>Mysteriously,</STRONG> when the bill came up a few days later for consideration by the Senate Subcommittee on July 19th, the Metcalf Amendment was <STRONG>gone!!!!</STRONG>  <BR><STRONG><EM>Section 637 was <STRONG>missing</STRONG> from the bill!!!!!!!!</EM></STRONG>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>M</FONT>ore than 10 years after the United States government illegally grabbed the property of an elderly Maine couple in the name of "wetlands," it has finally apologized. In a July letter, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers acknowledged that agency officials "were clearly guilty of inappropriate behavior in your case" and said the agency had taken steps to prevent it from happening again.
<P>
Given what Gaston and Monique Roberge went through, they would have to be pretty big steps. As noted in this space earlier, the couple had bought a small piece of property on the coastline back in the 1960s, an investment they hoped would one day serve as a nest egg for their retirement. In the mid-'70s, a contractor putting in a town sewer line asked to put some of the excavated dirt on their property. Armed with a town permit for the dirt, the Roberges agreed.
<P>
Suffering from a variety of health problems over the next decade, the ailing couple decided to cash in their nest egg and retire. They struck a deal with a developer in 1986, but the Corps effectively killed the deal by declaring the property a wetland. Never mind that there were houses on both sides of the property, a road in front and railroad tracks in back. Never mind that the Corps itself had previously determined that the property was not a wetland. The Corps insisted that the dirt be removed at costs of tens of thousands of dollars.
<P>
For approximately the next six years, the ailing and bewildered couple struggled futilely with what one federal judge the "regulatory hydra" embodied by the Corps. But it was only with expert assistance from the Cambridge, Md.-based Fairness to Landowners Committee, Washington attorney and former Environmental Protection Agency official Stanley Legro and former Corps regulator Bernie Goode that the couple were able to get their land back. Among other things, the experts quickly discovered that the Corps had misapplied its own rules and regulations; there was no reason to remove the dirt from the Roberges' property. The deal should have gone through.
<P>
Worse was to come. When the Roberges filed suit against the Corps to compensate them for the loss of their land, Mr. Legro discovered chilling memos in Corps files on the Roberge case. Read one: "Roberge would be a good one to squash and set an example." It was signed "Jay Clement, formerly the Maytag repairman." Mr. Clement, the regulator who oversaw the Roberge case, said later he couldn't remember what he had meant when he wrote that. But the obvious implication is that he was no longer bored, since he was squashing old folks. No doubt the discovery of those memos encouraged the Corps to settle the case for $338,000, roughly a third of which went to cover the Roberges' attorney fees and taxes.
<P>
So what steps is the Corps taking to prevent similar squashings in the future? According to the letter from Maj. Gen. Stanley Genega, the Corps' director of civil works, the agency has adopted a "Commitment to Public Service," which promises that its officials will be fair, honest, timely, knowledgeable about the rules they enforce and everything else they were not in dealing with the Roberges. They are going to offer customer surveys. And they are giving agency regulators "training in sensitivity and customer relations." There is no suggestion in the letter that anyone has been fired or otherwise disciplined in connection with the Roberge case.
<P>
Now when ordinary citizens violate wetlands rules they can face jail time and, as in the case of the Roberges, fines. They can also lose the deals on which their retirement nest egg is based. (No subsequent offer for the Roberge property approaches what they were originally offered.) Meanwhile, when Corps officials violate the rules, they get sensitivity training. Lawmakers ought to consider the obvious disproportionality here.
<P>
One apology is still missing -- from former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, whose smarmy tactics only made the couple's problems worse. In private he told them he would look into their case. Publicly he downplayed such cases as "either wildly exaggerated, partially or wholly untrue." For the sake of those involved in Irish peace talks, which Mr. Mitchell is helping to negotiate, one can only hope they don't get the Roberge treatment.<P>

<P>
The Metcalf Amendment Reappears...<br>
....as the Thompson Amendment!!
</center><p>
In Chapters 1 and 2, we learned that ABIC has been following the disappearance of the so-called Metcalf Amendment. In July, we pointed the finger at the 67 House members who voted against the Amendment offered by Rep. Jack Metcalf (R - WA) to stop the automatic pay increase scheduled for members of Congress.  The House adopted the amendment and under its provisions, Congress would receive no payraise this year.  (Note:  Congressional salaries in 1996 are $133,644 per year.)
<P>
We also learned that when the bill came out of the Senate committee, the Metcalf amendment had <b><i>vanished without a trace</i></b>.  No one knew how it disappeared or whodunnit! In <a href="/abic/ptf/7-29-96.html.cgi">Chapter 1</a>, ABIC pointed the finger at the prime suspects.
<P>
While no amount of detective work will reveal how the Metcalf Amendment disappeared in the Committee, <b>the day was ultimately saved by none other than...<P>

So, this week ABIC points the finger at a group of <i><b>good</i></b> guys: the six co-sponsors of the Thompson Amendment.

<h3>Testimony of Cleta Deatherage Mitchell</h3>
<h4>Director and General Counsel<br> 
Term Limits Legal Institute, a project of Americans Back In Charge Foundation
<p>
Subcommittee on the Constitution, Federalism and Property Rights<br>
U.S. Senate
<p>
January 25, 1995</h4>
</center>
<p>
 	My name is Cleta Mitchell.  I am the Director and General Counsel of the Term Limits Legal Institute in Washington, D.C.  The Term Limits Legal Institute was established in 1991 as a project of Americans Back in Charge, the first national term limits organization devoted to helping grassroots citizens committees in the various states follow the example of Colorado in 1990, limiting the terms of members of Congress by state action.  The Term Limits Legal Institute was created to defend the right of citizens to vote on term limits proposals and then to defend those enactments in the courts once passed by the voters.  We all are aware of the litigious nature of our society.  This is true as well in the political arena.  Since 1990, the term limits movement has been confronted with over 30 different lawsuits challenging the right of voters even to have the opportunity to consider the issue of term limits and then seeking a "second opinion" from the courts after the voters' verdict in favor of term limits was delivered in state after state or city after city.
<p>
	I am pleased to be in this forum today, because I believe that it is in the political arena--not in the courts--where the decision about term limits for members of Congress should be decided.
<p>
	There has been much discussion today about the public policy reasons for limiting congressional terms, and I won't reiterate those here.
<p>
	I want to focus briefly, however, on three primary points.
<p>
	First, I believe that when we begin amending the Constitution it is necessary to be thoughtful, careful and deeply respectful of the principles on which the entire framework of our government was founded.  I do not take lightly the notion of amending the Constitution, and I would not be here advocating amending it if I didn't believe that the principle at stake here was one that the Founding Fathers believed in but didn't bother to write down.  There has been ample testimony today about the history of the principle of rotation and the way in which term limits fit into the Constitutional framework.  It is my opinion that had Thomas Jefferson not been in France during the Constitutional Convention, we would not be here arguing this point today because he would have insisted on a mandatory rotation being written into the Constitution.  His concerns about the abandonment of the mandatory rotation were met with the response that the principle of rotation was imbedded in the national psyche and would be carried out "voluntarily".  Jefferson believed that voluntary rotation would, over time, erode and that is exactly what happened.
<p>
	But Jefferson <i>was</i> in France and it now settles upon our shoulders to complete a task that wasn't concluded in Philadelphia in 1787.  It is our role to write into the Constitution a principle that was inherent in the design of the institution of Congress--but which has eroded to the point of nonexistence: the principle of rotation and citizen responsibility for self-government.   
<p>
	In other words, the principle of term limits is a principle on which the national government was founded and one on which our notions of self-government are grounded.  The health of our democracy is at stake unless we restore this principle to our Constitution.   
<p>
	Second, any term limitation should treat the House and the Senate equally.  As we all recall from our history and civics classes, the first great hurdle at the Constitutional Convention was the tension between the small and the large states.  "The Great Compromise" that created the bi-cameral Congress with both a House and a Senate, based on separate forms of representation to accommodate the concerns and anxieties of BOTH small and large states, was the central underpinning of the constitutional convention.  Absent that compromise and the agreement to establish a Congress with 2 houses--equal in stature and authority, but differently designed--there would have been no constitution.   
<p>
	I do not believe that it is our task here to tamper with that design.  We are not here today and we should not be in the business of tinkering with the relative strength of the House vs. the Senate.  That is why I am here today urging you to adopt a term limits bill that treats the House and Senate equally under term limits: with 12 year limits on service in either House of Congress.  I believe that such an approach allows us to address the problems and the issues related to term limits without doing damage to the relative balance of power between the House and the Senate or the Great Compromise of the Philadelphia convention.   
<p>
	Further, it is the principle of term limits for members of Congress that is important.  There is a very real political consideration insofar as promoting a term limits measure that has some hope of success.  What that means, in my opinion, is that the Senate should not be promoting a bill that is dead on arrival in the House.  I served 8 years in the Oklahoma legislature as a member of the House of Representatives.  It is my considered opinion that there is not a House of Representatives anywhere on the planet that will pass a measure that allows Senators to serve in office twice as long as they can.  I believe that we should be focusing our energy on the principle of term limits and garnering support for a measure that can be successfully achieved--rather than wasting time fighting over something that is neither desirable nor attainable, namely, the 6 year term limit for House members.   
<p>
	Third, those who argue that the "people" are demanding a six year term limit for House members are, in my opinion, incorrect.  I know of no opinion poll that has asked the American people to state whether they would be supportive of a 12 year term limit if that's all the Congress was willing to pass.  If the choice is between a 12 year limit for House members and NO limit for either the House or Senate, I daresay that the people would choose 12 year term limits for all members of Congress.  That is a perfectly reasonable approach and it is one that, I believe, is achievable, which, again is part of the task before you.   
<p>
	The experience in the states is not as one-sided in favor of 6 year limits for House members as some might have you believe.   
<p>
	In the only state that has voted on both 6 year and 12 year limits on the members of the House of Representatives, Colorado, the 12 year limit received 153,000 more votes than did the 6 year limit.  While I realize that in the past few years there have been polls indicating that people were so angry at Congress that they would probably have supported a term limit of 6 months, I also believe that when the American voter steps into the polling booth, a sense of great responsibility sets in--and the evidence from Colorado is, I think, compelling.   
<p>
	Further, the reason that 6 year term limits for House members have been enacted in most states has not been a grassroots decision, but a requirement for receiving funds from the national term limits group that is dedicated to 6 year term limits.  It was important in the early days of this movement to bring the debate on term limits from the notion of 18 or 24 year term limits, which certain national figures who professed a commitment to term limits were actually promoting.  I believed in those days that it would be useful to promote the 6 year term limit for the purpose of insuring that the outer limits of discussion would ultimately be set at 12 year limits.  That goal has been achieved because no one is discussing anything today beyond a twelve year limit.  Today, however, we must move beyond  political rhetoric and name-calling and get about the business of seriously considering the public policy issues related to term limits and how the goals we espouse can best be achieved.
<p>
  	We must do everything in our power to see that the 104th Congress sends to the States a constitutional amendment to limit congressional terms.  That is what we are here today to discuss and I hope it is what this Congress is serious about doing.   
<p>
	President Clinton spoke over the weekend about the problems of the American people having become political "couch potatoes".  I find that objectionable for two reasons.  First, the American people have gotten up from their couches and spoken very loudly and firmly about their desire for term limits for members of  Congress.  To ignore our voices is to say "Go back to your couch.  We want you to become involved, but only if you agree with those of us who do this political stuff full time."  The second problem I have with the "political couch potato theory" is that those of you who lead our government can't have it both ways:  you can't tell us, the people, that we don't know enough to govern ourselves, that you have to be an "expert" to be involved in politics and government, and then wonder why normal everyday people throw up their hands and drop out of the process.  I believe that supporting term limits is essential to a revitalizing of our national democratic health and affirming our commitment to self-government.
<p>
	In  closing, I believe that we must approach this task with a love of the Congress and a careful concern for its design that was understood by our Founding Fathers.  That is why George Will entitled his book supporting term limits Restoration.   I join Mr. Will in his belief that by limiting the terms of members of Congress, we will be able to restore to Congress its rightful place of honor in our national life and in the hearts and minds of the American people.   	
<p>
	I urge your swift consideration and passage of the amendment to the Constitution to establish 12 year term limits for members of the United States House and Senate.   
<p>
	Thank you.

<b>Chapter 2</b>
<P>
In the last chapter, we learned that ABIC had pointed the finger at the 67 House members who voted against the Metcalf Amendment -- an amendment offered by Rep. Jack Metcalf (R - WA) to stop the automatic pay increase scheduled for members of Congress.  The House adopted the amendment and under its provisions, Congress would receive no payraise this year.  (Note:  Congressional salaries in 1996 are $133,644 per year.)
<P>
We also learned that when the bill came out of the Senate committee, that the Metcalf amendment had <b><i>vanished without a trace</i></b>.  No one knew how it disappeared or whodunnit! ABIC pointed the finger at the prime suspects:

<p>
<i>Excerpts from the Washington Times piece:</i>
<p>
The Federal Government's Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) "doles out corporate welfare through direct loans, loan guarantees and political risk insurance...
<p>
OPIC's welfare for multinational corporations can be very costly.  As of Sept. 30, 1995, the agency reported more than $4 billion in outstanding loan guarantees and $10 billion in outstanding insurance.  OPIC estimates that $14.6 million of its outstanding direct loans won't be repaid.  In the event that borrowers default on the direct or guaranteed loans, the ultimate risk is borne by the U.S. government (read: "taxpayers").
<p>
To balance the federal budget and downsize government, Congress claims to be scaling back wasteful spending programs and eliminating others.  No so for corporate pork, which has somehow survived the cuts and will even grow faster.  The bill to reauthorize OPIC through the year 2001 nearly doubles the ceiling on OPIC's investment insurance to $25 billion, and more than doubles OPIC's financing authority to $20 billion."

<h2>The Democratic Case for Term Limits</h2>
<p>
by <a href="/abic/cdmbio.html.cgi">Cleta Deatherage Mitchell</a>
<p>
<h5>(originally published in "The Mainstream Democrat", December 1990)</h5>
</center>
<p>
There are many good reasons for Democrats to embrace the issue of term limits, and not just because 70% of the American electorate support it.
<p>
For Democrats to step forward and claim limitations proposals as our own would abolish forever the perception of our party as the one which clings to congressional incumbency as a substitute for competitive elections, presumably out of fear that if we really had to compete, we couldn't win.
<p>
As a lifelong Democrat, I find that suggestion insulting.  I fully believe that Democrats can produce candidates for Congress whose ideas are more nearly those of the voting public than are the Republicans.  There is no doubt in my mind that Democratic candidates have the strength and vitality to defeat Republicans in truly competitive congressional elections.
<p>
But, if I am wrong, and we as Democrats cannot field candidates or platforms which enable us to maintain control of Congress without the ironclad advantage of incumbency, then incumbency is nothing more than an artificial life-support system which is keeping an otherwise brain-dead party alive.  If that is true, then term limitations should be enacted if for no other reason than to pull the plug and force our party to start breathing on its own again.
<p>
Limiting the number of years that members of Congress can serve used to be a Democratic idea.  Harry Truman recommended that the 22nd Amendment be applied to all federal officials, not just the President, to prevent, in his words, the "fossilization of the key committees."  Truman said a limit on congressional service would "help cure senility and seniority--both terrible legislative diseases."
<p>
While congressional senility seems to have faded as a public concern, another equally disturbing congressional trait has taken its place: the seeming loss of all common sense from the nation's capital.
<p>
The public perception is that people get elected to Congress and move away, and that the more time they stay in and around Washington, the less in touch with reality they become.
<p>
There is, unfortunately, an institutional force at work which is not the fault of any individual member of Congress, but is rather a reflection of the distance between Washington and most of the American electorate.  Most members of Congress can't commute daily and many can't commute weekly.  The more time one spends in and around the company town of Washington, the harder it is to identify with the people who live and work and try to survive in the rest of the country.  That is not an indictment of anyone--it is a fact of the system.
<p>
Members of Congress become like the non-custodial parent in a divorced family: they have visitations, they come on holidays and weekends, they send money... but they don't live with us.  And over time, it becomes harder and harder to really know one another very well.
<p>
To infuse Congress with a steady stream of new members and guaranteed turnover would provide not only the government, but also the Democratic party, with new blood, new ideas and a freshness that doesn't currently exist.
<p>
The unknown and unfamiliar are anathema to Washington, where the insider is revered.  Unfortunately, to most Americans, all those mutually beneficial relationships forged over years of service are exactly what's wrong with the country.
<p>
The millions of tax dollars spent by Congress on the franking privilege, congressional newsletters, perks, staff, salaries and retirement are issues which arise every time I have appeared to discuss limiting congressional terms.  The public is well aware of and furious that Congress continues to defend these expenditures while refusing to provide tax relief to working Americans.  Unless congressional Democrats start taking seriously the anger felt by millions of Americans, we will never earn their trust sufficiently to recapture the White House--and our long-term claims to congressional control may well be in jeopardy.
<p>
Imagine the reaction if Democrats were to step forward and say to the American people that we <i>do</i> recognize that Congress has become mired in the perks and PACs which surround the institution--and that to combat this anti-democratic situation of a 97% reelection rate for members of Congress, we are endorsing congressional term limitations.  If that happened, the popular support which would be generated for the Democratic party is inestimable.
<p>
Contrast that with the self-serving multi-million dollar losing campaign engineered by California's Democratic leaders against that state's legislative term limitation initiatives.  Isn't it time Democrats started caring more about the public and our democratic institutions than protecting our turf as the congressional majority?
<p>
We Democrats are always at our best when we take on the fight for fairness and belief in the people.  What could be more fair than the concept of taking turns in these offices of public trust?
<p>
My five-year-old daughter has to be constantly reminded to take turns and to share--basic and fundamental concepts of fairness, which we as Democrats hold dear.  We say we are not the elitist, upper-class snobs that Republicans are--yet we cling to this idea of a ruling congressional class as though it were our birthright.
<p>
Fairness.  Sharing.  Democratic with a small "d".
<p>
Public service, not life tenure.  Twelve years in each house of Congress and then out.  A quarter-century of Congressional membership ought to be long enough to get something done...  But if it isn't, then it surely is time to go home and let someone else take a turn at bat.
<p>
Term limitations for members of Congress is an idea which was tailor-made for Democrats to promote and support.  Let's not let the Republicans steal it away from us.

<CENTER><H2>Next Up on the Term Limits Agenda</H2>
by <A HREF="/abic/cdmbio.html.cgi">Cleta Deatherage Mitchell</A>
<H6>(originally published in the Washington Times--May 31, 1995)</H6></center>
<P><BR>
Those of us in the term-limits effort who've suffered the slings and arrows of the political and media elite in Washington these past five years on the issue must now endure another round of smug self-satisfaction from the insiders who truly believe the term-limits witch is dead.  But before anyone calls the mortician, people who support term limits should consider how far we've come--and what we have to do to finish the job of enacting term limits for all members of Congress.
<P>
<EM>The state term-limits laws were always a means to an end--not the end.</EM>  When the first term limits effort began in Colorado in 1989, culminating in Colorado's first-ever passage of a state constitutional amendment to limit the terms of its congressional delegation, the goal was not simply to limit the terms of those members of Congress from Colorado.  The original goal was to force the passage by Congress of a constitutional amendment to limit the terms of all members of Congress, from every state.
<P>
Such bills had been introduced since the very first Congress--but none had been acted upon.  When Colorado passed term limits in 1990, it had been 12 years since the last congressional hearing on a term-limits measure, and none had ever come to the floor of either house of Congress.
<P>
Now, five years and 25 million votes for congressional term limits later, the U.S. Supreme Court has said that to enact term limits, a constitutional amendment is necessary.  So, the court essentially has said that the original goal must still be the goal.
<P>
It is true that some term limits activists have gotten carried away with the strategy and have in the past year started to confuse the tactics with the goal.  Some began to argue that the state laws should supercede the constitutional amendment as the end product of the term-limit movement.  But that was never the idea.
<P>
The reason the state actions were necessary was debate--when inside Washington wouldn't give the issue the time of day.  That has happened.
<P>
In these past five years, many dozens of congressional candidates in both the House and Senate have been elected pledging to support term limits--and to abide by them, even without an amendment.
<P>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Majority Leader Dick Armey are very committed to term limits and have worked with term-limits supporters to enact a constitutional amendment.  In fact, those two House leaders did everything term-limits supporters requested during the term-limits fight earlier this year, reports to the contrary notwithstanding.
<P>
Many, many members of the House and Senate are personally dedicated to winning the issue of term limits--and are not deterred in any way by the Supreme Court's decision that the constitutional amendment is the only route to do so.  Those members of Congress already believed that.
<P>
The originial strategy of the term limits founders in Colorado (Paul Ogle, Shari Williams, and Terry Considine) has been fulfulled.  The issue of term limits has taken on a life of its own within the country and within the Congress--and the drive for a constitutional amendment has been jump-started from the states, just as they envisioned.
<P>
<EM>The organizing point for term-limits supporters is House Joint Resolution 1 in the 105th Congress.</EM>  The Supreme Court has focused the efforts and energies of term-limits proponents on Congress.  The blind alleys and rabbit trails that some term-limits supporters had been suggesting are foreclosed.  The shotgun is traded in for the rifle--and in plenty of time to make that a reality in the 1996 elections.
<P>
On the night of the term-limits vote in the House, Speaker Gingrich closed the debate in favor of term limits by promising that the Republicans would continue to push for limits and that the issue "will not go away."  The speaker pledged that if the Republicans are still in control, the very first issue in the 105th Congress will be House Joint Resolution 1, the term limits constitutional amendment.
<P>
That establishes for term limits supporters a tangible target around which to organize.  The language of H.J. Res. 1 must be developed carefully and thoughtfully with the input of members and constituents who support term limits.  House Joint Resolution 1 must contain the most stringent term limitation that can pass.
<P>
It does no good to argue for shorter term limits for House members if the resolution can't pass.  Likewise, it doesn't do much good to pass a term limitation that isn't meaningful.  Careful consideration and research must be given to these questions in order to reach consensus--and then all those who are serious about a constitutional amendment should rally 'round.
<P>
One version, one version only.  Not everyone's pet.  Not four or five different votes.  Some will have to give up on their personal preferences.  House Joint Resolution 1, period.
<P>
To accomplish this goal, the House and Senate leadership should appoint a joint task force on term limits.  No one should be appointed to the task force who didn't vote for at least two of the term-limits proposals considered by the House in March.
<P>
Open minds are needed here.  The task force could conduct public hearings around the country and work with the organizations who are seriously committed to passing a term limits amendment to develop the language of House Joint Resolution 1.  That task should be concluded this year.
<P>
Once H.J.Res. 1 is finalized, it will give organizers a chance to spend 1996 developing support for the specific amendment among the candidates and voters and to make the issue of term limits a priority in the presidential and congressional campaigns--without miring the issue in ancillary details.
<P>
<EM>The public is entitled to know where members of the Senate stand on the issue of term limits.</EM>  The timing of the Senate vote should be scheduled to maximize support.
<P>
There have been various ideas flying around as to when the Senate will vote, what the Senate will vote on and who's in charge.
<P>
Enough.  The Senate leadership should designate the leader(s) of the effort and term-limits supporters should work with that person or group to plan a schedule and a strategy to maximize support.  Even if we don't have the votes today, the process will be a learning experience that we can take to the American people in the same way we can the recorded vote in the House.  The Senate effort should be part of the strategic thinking developed by the joint task force.  (See <a href="/abic/sentlvotenote.html.cgi">note</a>.)
<P>
Amending the Constitution isn't easy--nor is it supposed to be.  The heavy-lifting in the term-limits effort is just getting under way.
<P>
There are plenty of people in Washington's high places who've always hated term limits and never really believed the issue was alive in the first place.  Just because those same people now say the issue is dead is only more reason to rededicate ourselves to the original goal:  getting a constitutional amendment to limit the terms of all members of Congress.

<P>
<img src="/abic/images/rogers.jpg" align="left">
"Cowboy humorist" and star of stage and screen Will Rogers was commissioned to write 
about the 1920, 1924, 1928 and 1932 national political conventions, a job he thoroughly
enjoyed as these quadrennial politicalfests provided ample fodder for a humorist.  ABIC has been pleased
 to offer just a sampling of Rogers' observations during the 1996 convention season.
  You'll note that in many cases things haven't changed much.  But in some cases 
things have changed so much that his statements offer even more ironic humor.
<P>
Each day we focused on a different aspect of the convention.  And as Rogers covered both the Democratic and Republican conventions, so did we.  First we published his thoughts from the Republican conventions (see below) and two weeks later it was the Democrats' turn!

</P>

There are few issues that so clearly separate the Republicans and Democrats in Washington as the issue of amending the U.S. Constitution to provide for limits on the number of terms members of Congress may serve.  These facts tell the story:
<p><img src="/abic/images/mitchell.gif" ALIGN="right" ALT="Cleta Mitchell" HSPACE=25>
<UL>
<LI>There have been proposals in many Congresses, for decades, to amend the Constitution and enact congressional term limits:  under the Democrats, NO term limits measure was ever allowed to be debated or voted on in subcommittee, full committee or on the floor of either the House or Senate.
<P>
<LI>Conversely, in the first 100 days of the 104th Congress, the House of Representatives voted on the term limits constitutional amendment in the Judiciary Committee AND the floor of the House of Representatives.  
</ul><p>
<table hspace="10"><tr>
<td align="left"><hr><b>
THE DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS<br> 
ARE VOTING AGAINST THE
 WILL<br> OF NOT ONLY
THE 
VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE 
IN THE COUNTRY, BUT 
AGAINST THE WISHES
OF 
THEIR OWN PARTY'S 
VOTERS AS WELL.</b><hr></td>
<td><ul>
<LI>In the historic first floor vote in the House in 1995, 82% of the House Republicans voted YES on term limits.  82% of the House Democrats voted NO. (See <a href="/abic/hstlvote.html.cgi">Chart</a>.)
<LI>Speaker Gingrich has already announced that term limits will be the first issue voted on in 1997 if the Republicans still control the House of Representatives.
</ul></td></tr></table>
<ul>
<LI>In the House Judiciary Committee in 1995, the Democrats unanimously voted AGAINST allowing term limits to be brought to the House floor for consideration.  Thanks to the Republican majority, the bill went to the floor despite the Democrats' opposition.
<P>
<LI>In the Senate this year, the Republicans unanimously voted in favor of bringing term limits to the floor for final consideration.  All but five Democrats voted AGAINST allowing the measure to proceed to the Senate floor for a final vote, thus blocking consideration and passage
 <P>
<LI>The GOP Platform has included term limits for members of Congress since 1984.
</UL><P>
What difference does it make if the Republicans overwhelmingly favor term limits and the Democrats in Washington oppose the issue so strongly?
<P>
The American people want to limit the terms of members of Congress!  In poll after poll, it is clear that the voters believe that congressional tenure should be limited and that congressional paychecks are like welfare checks:  it's okay to receive them for awhile but NOT for life.
<P>
In January, 1996, the Tarrance Group conducted a national poll of registered voters on behalf of the Term Limits Amendment National Campaign.  According to the data, 77% of the American people favor term limits while only 17% oppose the idea. (See <a href="/abic
/peoplepie.html.cgi">Chart</a>.) Of those, 59% strongly favor term limits and only 9% strongly oppose it.
<P>
The curious fact is that support for term limits never drops below 64% in any demographic or political group.  Democratic voters support term limits by a wide margin and conservative Democrats support term limits more strongly than any other group!
<P>
That means the Democrats in Congress are voting against the will of not only the vast majority of people in the country, but against the wishes of their own party's voters as well.
<P>
Term limits for Congress is a basic idea fundamental to our democracy:  Congress is supposed to be comprised of citizen representatives, not professional politicians.  The Democratic majority over the past four decades came to believe that Congress belonged to them, not the people of America -- and it is still difficult for Democrats to believe in the importance of returning Washington to the control of the American people.
<P>
There is another, more deeply philosophical basis for the congressional Democrats' opposition to term limits:  the national Democratic party basically believes in an unlimited federal government, with control over every aspect of our lives.  That notion has its origins in the idea of "no limits" for the Congress of the United States.  No limits on time, no limits on money, no limits on the federal government.
<P>
Most Americans believe that it is time to place limits on the money the Washington politicians can spend (the Balanced Budget Amendment) and limits on the time that politicians can spend in Washington -- the Term Limits Amendment.  These are the bookends of the GOP's Contract with America and they were fundamental principles of the design of the American system of government.  Because the founding fathers didn't write the principles down, our country has strayed badly from them -- and it is time to include in the Constitution the actual language of the principles that the framers clearly intended.
<P>
These are also principles in which most Republican members of Congress believe as well.  There are still some veteran Republican lawmakers who take the idea of term limits personally and can't get over the idea of how it will affect their careers.  They have difficulty getting past their personal involvement to see how the issue is fundamental to bringing the  federal government Leviathan under control for the sake of our children and grandchildren.
<p>
<table hspace="10"><tr><td width="60%">
George Will has written that term limits is more important to balancing the budget than the balanced budget amendment -- because the end of careerism in Congress will remove the incentives of members of Congress (from both parties) to use our tax dollars for their own reelection purposes by making voters dependent on Washington and the federal government instead of free enterprise and individual initiative.
</td><td><hr><b>
TERM LIMITS ARE IMPOSED ON THE PRESIDENT, 40 GOVERNORS,
21 STATE LEGISLATURES AND THOUSANDS OF LOCAL OFFICIALS
ACROSS THE NATION. WHY NOT CONGRESS?  
</b><hr></td></tr></table>
<p>
Term limits are imposed on the President, 40 Governors, 21 state legislatures and thousands of local officials across the nation.  Why not Congress?
<P>
In 1996, term limits is a key issue that Republican candidates and activists can use to demonstrate conclusively the differences between the parties.  It is an opportunity that should not be lost.

<CENTER><H2>We the People</H2>
<STRONG><EM>We the people of the United States of America...</EM></STRONG></CENTER>
<P><BR>
Somewhere between the First Federal Congress of 1787 and the 104th Congress, this defining opening statement to the Constitution of the United States of America lost its meaning.  What was once a "government of the people, by the people and for the people" has become a mockery of what the Founding Fathers envisioned. The citizen congress has become a welfare state for career politicians. The limited government has become a limitless government. And powers once reserved for the people have been lost in the politics of self-preservation.
<P>
There is little doubt that the "government of the people" envisioned by the Founding Fathers was one of limited federal powers. The framers of the Constitution certainly never imagined a "government by the people" run by career politicians so entrenched in their position of power as to be almost entirely removed from their constituency. And their ideal of a "government for the people" surely could not have been one that passes on the burden of a huge national debt from one generation to the next.
<P>	
The historical principle of a limited central government cannot be ignored by any serious student of the origins of our Constitution. James Madison wrote that "[i]n framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: You must first enable the government to control itself." Thomas Jefferson professed: "I own that I am not a friend of a very energetic government. It is always oppressive."
<P>	
What a distance we have traveled since 1787. The seemingly endless involvement of the federal government in every facet of our lives has far exceeded the worst fears of even the most vocal anti-federalist in the late 18th century.
<P>
As we prepare to move into the next century - and the next millennium - it is time for "we the people" to reclaim the vision of the Founding Fathers. We can only do this by restating in the Constitution the principles of limits that were implicit in the Founders' view of the nation. And only then will we put Americans back in charge of the government of the people. 
<P>
<H3><CENTER>LIMITED TIME + LIMITED MONEY<BR>
= LIMITED GOVERNMENT</CENTER>
</H3>
Central to the concept of a limited government was the principal of limited national service, evidenced most clearly by the example of Washington, Jefferson and every President until Roosevelt, but also evidenced by the short tenure of Members of Congress in the 18th and 19th centuries. The idea of a representative government is that the people select one of their own, a member of their community, and dispatch that person to the seat of government for a short time to represent the views and perspectives of their community before he or she returns home to once again live and work in that community. If allowed to linger for a protracted period of time, the representative becomes the federal government's emissary to the people, instead of the other way around. The dynamic of representation has been reversed and become the opposite of what was intended.
<P>
Imposing limited tenure on Members of Congress restores the principal of representative democracy to its proper function. People who make laws for others should do so knowing with certainty that they will soon return to private life and live and work under those laws. This is the ultimate check on the powers of the legislature. This is what democratic self-rule was supposed to be about.
<P>
Term limits are an essential part of restricting the role of the federal government. If we can limit the time that politicians spend in Washington, we can fundamentally change the role of the federal government in our lives. If Members of Congress know coming in that there is a time certain that they must leave, it will change the mind set of the institution and of the Members themselves.
<P>
Term limits are the surest way to reform Congress, addressing the issues of campaign finance reform, lobbying reform, the seniority system and the perks and privileges of the ruling class that have become a plague on the institution.
<P>
Equally important to the concept of limited government is the principle of limited funds and fiscal responsibility. The Founding Fathers recognized this as they addressed economic issues throughout the Constitution. Never in their wildest dreams could they have imagined a national debt over $3.4 trillion.
<P>
Unfortunately, that principle has been lost on the Congress of today. Not having ended the year in a surplus for the past 25 years, they have habitually and routinely abandoned the concept of a balanced budget. They have shown themselves both unwilling and unable to spend within our means.
<P>
Federal spending is inextricably linked to tenure in Congress. Studies by the National Taxpayers Union demonstrate that junior Representatives have always been more fiscally conservative than senior Representatives. Stephen Moore wrote in 1994 that "if we truly want to get government spending under control, much more important than changing the party controlling Congress is reducing the length of congressional careers via term limits ... research indicates that the longer a member has been in Congress, the worse is his or her voting record (as to spending) - and that is true of members of both parties."
<P>
By writing the two axioms of limited time and limited money into the federal constitution, our national government and its leaders will, for the first time in decades, be subject to the external controls and boundaries envisioned by the Constitution in its original form.
<P>

<CENTER><H3>Term Limits and Balanced Budget Amendments:<BR>The Bookends of the Contract with America</H3></CENTER>

The constitutional amendments to limit congressional terms and balance the federal budget were (and still are) the "bookends" of the GOP Contract with America - enjoying massive public support and reflecting the ideal of a permanently restructured federal government. Much of the electoral success enjoyed by Republican candidates in 1994 can be attributed to these two wildly popular provisions.
<P>
These constitutional amendments continue to enjoy the overwhelming support of the American people. George Will wrote in 1992: "There are just two things that three-fourths of the American people want that Congress will not permit. One is a balanced budget amendment; the other is term limits for legislators. These are anathema to Congress because careerism is the shared creed of Democrans and Republicrats, and deficit spending - burdening future voters to buy today's voters - is the key to careerism... term limits would change the motives and behavior of legislators."
<P>
Since 1990, more than 25 million people have voted in favor of limiting the terms of their congressional delegations and twenty-three states have passed congressional term limits. In January, 1996, a nationwide survey of 1,000 registered voters conducted by The Tarrance Group found that 77 percent of the country's electorate favor term limits.
<P>
According to the survey, Republicans (80%), Democrats (71%) and Independents (81%) all favor limits on the number of terms federally elected officials can serve. The support is extremely widespread, never falling below 60% with any voter group. The term limits issue cuts across party lines, social strata and economic status, making it one of the most widely popular government reform measures ever proposed.
<P>
Support for the balanced budget amendment is equally strong. Several Gallup polls conducted at various times in 1995 consistently showed over 71 percent of the American people favoring the balanced budget amendment.
<P>
The American people instinctively know that term limits will permanently limit the time that politicians can spend in Washington and, further, that the balanced budget amendment will permanently limit the money that politicians in Washington can spend. Together, the two amendments will restore to the Constitution the notion of a finite federal government - something that was implicit in the design of our government and understood by the Founders as an essential element of the system they created.
<P>
With such strong public support for these two issues, why has there been so little action in the 104th Congress? What the public is still looking for is some measure of results, which are not yet apparent. The bottom line is that term limits and the balanced budget amendment - the two issues most popular with the American people in November, 1994 - have not yet passed. Those failures are symbols in the voters' minds of "business as usual" in Washington.
<P>
What went wrong? This book is an in-depth investigation into the politics of self preservation that have derailed the two most important reform initiatives in Congress. With a quick read, it becomes clear that the major opponents to the term limits and balanced budget amendments are Congressmen and women who are unwilling to sever their ties with Washington or release their grasp on the purse strings of the Nation.

<center><h3>Setting Limits:<br>
The Truth About Why Congress Defeated <br>
the Term Limits and Balanced Budget Amendments in 1995</h3></center>
<hr width="55% size="3">
<p>     
As America looks toward the end of an incredible twentieth century and the
beginning of both a new millenium and a new century, we are well served to think
about the kind of government we want as we move into this new era.

<p>
Most of us believe that it is time for new answers to the problems and
challenges we face as a country:  an aging population, staggering deficits, and a
government in Washington that seems unable to cope with the major issues of the
day.
<p>
<table><tr><td width="60%">
That is why overwhelming majorities of the American people favor
enactment of two constitutional amendments:  one to permanently limit the tenure
of members of the U.S. Congress and the other to permanently require a balanced
federal budget.
<p>
In the 104th Congress that convened in January, 1995 and will adjourn at the
end of this year, we have made progress toward the twin goals of the balanced
budget amendment and term limits -- but we haven't achieved the necessary 2/3
vote in both houses of Congress for final passage of either.

</center></td></tr></table>

<p>
We have much work to do in order to secure congressional passage of these
constitutional amendments.  Our Founding Fathers intended that it would be
somewhat difficult to amend the constitution -- but it shouldn't be impossible, and
it isn't.
<p>
The active participation in the political process by average, patriotic citizens
is what it will take to see both of these amendments through passage by the
Congress and ratification by the necessary 38 state legislatures.
<p>
We can -- and we must -- reclaim our government from the governing elite
in Washington, D.C. and return it to the oversight and control of the American
people in our  home towns and our states.
<p>
That is what the balanced budget and term limits amendments will help
accomplish -- and we must keep up the effort for both until we see these
amendments added to our constitution.

<H3>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Finally Apologizes<BR> to Elderly Maine Couple in "Takings" Case</H3> </td>
</tr>
</table>
In a classic story of unrestrained government, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) has finally apologized to an elderly Maine couple for illegally seizing their retirement "nest egg" property.  In a July letter, ACE admitted that Corps officials "were clearly guilty of innappropriate behavior in (this) case."
<P>
After 10 years of legal wrangling in which ACE claimed that the property was a protected wetland, even though it was surrounded by a road, railroad tracks and houses, the Corps finally settled a lawsuit filed by the couple, the Roberges.  Worse, during the course of the lawsuit, the Roberges' attorneys discovered a memo signed by an ACE caseworker, Jay Clement, in which he stated, <STRONG>"Roberge would be a good one to squash and (make into) an example."  </STRONG>Apparently, Mr. Clement continues to be employed by the Corps despite its July acknowledgement that the case was mishandled.

This is exactly the kind of big government arrogance that insinuates itself into 
Americans' lives every day.  As Thomas Jefferson professed: "I own that I am not a friend of
a very energetic government.  It is always oppressive."   ... How prophetic!

<p>
Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.ntu.org">National Taxpayers Union</a> released a study of the cost of running House members' personal offices.  The figure above represents the entire total cost of all 435 offices.  
<p>
According to the press release which accompanied the release of the study, "the biggest office spender was former California Rep. Walter Tucker, who spent slightly more than he was legally allowed.  The most frugal office spender was Rep. Andy Jacobs (D-IN), who spent $265,124 less than the average representative.  If all members had spent as little as Rep. Jacobs, House office spending could have been slashed by 35%."

<H3>Insider Tales of an Honorable Ex-Legislator</H3>
<P>
by <a href="/abic/cdmbio.html.cgi">Cleta Deatherage Mitchell</a>
Director and General Counsel, ABIC
<P>
Wall Street Journal - October, 1991
</center>
<P>
<P>
I was elected to the Oklahoma House of Representatives as a Democrat in 1976 and served for eight years.  During that time and in the six years since I voluntarily decided not to run for re-election, I have come to believe strongly that our American democracy badly needs limitations on the number of terms that legislators--state and federal--can remain in office.  Only mandatory term limits will fix what's wrong with America's legislative bodies.
<P>
When I was first elected, I felt like every freshman: "My people" had selected me, and I was eager to "straighten out that mess."  It always begins that way, with the newly elected representative feeling he or she has a mission to accomplish on arrival at the seat of government.  Over time, however, the legislator becomes the honored guest from the capital who sits at the head table and explains our government to us, instead of fixing it.
<P>
Within a few days after my election, I began to receive gifts in the mail.  Not big things, just small gratuities like calendars and such, all addressed to "The Honorable Cleta Deatherage," a title one can quickly learn to like.  The gift that really got my attention, though, was the set of crystal stemware that was to be engraved with my initials, with the style of the engraving up to me.  Etched crystal stemware?  From a lobby group?  Just for winning the election?  Or for a future vote?
<P>
I had already campaigned against legislative perks--and this flurry of presents struck me as more of the same.  So I sent them all back.  I paid for anything already ordered that had my name on it--and asked the lobbyists not to send anything else.  But time was on their side, and I eventually fell victim to the process of familiarity that is the stock and trade of the special interests.  After a while, those lobbyists became my friends and co-workers, and it began to be uncomfortable to return their calendars.
<P>
When I started my first term, I distinctly remember being terribly annoyed when I would raise questions about state government practices that seemed particularly wasteful, inefficient, outmoded or stupid, only to find my more senior colleagues responding by rolling their eyes, folding their arms and--with that tone of voice that comes when one has lost patience with another's naivete--sighing and saying, "Because we've always done it this way."
<P>
I pledged to myself that if I ever got that way, it would be time for me to leave.  And it happened.
<P>
After serving eight years--five years in the inner circle of the state's leadership, three of them as chairman of the House Appropriations and Budget Committee--I chose not to run again.  I had become too familiar with the issues, too familiar with the process and too familiar with the capital insiders to truly be as effective as I once was.  I knew on any given issue, idea or proposal who would be for it, who would be against it, and which side would probably prevail.  So I lost the fever and the fervor to fight battles that couldn't be won or to try things that would surely fail.
<P>
Just as battle-weary soldiers are replaced with fresh troops, the legislatures need a steady, guaranteed influx of new blood to keep them vibrant and vigilant in their war against the special interests.
<P>
Legislators should be forced to think of each re-election cycle as a step closer to the conclusion of their service, not another notch in their belts of lifetime tenure.  More important, if members who begin their legislative service with a set of defined goals knew for certain from the outset that they had only a limited time in which to accomplish them, they would get about their business before being consumed by the inertia of insider politics.  I have seen all too many legislators keep putting off doing anything very hard until after the next election, and then the next, and the next.  Legislators measure their political lives in two-, four- or six-year intervals that must be gotten safely beyond.
<p>
But even the traditional concept of facing the voters in a competitive race is foreign to most members of Congress after their first elections.  Congressional incumbents have little to fear from opponents who can't compete with the perks and the PACs that have helped create a permanent Congress.  American democracy is based, in part, on the concept of every good citizen taking his or her turn at public service.  If we can restore this basic concept of citizen control by mandating legislative turnover and forcing competition, we are obligated to try.

<i>"If you can't say something nice,<br>
come sit by me."</i><br>

--Alice Roosevelt Longworth<br>

</p>
<p>
Last Tuesday (July 16th), the U.S. House voted on whether to raise congressional salaries.  By a vote of 352 to 67, the House decided not to raise their own salaries this year.  This week, ABICF wants to <b>point fingers</b> at the 67 members who felt they were doing such a great job that they deserved a payraise.</p>
<p>
<img src="/abic/images/rt.gif" ALIGN="left" ALT="Finger Pointing Right">
<img src="/abic/images/l.gif" ALIGN="right" ALT="Finger Pointing Left">
It is interesting to note that of the 67, over half have served more than twelve years and 17 have served more than 20 years!!  No wonder that 78% of them voted against term limits last year!</p> 
<p>
There are 48 Democrats and 19 Republicans on this list.  And the vast majority of these members have little fear of losing their jobs over this vote.  Of the 67, only five come from vulnerable seats, winning their 1994 reelection races with less than 55% of the vote.  
<img src="/abic/images/lup.gif" ALIGN="right" ALT="Finger Pointing Up and Left">
<img src="/abic/images/rtup.gif" ALIGN="left" ALT="Finger Pointing Up and Right">
And of those five, four aren't running this year!  So almost all of these members knew not only that they were safe in voting to give themselves a payraise but that they'd be around for a while to enjoy it!</p>
<p>
So ABICF is pointing the finger at each of these members this week because we thought you'd want to know!</p>

<title>ABICF - "Setting Limits" - "Hatfield and the Decoys"</title>

<h2>Hatfield and the Decoys</h2>
</center>
<p>
<p>



     When the Balanced Budget Amendment failed by one vote in the U.S. Senate in 1995, all eyes focused on Sen. Mark Hatfield, the lone Republican to vote against the BBA.  Less attention was paid to the real reason the BBA failed in 1995:  the six Democratic Senators who had previously voted "yes", had campaigned in favor of the BBA and then voted "no" when it really counted.  These are the "Decoys" who cost the American people passage of the BBA in 1995.
<p>
     In 1994, all of the following six senators had voted <i>for</i> a virtually identical Balanced Budget Amendment:
<p align=center>
Dianne Feinstein, D-California<br>
Wendell Ford, D-Kentucky<br>
Jeff Bingaman, D-New Mexico<br>
Byron Dorgan, D-North Dakota<br>
Ernest Hollings, D-South Carolina<br>
Tom Daschle, D-South Dakota<br>
</p align=center>
<p>
     What's worse, each and every one of them actually campaigned in favor of this issue.  They promised the voters of their states that they would vote "yes" when the amendment came to the floor.  They are the "Decoys" because they are Senators who pretended to support the BBA in an election year and switched in 1995 by voting "no".

<p>
<p>
<h2><b>Feinstein</b></h2>
     In a tough reelection race in 1994, Sen. Feinstein ran commercials touting her "yes" vote earlier that year on the BBA.  In October of 1994 during that campaign, while making an appearance on Larry King Live, Sen. Feinstein told a constituent caller that he could trust her to keep her promises.  When the caller asked her how she could expect him to vote for someone "wearing temporarily fiscally conservative clothing," she responded, "I said (in 1992) that I would vote for a balanced budget amendment and I voted for a balanced budget amendment."(1)  But when the vote actually came to the Senate floor in 1995 and was one vote away from passage, she voted "no".
<p>
<p>
<h2><b>Ford and Hollings</b></h2>
	Sens. Ford and Hollings voted <i>for</i> the BBA in 1986 and 1994.  Sen. Ford was quoted as saying that Congress "must begin to regain control of our spending policies.  . . . An amendment to the Constitution would do just that."(2)
<p>
	Sen. Hollings has been a frequent cosponsor of the Balanced Budget Amendment.  In a column sent to newspapers in 1994, he wrote, "(o)nly an amendment to the Constitution will have the clout to force the executive and legislative branches to pay the bills."(3)  He has further said, "by writing a balanced budget into the basic law of the land, we will compel Washington to do its job."(4)
<p>
<p>
<h2><b>Daschle</b></h2>
	Sen. Daschle deserves special status as a decoy--he led the charge against the Balanced Budget Amendment in 1995.  This is ironic considering that, like the others, he voted for the BBA in 1994 and in 1986 he ran a campaign ad declaring that when he first came to the Senate, "his first official act was to sponsor a constitutional amendment to balance the budget."  As is the case with others in Congress, perhaps the influence of Washington has caused him to listen to interests other than his constituents'.  Looking back on the failure of the BBA, Sen. Daschle smirked, "We had a good week."
<p>
<p>
<h2><b>Bingaman</b></h2>
	Sen. Bingaman voted yes on the BBA in 1994 in anticipation of a difficult reelection campaign.  After winning reelection to another six-year term in November, 1994, Sen. Bingaman apparently decided he could safely abandon his election year conversion to the BBA.
<p>
<p>
<h2><b>Dorgan</b></h2>
	Democrats fought the Balanced Budget Amendment last year with the claim that it would end up hurting the Social Security trust fund.  But all six Senators voted for the same amendment a year earlier.  At that time, Sen. Dorgan even disputed White House claims that the amendment would harm Social Security, saying, "the White House is not serving anyone's interests with these scare tactics on the balanced budget amendment."(5)
<p>
<p>
<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
	The bottom line is that if even one of these decoy Senators had voted "yes" in 1995, as they had all voted only a year before, the Balanced Budget Amendment would now be before the state legislatures for ratification.

 <B><h2><CENTER>TAKING CONGRESS OFF WELFARE</h2></B>
<p>
<table border=1><tr><td>
<I><FONT SIZE=4>Isn't it time for the government to encourage

<br>

<bR>
</FONT>
<P>
During the first 100 days of the 104th Congress,
the House of Representatives took up the issue of welfare reform.
 The legislation was aimed at ending welfare recipients' cycle
of lifetime dependence on the federal government and eradicating
the notion of being entitled to the receipt of a government check.


<P>
The week following the vote on welfare reform, the
House of Representatives voted against limiting their own dependency
on government checks.  Unfortunately, too many members of Congress
fail to see that they themselves have become dependent on their
own government program:  their careers in Congress.  Too many
members of Congress have come to believe that they are entitled
to their congressional seats and all the benefits they have created
along with it.

<P>
Congress has created for itself a welfare system
complete with salaries greater than those of the vast majority
of their constituents, pension programs that are far more lavish
than those of most private pension plans -- and other special
privileges that have resulted in scandalous and egregious breaches
of the public trust.

<P>
<I>The perks, pay and pension plans of the congressional
welfare system may be the real reason term limits didn't pass.

</I>
<P>
Let's compare two notorious examples of the abuse
created by the congressional welfare system--the &quot;midnight
payraise&quot; of 1989 and the House Banking Scandal of 1992--and
their effect on the vote on term limits.

<P>
While the congressional &quot;midnight payraise&quot;
was approved more than five years ago, there are 124 members who
voted for it still serving in the House of Representatives.  And
despite the public outrage at the abuses of the 1992 House banking
scandal, there are 144 House members still in office who were
revealed to have bounced checks.  These noteworthy episodes in
congressional history still linger.

<P>
And how did these Members of Congress vote on the
issue of term limits?  Not surprisingly, 71 percent of those members
who voted for the payraise and 61 percent of those members who
bounced checks opposed term limits.

<P>
All-in-all, there are 60 members of the House of
Representatives that have the dubious distinction of having all
three in common: they all voted to raise their congressional salaries,
they all bounced checks in the House bank scandal and they all
voted against term limits.  These are the reigning congressional
&quot;welfare kings and queens&quot;.

<P>
These 12 Republicans and 48 Democrats are the remnants
of the inside-Washington belief that receiving a government paycheck
is a lifetime entitlement.  Their dependence on the federal government
makes them unwilling and unable to limit congressional terms;
they are thoroughly opposed to ending congressional welfare as
they know it.

<P>
The congressional welfare kings and queens have pension
benefits worth an average of $1.73 million each.  These career
politicians have been in Congress for an average of 17.7 years.
 And they bounced an average of 86 checks each at the House bank.
 There is no better example of the need for term limits than these
career politicians building toward a cozy retirement.<BR>

<P>
The American people have said in clear and loud terms
that congressional checks are like welfare checks: they are okay
for a while but no one should get them for life.  It is time to
tell these members to get off the public dole and send them back
home to live and work under the laws they create.  It's time to
tell these Members of Congress to &quot;get a life.&quot;

<P>
The obstinate refusal of these Congressmen and women
to listen to the public will and behave accordingly is what keeps
Congress from making the changes the American people are demanding.
 These are the Members standing in the way of returning the federal
government to the role envisioned by the Founding Fathers.  As
long as these people are in Congress, the true change sought by
the voters in November 1994 will be never be realized.

<P>
Based upon the final passage roll call vote on term limits in
the U.S. House of Representatives on March 29, 1995, those members
who oppose term limits formed the basis of the study.  That list
was matched against the still-serving Members who voted in favor
of the congressional payraise in 1989, which legislation included
an automatic annual payraise for Members of Congress to avoid
the public pressure of having to ever again vote on a congressional
pay increase. Added to that list was the official record of the
Members of the House of Representatives who had at least one check
listed as paid without sufficient funds, which came to be known
as the House banking scandal of 1992 and resulted in the closing
of the House of Representatives bank.  The estimated lifetime
value of congressional pension benefits is taken from the National
Taxpayers' Union Foundation study published in 1994.  Pension
benefits are listed only for House members elected before 1984
as per the NTU study. <BR>

<center><h2>THE UN-REPRESENTATIVES</h2>

<P>


<table width="70%" border="1">
<tr>
<td><I>The strength of the grass-roots term limits movement comes
from the fact that Washington is simply out of touch with middle
America.</I>
<br>
<b>--Contract with America</b><BR></td></tr>
</table>

</center>
<P>
<br>
The very word &quot;representative&quot; charges our Members of
Congress with the responsibility to stand for the ideals, beliefs
and principals of the people they represent. A congressional district
sends one of their own to the House of Representatives to voice
their opinions and stand up for them in the halls of Congress.
That's why we call them <I>Representatives.</I>
<P>
So what would you call a Member of Congress who <I>does not </I>stand
for the interests and beliefs of his or her constituency, a member
who instead willfully acts in direct contradiction to those interests
and beliefs? We would call him or her an <I>un</I>-Representative.
<P>
The issue of term limits is unique among the thousands of measures
that have come before the Congress: there is no other issue voted
on by members of Congress that has also actually been voted on
by millions of American voters. Over 25 million votes have been
cast in 22 states in favor of congressional term limits since
1990 (Utah and New Hampshire passed congressional term limits
through their state legislatures).
<P>
There are 179 Members of the House of Representatives from those
22 states whose constituents have actually voted to support term
limits for Members of Congress.
<P>
One would think that those Representatives would follow the dictates
of the election results in their districts. These were, after
all, not opinion polls, focus groups or town meetings. These were
actual ballots cast by real voters in favor of limiting the congressional
terms of their own Representatives.
<P>
On March 29, 1995 the House of Representatives of the 104th Congress
held the first recorded floor vote in the nation's history on
a constitutional amendment to limit the terms of Members of Congress.
The measure, H.J.Res. 73, received a majority vote of the House
- but not the 2/3 super-majority required for a constitutional
amendment. The final vote was 227 in favor, 204 opposed and four
not voting (or present). The historic ballot on a term limits
constitutional amendment fell just 63 votes short of final passage.
<P>
So what is the correlation between the outcome of the congressional
district voting and the votes of the House members from those
districts?
<P>
Incredibly, there are sixty members of the U.S. House of Representatives
who voted &quot;no&quot; on final passage of the term limits constitutional
amendment whose constituents had voted &quot;yes&quot; on term
limits when it appeared on their general election ballots in 1990,
1992 or 1994. Sixty of the 179 Members of the House of Representatives
from those 22 states whose constituents have voted for term limits
violated their duty to act in accordance with the wishes of the
people they represent.
<P>
<I>These are the </I>un<I>-Representatives.</I>
<P>
The <I>un</I>-Representatives are the best, though not the only,
argument for term limitations for members of Congress. Every member
of Congress who opposes term limits does so in the face of clear,
consistent and continuing public opinion polls showing that three-fourths
of the American voters favor term limits.
<P>
Who are these <I>un</I>-Representatives? They include 51 Democrats
and 9 Republicans. They average 11.87 years in Congress, or nearly
six full terms. The three highest-ranking House Democrats are
<I>un</I>-Representatives: Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, Minority
Whip David Bonior, and Democratic Caucus Chairman Vic Fazio. The
longest tenured member of Congress (39.5 years), John Dingell,
is an <I>un</I>-Representative whose constituents voted &quot;yes&quot;
on term limits by a 16 percent margin.
<P>
But the most egregious <I>un</I>-Representative member of the
House is Sam Gibbons (D-FL), whose constituents voted &quot;yes&quot;
on term limits with a whopping 78 percent of the vote ... only
to have their &quot;representative&quot; vote against the constitutional
amendment for term limits.
<P>
There are many more House members who voted against term limits
but who escape this list only because their states do not permit
the initiative process enabling voters to vote on term limits.
Nonetheless, in considering where to begin to press for the 63
votes needed to pass the term limits constitutional amendment
in the House of Representatives, the <I>un</I>-Representatives
offer a natural starting point for public focus--and special criticism.

<h3>Welcome to the home page of<br>
Americans Back in Charge Foundation!</h3></center>
<p>
Our reason for existing is exactly what our name implies:  we want to put the American
people back in charge of their government, instead of the other way around.
<p>
<b>Americans Back in Charge</b> grew out of the original term limits statewide initiative effort in Colorado in 1989-90.  That state effort was known as "Coloradans Back in Charge".  A group of citizens circulated petitions calling for a state constitutional amendment to limit the terms of politicians in Colorado -- including limits on the Colorado congressional delegation.  The initiative was passed by over 70% of Colorado voters in November, 1990.  Soon thereafter, "Coloradans Back in Charge" established <b>Americans Back in Charge</b> in order to help other citizens do what they had done.
<p>
<b>Americans Back in Charge</b> has been a leading force on behaf of term limits for
politicians ever since it was formed in 1991.
<p>
But there is a broader purpose of <b>Americans Back in Charge</b>:  helping citizens take charge of government and American politics at every level.
<p>
We believe that was the original purpose of the <b><a href="/abic/declaration.html.cgi">Declaration of Independence</a></b>.  
<p>
We believe that the reason the colonies separated from England in 1776 -- an event we
celebrate every year on the Fourth of July -- was essentially rebellion against tyrannical government.
<p>
There is a need in 1996 -- just as in 1776 -- to be ever vigilant against governmental
excess, over-taxation, and bureaucratic arrogance and tyranny.
<p>
That is what <b>Americans Back in Charge</b> is all about.  Through this web site, Americans Back in Charge Foundation wants to provide the tools, the information and the support for you to take charge of your government.
<p>
We hope you enjoy our site!

<br>
<small><i><center><blockquote>
This graphic of the Declaration of Independence is a photo of the actual Declaration read by
George Washington to his troops in July, 1776.</small></blockquote></center><p></small>
<p>
When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
<p>
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.
<p>
Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.
<p>
But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.
<p>
Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain [George III] is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.
<p>
He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
<p>
He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained, and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
<p>
He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
<p>
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
<p>
He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
<p>
He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.
<p>
He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.
<p>
He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.
<p>
He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.
<p>
He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance.
<p>
He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies, without the consent of our
legislatures.
<p>
He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.
<p>
He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution and
unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:
<ul>
<li> For protecting them by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:
<li>For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:
<li>For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:
<li>For depriving us in many cases of the benefits of Trial by Jury:
<li>For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:
<li>For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:
<li>For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:
<li>For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
</ul><p>
He has abdicated Government here by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.
<p>
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.
<p>
He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to complete the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.
<p>
He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.
<p>
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the
inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.
<p>
In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms. Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
<p>
Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. 
<ul>
<li>We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an
unwarrantable jurisdiction over us.
<li>We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here.
<li>We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence.
</ul><p>
They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore,
acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.
<p>
We, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress,
Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by the authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare
<p>
That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain is and ought to be totally dissolved;
<p>
and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce,
<p>
and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do.
<p>
And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine
Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.

<CENTER><H2>The Antagonists</H2></center>
<P><BR>
<CENTER><i><H5>Election Day, November 8, 1994, was a turning point.  America's voters dismantled the forty-year lock the Democrats had on Congress...  Obviously the voters believed there was a difference between the way the two parties envisioned the role of government in their lives, and the difference mattered.</H5></i></CENTER>
<P align="right"><font="-2">Contract with America</font></align>
<P><BR>
During the first 100 days of the 104th Congress, constitutional amendments to require a balanced federal budget and to limit the terms for Members of Congress were taken up in the U.S. House of Representatives as part of the GOP <EM>Contract with America</EM>.  The U.S. Senate also took up the issue of a balanced budget amendment, but, as of January 1996, has yet to vote on the final passage of term limits.  (See <a href="/abic/sentlvotenote.html.cgi">Note</a>.)  All three votes--two in the House and one in the Senate--failed.
<P>
By electing Republicans, voters believed that they would finally get their way on term limits and the balanced budget amendment.  But as voters look back at the first year of Republican control of Congress following 40 years of Democratic rule, Republicans will have a hard time claiming that the direction of the federal government has been permanently changed.  So who is really to blame for the failure of these amendments?  Republicans?  Democrats?  Or both?
<P>
Amendments to the constitution require passage by 2/3 of the membership of both houses of Congress.  Although Republicans control the majority in both houses, the GOP falls well short of the super-majority required for passage.  Under the current makeup of both houses, it takes a fairly sizable number of Democratic votes in favor of any amendment to be able to pass it--even if 100 percent of the Republicans vote "yes".
<P>
<EM>The absence of a respectable bloc of Democratic votes in the 104th Congress for term limits and the balanced budget amendments was the chief cause of failure of both amendments.
</EM><P>
Simply by checking the recorded votes in Congress on the term limits and balanced budget amendments in 1995, a dramatic breakdown emerges along party lines.  Let's compare the votes of Republicans and Democrats with public support for these issues, starting with the U.S. House of Representatives.
<P>
Although term limits are supported by 77 percent of the American people, 82 percent of the House Democrats voted <EM>against</EM> the term limits amendment in 1995 while only 35 Democrats (18%) voted with the American people (see Chart 2-1).  Similarly, only 67 Democrats voted "yes" in the 1995 House vote on the balanced budget amendment, although it is supported by 71 percent of the American people (see Chart 2-2).
<p>
<center>
<img src="/abic/images/chart2-1.gif" alt="Chart 2-1">
</center>
<p>
In stark contrast, House Republicans supported both measures in large numbers, with over 82 percent voting for term limits and an overwhelming 99 percent voting in favor of the balanced budget amendment.
<P>
<center>
<img src="/abic/images/chart2-2.gif" alt="Chart 2-2">
</center><p>
Meanwhile, in the U.S. Senate, while the first actual, recorded vote on a term limits constitutional amendment won't occur until April, 1996, (See <a href="/abic/sentlvotenote.html.cgi">Note</a>) there was a "sense of the Senate" resolution regarding term limits in October of 1995.  Only three of the Senate's 46 Democrats (7%) voted with term limits supporters, compared to 42 of the Senate's 53 Republicans (see Chart 2-3).
<P><center>
<img src="/abic/images/chart2-3.gif" alt="Chart 2-3">
</center><p>
The nail-biting Senate vote on the balanced budget amendment in early 1995 provided great drama, falling just one vote short of passage.  But the reason the amendment failed was not because one Republican voted no; it failed because only 28 percent of the Senate Democrats voted yes.  Incredibly, 72 percent of Senate Democrats voted against an amendment favored by 71 percent of the American people (see Chart 2-4).
<P>
<center><img src="/abic/images/chart2-4.gif" alt="Chart 2-4">
</center><p>
Clearly, Republican Members of Congress are more in tune with the American people in their support of the term limits and balanced budget amendments, while a majority of Democrats are out of touch.  However, Republicans are not without blame for the failure of these key provisions of the GOP <EM>Contract with America</EM>.  In fact, there are 40 Republicans in the House who signed the <EM>Contract with America</EM> but voted against term limits, despite their pledge: "If we break this <EM>Contract</EM>, throw us out."
<P>
But there is a group of people who deserve to be singled out for their opposition to both the term limits and balanced budget amendments.  They are primarily Democrats.  In fact, just one Republican appears on this list. They are the reigning opposition to real reform of the Federal government.  We call them the Antagonists.

<title>Biography: Michael S. Joyce</title>
</head>

<h3>Biographical Sketch<br>
Michael S. Joyce</h3>
</center>

Michael S. Joyce is President and Chief Executive Officer of The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation in Milwaukee. Throughout a twenty-year career in private philanthropy, which has included leadership of the John M. Olin Foundation in New York and of the Goldseker Foundation in Baltimore, Mr. Joyce has seen and compared the ideas, the actions and the results of thousands of programs that have sought to address the challenges of modern life and has, in consequence, become convinced that the best hope for our time lies in the renewal of the institutions of civil society. The Bradley Foundation has coined the term, "New Citizenship," to express its aspiration for a return to a pre-welfare state understanding of civic participation in which citizenship is not defined merely as "occasional voting" but as a deep and active engagement in community life.<p>

Beginning his career as a teacher of history and political science at the secondary and college levels, Mr. Joyce spent six years with the Educational Research Council of America before entering the world of private foundations and maintains a strong commitment to educational reform as a supporter of parental choice in education.<p>

Mr. Joyce has served on many presidential and national commissions, including the Presidential~Transition Team at the outset of the Reagan years in 1980. On the other end of the Reagan-Bush era, in the fall of 1993, he joined with William Kristol to found the Project for the Republican Future.<p>

As a scholar, Mr. Joyce, who holds degrees in history and philosophy and a Ph.D. in politics and education, has been the author of many research studies as well as a contributing editor to a textbook series in the social sciences. As a contributor to a wide variety of journals, he has also published many essays and articles on contemporary issues, with a special emphasis on restoring the central role of civil society -- of family, church, and community institutions -- in the wake of a period dominated by unchecked expansions both of government controls and of personal license.

When voters rejected George Bush in 1992, liberal commentators and the press argued that the Administration's economic policies were only partly to blame.  They claimed that conservatives cost Bush the presidency by debating social issues and family values.  Partisan liberals went further, concluding that the public had repudiated an entire decade of greed.  All believed that Bill Clinton successfully campaigned as an agent of change.
<P>
	Since the election, Clinton has abandoned most of his &quot;New Democrat&quot; rhetoric and has promoted traditionally liberal policies.  The public feels increasingly uneasy about the nation's direction and the durability of the social fabric.  Why has the President failed to inspire?  The answer is simple.  Americans see all about them the continuing moral and cultural distintegration that accompanies expanding social welfare programs.  They want changes more profound than government programs; they want an end to the something-for-nothing mentality that passes for public participation in the modern welfare state.
<P>
	During the past thirty years nonprofit public affairs and advocacy groups have claimed to speak for the American public.  Concentrated in the nation's capital and proliferating as the federal government identifies ever more problems as its responsibility, these groups have become the idea factories and advertising agencies of public policy debate.  At key points in what Washington euphemistically calls &quot;the policy process&quot; advocacy groups become very influential.  By providing information and useful arguments to policymakers, the media and the public, they affect political outcomes.  When they advocate policies in &quot;the public interest,&quot; public affairs groups influence whether government will afford its citizens opportunities or whether it will distribute entitlements.  In the case of Randall Robinson's TransAfrica, an advocacy group can even affect whether America chooses to go to war.  Corporate contributions to nonprofit advocacy organizations implicitly acknowledge their importance.  But corporations have failed to understand how they operate or what they really want.  
<P>
	For eight years Capital Research Center has tracked corporate giving to nonprofit public affairs groups.  Regrettably, Corporate America continues to fund groups that advocate welfare state policies.  Corporate philanthropy too often supports interest groups that denigrate market incentives and economic growth.  Whatever their motivation, corporate managements are contributing stockowner funds to groups that obstruct genuine economic, social and political reforms that can renew America's traditions of limited government, a free market, and respect for individual rights and responsibilities.
<P>
	Public debate over the health care &quot;crisis&quot; offers a telling example of how advocacy groups use corporate dollars.  For decades advocacy groups and think tanks championed health care policy ideas that can be found in the plan devised by Hillary Clinton's health care task force.  The Administration's plan for &quot;universal coverage&quot; through regional health care &quot;alliances&quot; and its rhetorical emphasis on &quot;managed competition&quot; can be traced to a variety of nongovernmental sources: from the Progressive Policy Institute, a project of the the Democratic Leadership Council (which Gov. Bill Clinton once chaired) to the Children's Defense Fund (which Hillary Clinton once chaired).  Planned Parenthood joined the coalition for universal coverage on condition that it include taxpayer-funded abortions on demand.  As the entries in this study indicate, these advocacy organizations received financial support from major American corporations.  How many of the companies funding them would eventually spend far more to fight the Administration's 1342 page health insurance bill? 
<P>
	Nonprofit advocacy groups cannot market their ideas without money.  They depend on tax-deductible contributions from individual donors sympathetic to their aims, grant-giving foundations, and corporations.  But the financial contribution of a large corporation, even a modest donation, has one added benefit.  Corporate money can obscure the radical economic or political agenda of an advocacy group, giving it an unearned credibility with otherwise cautious individual donors.  Indeed, corporate funding can help a nonprofit increase its budget exponentially, opening doors to other corporate and foundation donors and to government grants.
<P>
	It is clear that too many corporate executives just don't get it.  The trends in corporate philanthropy have not improved during the eight years Capital Research Center has conducted this study.  There are few individual exceptions.  Among the 43 most significant corporate contributors to nonprofit advocacy groups (<a href="/crc/patterns/pcp10b.html">SEE TEN BEST GIVERS</a>), only Eli Lilly received a grade of &quot;A&quot;, the first corporation to be so designated in eight years.  No corporations received a &quot;B.&quot;  Nine corporations received a &quot;C&quot; grade; of these, however, only Amoco and Cigna displayed slight right-of-center giving patterns.  The patterns of public affairs giving by Coca-Cola, Anheuser-Busch, Fannie Mae, and J.P. Morgan earned these corporations the lowest possible grade -- &quot;F&quot;.  All others on the list earned &quot;D&quot; grades.  Waste Management, General Mills, Dayton Hudson, and American Express--each with a long-standing tradition of funding Left-oriented advocacy groups--are especially familiar faces on this list.
<P><br>
<a name="how"></a>
<B>How Corporate Philanthropy Hurts Traditional Charity</B>
<P>	
Traditional charity involves individual acts of virtue:  charitable individuals voluntarily offer direct assistance to the needy.  Traditional charities--groups like the Boy Scouts, Catholic Charities, the Red Cross, and the Salvation Army--work to alleviate suffering and assist the recovery of personal independence.  In contrast, the welfare state mandates social programs that empower service professionals, generate dependency in their clients, and promote a sense of entitlement in both.  Proponents of so-called &quot;progressive philanthropy&quot; are encouraging corporations and foundations to adopt a new philosophy of philanthropic giving.  Occupying leadership positions in key organizations like the Council on Foundations, they deemphasize support for traditional charities and would shift philanthropy's financial resources to nonprofit advocacy groups, especially those that actively promote welfare state programs.
<P>
	The majority of companies surveyed in this study devote less than 10 percent of their charitable contributions to nonprofit advocacy groups.  But the trend toward advocacy and away from traditional charity is growing.  Moreover, most of the corporations that contribute significantly to nonprofit advocacy groups (<a href="/crc/patterns/pcp10w.html">SEE TEN WORST MISGIVERS</a>) favor groups that are committed to expanding the welfare state.  
<P>
<ul>
<li>Exxon contributed the most money to nonprofit advocacy groups--more than $2.7 million.  Other members of the million dollar club included Aetna, Ford, NYNEX, AT&amp;T and General Electric.  Together these five companies gave nearly $6.4 million to largely center-left and liberal interest groups.
<li>IBM devoted more than 25 percent of its philanthropic dollars to advocacy groups in a year when it lost almost $7 billion.  Monsanto gave over 24 percent of its total contributions to nonprofit advocacy groups; Archer Daniels Midland gave over 17 percent.
<li>Fannie Mae contributed almost 30 percent of its philanthropy--almost $2 million--to left-of-center advocacy groups.  None of the company's 26 grants to advocacy nonprofits went to a right-of-center group.  Freddie Mac gave over 13 percent to advocacy groups.  Both corporations enjoy government guarantees enabling them to make huge profits in an otherwise risky secondary mortgage market.
<li>FMC, Unocal, Reynolds Metals, W.R. Grace, and Amoco deserve recognition for supporting advocacy groups that favor competitive free markets and limited government.  Sun Microsystems is the only company whose charitable contributions program does not fund nonprofit advocacy groups.
</ul>
<P>
	The advocacy groups that bid for corporate philanthropy enjoy the same tax-exemption as a church or a traditional charity, even though they recognize no obligation to provide charity's direct assistance.  When corporations fund these nonprofits from their philanthropic budgets, they give traditional charities an incentive to alter their priorities to compete for the advocacy dollar.  Worse, the advocacy groups that receive corporate funding tend to be those most favorable to welfare state policies, policies that co-opt the aims and undermine the achievements of genuine charity. 
<P><br>
<a name="whose"></a>
<B>Whose Money Is It?</B>
<P>
	Conservatives understand that limited government is necessary for civil order as well as for liberty, and that local government works best to provide services protecting the community.  Conservatives understand that religion and education instill good character in the young and that a strong family is the best safety net.  Conservatives know that work creates wealth, and that property rights protect opportunity.  Does it matter whether big business agrees?  Shouldn't corporations be free to make charitable contributions to whichever groups they favor?
<P>
	The answer is no.  Charity is a voluntary and virtuous act of giving by one person to another.  But the companies examined in this study issue shares of stock that are publicly traded.  Except insofar as they are shareholders, company executives are <I>management</I>, not <I>owners</I>.  To truly engage in an act of charity with corporate funds, management would need to inform shareholders of the company's proposed contribution and obtain their consent. Management's fiduciary trust requires that its decisions properly represent shareholder interests.
<P>
	Milton Friedman has argued that &quot;socially responsible&quot; companies are those that operate most profitably for their owners.  In doing that they supply jobs, products, and services that are in demand.   When USAir indefinitely suspended its corporate philanthropic program until the company returned to profitability, it was taking Friedman's advice.  Sadly, other companies ignored the message in their bottom line.  In 1991, the most recent year for which information in this study can be gathered, 21 corporations gave away their shareholders' money despite the red ink on their books:
<P>
<ul>
<li>Equitable contributed $3.5 million to charity, or nearly 11 percent of the $32.2 million the company lost.  Ashland Oil's philanthropy budget amounted to $5.2 million, or close to 8 percent of its $66.8 million loss.
<li>IBM lost nearly $6.9 billion, but still found nearly $3 million to give away.  General Motors lost $2.6 billion, but found $21 million for charity.
<li>Ford Motor gave away over $19 million even as it lost more than $500 million.  The St. Paul Companies made contributions of $8.8 million while losing over $232 million.  Westinghouse gave $6.8 million to charity in a year in which it lost $953 million.
</ul>
<P>
	At least the corporate managements at Georgia-Pacific, W.R. Grace, and Reynolds Metals could claim they were pursuing their companies' longer term interests by contributing to right-of-center think tanks and advocacy groups.  But what excuse could the managements at 18 other money-losing companies give for dispensing shareholder monies?  It was, after all, not theirs.  Corporate philanthropists may fancy themselves modern-day Robin Hoods.  But management's fiduciary trust is not a license to steal. 
<P><br>
<a name="feeding"></a>
<B>Feeding the Mouths That Bite Them</B>
<P>
	The old argument that what's good for business is good for America (and vice-versa) is enjoying a peculiar revival.  Advocacy groups claim that what's bad for particular American businesses is bad for America.  When a dynamic, competitive market threatens the well-being of major American corporations shouldn't something be done?  For instance, Ford and Chrysler each gave $150,000 to the protectionist Economic Strategy Institute.  General Motors gave $17,000.  Won't contributions to this group fund the studies that protect jobs and return profits to Detroit?
<P>
	Such claims ignore the interest of shareholders in the <I>long-term</I> competitiveness of their company.  Anti-market policies may help companies retain current market share and protect top management in the <I>short-term</I>.  But the benefits of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) outweigh any negative consequences from foreign competition.
<P>
	The automobile industry offers a particularly salient example: Artificial price barriers like tariffs or &quot;voluntary&quot; limits on imports have not stopped foreign companies from setting up shop in the United States.  Consumer demand for a superior product has pressured Detroit automakers to improve auto quality or lose market share.
<P>
	If management gives away shareholder profits through a corporate philanthropy program, wouldn't it be best to contribute to traditional charities that provide direct services?  If management looks for advocacy groups to fund, why not those that encourage self-help and individual responsibility like Robert Woodson's National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise?  There is no ethical explanation or excuse for supporting proponents of the welfare state.  Consider the following examples of self-defeating corporate philanthropy:
<P><ul>

<li>ACORN, the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, received $123,000 from financial institutions BankAmerica, Fannie Mae, First Chicago and J.P. Morgan.  ACORN activists are best known for targeting banks, telling them who should receive minority set-aside loans.  Banks that reject ACORN's advice risk charges that they have failed to comply with the Community Reinvestment Act.
<li>The Center for Community Change, which supports raising personal and corporate taxes, received 
$319,000 in corporate contributions.  Fannie Mae contributed $100,000; Aetna - $70,000; Dayton Hudson - $34,500; and AT&amp;T - $25,000.
<li>Children's Defense Fund wants to nationalize distribution of child vaccines and greatly expand Medicaid and Head Start.  Once chaired by Hillary Clinton and then by Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, CDF backed the Clinton health plan and prods the Administration's social welfare agenda.  Corporations gave CDF over $700,000 in 1992.  This includes $75,000 from J.P. Morgan, $70,000 from American Express, $60,000 from Fannie Mae, and $50,000 each from Aetna, AT&amp;T, Citicorp, and Coca-Cola.  Merrill Lynch provided at least $36,000, General Mills gave $35,600, and Dayton Hudson gave $30,000 to CDF.
<li>The Alliance to Save Energy has supported a fifty-cent per gallon gasoline tax that would dampen consumer demand for larger and safer, but less fuel-efficient American-made cars.  Ashland Oil, Chevron, Chrysler and Texaco each contributed $5,000 to the Alliance.
<li>Exxon contributed $5,000 to the Environmental Law Institute, which economist Paul Craig Roberts credits with formulating the legal rationale for Exxon's criminal indictment for the <I>Valdez</I> oil spill. 
<li>The Audubon Society and the National Wilderness Federation oppose exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.  Chevron and Enron combined to give Audubon $30,000, while Amoco gave $46,000 to the National Wildlife Federation.  NWF also supports an &quot;Environmental Quality Amendment&quot; to the Constitution and would elevate the Environmental Protection Agency to cabinet-level status.  Chevron also gave $5,000 to the Center for Marine Conservation, which has blocked oil drilling in Monterey Bay.
</ul><P>
	Why do corporations feed the mouths that bite them?  The answer is unclear because many corporations are unwilling to reveal which charities they fund.  In responding to Capital Research Center queries, many corporate contributions managers claimed that company policy prohibited them from disclosing grant recipients lists.  Others insisted that the requested information was confidential or &quot;proprietary.&quot;  In a &quot;politically correct&quot; environment, companies are torn between their desire for good public relations and their fear of public controversy. 
<P><br>
<a name="corporate"></a>
<B>Corporate Culpability</B>
<P>
	Evidence of corporate support for nonprofit proponents of the welfare state is compelling.  Of 36 nonprofit advocacy groups that received more than $250,000 in corporate contributions, 27 had liberal public policy agendas.  It is striking that the top five left-of-center groups received over $9 million in corporate contributions, over $1 million more than the total corporate contributions to 87 right-of-center groups.  The top five:
<P>
<ul>
<li>The Urban League received over $3 million from corporations.  It supports an &quot;Urban Marshall Plan for America,&quot; a $500 billion expansion of the welfare state to achieve the &quot;goal of black-white parity by the year 2000.&quot;  Toward this end it opposed U.S. military action against Iraq fearing the deaths of a disproportionate number of blacks.  The League receives over half of its $26.5 million budget from the federal government. 
<li>The Enterprise Foundation received nearly $2 million.  A recipient of large U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development contracts, it would dramatically increase federal funding for low-income housing.
<li>The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has seen its proud history of civil rights activism tarnished by scandal.  And its support of racial quotas in hiring undermines a commitment to equal rights.  The NAACP received nearly $1.6 million in corporate contributions.
<li>The Nature Conservancy boasts that it is &quot;the largest private system of nature sanctuaries in the world.&quot;  But it has sold millions of acres of private lands to the federal government at a profit to itself, actions for which it was reprimanded by the General Accounting Office.  Corporations contributed $1.2 million to the Conservancy.
<li>The Committee for Economic Development supported the government mandates of the Family and Medical Leave Act.  CED Chairman Owen Butler opposes school choice initiatives.  The Committee received nearly $1.2 million from corporations.  
</ul>
<P><br>
<a name="big"></a>
<B>Big Business and Interest Group Liberalism</B>
<P>
This edition of <I>Patterns of Corporate Philanthropy</I> tracks the source and destination of nearly $37 million in corporate philanthropy.  This is the amount that 129 of the nation's largest companies contributed to over 300 nonprofit advocacy groups in 1992, the most recent year for which records are available.  For eight years Capital Research Center has surveyed giving to nonprofit advocacy groups by America's largest corporations as determined by <I>Forbes Magazine</I>.  Our findings have never been worse:  Big businesses gave $3.46 to left-leaning interest groups for every dollar contributed to right-of-center groups.  
<P>
	Recipient groups are classified according the the following criteria:
<P><ul>
<li><I>The Change-Oriented Right</I> includes conservative organizations like The Heritage Foundation, Hoover Institution and Capital Research Center, as well as market liberal and libertarian groups like the Cato Institute, Reason Foundation and Competitive Enterprise Institute.  These groups are strong defenders of individual liberty and responsibility, and they are convinced that major cuts in government programs, taxes, and regulations are essential for economic prosperity and personal freedom.  They received only 11% of 1992 corporate contributions to nonprofit pubic affairs groups.
<li><I>The Establishment Right</I> includes the American Enterprise Institute, Center for Strategic and International Studies, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  These organizations favor less systemic reforms to eliminate waste and fraud in government and to improve economic efficiency.  These groups actually received slightly less funding from corporations than the Change-Oriented Right.
<li><I>Non-ideological</I> groups like the Center for Governmental Research and the Rand Corporation avoid controversy over political values and offer pragmatic or &quot;good government&quot; policy prescriptions.   They received the smallest share of corporate philanthropy, less than four percent.
<li><I>The Establishment Left</I> consists of moderate center-left groups like the Brookings Institution and the National Alliance of Business, as well as liberal groups like the Urban League, Enterprise Foundation, and Nature Conservancy.  These groups defend government's role as a problem-solver and look favorably on increased government regulation and taxation.  The lion's share of corporate contributions--nearly 64 percent--went to them.
<li><I>The Change-Oriented Left</I> includes groups that favor a government-initiated restructuring of American economic and social institutions.  Groups like the Center for Community Change, Children's Defense Fund, the NAACP, and more radical activists like Greenpeace pursue collectivist public policies through activist politics.  These groups received 11% of corporate contributions.
</ul><P>
	Corporate America's connection to interest group liberalism is most evident when funding of &quot;change-oriented&quot; groups, Left and Right, is compared to corporate funding of &quot;establishment&quot; groups.  Corporate contributions to nonprofit groups on the change-oriented Right were equal to corporate contributions to nonprofit groups on the change-oriented Left.  This finding suggests that corporate funds may neutralize or cancel out the impact of the most determined agents of change.  But the Establishment Left received more than six dollars in corporate contributions for every dollar that went to Establishment Right groups.  Money means influence inside the Washington, D.C. Beltway.  By a six to one margin, corporate executives gave it to liberal interest groups.  Is it any wonder that politics is in gridlock and public policies reinforcing a failed welfare state remain in place?
<P>
<br>
<a name="conclusions"></a>
<B>Conclusions</B>
<P>
<ul>
<li>That big business funds the liberal agenda flies in the face of conventional wisdom.  But the common presumption that American corporations are conservative advocates of the free enterprise system is far from the truth.  The charitable contributions of America's largest companies provide financial support for group interests well to the left of mainstream Americans.
<li>Corporations undermine traditional charities by giving to advocacy groups.  The poor are ill-served when funds that might have been used for them go instead to groups favoring programs of advocacy.
<li>Finally, it is improper for unprofitable corporations to make philanthropic donations.  Worse, it is inexcusable that corporations, profitable or not, contribute to groups whose political agenda undermines the conditions that make possible their own economic prosperity.  In neglecting shareholders' interests in long-term profitability, managers betray their fiduciary trust.
</ul>
<P><br>
<a name="call"></a>
<B>A Call To Action</b>
<P>
What will change the behaviour of corporate management?  If shareholders believe corporate philanthropy is directly or indirectly hurting profits, they may want to confront company policies directly.  Capital Research Center urges corporate shareholders as well as taxpayers, consumers, and citizens to express their dissatisfaction to company executives.  Let them know that corporate contributions:
<P><ul>
	<li>should not take precedence over returns to investors;
	  <li>should not fund advocacy groups over traditional charities;
 	  <li>should not favor liberal interest groups over groups favoring market reform.  
</ul><P>
	Without popular pressure the pattern of bias in corporate philanthropy will continue, and Americans' desire for change will remain frustrated.  If big business will stop funding liberal advocacy groups it may be possible yet to replace the welfare state with the land of opportunity.

	Capital Research Center wrote to each of the 250 largest American corporations (as ranked by <I>Forbes</I> according to sales) and requested information on both direct corporate and corporate foundation charitable contributions, including a complete list of grant amounts and recipients for 1992.  We obtained partial or complete lists of grant recipients from 147 corporations.  (These lists included data on giving by the corporation, its subsidiaries, and/or its corporate foundation.  The structure of each corporate program determined the nature of the lists.)  The 147 corporate responses included ten lists of direct corporate grants only, 110 lists of corporate foundation grants only, and nine lists of both corporate foundation and direct corporate grants.  Another 18 lists lacked the data necessary to determine a company rating. (In some cases the company did not have a philanthropic program, or no grants to advocacy groups were found, or the grant recipients were listed without corresponding dollar amounts).  While most scholarly studies consider data samples of 5-10% a success, we obtained sufficient data to establish giving patterns for 51.6% of the <I>Forbes</I> 250.
<P>
	Each corporate foundation is required to file a Form 990-PF annually with the Internal Revenue Service.  The form lists grant recipients and the amounts awarded to each.  We obtained copies of these forms from the Foundation Center or from companies directly.  In Section Two, citation of a Form 990-PF as the only available data source indicates that the company did not provide independent information for its direct giving or that of its subsidiaries.  In these cases the list of grant recipients represents only those grants made through the corporate foundation.  Capital Research Center made at least two follow-up telephone calls when a corporation failed to send requested information, or sent only partial information after three requests.
<P>	In addition to all non-advocacy related grants, we generally excluded three types of giving: &quot;in kind&quot; contributions such as land or computer equipment, because data are not readily available; grants matching gifts from company employees, because employees generally determine the choice of recipient; and contributions to political action committees, because grants to candidates are fundamentally different from nonprofit advocacy giving.
<P>	After a careful review of annual reports, newsletters, books, pamphlets, and other relevant publications, Capital Research Center classified over 300 grant recipients, using an eight-point scale: 1 (radical left), 2 (left), 3 (liberal), 4 (center-left), 5 (center), 6 (center-right), 7 (market liberal), 8 (conservative).  	Ratings were based on primary source information and reputable secondary sources.  Evaluators worked separately to assure independent analyses of the documentation, and individual group ratings were averaged to determine each organization's final rating.  Although this process is judgemental, similar category and rating systems are common in social science and public policy research measuring the impact of ideology on public policy.
<P>	To analyze the giving patterns of each corporation and, where applicable, its foundation, we computed a mean from the ratings assigned to each corporate grant recipient, <I>adjusted </I>by the dollar amount of each grant.  The company rating, then, is a weighted average of its recipients' ratings.  For example, if a company makes 10 grants to public affairs organizations, 9 for $1,000 each and 1 for $50,000, with all $1,000 grants awarded to conservative groups (rated 8) and the $50,000 grant to a group with a rating of 2 (left), the adjusted mean is 2.9 * ([{9 * (8 * $1,000)} + {2 * $50,000}] / [{9 * $1,000} + $50,000]) because the corporation gave far more in dollar terms to leftist than to conservative groups.
<P>	Thus, the corporate rating is a computation and letter grades were derived from this figure for every corporation giving at least $250,000 to nonprofit advocacy groups.  Based on ratings of 8 and 7 for change-oriented right, 6 for establishment-right, 5 for nonideological, 4 and 3 for establishment-left, and 2 and 1 for change-oriented left groups, an adjusted mean of at least 6.5 merits an &quot;A;&quot; an adjusted mean of 5.5 to 6.4, a &quot;B;&quot; an adjusted mean of 4.5 to 5.4, a &quot;C;&quot; an adjusted mean of 3.0 to 4.4, a &quot;D;&quot; and an adjusted mean below 3.0, an &quot;F.&quot;  A corporation that consistently supported nonprofit advocacy groups that favor reducing regulatory barriers to enterprise would thus easily merit an &quot;A,&quot; while one that supported nonideological groups or that contributed equally to groups of both the left and right would receive a &quot;C.&quot;

<P>	Grades refer only to corporate contributions to nonprofit advocacy groups that attempt to influence public policy.  Giving to museums, symphonies, medical research and education institutions, and organizations that primarily provide direct services to the poor is not counted.

<DD>Almost out of public sight, a struggle for the future of higher education has reached a crisis point. The outcome of that crisis is still uncertain. At stake is whether colleges and universities should retain their wide institutional variety, unique to American higher education, or become standardized instruments for social change.
<P>For two decades, ideology-driven academics have sought to shape higher education to reflect their "politically correct" views. They have won some battles but lost others, largely because some few college administrators have held firm and because the Department of Education and Congress have intervened.
<P>
<a name="2">
<B>How Accrediting Works</B>
<P>
College accreditation is a little-understood cooperative process. Reminiscent of the medieval guild system, it is essentially peer review, designed to ensure quality among institutions of higher learning. It amounts to an endorsement of one school by representatives of other schools.
<P>
The U.S. Department of Education recognizes six tax-exempt 501(c)(3)
regional accrediting associations. They are the Middle States Associatioin of Colleges nad Schools Commission on Higher Education (Philadelphia), New England Association of Schools and Colleges Commission on Institutions of Higher Education (Bedford, Massachusetts), North Central Association of Colleges and Schools
Commission on Institutions of Higher Education (Chicago), Northwest Association of Schools & Colleges (Seattle), Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (decatur, Georgia), and Western Association of Schools and Colleges Accrediting Commission for Senior Colleges and Universities (Oakland, California). Each accredits schools in its respective region. Middle States, for example, accredits colleges,
secondary schools, and elementary schools in Delaware, the District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, the Republic of Panama, and the Virgin Islands.
<P>
Accrediting agencies derive their budgets primarily from dues from member schools,
although workshop and consulting fees, publication sales, and foundation 
support supplement these revenues.  The boards of  accrediting agencies are generally composed of representatives from member schools.  The creation of new accrediting 
standards usually requires input from member institutions.
<P>
<a name="3">
<P><B>From Academic Standards to &quot;Diversity Standards&quot;</B>
<P>
Educators began banding together to create accrediting agencies in the late 19th century out of fear that the federal government would standardize higher education.  
After World War II, the federal government began to rely 
on accrediting associations to guarantee quality education 
to veterans attending college under the GI Bill of Rights.  
Only accredited schools could receive GI students using 
federal funds to pay for tuition.  Accreditors were thus 
made gatekeepers of federal monies, a role that expanded 
substantially as federal funding of higher education in the 
form of student loans and research grants increased.  By 
the 1970s, accreditors held life-or-death funding power 
over most colleges and universities.
<P>
Emboldened by the political correctness movement 
of the 1980s, some accrediting agencies--particularly 
Middle States and the Western Association of Schools and 
Colleges--began to look beyond traditional accrediting 
criteria, such as library resources, laboratory equipment, 
and classroom space.  &quot;Diversity standards&quot; began to 
overshadow longstanding academic standards.  These 
newer standards essentially sought to tell colleges and 
universities what they should teach, who should teach it, and to 
whom it should be taught.  Some colleges and universities 
even gave accreditors an important role in recruiting and 
hiring faculty and administrators, whose decisions often 
revolved around the open-sesame words &quot;diversity&quot; and 
&quot;affirmative action.&quot;
<P>
Some colleges balked at the new standards.  &quot;You 
will destroy us,&quot; the dean of St. John's College, a small 
liberal arts college in Annapolis, Maryland, wrote to Middle States. 
 As a result of complaints from other schools under 
Middle States' jurisdiction, the Department of Education in 
1991 temporarily withheld reauthorization of Middle 
States' accrediting powers.
<P>
On June 22, 1990, Middle States told the Department 
of Education that although it had referred to &quot;equity 
and diversity concerns&quot; in 221 letters to colleges and 
universities over the last ten years, in only two cases had 
such concerns become problematic.  These, Middle 
States claimed, were &quot;satisfactorily resolved.&quot;
<P>
Yet college and university officials estimate that 
roughly one out of three campus visits by accrediting teams 
still raises questions regarding the &quot;diversity&quot; of curricula or 
of students, faculty, and trustees.  No one can say for sure 
how many colleges and universities have had accreditation delayed due to an alleged failure to meet diversity standards.  Schools are reluctant to draw attention to problems 
in obtaining accreditation for fear that students, 
graduates, and donors will question an institution's adequacy.  
Furthermore, college administrators do not want to attract 
the wrath of accreditors.
<P>
Some observers say that accreditors have recently 
placed renewed emphasis on traditional academic standards.  
But diversity standards have causedand continue to 
causesubstantial problems for colleges and universities.
<P>

<P><B>Baruch College</B>
<P>
In an October 29, 1990 op-ed piece in the <I>Wall 
Street Journal</I>, Dr. Joel Segall, former president of Bernard 
Baruch College, a highly-esteemed business school of the 
City University of New York, wrote that the Middle 
States Association of Colleges and Schools was subjecting 
Baruch to &quot;a Kafkaesque trial process.&quot;  Segall claimed that 
institutions evaluated by Middle States &quot;are not made aware 
of explicit charges nor are they presented with evidence.&quot;
<P>
Speaking in November the following year at a meeting 
of the U.S. Department of Education's Committee on 
Accreditation, Segall said: &quot;During the lengthy 
discussions with Middle States' representatives prior to the visit of 
the evaluation team, there was absolutely no suggestion that 
the proportions of minority faculty and administrators 
and retention rates [of minority students] would play a role 
in the accreditation.&quot;  He added that when these demands 
were later put before him, he was &quot;blindsided.&quot;  At the 
time, Baruch's student body was 36 percent white, 26 
percent black, 20 percent Asian, and 18 percent Hispanic.  
Minorities comprised 18 percent of full-time facultyfar 
higher than most colleges in the country.
<P>
&quot;Persuaded that an unfortunate mistake had been 
made,&quot; Segall met with Dr. Howard L. Simmons, the executive director of Middle States.  Segall &quot;had barely started&quot; 
to present figures showing the diversity already present 
at Baruch when Simmons stopped him, remarking 
ironically, &quot;I don't want to get into a numbers game with you.&quot;  
After some discussion, Segall finally asked Simmons what 
he wanted.  Simmons responded with two words: 
&quot;Social justice.&quot;  From that, Segall concluded that Middle 
States' was motivated by &quot;zealotry in pursuit of what is 
essentially a political agenda and a social goal.&quot;
<P>
Baruch College was reaccredited after it developed 
a comprehensive plan to hire more minority faculty 
and administrators.  But Segall claimed it &quot;was a cave-in. . . , and for that I am responsible.&quot;  When the <I>New York Times</I> ran a front page story on the affair, corporate donors began to pull back, parents expressed concern, and students 
feared that federal loans would dry up.  &quot;We fielded a lot 
of telephone calls from alumni asking whether their 
degree really meant anything any more,&quot; Segall said.  He 
eventually resigned.
<P>
<a name="5">
<P><B>Westminster Theological Seminary</B>
<P>
On April 1, 1989, the dean of Westminster 
Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania responded to a concern 
expressed by Middle States regarding the all-male 
membership of Westminster's board.  The seminary's 
constitution, the dean explained, required that the governing 
board consist of ordained elders, and the seminary 
understood Scripture to forbid the ordination of women.  On March 
7, 1990, Middle States, declaring that it would not 
&quot;compromise&quot; on &quot;principles,&quot; ordered Westminster to show 
cause &quot;why its accreditation should not be removed.&quot;
<P>
Middle States executive director Howard Simmons 
was summoned in November 1990 to the Department of 
Education to discuss his request for renewed recognition 
of Middle States' accrediting authority.  Simmons 
claimed that diversity &quot;is not something which was required by us.&quot; 
 But the Department's Committee on Accreditation was 
not convinced, and recommended remanding Middle 
States' accrediting powers.  In April the new Secretary of 
Education, Lamar Alexander, sent the matter to the 
Advisory Committee for fresh scrutiny.  Simmons and his 
backers would have to explain themselves again the 
following November.
<P>
But even before Secretary Alexander ordered 
recognition withheld, Middle States compromised 
with Westminster: women would serve on committees of 
the seminary's board, though not on the board itself.  
The compromise came after Middle States was chastised in 
a resounding legal opinion by veteran First 
Amendment litigator William Bentley Ball, appealing on 
Westminster's behalf to the Council on Postsecondary Accreditation, 
a now-defunct Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that 
oversaw regional accreditors.  After the compromise, 
Middle States revoked its show-cause order and asked 
Westminster to withdraw its complaints to the Department of Education.
But the attempt of Middle States to save face ran into 
a stone wall November 20, 1991 at the meeting of the 
Department of Education's Committee on Accreditation.  
The Committee was armed with a staff report 
contradicting Middle States' claim to Secretary Alexander: that 
since 1981, only two cases dealing with diversity had 
become problematicBaruch and Westminster.  Twenty cases 
selected from the files at the Department of Education 
showed that Middle States had &quot;increased the level of 
enforcement of its diversity standards,&quot; that it had &quot;treated these 
standards as mandatory,&quot; and that it had &quot;repeatedly used 
the threat of non-accreditation to obtain compliance.&quot;
<P>
Within a month of this meeting, the trustees of 
Middle States voted not to apply &quot;diversity&quot; to Westminster or 
to any school as a condition of accreditation.  But 
according to the <I>Chronicle of Higher 
Education</I>, senior staff at Middle States said they &quot;were only clarifying their position&quot; 
and that they &quot;still supported the diversity standards, but 
had never intended to use them to deny accreditation to 
colleges.&quot;  Early in February 1992, the Department of 
Education renewed its recognition of Middle States' 
accrediting authority.
<P>
<a name="6">
<P><B>Thomas Aquinas College</B>
<P>
In late 1993, <I>The Wall Street Journal</I> opined that 
&quot;Anyone who still believes that political correctness is an 
imagined threat should have a look at what a university 
accrediting body is proposing in California. . . .  [The 
Western Association of Schools and Colleges] is now proposing 
that schools meet a new `diversity' standard, arguing that 
`diversity is an essential element of academic discipline. . . .' 
 WASC executive director Dr. Stephen Weiner (who did 
not return calls) has announced that diversity is 
`inextricably linked' to `quality' in higher education.  In short, unless 
a school shows that it subscribes to this suddenly 
discovered dogma, WASC's accreditors would not consider it a 
school that could provide a quality education.&quot;
<P>
Why would WASC venture into waters where Middle States almost met shipwreck?  The answer is probably twofold: the arrival of the Clinton Administration 
and former Stanford University president Donald 
Kennedy's support of WASC.  Unlike Baruch and Westminster, 
on whose behalf Bush Education Secretary Lamar 
Alexander intervened, Clinton Education Secretary Richard 
Riley took no action regarding Thomas Aquinas College, a 
small Catholic liberal arts college in California.
<P>
Thomas Aquinas College was founded 25 years ago 
to steep students in the traditions of Western Culture.  
During one visit, representatives of WASC asked 
then-president Dr. Ronald MacArthur why the school didn't teach African philosophy.  He responded that it would do so if 
WASC could suggest an African philosopher up to the level of 
the philosophers the college was already teaching.
<P>
WASC reaccredited Thomas Aquinas in 1993, but 
WASC executive director Stephen Weiner was not fully satisfied. 
 &quot;Thomas Aquinas is a good institution of its 
particular kind,&quot; Weiner said.  &quot;I think it would be a better 
institution if it were more concerned with a variety of cultural 
institutions.&quot;
<P>
At the time, Weiner was seeking approval from 
WASC accredited institutions for his &quot;Policy Statement on 
Diversity,&quot; then in its third draft.  Since 1991, Thomas 
Aquinas had criticized the drafts, which included such 
dubious assertions as &quot;All study is intended to break down 
narrow certainties.&quot;  Drafts of the statement also lacked any 
guarantee that WASC would not punish institutions found 
deficient in &quot;diversity.&quot;  A majority of WASC-accredited 
institutions supported the statement by January 1994, 
though many of their letters of support were guarded.  
Opponents also charged that some institutions acted out of fear 
of retribution from WASC.
<P>But by this time, a second issue had moved to the fore. 
 WASC demanded that universities strike a better 
balance between the time teachers spent teaching and the time 
they devoted to research.  This encroached on the turf of 
some powerful people, including new Stanford University 
president Gerhard Casper, who had already been considering 
the problems that research poses for teaching.  He and 
others resented WASC's intrusion into dilemmas they were 
seeking to resolve themselves.
<P>In early 1994, Casper, addressing the Stanford 
Faculty Senate, acknowledged his own liberal political 
convictions, but he drew a clear distinction between means 
and ends: &quot;A university must prize freedom, 
nondiscrimination and equality of opportunity for every university 
citizen above all other values.  But it is a serious mistake to 
believe that such values are promoted by layers of 
bureaucratic regulation.&quot;  The Faculty Senate voted to endorse 
Casper's opposition to WASC's diversity statement, and it 
added that WASC &quot;has circulated a second policy draft [on 
teaching and research] that is more troubling than the 
diversity statement.&quot;
<P>Casper declared, &quot;I will do everything possible to 
resist this kind of intrusion on the part of an outside agency.&quot;  
He intimated how: &quot;New federal regulations have begun 
to transfer some of the traditional functions of 
accrediting groups to state agencies.  While I would normally 
oppose more government oversight, in this case the state may do 
a better job than WASC has done recently.&quot;
<P>But Weiner's confidence was not shaken.  He had 
garnered a show of support for his diversity statement and 
had the backing of the chairman of the accrediting 
commission of WASC, Dr. Donald Gerth.  Weiner's confidence 
might have been justified if his only worry had been WASC.  
But he was also seeking to create a national group that 
would accredit accrediting associations.  This effort fell 
apart amid criticism that it was a power grab.
<P>Weiner abruptly left on a three-month paid leave 
in March of 1994.  On March 17, a rump group of 
disgruntled WASC members met at Pepperdine University and 
laid plans for a meeting of WASC that April in Maui, 
Hawaii (which is under WASC's jurisdiction).  Their carefully 
laid strategyto discredit WASC policiesprevailed.  
The Maui meeting turned into a rebellion against the old regime. 
 Dr. Gerth and others admitted that the credibility of 
WASC had suffered.
<P>
On May 5, 1994, Attorney Ball entered the WASC dispute on behalf of Thomas Aquinas.  He told WASC that its attempt to force &quot;diversity and multiculturalism&quot; 
on institutions of higher learning infringed their First 
Amendment rights.  His 20-page opinion went unanswered, as 
had a briefer memo to the same effect from Michael 
McConnell, a prominent professor at the University of Chicago 
Law School.
<P>By this time, Gerth had apparently realized that he 
might find himself presiding over the dissolution of WASC. 
 Weiner's assistant, Ralph Wolff, announced that a 
meeting of the accrediting commission of WASC, scheduled 
for June 23, 1994 and open to representatives of accredited institutions, would discuss &quot;the future of WASC.&quot;  
The announcement was taken to imply that the policies 
anathema to Stanford and other universities could become a 
dead letter.
<P>
That fall another storm broke.  A provision of the 
WASC constitution that had been designed to protect the 
autonomy of accredited institutions, especially those under 
religious sponsorship, was surreptitiously altered.  Questions 
of good faith arose.  Weiner showed a reluctance to 
produce minutes of meetings of the accrediting commission 
during which the amendment was made, and Gerth, under 
pressure, provided an explanation that proved inaccurate.  
In May of 1995, Weiner's resignation was announced, 
effective in July of 1996.
<P>
<a name="7">
<P><B>Other Ways of Ensuring Excellence?</B>
<P>
Yet many problems remain.  The plan for a 
national supervising board of accreditors has, at least for 
now, failed.  In place of it and its predecessor, the Council 
on Postsecondary Accreditation, a group of presidents 
and trustees of accredited institutions was formed this May. 
 Calling itself the Council for Higher Education 
Accreditation, it is considered far less dangerous than a 
supervisory board of accreditors because it consists chiefly of 
college presidents.  Proponents believe it will carry weight 
with Congress in the great unsettled question of whether 
governmental accreditation should replace voluntary 
accreditation.
<P>
Some of the most prominent figures in higher 
education believe regional accreditors should play a far more 
limited role.  Professor Diane Ravitch of New York University, 
a former Department of Education assistant secretary, 
argues that accreditors &quot;should visit only schools that are in 
trouble,and leave the others alone.&quot;  Moreover, she wants 
the federal government to &quot;extend recommendation to a 
variety of accrediting groups whose purposes differ. . . .  The 
point is to break the monopoly power of the regional 
accrediting agencies and to give colleges and universities the 
opportunity to choose the kind of agency they wish to belong to 
and be judged by.&quot;
<P>
One such organization is the new American Academy 
for Liberal Education (AALE), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit based 
in Washington, D.C.  Last year, the Department of 
Education recognized AALE as national accrediting agency for 
liberal arts colleges and programs.  Concerned about 
increasing politicization on college campuses, AALE seeks to 
raise academic standards and strengthen the general 
education component of undergraduate education.  Its founding 
group of scholars and academics includes Jacques Barzun 
(Provost Emeritus of Columbia University), John Agresto 
(President of St. John's College of Santa Fe), and 
Gertrude Himmelfarb (Professor Emeritus of the City University 
of New York).
<P>
AALE President Dr. Jeffrey Wallin, former Director 
of General Programs at the National Endowment for the 
Humanities, notes that because of AALE's rigorous 
standards, which include mandatory courses in literature, 
science, and a foreign language, the number of 
institutions accredited by AALE is not expected to surpass that of regional accrediting associations.  And although the 
AALE draws its membership from a national pool, it does 
not expect to be a fierce competitor of regional accreditors. 
 Colleges that receive AALE accreditation have the 
option of declaring AALE their primary accreditor or of 
holding membership with both the AALE and their 
regional accreditor.  Thomas Aquinas College, for example, 
has applied to AALE for accreditation, but intends to 
remain within WASC.
<P>
According to its newsletter, over 150 institutions 
have contemplated AALE membership.  So far, AALE has 
granted candidacy for accreditation to three institutions and 
one program: the University of Dallas, Rhodes College 
(Memphis), Thomas Aquinas College, and the James 
Madison College of Michigan State University.  The 
accrediting process takes about a year to complete and includes:
<UL>
<LI>A self-study by the institution
<LI>An on-site visit by a team of volunteer 
	evaluators appointed by the AALE in cooperation with the school
<LI>A team report and recommendation by AALE's Council of Scholars, a body responsible 	for creating and maintaining AALE's evaluation standards
<LI>A vote by AALE's Board of Trustees

In the controversy surrounding accreditation, one 
group appears to have been left out: parents.  True, in this age 
of federal funding, parents don't always directly foot most 
of the bill for their children's education.  Still, many 
make sacrifices to assure the best education for their offspring. 
 Moreover, they retain moral responsibility for 
their children's education, and hence should have a certain say 
in it.  Despite this, the responsibilities and rights of parents 
are rarely encountered in the literature of accreditation, 
let alone in the polemics over university curricula.
<P>
One way parents can remain involved in higher 
education is through alumni associations.  These, however, are 
often under the control of universities.  For example, 
when Thomas Troy, an historian and a graduate of Holy 
Cross College in Worcester, Massachusetts, asked his alma 
mater for the addresses of his classmates so that he could write 
to them about his objections to proposed changes in 
the college's mission statement, the president of Holy 
Cross refused.  Episodes such as this are not uncommon.
<P>
The National Alumni Forum (NAF), a 501(c)(3) 
organization based in Washington, D.C., was founded in 1995 
to support academic freedom and excellence and to enlist 
the help of alumni, donors, and trustees in the fight 
against political correctness.  With members from over 200 
colleges and universities, its leadership includes former 
National Endowment for the Humanities chairman Lynne 
V. Cheney (chairman), former Colorado Governor Richard 
D. Lamm (vice-chairman), and Jerry L. Martin (president).
<P>Working with its major donors, NAF recently created 
a program called the Fund for Academic Renewal that 
helps alumni selectively target their gifts and ensure that 
their wishes are implemented.  According to Martin, &quot;Many alumni have come to understand that unrestricted gifts to 
[a college's] annual fund can be used to support the 
mediocre as well as the excellent, the political as well as the 
academic, the trendy as well as the enduring.&quot;  Another 
new project is the Alumni and Trustees for Higher 
Education Accountability (ATHENA), which offers trustees 
advice on how to fulfill their responsibilities with an eye 
toward improving the academic quality of their institutions.  
NAF has also alerted trustees to accreditation issues and 
encouraged them to meet with the staff of the American 
Academy for Liberal Education.
<P>
Higher education, of course, has become big 
business and federal funding of colleges and universities has 
increased enormously.  Where tax money mixes with 
religion and where longstanding academic principles 
encounter new political ideologies, there is always tension and 
the danger of explosion.  Hence, the fierce struggles 
over access to alumni lists, over the academic canon, over 
the &quot;climate&quot; on campusand over accreditation.
<P>
We now have in the West a vast system for educating 
our children.  Trustees and alumni are impressed by 
splendid campuses, and fundraisers urge them to contribute to 
new building programs.  In some sense, this disguises the 
struggle for the minds of the next generation that occurs on 
college campuses.  Amid this struggle, we cannot afford to 
lose sight of the purpose of education, summed up two and a 
half millennia ago by Plato, who recalled of his own 
teacher, Socrates, that Heaven descended on his low-roofed 
cottage.<BR>

<h2><BR>
American Bar Association  
<I>By One Vote Lawyers' Group Picks 
Controversial President-Elect </I>
Orlando Convention Features Liberal Line Up</h2><BR>
</center>
<p>
During the first week of August, the American Bar Association
(ABA) held its annual meeting at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida.
Speakers included prominent Clinton administration officials suach as U.N
Ambassador Madeleine K. Albright, Attorney General Janet Reno, and Defense
Secretary William Perry. First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton received an 
award from the Young Lawyers Division. Other speakers included Supreme
Court Justice John Paul Stevens, who anchors the high court's four-man
liberal wing, and attorney Johnnie Cochran of O.J. Simpson fame.
There were no conservative speakers and no Republican politicians.
<P>
During the meeting, the Commission on Women in the Profession conferred its 
Margaret Brent Women Lawyers of Achievement Award on ultrafeminist Rep.
Patricia Schroeder (D-CO). Other recipients included liberal Judge
Rosemary Barkett, infamous for her solicitude toward violent criminal
defendants and death row inmates, and lynn Hecht Schafran, director
of the National Judicial Education Program for the NOW Legal Defense and Education
Fund. Beginning to get the picture?
<P>
The group adopted resolutions opposing term limits for judges, encouraging initiatives
that allow "extended contact visitation" between incarcerated parents and their 
children, and recommending early release for prisoners with AIDS.
<P>
The group also chose its next president-elect, Jerome Shestack, a liberal
activist whose selection does not augur well for those interested in reform.
It suggests that the ABA's leftward advance will 
only pick up speed, and that the group will involve itself in politics to an even 
greater degree.
<P>All this is further evidence of the once-prestigious ABA's descent from 
proud professional organization to political pressure group.  From its controversial role 
in the Bork battle to its support for a raft of left wing policy prescriptions, the 
ABA has lost all claim to be an unbiased voice of the legal profession.  It has become 
just another Washington lobby  not much different from the National 
Education Association, except for the more expensive suits.
<P>Yet one should not simply waive off the ABA as a lost cause and forget about it. 
The Association remains extremely influential both in the legal community, in 
law schools, and on Capitol Hill.  It continues to play a semi-official, and key, role in 
the selection of federal judges.  Its membership constitutes a powerful and 
prestiguous force in society.  And its ability to 
effect public policy can not be overstated.
<P>Thus, the ABA is something that should concern us all.  Particularly so because 
its armor is beginning to weaken.  Republican presidential candidate Robert Dole 
has made the ABA's partisanship a campaign issue.  Earlier this year, the Senate 
Judiciary Committee held a hearing to examine 
the ABA's involvement in the selection of judges.  That committee is reportedly 
one vote away from removing the ABA from the selection process.  
<P>
<P>* * * * *
<P>
<P>On issue after issue, the ABA marches in lock step with the prevailing 
liberal dogma.  It supports abortion rights and taxpayer funding of abortions, as well 
as affirmative action, gay rights, and greater gun control.  It opposes key aspects 
of welfare reform, as well as employer sanctions for immigration law violations.  
On legal issues, it follows the lead of the Association of Trial Lawyers of 
America and the contingency fee bar, opposing tort reform, caps on punitive damages in 
product liability cases, and legislation reforming federal securities law.  
<P>There are many other examples of the ABA's embrace of liberal politics.  At 
its mid-year meeting in Baltimore last February, the Association officially 
endorsed the Platform of Action adopted at the recent international women's 
conference in Beijing, China.  In addition to 
recommending the usual feminist agenda of abortion, &quot;children's rights,&quot; and 
affirmative action for women, the multilateral gathering considered measures 
recognizing &quot;five genders&quot; (male 
heterosexual, female heterosexual, gay, lesbian, and 
bisexual).  
<P>What is particularly troubling is not merely that the ABA supports liberal 
policies, but the extent to which its positions seem dictated more by the winds of 
political correctness than by sober analysis.  Consumed with issues like domestic 
violence and sexual harassment, the ABA has become a slave to liberal chic.
<P>The Association's Committee on Women in the Profession has been 
particularly busy.  Earlier this year, it released a report entitled 
<I>Elusive Equality</I>, which recommends that law schools 
establish committees on 
gender issues so that they might better meet the needs of women 
in the law school community.  The committees are supposed to monitor the 
curriculum to ensure that it is sufficiently inclusive of women's issues.  Emphasizing 
the need for more racial and sexual diversity within faculties, the report notes that
&quot;Many schools have found that they can hire better and more diverse groups of 
people if they are flexible about credentials. . . .&quot; 
 (Translation:  lowering or eliminating standards is an easy way to increase the 
pool of viable candidates.)  The report also suggests that gender issues  e.g. 
how many women are selected for law review  should be a factor in determining 
whether or not to grant accreditation to a law school.
<P><I>Elusive Equality</I> follows a 1995 report, 
<I>Unfinished Business</I>, which claims that there is widespread discrimination 
against women in law firms  and that the way to rectify this problem is to treat
women differently than men.  The report offers support for the notion that two sets 
of standards are needed to evaluate the performance of male and female 
attorneys, because &quot;Using the same criteria to 
evaluate men and women frequently undervalues the contributions of women.&quot;
<P>These reports were funded by the ABA's 
Fund for Justice and Education, the group's 501(c)(3) tax-exempt affiliate, which
receives over 40 percent of its revenues from the federal government.  For
fiscal year 1995, the Fund received $13,345,570 in federal funding.  This money 
came from various government agencies including the Departments of Justice,
Education, and Health and Human Services, the National Endowment for the 
Humanities and the U.S. Information Agency.  Other sources of support include the 
ABA, state governments, individuals, law firms, and institutional donors such as the 
Edna McConnell Clark Foundation, Weyerhauser Foundation, and Ford 
Motor Company.
<P><I>Why does an organization that claims to represent one of the wealthiest groups 
of people in society need taxpayer funding?  The ABA spends considerable amounts 
of time and money attempting to rehabilitate the image of attorneys in America.  
By refusing taxpayer money during the current budget crisis, it could take 
major steps toward achieving that goal.
<P><B>Current ABA President Lee Cooper</B></I><BR>
By involving itself so forcefully in policy issues in which it has no particular 
expertise the ABA can no longer credibly claim to the preeminent national 
representative of the legal profession.  Indeed
declining membership numbers belie such claims.  The ABA currently represents less 
than one half (37 percent) of the profession, and it should come as no surprise
that membership in the ABA has been steadily dropping.  After years of increases, 
membership has been falling throughout the nineties  from a highwater mark 
of 362,104 in 1991-92 to 333,831 in 1995-96.  Even more striking, the number 
of ABA members who are judges has dropped by over 40 percent.  Between 1988-89 
and 1995-96, the number of judicial members fell from 5,488 to 3,295.  
<P>Federal Appeals Judge John M. Walker, testifying before the Senate Judiciary 
Committee in May, noted that the politicization of the ABA creates &quot;special problems&quot; 
for judges.  According to Judge Walker, 
&quot;there is an inherent conflict between a bar association's political activity and the 
ability of judges who are members of that bar association to contribute to the 
association and at the same time to maintain the unquestioned impartiality and political 
neutrality that their judicial office requires.&quot;
<P>
<P><B>Perception versus Reality</B>
<P>The ABA bristles at charges of partisanship and argues that its political 
activities are wholly consistent with its role as a professional organization.  It regards 
the only problem as one of perception, not reality.
<P>This year Alabama attorney Lee Cooper became the ABA's president for 
1996-1997.  His selection is seen by many as an attempt to overcome the perception 
that the ABA is just another liberal special interest advocacy group.  A 
moderately conservative Southern Democrat who is pro-life, Cooper, 56, became president 
at the annual meeting in August.  He has said that the ABA should back away 
from involvement in contentious social issues that can only harm the organization.
<P>Yet Cooper's ascendancy appears to be only a hiatus from the group's 
leftward swing.  The Orlando convention demonstrated that, far from backing away 
from politics, the ABA has become even more its creature.  Rather than affirm its 
professional standing or at least move toward the center, the group remains dedicated 
to advancing the agenda of contemporary liberalism.  The selection of the 
group's next president, Jerome Shestack, signals that the activist community has no 
intention of relinquishing its grip on the ABA.
<P>
<P><B>Jerome Shestack:  The Model of a Liberal Lawyer</B>
<P>The ABA selects its presidents one year in advance.  The first step is to be 
nominated.  At the mid-year meeting in Baltimore, the ABA's nominating 
committee nominated Shestack by a one-vote margin, 31 to 30.  The nomination must 
then be approved by the House of Delegates at the annual meeting.  This vote, 
however, is largely a rubber stamp.  The current president, Cooper, was chosen at 
the ABA's convention last year, and began his term this August.  
<P>In Orlando, the House of Delegates approved the nominating 
committee's choice of Jerome Shestack to be the organizations
next president-elect. He will take over in August 1997.
<P>
A Philadelphia lawyer, Shestack stands in sharp contrast from Cooper.  A 
former executive director of the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights under Law 
and Carter administration ambassador to the United Nations Commission on 
Human Rights, Shestack does not shy from controversy.  It is widely reported 
that Shestack was one of four minority members of the Standing Committee on 
the Judiciary who decided that Robert Bork should receive the ABA rating &quot;not 
qualified&quot; to serve on the Supreme Court.  
The split vote was exploited successfully by Bork opponents to rally opposition to 
his confirmation.
<P>Shestack also reportedly has questioned judicial nominees about their 
religious views.  Arthur Schwab, who was nominated by President Reagan to the 
Third Circuit Court of Appeals, claims that Shestack asked him about his 
family's religious practices and the enrollment of Schwab's children at a religious school. 
 Although Shestack denies the charge, Schwab credits him with scuttling 
his nomination.  According to <I>ABA Watch</I>, a publication of the Federalist Society, 
U.S. District Judge James Graham has also said that the Standing Committee, 
while Shestack was a member, asked him about his religous views during the nomination
process.
<P><I>ABA Watch</I> also reports that Shestack has been a prominent supporter of
Democratic politicians like former Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Joseph
Biden and Pennsylvania's Lynn Yeakel, founder of the nonprofit group, Women's Way.
 Yeakel made Republican Senator Arlen Specter's questioning of Anita Hill 
during the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas the 
raison d' etre of her unsuccessful 1992 Senate campaign against Specter.  
<P>The acerbic Shestack garnered public attention in 1992 when the 
<I>Washington Post</I> reported his reaction to the 
ABA's refusal to allow then-Vice President Quayle to speak as its convention.  Shestack 
quipped that the ABA probably would have allowed Quayle to speak if he was a man 
of &quot;personal stature or legal ability.&quot; 
<P>In short, Shestack's record and statements leave no doubt about where 
he intends to lead the American Bar Association.  His selection sends a strong 
signal that the ABA has no intention to reform itself.
<P>
<P><B>Judicial Selection:  Time to Pull the Plug</B>
<P>The ABA's tarnished record in evaluating judicial appointments offers the 
most evidence of its decline as a professional organization.  Since the 1950s, the 
attorney general, prior to the nomination of federal judges, has provided the ABA 
with the names of prospective nominees.  The Association is also provided with 
background information on the candidates.  It interviews the candidates and rates 
them on a scale of well-qualified, qualified, or not qualified.  This is an awesome 
and unusual responsibility for a private organization.
<P>The Senate Judiciary Committee examined Republican and Democratic 
nominees with similar backgrounds and qualifications.  It found that Democratic 
nominees were consistently rated &quot;well qualified&quot; while similarly-situated 
Republican nominees received lower ratings.
<P>For instance, on the D.C. Circuit, liberal jurists Patricia Wald, Abner Mikva, 
and David Tatel all received &quot;well 
qualified&quot; ratings, while conservatives like 
Judges Laurence Silberman and James Buckley were given lower &quot;qualified&quot;/&quot;not 
qualified&quot; ratings. 
<P>Likewise, Seventh Circuit Democrat Diane Wood was given a 
&quot;well-qualified&quot; rating, while Judges Richard Posner 
and Frank Easterbrook, two titans of law and economics theory, both received 
qualified / not qualified ratings.  
<P>These facts have lead many to regard the ABA's evaluation process as 
fundamentally biased.  In May, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing to 
examine the ABA's role in judicial selection.  
Among those testifying was Washington attorney Daniel Troy, a former Justice 
Department official who has been actively involved in several ABA
committees and working groups. Troy testified that ABA evaluations
have become "overly political" and that the ABA's Standing Committee
on the Federal Judiciary "does indeed take the political views
of nominees whose views are not consonant with the ABA's liberal
philosophy."
<p>
P>Even the <I>Washington Post</I> reported that of the 15 members of the Standing 
Committee, 11 have made political contributions  nine to Democratic 
candidates and causes.  One member, Mortimer Caplin, gave over $12,000 to 
Democrats between 1991 and 1993.  In another article, the 
<I>Post</I> noted that about 67 percent of President Clinton's nominees 
received the ABA's highest rating, as compared to 52 and 53 percent for Presidents Bush 
and Reagan, respectively.  Perhaps not surprisingly, the Clinton administration 
has defended the ABA's role in the process.
<P>The ABA and its defenders insist that critics place too much emphasis on 
its advocacy of political positions and that in no way does it preclude the 
organization from being a neutral player in the 
process of judicial selection.  The Association claims that there is a Chinese Wall 
separating the ABA's political activities from its semi-official judicial evaluation duties. 
Responding to disbelieving Senators, ABA officials insisted that the ABA's 
Standing Committee on the 
Judiciary is &quot;insulated&quot; from the ABA's policymaking
activities and &quot;conducts its work completely
independent of the rest of the ABA.&quot;  
Standing committee members &quot;leave their 
politics at the door,&quot; they claim.
<P>Yet Senators' questions revealed that the wall of separation is at best a 
flimsy partition.  Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-UT) noted that Standing Committee 
members can also serve in the ABA's House of Delegates, which is responsible for 
adopting the group's positions on public policy issues.  He also noted that the current 
staff director for the Standing Committee, Irene Emsellem, is also a senior legislative 
counsel for the ABA's lobbying arm.  Emsellem was formerly a staffer for Senator 
Edward M. Kennedy (D-MA).
<P>Notwithstanding this probe, the ABA continues to enjoy its special 
quasi-official role in the judicial selection process.  
The Clinton Administration provides it wit<BR>
h early notification of the names of nominees and special access to 
information about those nominees.  The ABA continues to be received respectfully on 
Capitol Hill, and the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee has yet to take 
action to remove the ABA from the process.  Why?
<P>* * * * *
<P>In the battle of ideas, conservatives have won many strategic victories in 
recent years.  But the control of institutions  the schools, the media, the 
academy, and foundations  remains the province of the Left.  Professional 
organizations, including the most rigorously 
specialized, have not been able to resist the long 
march through the institutions that political advocacy groups commenced in the 1960s. 
 Until the mainstream reclaims these institutions or establishes suitable 
alternatives, groups like the American Bar 
Association must be recognized for what they are.

as clearly as the first order to go to New York. And

there would always be lots and lots of beds, and clothes

<P>
<H5> Reverend David Wilkerson<BR>
 The Cross and the Switchblade</H5>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<a name="1">
<BR>
<DD>In 1963 Dave Wilkerson wrote<I> The Cross and the 
Switchblade,</I> in which he recounted his experiences just a few years earlier 
in New York City.  Rev. Wilkerson was a self-described 
&quot;country preacher&quot; from Philipsburg, a small town in western 
Pennsylvania.  He was married with two children and pastoring a church 
in Philipsburg in 1958.  Rev. Wilkerson saw a story in 
<I>Life</I> magazine about seven gang youths in New York on trial for murder 
and suddenly felt a compelling urge to go to New York and help 
the boys.  
<P>Rev. Wilkerson took many leaps of faith, often unsure as 
to where he would turn next or who would pay tomorrow's bills.  
He met many gang members in Manhattan and Brooklyn, at first 
not knowing how he could help.  His ministry began to spread 
the good news that  homeless, destitute youths were loved and 
could have a better life. It has never departed from that central theme. 
 Often young people only needed someone to show them love 
and caring and lead them to a local church.  Others, however,  
fought in gangs, prostituted themselves, and turned to heroin for comfort. They needed more than just a message, they needed a home 
and constant attention.  
<P>Rev. Wilkerson dreamed of establishing such a home, a 
dream that came true in 1960.  With $100 in the bank, he agreed 
to purchase a large but neglected red-brick Georgian house.  
This house became the first Teen Challenge Center.  From that 
house 20 lowly-paid young workers coordinated efforts to 
evangelize the city's roughest neighborhoods, and to take in youths  
who needed extra attention.  Despite incidents of  stabbings 
and beatings, these workers remained devoted to  those they served. 
<P>The home saved many lives from gang violence and heroin. 
 Rev. Wilkerson believed that the only way to get and 
keep someone off heroin was to have that person receive the baptism 
of the Holy Spirit.  This religious experience is the central focus 
of many Pentecostal denominations.  The baptized Christian 
is taught to &quot;walk with the Holy Spirit,&quot; in close personal 
contact with God.  Rev. Wilkerson found that those who were 
baptized with the Holy Spirit no longer craved heroin.  
<P>
As Rev. Wilkerson was finishing his book, a new Teen 
Challenge Center was opening in Chicago, using the same methods 
as New York Teen Challenge.  In the epilogue he draws this 
lesson: &quot;The Holy Spirit is in charge.  As long as He remains in 
charge, the program will thrive.  The minute we try to do things by our 
own power we will fail.&quot;  Teen Challenge now operates 130 
centers nationwide. 
<P>
The Teen Challenge model is founded on a religious 
component that actually reverses the usual dynamic of religious 
rehabilitation programs.  The usual religious rehabilitation program 
aims to end drug and alcohol abuse  through a religion-based program. 
 Teen Challenge starts with discipleship training which 
battles man's sinful nature and has the side-effect of eradicating drug 
and alcohol abuse.  Teen Challenge firmly sees itself as a 
discipleship training program, and not a drug and alcohol 
rehabilitation program. 
<P>
Still, Teen Challenge focuses its ministry on those whose 
lives will be short and miserable if their addiction is allowed 
to continue. As patterns of addiction have evolved, Teen 
Challenge has changed its focus from teenagers to adults, but the 
philosophy remains the same.  The purpose of the program is not to 
&quot;rehabilitate&quot; in the usual sense of returning the individual to a 
previous state.  The goal  is to create a new person from the olda 
person who does not need addictive substances because he has 
found contentment in a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. 
<P>
<BR>
<a name="2">
<P>
<B>A Growing Program</B>
<P>
Teen Challenge began in 1958 with the tiny but 
powerful ministry of one person who felt the call to leave his 
small-town parsonage for the streets of New York City.  Thirty-eight 
years and thousands of lives later, Teen Challenge is a major 
force among adolescents and adults who have addictive 
problems, and thousands will proudly declare that Teen Challenge 
has  given them a life they never thought possible--a happy life 
free from addictions. 
<P>
As of 1995, Teen Challenge had 130 centers in the 
United States, including Puerto Rico, and a total staff of over 1,500.  
One hundred eleven of the centers are residential. They have a 
 a total capacity of 2,877 and an average occupancy of 2,666. 
 Over 1,000 former addicts completed the program last year. 
<P>
Teen Challenge is also involved in other forms of 
counseling. It answered over 100,000 telephone crisis calls in 1995 
and held almost 14,000 drop-in counseling sessions.  Teen 
Challenge reached 839,000 people in jails, schools, churches, and community 
meetings.
<P>
But drug and alcohol addiction touches the lives of millions of Americans, 
and the mission of Teen Challenge is far from accomplished. 
<P>
<BR>
<a name="3">
<P>
<B>The Nature of Addiction</B>
<P>
Addictions are hard to define because factors such as 
&quot;tolerance,&quot; &quot;physical dependence,&quot; and &quot;reinforcement&quot; are part 
of the equation.  The complexity of defining &quot;addiction&quot; is 
compounded by social, political, and economic factors. 
Addiction to drugs and alcohol is also a medical matter. 
<P>&quot;Addiction,&quot; is not the same as &quot;physical dependence.&quot; 
 Physical dependence is how the body reacts when it lacks a 
drug to which  it has become accustomed.  Heroin has a high rate 
of physical dependence, causing all sorts of physical 
reactions when the body is deprived of it. They are often so violent 
that the addict, for the sake of maintaining bodily equilibrium, 
returns to drug abuse.  Cocaine and marijuana, on the other hand, create 
a relatively low rate of physical dependency. The body does not 
react violently to withdrawal.  Nevertheless, they also are addictive.   
<P>
Cocaine and marijuana are also similar in that they have low 
rates of &quot;tolerance.&quot;  That is, a user 
can take the drug repeatedly over a short time, yet not build up a 
resistance to its effects  Low tolerance rates also mean that the 
user can quit and return to drug use without needing more of it 
to achieve the same high.  For drugs with high tolerance rates, such 
as heroin, tolerance is the second devil working with physical 
dependence.  As the user builds up tolerance, quitting becomes 
more difficult, because the amount to which the user is addicted is 
constantly increasing, giving rise to 
increasingly violent physical reactions upon withdrawal.   
<P>
&quot;Reinforcement&quot; also helps to conceptually define 
addiction.  Used pharmacologically it  refers to whether an 
animal will work for a drug, and how hard and long the animal 
will work.  Animal experiments are not always good predictors 
of human behavior, but in this case the concept seems to apply. 
 Humans will work for a specific dose of a particular drug 
 administered in a particular way.  As the dose, and 
more importantly, method of administration change, the degree 
of reinforcement may also change.  Thus, while dependence 
and tolerance are physical changes in the body, reinforcement is 
a behavioral change. It is affected by social and economic 
factors, drug availability, and how the drug is administered.  
<P>
Therefore, to define &quot;addiction&quot; biologically, one must 
consider a number of factors that contribute to reinforcement and 
 dependence.  One should, furthermore, not forget that 
alcohol is a drug.  Alcohol has a low tolerance rate, a high 
physical dependency rate, and a mid-range rate of reinforcement.  Does 
the high physical dependence contribute to reinforcement?  
No doubt it does, but there are so many other factors that it is 
hard to say that physical dependence creates reinforcement, much 
less addiction.
<P>
With so many variables and causes, modern science 
cannot develop a medical or scientific formula for &quot;curing addiction.&quot; 
It is Teen Challenge's conviction that drug and alcohol abuse 
are products of man's distance from God which must first be 
overcome.
<P>
<P>
<BR>
<a name="4">
<B>The Teen Challenge Method</B>
<P>
Teen Challenge is considered by outsiders to be a religious 
program for the recovery of alcohol and drug addicts, but leaders 
of the movement would disagree with that definition. To them Teen Challenge offers a 
new alternative to rehabilitationso different that it is not 
rehabilitation at all, but a training program for Christian 
discipleship that helps to cleanse away the old human nature and with it 
the addiction.
<P>
Teen Challenge declares its mission is &quot;to evangelize 
people who have life-controlling problems and initiate the 
discipleship process to the point where the student can function as 
a Christian in society, applying spiritually motivated 
Biblical principles to relationships in the family, local church, chosen 
vocation, and the community.  Teen Challenge endeavors to help people 
become mentally sound, emotionally balanced, socially adjusted, 
physically well, and spiritually alive.&quot;
<P>
This mission is developed by various methods, including counseling 
 based on a standardized three-volume collection of class 
materials, &quot;Personal Studies for New Christians,&quot; by David Batty.  The 
counselor barely touches on issues of drugs or alcohol.  Instead, the new 
resident is taught lessons from the Bible on character, life-styles and 
Christian conversion.  Furthermore, the student is encouraged to read other 
Christian books in order to benefit spiritually and emotionally, but also to 
gain practical reading skills.  &quot;God's Plan for the Family&quot; is the subject of 
one class that concentrates on Biblical models of marriage 
and parenthood.   There are also lessons that deal with the 
temptation to leave the program that residents occasionally feel.
<P>
The overall goal of counseling is to prepare a person to 
enter a Christian life-style.  Discussion of drugs or alcohol is  rare. 
 Instead, the patient is taught a new approach to life, as well 
as encouraged to let go of a painful past.  Not only are 
the counseling sessions geared toward the realization of a new 
life-style, but the overall structure of the program, from the first 
day in the center to the reentry program for ex-residents, is 
geared to developing a Christian life-style and world view.  
<P>
Teen Challenge centers consider themselves part of 
the larger Christian church.  Teen Challenge centers are the 
branch of the Church that concentrates on 
&quot;ministry to acutely hurting people.&quot;  This 
is accomplished  through a  five-step process.  The first phase is evangelism.  
Once someone is converted, crisis intervention may be neededthe second step.  
Then, individuals are placed for a three to four month stint in residential induction 
centers.  Beyond this, the student moves to the fourth phase, residence for at least eight months in a training center.  The final step is re-entry, which helps students 
to readjust to society.  
<P>
The residence programs are centered around 
discipleship training with prayer, counseling, Bible reading, worship, 
work activity, meals, meditation, and recreation.  These activities 
are structured around five types of therapy.  In work therapy 
the resident learns the value of work as well as a vocational skill. 
 Group therapy involves the resident living with three others. 
All must take joint responsibility for the upkeep of their room. 
 There are also groups that meet on specific issues, according 
to the needs of the residents.  In individual therapy the goal is 
to &quot;join head and body&quot;to make the student aware of reality 
and  wanting to live in it. Music is another powerful source 
of therapy.  Residents join in worship through music, and in 
the process are drawn into its themes.  The final type of therapy 
is recreational therapy.  Outdoor events and exercise teach 
residents how to use their free time without relying on drugs.  
<P>
The long-range goal of residence and therapy is to move 
the &quot;ex-addict&quot; to the &quot;non-addict&quot; stage. 
 The resident is already an ex-addict upon entry into the program.  
However, he may still relapse into addiction. The final stage of 
non-addiction is achieved when the resident no longer has the desire to use  drugs 
or alcohol.  
<P>
The re-entry programthe final step of Teen Challenge's five 
step processensures that the ex-addict can complete the transition to 
non-addict.  Because it may take years to reach the non-addict stage, Teen 
Challenge stays in touch with many former addicts upon their graduation 
from the program, using the re-entry program to aid them in adjusting to 
the real world.  The focus of re-entry is to help the former addict 
establish healthy relationships with non-addicts and secure employment.  
<P>
<BR>
<a name="5">
<P><B>How Do you Spell Success?</B>
<P>
Teen Challenge's growth in its short history speaks 
volumes about the power of its ministry.  But these numbers are 
merely an outward sign of its effectiveness and high success rate.
<P>
Teen Challenge of Chattanooga, Inc. conducted an 
alumni survey between 1992 and 1994.  The survey was directed by 
Dr. Roger Thompson, head of the Criminal Justice Department 
at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga.  All the 
alumni surveyed spent their 3-4 month third phase of the program in 
 the Teen Challenge residential induction center in 
Chattanooga sometime between 1979 and 1991.  They then transferred 
to phase four, the training center, at either Cape Girardeau, 
Missouri or Rehrersburg, Pennsylvania.  The survey had a 
50% response rate. 
<P>
The survey's findings are very impressive.  
Eighty-eight percent of those responding named Teen Challenge as 
the treatment program most beneficial in their lives.  Sixty 
percent continued their education after graduation from the program. 
 Sixty percent became members of a local church, and 
76% attended church regularly.  Seventy-two percent were 
employed.  Seventy-six percent were free from the court 
system, quite a reversal from the 60% who were in the court 
system upon entering the program.  Ninety-two percent claimed 
that Teen Challenge had a great impact on their lives.  
Eighty percent credited their ability to abstain from drugs to a 
personal relationship with Jesus Christ.  The statistic that speaks 
volumes, however, is the abstention rate.  A full 67% of 
respondents were completely abstaining from drugs and alcohol.  
<P>
The Chattanooga results are impressive but not surprising. 
 They echo the results found in 1975 by the Department 
of Health, Education, and Welfare.  Dr. Catherine Hess, 
M.D., formerly the assistant chief of the Cancer Control Program 
of the U.S. Public Health Service  studied the class of 
1968 entering the Brooklyn Teen Challenge, who went on 
to Rehrersburg Teen Challenge for their training center phase. 
<P>
Much like in Chattanooga, seventy-two percent of 
graduates continued their education after graduation from Teen 
Challenge.  Seventy-five percent of the graduates were 
currently employed.  Eighty-seven percent of graduates required 
no further treatment after graduating from Teen Challenge.  
Sixty-seven percent regularly attended church.  Only 30% had 
been arrested since graduating.  Moreover, in a statistic 
strikingly similar to the Chattanooga study, 67% of the graduates 
proved themselves drug-free by urinalysis.
<P>
<BR>
<a name="6">
<P>
<B>Changed Lives</B>
<P>
Perhaps the most powerful evidence of a changed life lies 
not in numbers, but in the stories of those whose very lives 
were saved by Teen Challenge.  One such life is that of  James Heurich. James 
began sipping his parents' beers at an early age. His father was an alcoholic. By the age 
of 15, James was drinking bourbon, smoking marijuana, and sniffing up to 20 tubes of glue in a single day.  &quot;My 
younger brother, whom I had started out on drugs, became a heroin addict.  I remember 
the night he died in his sleep in the bed next to mine.&quot;  
<P>
The funeral of James' brother was conducted by the director of the 
Philadelphia Teen Challenge. He prayed with Heurich's father.  After 
37 years of alcoholism, Mr. Heurich put down the bottle forever. 
 For the next eight months, Philadelphia Teen Challenge 
reached out to James Heurich who had entered the program.  James 
is now an ordained minister and Executive Director of San 
Antonio Teen Challenge.  
<P>
John Douglas is another young man whose life was 
changed by Teen Challenge.  He declared in <I>American 
Horizon</I> that, &quot;[i]f Christ had not impacted my life through Teen Challenge, 
I would most likely be dead or locked up.&quot;  Tortured by 
drugs, John knew that he wanted to end his addiction, and he found 
a way out in Teen Challenge.  John entered the Teen 
Challenge program at age 17.  For the first ten days, he was still 
hallucinating from LSD flashbacks.  The patient and caring 
staff finally broke through John's haze, and he completed the 
entire program.  Today John is married with two children, and 
he owns a roofing business.  He credits Teen Challenge with 
his current happy life. 
<P>
These individuals are representative of countless 
others throughout America who share three common attributes.  
They are substance abusers whose lives had been destroyed by 
their habits.  They had tried unsuccessfully to kick their 
habits through various secular programs.  And they have 
found comfort and life control through a structured religiously 
focused treatment programTeen Challenge.
<P>
There is something else that unites them.  The programs that have made the difference between life and death for them are 
at risk.  As long as States exercise licensing authority in ways 
that undermine or corrupt the viability of these programs, a cloud 
of uncertainty will hang over these much-needed organizations. 
<P>At a time when we worry who will help the unfortunates if 
the safety net is removed, we should make it easier for 
these programs to operatenot harder. At a time when concern 
over drug and alcohol abuse is growing, we should foster 
private, voluntary, faith-based programs by removing the state 
licensing requirements that hold such potential for abuse.  This 
will entail a state-by-state examination of the many laws that 
govern drug and alcohol treatment.  Arduous though this task may 
be, it will allow these institutions to become building blocks in 
the creation of a civil society of free and responsible individuals.

<B><I>Texas State Authorities Raise Obstacles to Teen Challenge Success</B></I>
<P>
The Alamo was a vivid backdrop and symbolic frame 
of reference for dozens of protesters.  In the crowd of 
largely low-income individuals picketing on a mid-July day 
in 1995, many held signs calling for an end to 
government oppression.  Robert Woodson of the National Center 
for Neighborhood Enterprise, the event organizer, 
exhorted the crowd to take a stand against tyranny, not just 
for themselves, but also for those whose ability to control 
their own lives was threatened by an imperious 
government agency.  This event focused the eyes of the nation on 
Texas where a struggle between  state officials and a small 
faith-based drug and alcohol treatment facility offered 
crucial insight into one of the most important challenges 
facing voluntary self-help programs in America.
<P>
The villain in this story and the object of the 
protesters' wrath is the Texas Commission for Alcohol and 
Drug Abuse (TCADA), which exercises licensing authority 
over all drug and alcohol treatment centers in the state.  
TCADA had recently notified the San Antonio chapter of 
Teen Challenge, the local affiliate of the nationally 
acclaimed drug and alcohol treatment program, that it needed 
a license to continue providing treatment for addiction.  
The fact that San Antonio Teen Challenge had provided 
these service since 1977 was irrelevant to TCADA.
<P>
Under Texas law, any organization that offers 
treatment for drug and alcohol addiction needs a license, and 
TCADA enforced this requirement vigorously.  In order to obtain 
a license, Teen Challenge would have to adopt a 
program that TCADA deemed appropriate.  Not 
surprisingly, TCADA's requirements were different from, and in 
key ways antithetical to, Teen Challenge methods.  So 
Teen Challenge was faced with a stark choice: become a 
creature of the state or halt its program.
<P>
The plight of Teen Challenge came to the attention 
of Marvin Olasky, who published an op-ed in the 
<I>Wall Street Journal</I> in August of 1995 exposing TCADA's 
heavy-handed tactics to a national audience.  At the same time, 
the Institute for Justice offered to represent Teen 
Challenge. The Institute threatened a lawsuit using the 
Religious Freedom Restoration Act to challenge TCADA's 
authority to impose licensing conditions that interfered with 
Teen Challenge's fundamental tenets of faith practiced in 
its drug and alcohol treatment.
<P>
The Institute for Justice began negotiations with 
Texas Governor George W. Bush and with TCADA.  As 
negotiations proceeded, the Institute contacted 
<I>NBC Nightly News</I> and encouraged them to report the story of the 
tension between a group dedicated to self-help through faith 
and secular licensing requirements of a state agency that 
undermined that faith.  NBC soon produced an <I>American 
Agenda</I> feature that was highly favorable to Teen Challenge.  
Not long thereafter, TCADA signed a consent order that 
allows Teen Challenge to continue to operate as it has 
historicallywithout a license. In addition, Governor Bush 
appointed a task force whose members included Teen 
Challenge representatives to review Texas laws and 
regulations and propose reforms that will recognize the importance 
and efficacy of faith-based treatment programs.  
<P>
Although this situation came to a happy resolution, it 
is but one episode in an ongoing saga of how states 
exercise licensing authority to the detriment of voluntary 
self-help drug and alcohol treatment programs, particularly those 
of a faith-based nature.  For as social work and 
psychiatry have exerted their professional presence in this field, 
their secular methodology has become increasingly 
incorporated into licensing requirements imposed by states.  
Teen Challenge has faced similar issues in Oregon, 
Pennsylvania, and Florida in recent years, all of which have 
been resolved at least temporarily so as to allow Teen 
Challenge to continue. But the issue of licensing has left 
unresolved the underlying tension between secular and 
faith-based methods.

<P>
 <B><I>Some of the Alternatives</B>
<P>
<P>Alcoholics Anonymous:</I> The modern era of alcohol 
and drug treatment began with Alcoholics Anonymous.  
AA was founded in 1935 by William Wilson, &quot;Bill W.&quot; 
and Robert Holbrook Smith, &quot;Dr. Bob.&quot;  The founders 
believed that the only way to sobriety was to give one's 
life to a Higher Power.  AA treated alcoholism as a 
disease without cure, but with remission.  That remission can 
be maintained only by hard work and moral support, 
and many find that support through AA.  Explosively 
successful from the beginning, AA has grown to over a 
million members, with 67,000 local chapters, plus Al-Anon 
and Alateen, support groups for loved ones and teenage 
children of alcoholics. 
<P>
Alcoholics Anonymous is famous for its 12-step 
method, a method used by many drug and alcohol treatment 
and support groups today.  The 12 steps alcoholics must 
follow to put an end to their alcoholism have a religious 
dimension.  They include such steps as asking God to 
remove one's shortcomings, prayer and meditation, and a 
spiritual awakening. Many attribute the success of AA to its religious natureto the admission that alcoholism can not 
be conquered without the intervention of a Higher Power.
<P>
<I>Medical Model</I>: The general consensus among drug 
and alcohol treatment experts is that alcoholism is a disease.   
 This concept, began with AA and spread to Yale's 
Center of Alcohol Studies, founded in the 1930s.  The Center 
set the pace for medical research and intervention into 
alcoholism by training alcoholism counselors.  The 
disease concept of alcoholism has since that time been the 
leading paradigm in the field.  It has evolved from AA's 
simple concept of  addiction as a lasting condition that one 
must never quit fighting to alcoholism as a medical and 
psychological condition that can be studied empirically.  
Drug abuse, which has exploded in recent decades, has 
therefore been approached by the same model.  
<P>
<P><I>Drug and Psychological Therapy: </I>Drug and alcohol 
addiction are predominantly treated by medical and 
psychological methods.  Most rehabilitation centers follow 
the &quot;Minnesota Model,&quot; which employs drug treatment 
only for detoxification.  The centers often incorporate AA's 
12 steps with inpatient treatment.  The Model integrates 
self-help counseling, involves the family directly and 
continuously, and employs aftercare, or continued contact with 
the patient after graduation from the program.  The 
centers often incorporate AA's 12 steps into the treatment, with 
the first five steps occurring in the inpatient stage, and 
the remaining seven in aftercare. 
<P>
Of all the drug treatments for alcohol, the most popular 
is disulfiram, which goes more commonly by its brand 
name, Antabuse.  Physicians initially treat patients by giving 
them the drug followed by alcohol.  The patient 
experiences acetaldehyde buildup, which induces vomiting, nausea, 
a drop in blood pressure, and a pounding heart.  The 
patients often feel that they will die right there in the doctor's office. 
 Motivated by fear and a regular dosage of Antabuse, 
the patient refrains from drinking alcohol.  
<P>
The second most popular method of drug treatment 
for alcohol is conditioned-reflex treatment.  This 
treatment originated in 1940 when Dr. Walter Voegelin began 
treating alcoholics with Pavlovian conditioning.  The 
physician injects a drug that induces nausea.  Just before the 
patient feels the effects of the drug, the physician gives the 
patient alcohol.  The violent physiological reaction becomes 
associated with alcohol in the patient's mind, and the patient 
will not drink alcohol for several months.  The interim time 
is used for rehabilitation and psychological treatment.
<P>
Psychotherapy has also been used for alcoholics, 
but without good results.  Better results have been attained 
by combining drug therapy with group therapy, 
rehabilitation clinics, and the Minnesota Model.  
<P>
Drug addiction has been treated in similar ways.  
Perhaps the most common medical method of countering 
drug addiction is detoxification.  Detoxification involves 
administering an opiate or barbiturate to the patient at 
regular intervals and slowly reducing dosages.  An 
in-hospital detoxification usually takes two weeks, while an 
outpatient detoxification takes four to six weeks. Detoxification 
is successful in temporarily stalling addiction so that 
other treatment may be administered, but rarely causes 
long-term cessation of drug use without other interventions. 
<P>
Psychiatric hospitals are sometimes used in 
conjunction with detoxification.  Psychiatric hospital programs 
vary: elements include the frequency of patient-psychiatrist 
contact, the focus of daily activity, whether individual or 
group, and the use of psychiatric drugs.  Psychiatric 
hospitalization is good for those with serious mental disorders, but 
it is not particularly successful or cost-effective for those 
with no such disorder.
<P>
Psychiatric drugs, among others, are also used in 
outpatient therapy.   However, the more popular form of 
outpatient therapy is drug maintenance.  Drug 
maintenance therapy differs from detoxification in that it requires 
a much longer term of treatment, focusing on one of 
three areas: (1) treating withdrawal symptoms and cravings, 
(2) creating high cross-tolerance so that the addict can 
no longer feel any &quot;high&quot; from using the illicit drug, and 
(3) maintaining abstinence by drug antagonists, which 
neutralize the effects of the addictive drug.  The best 
known drug maintenance therapy is methadone, which is used 
as a substitute for heroin.  It can be given in doses to 
either treat cravings or to create cross-tolerance.  Methadone 
has met with mixed results, as have most types of drug 
maintenance therapy.
<P>
Besides medical treatments, psychological and 
social treatments are also used for drug addictions. 
Psychological treatments include psychotherapy, behavior 
therapy, and group therapy.  The classical Freudian 
psychotherapy has not been effective in treating drug addiction.  
Behavior therapy, in which the patient unlearns maladjusted 
behavior and relearns functional behavior, has been more 
successful.  Group therapy, which entails three different 
kinds of therapy, has been yet more successful, but with 
some mixed results.  Group therapy involves couples, 
families, and encounter groups.  Encounter groups bring 
addicts together to emotionally struggle through and work 
out their problems, a method that is definitely effective in 
the short-run, but with uncertain effects over long periods 
of time.  
<P>
Social intervention takes a different route.  Some 
groups, like Alcoholics Anonymous, maintain self-help 
programs with addict support groups run by ex-addicts.  
Others, known as &quot;day care&quot; centers, involve the addict in 
a daytime program.  Therapeutic communities are like 
day care centers, except that the addict lives in the community. 
 They vary tremendously, but all have the same 
basic phases of admission, residence, and post-residence 
reentry into society.  The residence phase involves a 
structured program that modifies the environment of the 
patient, assigning work tasks and holding group meetings.  
The results of such programs are very mixed.

<center><h2>INSIDE THE GREEN MAFIA: THE BIG ENVIRONMENTALIST GRANTMAKERS</h2>
<h3>by Jonathan Adler</h3></center>
<p>
Environmentalism today is Big Business.  By some estimates, the 
environmental movement commands revenues of nearly one-half billion
dollars annually, and at least a dozen of its organizations have
annual budgets in excess of $20 million. Notwithstanding environmentalist
claims, this wealth is not an accurate indicator of grass-roots
support.  Membership levels at many environmental groups have
been static or fallen in recent years, and membership dues provide
less than half of a typical group's funds, although they remain
a significant source of revenue.  The major environmentalist groups
headquartered in Washington, DC look elsewhere for the vast sums
they require to support their large staffs and expensive advocacy
campaigns.  Corporations, government agencies and private philanthropic
foundations now provide major grant support to the movement. 
This report will focus on the role of foundation support.  (For
a full discussion of the environmental movement see Jonathan Adler,
Environmentalism at the Crossroads, Capital Research Center, 1995,
299 pages.)
<P>
According to a 1992 study conducted by the Conservation
Fund, private foundations account for approximately one-fifth
of environmental group funding.  By virtue of their concentrated
funding, foundations have become highly influential in the environmental
movement.  However, more than money is involved.  When an environmental
group receives active foundation assistance, the financial reward
is only the most tangible aspect of support.  As the Conservation
Fund study concludes:
<P>
The importance of foundations goes well beyond the
giving of money.  Leaders depend on foundations for programmatic
ideas, information on productive  networking with other groups,
occasional technical support, and the sense of legitimacy and
prestige that comes with foundation grants.  Well-funded organizations
gain the attention of policymakers simply by virtue of the recognition
they receive from national grant makers.
<P>
In recent years foundation funders have moved from
behind the scenes.  Not content to be silent partners, grantmakers
have discovered that they can coordinate lobbying and set the
agenda of diverse environmental groups by coordinating the distribution
of foundation grants.  This is the enviable role of the Environmental
Grantmakers Association, a so-called &quot;affinity group&quot;
of the Council on Foundations.  An EGA conference brochure puts
it this way:  &quot;In 1987, a group of environmental grantmakers
met in Washington, D.C. to discuss common interests and to learn
about each other's specific programs.&quot;  Among the group's
stated purposes: &quot;To promote recognition that the environment
and its inhabitants  are endangered by unsustainable human activities;&quot;
&quot;To facilitate communication, foster cooperation, and develop
collaboration among active and potential members;&quot; and &quot;To
increase the resources available to address environmental concerns.&quot;

<P>
In January 1995, EGA had 182 members from private,
corporate, and community foundations.  Housed in the offices of
the Rockefeller Family Foundation in New York City, EGA's &quot;Management
Committee&quot; in 1994 included representatives from eight foundations
-- Island,Nathan Cummings, Surdna, C.S. Mott, Compton, Bullitt,
MacArthur, and Hewlett -- and one corporation, Apple Computer.
 EGA members meet annually at retreats and conferences, share
information on grantmaking, and strategize about how to achieve
environmental goals.  As the leftist magazine Mother Jones has
noted, &quot;By deciding which organizations get money, the grant-makers
help set the agenda of the environmental movement and influence
the programs that activists carry out.&quot;  EGA coordinator
Donald Ross, a director of the grantmaking Rockefeller Family
Fund, asserts that &quot;funders have a major role to play&quot;
in determining the environmental policy agenda.  
<P>
At EGA's 1994 annual meeting many members agreed
to devote more funds to issues of population and consumption,
a theme of the meeting.  Topics at the 1992 annual retreat included
&quot;Population and the Environment,&quot; &quot;Environmentally
Responsible Investing,&quot; &quot;Environmental Education, K-12,&quot;
&quot;Environment and Spirituality,&quot; and &quot;1993, Year
of Indigenous Peoples.&quot; Few of EGA's professional grantmakers
know how their organizations' founders created the wealth they
freely dispense.  Indeed, they do not seem to appreciate how the
free enterprise system makes wealth accumulation possible.  In
his keynote address to the 1992 EGA retreat, zoologist and environmental
author David Suzuki offered a remarkable commentary that illustrates
how intellectually disconnected environmentalists are from the
wealth of their foundation patrons.  Suzuki observed:
<P>
Economics is a very chauvinistic invention -- and
I don't mean male chauvinist -- it is a species chauvinistic idea.
 No other species on earth, and there may be 30 million of them,
has had the nerve to put forth a concept called economics, in
which one species, us, declares the right to put value on everything
else on earth, in the living and non-living world.
<P>
Although some EGA members are less radical in their
analysis and prescriptions, the organization has helped steer
environmental grantmaking leftward toward more government control
over the economy.  Today most foundation giving for &quot;environmental
protection&quot; is used to prop up nonprofit organizations that
have become key parts of a Washington establishment dedicated
to continued expansion of the regulatory state.  Profiles of some
of the most powerful grantmaking foundations supporting the environmental
cause follow:<BR>
<P>
<a name="pew"> 
<h4>THE BIGGEST AND BADDEST:
THE PEW CHARITABLE TRUSTS</h4><BR>
<P>
Pew appears to be the largest environ-<BR>
  mental grantmaker.  In 1993 alone it <BR>
  donated $35 million to green causes.  As a leader in the field
it even goes so far as to conceive of projects for environmental
groups to undertake in order to attract funding from other private
foundations.  Pew's funding focuses on three areas: global climate
change, pollution prevention, and forest and marine conservation.
 It also has launched major programs to promote public advocacy
and civic participation in government policymaking and it supports
&quot;environmental education&quot; using the school curriculum
and Boy Scout style recruiting to mobilize children for the cause.
<P>
Pew funds have also spurred development of new tactics
including the formation of environmental coalitions and regional
campaigns.  A recent $150,000 Pew grant to a project named the
Global Action Plan for the Earth seeks to &quot;support the development
and delivery of a program educating children about how to live
environmentally sustainable lives.&quot;  Another grant of $120,000
over two years went to the Humane Society of the United States
(HSUS) to support a project entitled &quot;Theological Education
to Meet the Environmental Challenge.&quot;  It is aimed at influencing
seminaries and divinity schools on population and environmental
issues.  HSUS, contrary to popular belief, does not run animal
shelters.  It is an animal rights advocacy organization that opposes
hunting, circuses, rodeos, and marine mammal parks.  Its officers
have recently come under fire for using the society to promote
their private financial interests.
<P>
The scope of environmental support by the Pew Charitable
Trusts may be gauged by a review of grants it made in 1995: 
<P>
Alaska Conservation Foundation (15 months)      $470,000
<P>
American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy
(2-years)   $325,000 
<P>
Aspen Institute (9 months) $1,015,000 
<P>
Business for Social Responsibility Education Fund
    $200,000 
<P>
Chesapeake Bay Foundation (2 years)      $200,000
<P>
Christian Environmental Association (2 years)   
  $175,000 
<P>
Christianity Today (18 months) $175,000 
<P>
Environmental Defense Fund $110,000

Environmental Information Center (2 grants)     
$986,000 
<P>
Greater Yellowstone Coalition (2 years)      $600,000
<P>
National Audubon Society (4 grants, 2 years)    
 $2,015,000
<P>
National Religious Partnership for the Environment
(18 months)   $323,000 
<P>
Natural Resources Defense Council (9 months)    
 $625,000 
<P>
Sierra Club Foundation (2 grants, 9 months)     
$1,125,000
<P>
Worldwatch Institute (2 years) $200,000 
<P>
World Wildlife Fund (3 grants, 2 years)      $1,360,000
<BR>
<P>
In 1988, the Foundation established the Pew Fellows
Program in Conservation and the Environment.  Rather like the
MacArthur Foundation &quot;genius grants,&quot; this program was
intended to fulfill what Pew identified as &quot;a critical need
to identify and support a new generation of scholar-scientists
who would apply their special knowledge and skills directly to
pressing environmental problems.&quot;  The Foundation annually
awards ten three-year $150,000 fellowships.  More recently, however,
Pew has changed its definition of likely recipients, and the fellowships
now encompass &quot;outstanding scientists, researchers and conservation
activists.&quot;  Why the change?  Perhaps because Pew fellowships
increasingly go to environmental activists with limited scientific
credentials.  Recent Pew Fellows include Michael J. Bean and David
S. Wilcove of the Environmental Defense Fund, Johanna H. Wald
of the Natural Resources Defense Council, Victor M. Sher of the
Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, and Carl Safina of the National
Audubon Society. 
<P>
One current Pew scholar is Theo Colburn, a zoologist
at the World Wildlife Fund and co-author of Our Stolen Future,
a controversial new book which alleges that synthetic chemicals
may be responsible for such developmental and reproductive problems
in humans as low sperm counts, impotence, and homosexuality. 
Another Pew scholar is Donella Meadows, co-author of the infamously
wrong 1972 doomsday report The Limits to Growth. Another Pew Fellow
is Reed F. Noss, who established the radical Wildlands Project
with Earth First! founder Dave Foreman.  The Wildlands project
is an effort to &quot;restore&quot; over half of the United States
to its &quot;natural&quot; condition.  Its mission statement says:
<P>
"We live for the day when grizzlies in Chihuahua
have an unbroken connection to grizzlies in Alaska; when gray
wolf populations are continuous from New Mexico to Greenland;
when vast, unbroken forests and flowing plains again thrive and
support pre-Colombian populations of plants and animals.&quot;
<P>
Pew Fellows are nominated by 37 &quot;leaders in
the conservation  field&quot; who each submit two candidates.
 Candidates must then apply for a fellowship.  The  nominators
include many representatives from environmental organizations
that are recipients of Pew funds, including the Worldwatch Institute,
World Wildlife Foundation, Natural Resources Defense Council,
Environmental Defense Fund, and the National Audubon Society.
 Beginning in 1996, Pew Fellows will be selected who focus on
the &quot;sustainable utilization&quot; and conservation of marine
resources. 
<P>
Pew Fellow Michael J. Bean, chair of the wildlife
program at the Environmental Defense Fund, currently directs the
Pew Scholars Program, and he sits on the Advisory Committee that
evaluates applications.  That committee also includes Zero Population
Growth founder Paul Ehrlich, sustainable development guru Herman
E. Daly, author of the no-growth Steady-State Economics, and Kathryn
Saterson of the World Wildlife Fund. 
<P>
Another ambitious Pew project is Environmental Strategies,
since renamed the Environmental Information Center.  Conceived
in 1993 by Joshua Reichert, Pew's environmental director and a
veteran of the movement, its stated mission is to help environmental
groups &quot;conduct public education campaigns on priority national
environmental issues&quot; and &quot;to improve the campaigning
skills of national, regional and local environmental groups.&quot;
In truth, the Environmental Information Center is controlled
by a mixed board of environmental and foundation leaders and it
is supposed to act as a &quot;command center&quot; coordinating
lobbying by Washington, D.C. environmental advocacy groups.  &quot;We
started [the Environmental Information Center] because no organization
was doing what we thought needed to be done,&quot; Reichert told
writer Mark Dowie.  But others disagree.  Reflecting the resentment
that environmental groups must feel at attempts by funders to
control their agenda, Jim Maddy, then president of the League
of Conservation Voters, responded, &quot;The idea that what we
need right now is yet another organization to perform the function
of a headquarters doesn't strike me as the solution to our problems.&quot;
<P>
Pew supplied the Tides Foundation with a two-year,
$650,000 start-up grant to administer funds to get the Center
going.  The W. Alton Jones Foundation added $125,000 and the Rockefeller
Family Fund supplied another $60,000.  Last year, Pew gave the
Center close to $1 million.  The Environmental Information Center
is meant to sell policies, not provide research or analysis. 
As Reichert has explained, &quot;I don't want someone who knows
the facts, or can articulate them persuasively.  I want someone
who wants to win and knows how.&quot;  The ideal project leader,
he told Dowie, would be Clinton campaign consultant James Carville.
<P>
The Center claims that its D.C. office is &quot;the
'war room' for a massive public education campaign to alert Americans
that the new majority in Congress is teaming up with powerful
special interests to roll back 25 years of environmental protections.&quot;
 To broaden support for environmental regulation, it is trying
to build coalitions with local government officials, religious
leaders, and &quot;children's advocacy groups.&quot;  The Center
has been particularly active in promoting the work of the Evangelical
Environmental Network, a spin-off of the liberal Evangelicals
for Social Action, a group that argues that the Endangered Species
Act is biblically ordained. According to the Network, &quot;the
threat to the Act threatens the core of our faith.&quot;  The
Environmental Information Center's has also been an ardent opponent
of the House Republicans' &quot;Contract With America.&quot; 
<P>
The Center's 501(c)(4) lobby, the American Community
Protection Association, has campaigned against the Contract's
property-rights legislation by running ads in publications like
Roll Call, a Washington, D.C. biweekly newspaper that focuses
primarily on the internal operations of Congress.  &quot;'Takings'
provisions would interfere with state and local decision making
and could inflict new and unlimited funding mandates on state
and local governments.&quot;  In fact, the provisions, which provide
compensation for government actions diminishing property values,
apply only to federal laws and explicitly exempt federal rules
that reinforce state and local laws, including common-law protections
of public health and safety.  By targeting a publication widely
read by members of Congress and their staffs, the advertisements
must influence how they will think about property rights legislation.

<h4>MONEY LAUNDERED BY
THE TIDES FOUNDATION</h4><BR>
<P>
The Tides Foundation is a unique 
funder of environmentalist causes. 
Founded in 1976 by activist Drummond Pike it aims &quot;to link
diverse individuals seeking  social justice, creative new approaches
to economic enterprise, and an enlightened stewardship of our
national environment.&quot;  In particular, &quot;The Foundation
is interested in supporting efforts which demonstrate the value
of sustainable agricultural techniques, groups working to promote
the preservation of the Earth's remaining wetlands and rainforests,
and the struggles of indigenous people around the world who have
pioneered ways of `living gently' on the land.&quot;
<P>
Tides is no traditional foundation. Legally, it
is a grantmaking charity, not a philanthropic foundation.  In
practice, this means that Tides is both a grantmaker and a grant-taker,
raising money in order to support assorted projects undertaken
by those who come to it.  Tides' money comes from other foundations,
individual and corporate grants, and even government sources.
 This dual role gives Tides an unusual place among foundation
funders of environmental groups.
<P>
The Tides Foundation's division of activities reflects
its twin purposes: grantmaking and project management.  This peculiar
structure enables it to handle so-called &quot;pass-through&quot;
grants for those who want to keep their contributions secret.
 Tides will work with donors to channel their funds to preferred
causes.  Typically, donors give a minimum of $25,000 annually
to Tides.  At the donor's direction, Tides will then steer these
funds to the donor's chosen cause, whether or not it is affiliated
with Tides, and it will charge a percentage service fee.  Tides
is widely credited with having provided the grant that enabled
the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) to hire Fenton Communications,
a public relations firm, to promote NRDC's alarmist report on
the pesticide Alar.  Many donors choose this way of working with
Tides because it can provide them with total anonymity.  &quot;Anonymity
is very important to most of the people we work with,&quot; Tides
president Drummond Pike explained to the Chronicle of Philanthropy.
<P>
The management side of Tides, known as the Tides
Center, became a separate entity in April 1996.  It helps small
start-up groups handle their organizational affairs.  This projects
management task is the heart of Tides' work.  These start-up group
projects are technically adjuncts of the Foundation because they
use Tides' non-profit status as their own.  This spares new groups
from the chore of completing IRS paperwork to achieve independent
tax-exempt status.  It also enables them to benefit from the Tides'
oversight and managerial expertise.  Tides can offer new groups
practical experience in managing particular programs.  It can
help them select a health insurance provider and other outside
contractors.  Funding is channeled through Tides, which charges
a percentage fee for its services.  These fees pay for Tides'
operating expenses. 
<P>
Groups that work with Tides commend the concept.
 &quot;I think it is a bargain for a small start-up organization
to not have to worry about a lot of the vital details of becoming
an institution that Tides can take care of for you,&quot; commented
Kenneth Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group (EWG),
a current Tides Project.  EWG raised about $1.3 million in 1994
and paid Tides approximately $65,000 in service fees.  The Environmental
Information Center also relied on the Tides Center before its
obtained independent non-profit status. 
<P>
In 1994 Tides distributed $11 million in grants.
 These went to an assortment of causes, only some of which were
environmental.  Tides' environmental-related grants listed in
its 1994-5 annual report include the following:<BR>
<P>
Animal Welfare Institute  $19,106 
<P>
Citizens Clearinghouse for Hazardous Wastes     
$17,816 
<P>
Environmental Action Foundation $15,000 
<P>
Environmental Support Center $25,000 
<P>
Environmental Working Group $46,909 
<P>
Essential Information  $149,3000 
<P>
Friends of the Earth  $260,000 
<P>
Greenhouse Crisis Foundation $50,000 
<P>
Greenpeace, USA  $22,309 
<P>
Rainforest Action Network $32,532 
<P>
Rocky Mountain Institute $20,000 
<P>
In 1994, Tides projects received an additional $22
million from outside foundations, individuals and corporations.
 In 1993, nearly one-third of the Tides Center's 180 projects
dealt with the environment.  These included the Student Environmental
Action Coalition, the Institute for Deep Ecology Education, and
the Biotechnology Working Group.  Current environmental projects
include, among others, the Environmental Working Group, the Military
Toxics Project, the Biotechnology Working Group, Biodiversity
Action Network, Forest Guardians, the Environmental and Economic
Justice Project, and the Institute for Global Communications,
which operates the EcoNet on-line computer network.
<P>
In the spring of 1996, the two sides of Tides formally
separated.  Both, however, moved into a former hospital complex,
renamed the Thoreau Center for Sustainability, located at San
Francisco's historic Presidio National Park, which anchors one
side of the Golden Gate Bridge (Tides leases the complex from
the National Park Service).  Tides's moving and renovation costs
for the Thoreau Center were approximately $5 million. Tides created
a special for-profit subsidiary that took advantage of tax breaks
provided for historical preservation.
<P>
Besides Tides, the Thoreau Center houses other nonprofit
organizations, several of which are Tides projects.  Center tenants
include the Energy Foundation, Institute for Global Communications,
Military Toxics Project, Social Venture Network, and the California
office of the Wilderness Society.  Tides employs about 300 staff
in its offices at the Presidio, in Washington, D.C., and elsewhere.
<BR>
<P>
<a name="catalysts">
<h4>OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL
'CATALYSTS'</h4><BR>
<P>
Pew and Tides are not alone in acting 
as catalysts to create new environmental
groups and campaigns.  For example, in 1982 the John D.
and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation provided a $15 million grant
to launch the World Resources Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based
nonprofit research organization which consults for governments
and for nongovernmental organizations around the world, especially
in developing nations, and which focuses on such global issues
as population, climate and sustainable development.  WRI's first
president was the ubiquitous James Gustave &quot;Gus&quot; Speth,
a founder of the Natural Resources Defense Council, former head
of President Jimmy Carter's Council on Environmental Quality (where
he oversaw production of the Global 2000 report which predicted
imminent resource exhaustion), and currently head of the United
Nations Development Program (see &quot;Making Americans Pay: The
MacArthur Foundation's Plan For A Global IRS&quot; in Foundation
Watch, vol.I, no.8).  
<P>
Speth has been a prominent exponent of the concept
of &quot;sustainable development&quot; and he has focused his
attention on energy-related issues.  Following the Persian Gulf
conflict, for instance, Speth, then at WRI, called for a new national
energy strategy.  Writing in the Los Angeles Times, he demanded
contradictory policies that would &quot;guarantee an affordable
supply of energy&quot; while increasing taxes on fossil fuels
because &quot;at the root of our problem is America's addiction
to cheap energy.&quot;  WRI's annual revenues, almost $14 million
in 1994, have since come from such private grantmakers as the
Joyce, Charles Stewart Mott, Rockefeller and Surdna foundations
and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund.
<P>
<P>
<a name="ford">
<h4>FORD'S BETTER IDEA</h4><BR>
<P>
Just as MacArthur established WRI, the 
Ford Foundation is credited with founding
in 1952 Resources for the Future, the foremost nonprofit
environmental research organization in Washington, D.C.  Ford
also provided in 1970 the seed money for the Natural Resources
Defense Council, the environmental litigation group known for
the Alar scare which alleged potential health threats from pesticide
residues on apples.  Ford has provided major funding for most
of the environmental organizations that use litigation to achieve
changes in public policy, including the Sierra Club Legal Defense
Fund, Environmental Defense Fund, and Southern California Center
for Law in the Public Interest. <BR>
<P>
<a name="heinz">
<h4>HEINZ'S 57 VARIETIES
OF ENVIRONMENTALISM</h4>
<P>
The Heinz Endowments have become 
another major player in 
environmental grantmaking.  They put up $20 million in 1995 to launch
the Heinz Center for Science, Economics and the Environment in
memory of the late Pennsylvania Republican Senator H. John Heinz
III. Theresa Heinz, the Senator's widow and a vice-chairman of
the Environmental Defense Fund, has made the environment a central
concern of the Heinz Endowments.  Upon announcing the Center's
establishment Theresa Heinz ,by now remarried to U.S. Senator
John Kerry (D-MA) (who did not give a penny to charity in 1995),
explained, &quot;This center will be a middle ground where the
major stakeholders in environmental policy can be jointly challenged
to think long-term and to forge a durable consensus for action
based on sound scientific and economic principles.&quot;  The
Center's president is William Merrell, a distinguished oceanographer,
and its board includes Fred Krupp, executive director of the Environmental
Defense Fund, John Sawhill, president of the Nature Conservancy,
Enron Corporation chairman Kenneth Lay, Carnegie Mellon president
Robert Mehrabian, Princeton University biologist Simon A. Levin,
and Paul O'Neill, chairman of ALCOA. 
<P>
Beginning in 1994, the Endowments announced recipients
of the Heinz Awards.  In 1994, the winners of the Heinz Award
for the Environment were the doomsayers Paul and Anne Ehrlich,
who were cited for &quot;their thoughtful studies of difficult
environmental issues.&quot;  Paul Ehrlich is the author of the
1968 book The Population Bomb, which proclaimed that &quot;The
battle to feed all of humanity is over...In the 1970s the world
will undergo famines - hundreds of millions of  people are going
to starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon
now.&quot;  The Ehrlichs recently co-authored a sequel, The Population
Explosion which predicted more of the same.  Paul Ehrlich is also
the founder of Zero Population Growth, an organization dedicated
to the global control of population.  According to Heinz, the
Ehrlichs' &quot;prescriptions, sometimes misrepresented as draconian,
are rooted in the same Judeo-Christian principles that are the
source of the Ehrlichs' profound ethic of stewardship.&quot; 
Of course, the Ehrlichs' predicted population &quot;die-backs&quot;
have never occurred. 
<P>
The 1995 Heinz Award went to Dr. Herbert Needleman,
guru of the &quot;get-the-lead-out&quot; movement.  Needleman,
a pediatrician and child psychologist, is the founder of the Alliance
to End Childhood Lead Poisoning and the author of several controversial
articles on lead's impact on children.  All scientists recognize
that exposure to lead can have a serious impact on child development.
 Needleman, however, has maintained that the impacts occur at
levels lower than is generally accepted by many experts.<BR>

<h4>ROCKEFELLER'S GREEN
FAMILY VALUES</h4>

<P>
The Rockefeller Family Fund (RFF) is
a veteran funder of environmental 
causes.  Founded in 1967, the Fund has over $44 million in assets
and is organized into five programs: Citizen Education and Participation,
Economic Justice for Women, Institutional Responsiveness, Self-Sufficiency,
and the largest program, Environment.  RFF is but one of several
Rockefeller family foundations supporting environmental causes.
 The Rockefeller Foundation, Rockefeller Brothers Fund, American
Conservation Association, and Jackson Hole Preserve together contributed
over $12 million to environmental causes in 1992 (John D. Rockefeller,
IV, a member of the Rockefeller family, has a vacation home in
Jackson Hole, Wyoming in which President Clinton has vacationed).
<P>
The Rockefeller Family Fund is the most prominent
of these in the area of environmental giving.  While RFF grants
are made to &quot;organizations which traditionally enjoy popular
support, such as universities, museums, hospitals, or endowed
institutes,&quot; the Fund also supports &quot;advocacy programs
that are action-oriented and likely to yield tangible public policy
results.&quot;  Moreover, it seeks to promote &quot;progressive&quot;
causes while countering the &quot;political right.&quot;  Most
of its environmental giving is of this sort. 
<P>
One particular interest of the Rockefeller Family
Fund is encouraging &quot;whistleblowing&quot; [i.e., snitching]
and environmental activism [i.e., politics] by civil servants.
 As RFF director Donald Ross explained in a 1994 letter to members
of the Environmental Grantmakers' Association, the group whose
work he helps coordinate:
<P>
Underlying many successful news releases, lawsuits,
and blockbuster reports and testimony is information provided
by insiders: public employees who rejected conformity, abandoned
the get-ahead, go-along philosophy of government service and blew
the whistle.  Whistleblowing is always important, but it becomes
even more so when public policies are in dispute.
<P>
Toward this end, the Fund in 1993 supported the
Government Accountability Project ($60,000) and Association of
Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics ($20,000), two
nonprofits that promote whistleblowing, particularly when it produces
litigation.  As Ross notes, &quot;The one-two punch of inside
whistleblowers and outside litigators remains potent.&quot; 
<P>
Among the environmental groups that received RFF
grants in 1994 were the following: 
<P>
Alaskan Conservation Foundation $40,000 
<P>
Center for Auto Safety  $25,000 
<P>
Citizens Clearinghouse for Hazardous Wastes     
$30,000 
<P>
Clean Water Action  $25,000 
<P>
Clean Water Fund  $25,000 
<P>
Environmental Information Center $30,000 
<P>
Environmental Support Center $30,000 
<P>
Friends of the Earth Foundation $25,000 
<P>
Mineral Policy Center  $25,000
<P>
Mothers and Others for a Livable Planet      $30,000
<P>
Ozone Action, Inc.  $30,000
<P>
Western Ancient Forests Campaign $30,000 
<P>
<P>
Other Rockefeller foundations also support organized
environmental activism.  In 1992, the American Conservation Association
gave $90,000 to the Natural Resources Defense Council, $90,000
to the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, and $75,000 to the Wilderness
Society. In 1992, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund supported the
Worldwatch Institute ($525,000), American Farmland Trust ($1,000,000),
and Environmental Law Institute ($120,000 [3-year]). In 1993,
the Jackson Hole Preserve funded the Greater Yellowstone Coalition
($20,000), National Wildlife Federation ($10,000), and National
Park Foundation ($125,000).<BR>
<P>
<a name="jones">
<h4>KEEPING UP WITH
W. ALTON JONES</h4>
<P>
<P>
The W. Alton Jones Foundation is 
devoted exclusively to two issues, &quot;to 
protect the Earth's life-support systems from environmental
harm and to eliminate the possibility of nuclear war.&quot;  Like
the Pew Charitable Trusts, the foundation is the product of oil
industry wealth.  In 1995 it made grants of nearly $20 million,
with over 60 percent going to environmental organizations and
causes.  Although based in Charlottesville, Virginia the Jones
Foundation is well-connected to Washington, D.C.'s environmental
establishment.  Debra Callahan, the newly appointed president
of the League of Conservation Voters, was formerly the foundation's
environmental grass-roots coordinator.  Foundation director John
Peterson Myers is a former senior vice president at the National
Audubon Society.  George Perkovich, a foundation program director,
was a prominent defender of Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary who
was widely criticized for using outside consultants to evaluate
media coverage of her Department.
<P>
W. Alton Jones's &quot;Sustainable World Program&quot;
provides funding for environmental groups.  Foundation boilerplate
says it &quot;supports efforts that will ensure that human activities
do not undermine the quality of life of future generations and
do not erode the Earth's capacity to support living organisms.&quot;
 According to the Foundation, this is achieved through &quot;a
tight focus on issues whose resolution will determine how habitable
the planet remains over the next century and beyond.&quot;The
W. Alton Jones Foundation has become intimately tied to the campaign
against synthetic chemicals that, it is claimed, may damage human
and animal hormone systems.  This campaign, largely based on speculative
claims and anecdotal evidence, was boosted by publication in 1996
of the book Our Stolen Future.  Co-author John Peterson Myers
is a director of the foundation.  Another co-author, Theo Colburn
of the World Wildlife Fund, had been a foundation staff scientist.
 Our Stolen Future calls for a dramatic reduction in chemical
use and far stricter regulatory controls on industry.  The authors
urge consumers to buy only organic vegetables and to stop microwaving
food in plastic containers.  Many scientists reject as unproven
the book's central charge that hormone-disrupting chemicals are
a major public health risk, and the book's claims have been criticized
in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal.
<P>
In 1995 W. Alton Jones Foundation made environmental
grants to:

Like many of the other environmental grantmakers
the Jones foundation has encouraged environmental advocacy groups
to cooperate with one another and coordinate their policy objectives.
 These efforts &quot;usually take the form of coordinated grants
to multiple institutions, each of which focuses on one or more
components of an overall campaign. . . .&quot; Once an initiative
is underway, the Foundation accepts grant proposals from organizations
that want to participate.  The Jones Foundation has also supported
non-environmental groups engaged in environmental work.  For instance,
in 1993 the Foundation made a $15,000 grant to the National Taxpayers
Union Foundation to oppose environmentally-destructive corporate
subsidies.  <BR>

<h4>GREEN GIVING BY 
THE 'MOUTH OF THE SOUTH'</h4><BR>

The Turner Foundation is perhaps the 
newest foundation to dedicate big 
money to environmental issues.  Media mogul Ted Turner hopes
his foundation, launched in 1990, will become the largest philanthropy
devoted to environmental and population issues.  In 1994 it gave
$5 million to environmental causes, a figure sure to climb.  Unfortunately,
the cable pioneer who once prided himself on his feisty independence
of mind (he tried to take over CBS with Senator Jesse Helms in
the 1980's) now seems to have fallen victim to conventional thinking
about the environment and population. Turner explains, &quot;We
are literally in a fight to save the humans.&quot;  He told the
Atlanta Journal-Constitution, &quot;I see the whole field of environmentalism
and population as nothing more than the survival of the human
species.  I have wanted to have some bumper stickers made up saying,
`Save the  Humans.'  At the bottom of it all, we are trying to
save ourselves.&quot;  
<P>
The executive director of the Foundation is Peter
Bahouth, former head of Greenpeace USA, widely regarded as the
most radical of the major environmental organizations.  Greenpeace
is well known for its high-profile campaign to end whaling worldwide.
 It also has called for a complete phase-out of all chlorine chemicals,
including those used to manufacture pharmaceuticals and sanitize
water supplies.  Bahouth echoes the contemporary attitude that
the environment must be conserved not for man's use, but for nature's
own sake.  In his view, the environmental challenge &quot;is to
expand our collective sense of care and return responsibility
towards not just our extended human family, but to other living
species as well.&quot;  The stated goals of the Foundation are
&quot;preventing damage to the natural system&quot; and &quot;supporting
innovative institutions committed to protecting the  Earth's natural
systems and ensuring a sustainable and better world for all its
inhabitants.&quot;
<P>
Turner Foundation grants are targetted to the issues
of energy, protection of forests and other habitat, population,
and water and toxics.  &quot;Nearly 300 groups representing a
broad range of approaches received grants from the Turner Foundation
in 1995,&quot; says Bahouth.  &quot;Most are small groups of citizens
who are concerned about their communities and want to make them
better places to live.&quot;  The Foundation has made several
environment-related grants to leftist organizations like the Institute
for Policy Studies and Fairness &amp; Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR).
<P>
Favoring &quot;sound population policies,&quot;
the foundation has funded a campaign aimed at teen pregnancy in
Georgia, where it is headquartered.  According to Bahouth, &quot;The
vision of this work is, 'All teens are entitled to a healthy adolescence,
free of unwanted and unplanned pregnancies, and characterized
by hope and opportunity for a productive future.&quot;  In 1995
population grants recipients included Concerned Women for Family
Planning, Georgia Population Initiative, Population Action International,
Catholics for a Free Choice, The Center for Reproductive Law &amp;
Policy, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Families First,
and the  League of Women Voters Population Coalition.  The Turner
Foundation does not publish the amounts of its grants.  Other
1995 grant recipients were the following:
<P>
Alliance for the Wild Rockies, American Rivers,
American Wildlands, Biodiversity Legal Foundation, Center for
International Environmental Law, Earth Island Institute, Environmental
Media Services, Environmental Working Group, Friends of the Earth,
 Government Accountability Project, Kentucky Hemp Growers Cooperative

Native Forest Council, Oregon Natural Resource Council, Ozone

As grantmakers focus their giving on 
particular issues and policy strategies 
they have little by little begun to direct the environmental
advocacy agenda.  &quot;The foundations want to get something
for their money,&quot; charges Jeff St. Clair, editor of Wild
Forest Review.  &quot;They're out for control,&quot; he told the
Newhouse News Service, &quot;They want to control the policy and
political agenda of the environmental movement.&quot;  
<P>
During the 1980s, the Kendall Foundation  pressured
the largest environmental advocacy organizations into coordinating
their efforts through the so-called &quot;Group of 10&quot; meetings
of the major environmental groups.  Today the Environmental Grantmakers
Association operates from Rockefeller Family Fund offices.  &quot;As
often the sole source of funds for broad public outreach, grantmaking
becomes the focal point for inter-organizational cooperation,&quot;
the Pew Charitable Trusts' Joshua Reichert has explained. 
<P>
Pew is one of the most active foundations trying
to manage environmental advocacy (for more on Pew see &quot;Buying
Press Coverage: How Pew's Civic Journalism Project Put Newspapers,
Radio and Television Stations On the Payroll,&quot; Foundation
Watch vol.I, no.7).  For instance, in 1992 Pew and the W. Alton
Jones Foundation created Americans for the Ancient Forests, to
campaign against logging on public lands in the Pacific Northwest.
Pew also tried to organize a national campaign to pressure the
U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management to change forest
land management practices.  In 1993 it set aside $12 million to
create Earth Force, an environmental activist organization for
kids _ a sort of environmental Boy Scouts.  Earth Force was created
without consulting groups like the National Wildlife Federation
that already had extensive programs for children.
<P>
In 1991, Pew joined with the Rockefeller Foundation
and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation to provide
$20 million to create the Energy Foundation, which promotes local
and regional regulatory policies on energy conservation and use
of low-energy-use technologies.  By pooling their resources, the
three foundations have been able to ensure that funding in this
area is focused on a single policy agenda.  The three foundations
have committed to fund the Energy Foundation for at least a decade.
 In 1993 the Energy Foundation made grants to the Environmental
Defense Fund of Texas ($500,000), Center for Neighborhood Technology
($150,000), 1,000 Friends of Oregon ($237,000), and Environmental
Action Foundation ($14,000). Environmental groups complain that
foundations are &quot;the tail wagging the dog.&quot;  Some charge
that Pew interfered with their attempt to prevent reform of the
Endangered Species Act by cutting off funds meant for the Endangered
Species Coalition and funding the Environmental Information Center
instead.  The Coalition's head, former Congressman Jim Jontz,
claims Pew forced him and the Coalition out of the campaign to
&quot;protect&quot; the Endangered Species Act. 
<P>
Pew executive director Rebecca Rimel acknowledges
the fear that foundations have their own priorities.  She told
The Chronicle of Philanthropy, &quot;Because by nature we are
insulated institutions, it's very hard for us to get candid and
direct feedback from the field.  So it's very easy for us to maybe
choose the wrong issue or go down the wrong road strategically.&quot;
Yet even though environmental groups gripe about foundation direction,
grantmakers report that they are overwhelmed with proposals at
the slightest indication  that they may have funds available for
particular projects.  Grassroots activist Sam Hitt explained the
paradox to High Country News: &quot;When Pew steps in, it's like
a death star in the solar system.  They set up their own gravitational
field and everyone begins to revolve around them.  I've watched
activists go through this dance of making themselves look fundable
to Pew by altering their priorities to meet Pew's goals.  I've
had it with those guys.&quot;<BR>

Re: Vol. I, no.4 article on Opera.
[&quot;Why did a reclusive widow give the Washington Opera eighteen

of the Washington Opera has given the lie to NEA lobbyists who
claim cutting federal funding of the arts will undermine the survival
of art itself.&quot; 
<P>
Seems an odd place to find anti-NEA
sentiments. 
<P>
There is no question that the very
modest support USA has given to support of the Arts through NEA
has contributed to a growth in the arts especially dance and perhaps
Opera too etc. 
<P>
The pittance given has never been the
main support of any organization, in an era of high crime it seems
crazy to cut back on arts support.
<P>
One toilet didn't kill defense. Does
a bad grant kill the NEA?

Why not support the arts?  It beats

EDITOR'S NOTE
<P>
<i>The
September-October issue of Foundation News and Commentary contains
an item about the Rockefeller Foundation's response to our request
for interviews which should interest readers of Foundation Watch.
[&quot;The Rockefeller Foundation: The Big Money Behind Multiculturalism,&quot;
vol. I, no. 4].</I>
<P>
<I> Denise Gray-Felder, director of
communications for the Rockefeller Foundation told the house organ
of the Council on Foundations that she had asked &quot;people&quot;
who had heard of our publication whether to provide interviews
with foundation president Peter C. Goldmark, Jr. and arts and
humanities program director Alberta Arthurs. They &quot;agreed
with the foundation's decision to refuse to be interviewed.&quot;</I>
<P>
<I>Gray-Felder, who told Foundation
News that she found our article &quot;bizarre&quot; and &quot;very
inaccurate,&quot; defended her decision not to present Rockefeller's
point of view: &quot;I have never done that in my 20-year public
relations career. It was a hard decision to make; it turned out
to be the right decision for us.&quot;</I>
<P>
<I>Gray-Felder and Foundation News
failed to note that we interviewed Dr. John Robert Evans, former
Chairman of the Board of the Rockefeller Foundation; Daniel P.
Garcia, a foundation trustee; and a number of other board members
who asked to remain anonymous. Not one of our interview subjects
has noted any inaccuracies in the story.</I>
<P>
<I> As for what Grey-Felder called bizarre,
we can only note that our account was based on published listings
in the Foundation's annual report.</I>
<P>
<I>The Rockefeller Foundation has given
grants to the late &quot;Tongues Untied&quot; filmmaker Marlon
Riggs; New York's Franklin Furnace, venue  for a pornographic
event by &quot;Scarlet O;&quot; Intermedia Arts in Minneapolis,
which hosted Ron Athey's HIV-positive slicing and dicing torture
performance; and Santa Monica's Highways, where Athey also performed
as well as &quot;NEA Four&quot; strippers Tim Miller and Karen
Finley, as well as another peformance artist describing &quot;sex
with Newt's mom.&quot;</I>
<P>
<I>We agree with Gray-Felder that such
organizations are bizarre. Even more bizarre has been the decision
of the Rockefeller Foundation to fund them.</I>

<center><h2>Why did AFL-CIO chief George Meany help Warren Carroll 
found Christendom College in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley?</h2><BR>
</center>
<center><h3>by Ann Marie Temple</h3></center>
<blockquote>
<p>Warren Carroll may be the most successful 
man in Virginia for he is one of the lucky 
few who can say that he is doing what he 
believes in every day of his life. 
Carroll is the founding president of Christendom College, 
a small liberal arts college tucked away in 
Virginia's picturesque Shenandoah Valley. Ten years ago 
he resigned his office to teach history full time at 
the college. He is an author and editor of numerous 
histories and biographies, including two books on 
the origin and history of the Communist Revolution 
and a newsletter tracking international resistance to 
communist insurgency.  He is currently at work on a 
multi-volume history of Western Civilization.  Many 
professors today view the past as a complex web of events that require periodic reinterpretion to fit 
current politically correct doctrines. But unlike 
most modern historians, Carroll teaches that 
individuals, not economic or social forces, are the shapers of 
history.  During the 1960s Carroll saw the Western 
tradition systematically abandoned as his fellow 
historians revised the past.  He concluded the only 
hope for a renaissance lay in America's youth. In 
1977, Carroll decided to change how history was 
taught by making history himself. He founded 
Christendom College.
<p>
Carroll insists history majors at Christendom
take at least one class on the history of 
revolutionary movements, either the French <BR>
Revolution or the Communist 
Revolution, and encourages his students to read 
<I>Witness</I>, the autobiography of Whitaker Chambers. It was after 
reading this book as a graduate student in 1954 that 
Carroll became a dedicated anti-communist. Carroll 
graduated from Bates College and received his doctorate 
in history from Columbia University. He is a 
prolific writer: in addition to two books on the Russian 
revolution, <I>1917</I> (Christendom Press, 1981) and 
<I>70 Years of the Communist Revolution</I> (republished as 
<I>The Rise and Fall of the Communist 
Revolution</I>, Christendom Press, 1995), Carroll established the 
<I>Freedom Fighter</I> newsletter to track &quot;counter-revolutionary&quot; 
activity throughout the world.  From 1985-1990, this 
publication covered the Afghan resistance, the 
Nicaraguan freedom fighters, and African anti-communist 
movements.  Carroll believes the revolutionary 
impulse remains alive and will continue to cause conflict. 
He thinks the best response is a strong defense of 
the Western tradition. He recently completed <I>The 
Last Crusade</I> (Christendom Press, 1996), a book 
about 1936, the first year of the Spanish Civil War.  

<BR>
Carroll has always been politically and socially
conservative. However, he arrived at a new perspective
after 1968.  He came to understand that modern 
societies were the battleground for the conflict between those who 
recognize objective realityand those committed to skepticism and 
moral relativism.  In 1967 Carroll was working in California politics 
and was not religious.  &quot;Technically, I was a Deist,&quot; he says. Then 
he married Anne Westhoff, a devout Catholic whom he met in 1962.  
 In 1968, the United States was facing what Carroll considers 
its greatest internal turmoil since the Civil War.  He calls the era 
a &quot;wild saturnalia&quot; and &quot;the height of the revolutionary 
movement, the rejection of all values and principles.&quot;  That year he 
converted to Catholicism and it became the key event in his life. The 
Carrolls moved to Washington in 1970.  His wife Anne began working 
for <I>Triumph</I>, a conservative Catholic magazine founded by 
Brent Bozell, William F. Buckley, Jr.'s brother-in-law. In 1973 
Carroll left politics and joined Anne at the magazine. 
<P>
<P><I>Triumph</I> hosted an annual six week summer institute at the 
Escorial, Philip II's palace outside Madrid.  The summer 
program was designed to introduce American students to the 
traditional liberal arts (history, literature, philosophy, political 
science, theology) in the physical context of a conservative and 
religious civilization.  Carroll taught American students in the Spanish 
program.  There, the &quot;person around whom all else revolved&quot; was 
Dr. Frederick Wilhelmsen, professor of philosophy and political 
science at the University of Dallas. In 1956, while teaching at 
UCLA, Wilhelmsen had organized 2,000 students to go to the aid of 
the Hungarian freedom fighters.  (They were stopped at the Los 
Angeles airport by authorities.)  Wilhelmsen was a strong influence 
on Carroll as he developed the curriculum of  the  new college.  
Teachers and students in the <I>Triumph</I> program in Spain eventually made 
up the nucleus of Christendom College.  
<P>
<P>With <I>Triumph</I>'s demise in 1975, Carroll decided to found 
a college that would emulate medieval universities 
by reinforcing the traditions of Western Civilization. 
Students at Christendom major in one of the traditional 
liberal arts:  English, Philosophy, Theology, Political Science, 
History, French, or Classical Languages.  All students must complete a 
core curriculum, including Christian doctrine, moral theology, and 
several semesters of philosophy.   By the 60's and 70's many 
American Catholic colleges had weakened their religious identity.  
Carroll saw a need for a college that would be uncompromisingly 
Catholic. And so as <I>Triumph</I> published its last issue in the summer 
of 1975, Carroll began making plans.  Thomas Aquinas College 
in Santa Paula, California, had been founded a few years earlier  
but Carroll thought more was needed: &quot;Bad as things had become, 
I was sure that a country as big as this could support at least 
two, especially on opposite sides of the country.&quot;  Money seemed to 
be the greatest obstacle. <I> </I>In order to maintain its 
independence, Christendom College does not receive money from the 
Church, although the Arlington, Virginia diocese is supportive and 
provides a chaplain.  Carroll likewise refused federal funding, 
even student loans. The college has grown with the support of  
loyal donors and benefactors among the Catholic laity.  As time 
has passed, money has not proved to be the main problem, 
and Christendom recently raised funds to build a new common 
room and chapel.   &quot;We always had more people who wanted to teach 
at Christendom College than we had places,&quot; says Carroll. Dr. 
Jeffrey Mirus, who wrote for <I>Triumph</I> and later taught history 
and literature as one of Christendom's founding faculty, says he 
was always struck by Carroll's ability &quot;to keep his eye on the goal.&quot; 
 Carroll was amazed to discover that his real challenge was 
finding students who saw the value of a classical education.  He had 
decided he would not start the college unless he had 25 initial 
applicants; he found 26.  But even finding pupils became easier, 
especially after the college received accreditation in 1986. Last year the 
 the college enrolled some 200 students.
<P>Admissions are selective, and the college is on the John 
Templeton honor role and has the highest rank from 
the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement 
of Teaching.  Students come from all over the U.S, and 
from Canada, Mexico, Costa Rica, Hungary, and  Ireland.  All 
of the professors are practicing Catholics and make a 
yearly declaration of loyalty to the teachings of the Church.  
The school has a midnight curfew and a strict dress code 
(shirts and ties for men, knee-length skirts or business pants 
for women), along with sanctions against alcohol in 
student rooms and intervisitation between men's and women's 
dormitories.  These rules are enforced by older students 
appointed as  Resident Assistants under the direction of a 
Dean of Students.  Many applicants are frightened away 
by Christendom's strict rules, high standards and small 
size, but students consider  these to be advantages. The key 
social event of the year is the St. Patrick's Day party, 
with traditional Irish music and dancing performed by 
teachers, students, alumni, and even children of alumni.  Senior 
Cary McCoy says, &quot;It's like a big family event.  All the 
alumni come and everyone is eating and singing together.  
Dr. Carroll gets up and sings and everybody cheers.&quot;  
Graduate Lorraine Overbeck comments, &quot;Christendom is the 
only place where I can leave my purse in the cafeteria, 
come back a day later and find it where I left it with 
everything still in it.&quot;  
<P>
<P>Christendom's first classes were held in temporary class
rooms in Triangle, Virginia leased to Carroll by the
local Catholic parish.  Carroll had no idea where 
to move his college but had faith that God would send a 
solution.  His prayers were answered.  
<I>Triumph</I> had held a final weekend seminar in a lodge on the Shenandoah River 
owned by the AFL-CIO  and used for training Latin American 
labor organizers.  The manager was a friend of the magazine. 
 In 1979, the AFL-CIO decided to sell the property, but 
the asking price was too high for Carroll. Miraculously, the 
retired Patrick Cardinal O'Boyle was able to help.  
O'Boyle was a friend of George Meany, longtime AFL-CIO 
president.  The Cardinal persuaded Meany to lower the price 
by more than one third. After contacting a long list of 
prominent Catholics and friends of <I>Triumph</I>,  enough money 
was raised for the down payment.  Christendom College 
permanently relocated  in Front Royal, Virginia, 60 miles west 
of Washington. 
<P>
<P>Carroll considers his determination to be the legacy of
his earliest ancestor in America,  Englishman James 
Warren, who was captured at the battle of Dunbar 
fighting for King Charles II against Oliver Cromwell.  
Warren was shipped off to America as an indentured servant 
and obtained land in Maine. Carroll's ancestral home is on 
the site of the original &quot;Warren Garrison.&quot;   Carroll's 
great-grandfather, Robert Carroll was killed in the Civil War 
fighting for the Union at the Battle of Cedar Creek in 1864, 
a few miles from Christendom College. Like his battling 
Yankee ancestors, Christendom's founder has committed 
his lifetime to fighting -- this time on the side of  Catholic 
tradition. Today he lives and writes in Manassas, teaching 
a full load of history courses in Front Royal.  All his 
classes rest on the premise that history is the story of people.  
&quot;All this talk about trends and forces and so on . . . doesn't 
make any sense; these things are not real, they're 
imaginative themes.  People are the great reality in history and they 
are the ones who make it.&quot;  Carroll himself has 
demonstrated by his own actions that he is one of those people.
<P>

College, 134 Christendom Drive, Front Royal, VA 22530.

poverty groups by addressing &quot;basic causes of poverty&quot; and must &quot;effect 
institutional change&quot;; projects must &quot;contribute to 
a more integrated and mutually understanding society&quot;; &quot;members of the 
poverty group must have a dominant voice in the project&quot;; and finally, &quot;CHD 
funded projects must conform to the moral teachings of the Catholic Church.&quot; 
(CHD 1994-95 Annual Report)      
<p>Despite these reassuring criteria, it might surprise the average Catholic 
to see what sort of organizations his CHD donations are funding.  While 
specifically funded projects may be innocuous enough, some recipient groups are 
fighting against the &quot;moral teachings of the Catholic Church.&quot;  Organizations 
receiving thousands of dollars from the Campaign for Human Development 
officially cooperate with groups like the National Organization for Women, Planned 
Parenthood, and the Feminist Majority Foundation, among others.  These 
groups advocate abortion, gay and lesbian activism, and other causes condemned by 
the Catholic Church.  Other CHD-funded groups focus on politically liberal 
issues such as gun control, cuts in defense spending, increases in welfare 
programs, and socialized medicine.  While there is no Catholic position on these issues, it 
is doubtful that every parishioner donating money to the Campaign for Human 
Development intends his contribution to support these causes.

<B>JEDI Women</B>
<br>
One of the most troubling things about CHD has been its persistent habit 
of funding organizations closely associated with and in some cases directly 
supportive of  the pro-abortion movement.  Despite the repeated revelation 
of these incidents, by the Capital Research Center and others, the practice 
continues.
<P>Justice, Economic Dignity and Independence for Women of Salt Lake 
City (JEDI Women) received a CHD grant of $20,000 in 1995.  In April 1996, 
JEDI Women officially endorsed the National Organization for Women's &quot;Fight 
the Right&quot; March in San Francisco, marching alongside such groups as: 
Catholics for a Free Choice; D.C. Coalition of Black Lesbians, Gay Men and Bisexuals, Inc.; Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund; National Abortion &amp; Reproductive Rights Action League (NARAL); 
Feminist Majority Foundation; Planned Parenthood Federation of America; and 
Zero Population Growth.  According to NOW, the purpose of the march was to 
show that &quot;the majority of people denounce 
the divisive hate-mongering of the right-wing; and will  with our time, money 
and votes  actively support affirmative action; economic justice; abortion 
rights and reproductive freedom; civil rights for people of color; lesbian, gay and 
bisexual rights and efforts to end violence 
against women.&quot;

<hr width=50% align=center size=3>
<p>
Speakers at the march included Gloria Steinem, Feminist Majority 
Foundation President Eleanor Smeal, and Phil Wilson, founder of the National Black 
Gay and Lesbian Leadership Forum.  Prominent signs and banners read: &quot;Fight 
the Radical Right&quot;; &quot;Spread Love:  Hug a Queer&quot;; and &quot;Get Your Rosaries Out 
of My Ovaries.&quot;
<p><i>Organization Trends</i> asked Timothy Collins, CHD's acting director, 
about CHD's support for groups participating in this march.  Collins responded 
that &quot;CHD cannot control every project we fund.&quot;  
<p>The Fight the Right March was not JEDI Women's only association 
with pro-abortion and gay rights activism.  JEDI Women is one of 17 members 
of UPNET, the Utah Progressive Network of Salt Lake City, founded in 1993.  
Other members of UPNET include: Planned Parenthood Association of Utah; 
Pro-Choice Coalition of Utah; Parents, Families, Friends of Lesbians &amp; Gays; 
Utahns for Choice/Student Coalition; and Utah NOW.  A brochure published by 
UPNET explains the purpose of the coalition:  &quot;UPNET organizations are 
committed to actualizing a vision of Utah as a 
place where all people, whatever their gender, race, national origin, veteran's 
status, affectional orientation, age, physical 
or mental ability, or religious beliefs, have the freedom to live their lives fully, 
without fear of violence, discrimination, or economic deprivation.&quot;
<p>The UPNET Education Fund holds its meetings each month at the 
Planned Parenthood Association of Utah Community Meeting Room.  
<p>JEDI Women was profiled in the Spring 1996 issue of the 
<i>Utah Progressive News</i>, the newsletter of UPNET. 
 In the same issue, an article entitled &quot;Utah Legislature Passes 
Anti-Choice Bills&quot; complains of legislation 
requiring women to receive counseling 24 hours prior to an abortion and to watch a 
video on fetal development.  The article expresses relief that a bill to ban partial 
birth abortion &quot;was watered down to the point of being ineffectual.&quot;  The issue 
also featured a report on efforts by UPNET to &quot;support the efforts of students in 
local high schools to form support clubs in which students can be open about 
their sexual identity.&quot;  The article notes 
that UPNET has &quot;played a major role in opening dialogue in Utah about gay 
youth specifically, and homosexuality, generally.&quot;
<p>The 1996 UPNET Member Organization Calendar includes: &quot;April 1: 
Utah State Liberal Appreciation Day&quot;; 
&quot;April 5: Planned Parenthood benefit&quot;; 
&quot;May 18: Pro-Choice Coalition Workshop&quot;; &quot;June 9:  Utah GAY PRIDE DAY:

<b>Working 9 to 5</b>
<br>
JEDI Women is not the only CHD grant recipient to support causes that 
do not &quot;conform to the moral teachings of the Catholic Church.&quot;  (Indeed, what 
is striking is the ease with which one finds such groups.)  9 to 5/Working 
Women, <br>
was profiled in the Campaign for Human Development 1994-95 Annual Report. 
 Ellen Bravo, national director of 9 to 5, is quoted as saying:  &quot;CHD was the 
one place you could go to get money for organizing.  That was what we 
believed we needed to be doingorganizing, reaching out to the largest sector of 
the workforce which was clearly being discriminated against and had no 
public voice . . . CHD was really there for us, and we couldn't have made it 
without them.&quot;
<p>Milwaukee 9 to 5, Inc., recently received $35,000 from CHD for its 
Wage Replacement for Family Leave Project. Sounds nice, but what else does 9 to 
5 do?  In February, Ellen Bravo, representing 9 to 5, spoke at Expo `96 
for Women's Empowerment in Washington, D.C.  The Feminist Majority 
Foundation was the primary sponsor of the Expo, and other sponsors include the 
pro-abortion political group EMILY's List, NARAL, National Abortion 
Federation, National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, National Association for Women, 
National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association, Planned 
Parenthood Federation of America, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals 
(PETA), Women's Environment and Development Organization (WEDO), and Zero 
Population Growth.  Prominent speakers at the Expo were Eleanor Smeal of 
the Feminist Majority Foundation, Bella Abzug of WEDO, Gloria Steinem, 
founder of <i>Ms. Magazine</i>, and Patricia Ireland of NOW.  Singer Helen Reddy 
performed, &quot;I am woman, hear me roar.&quot;  The Expo was not an isolated incident 
for 9 to 5/Working Women; in April, the group joined Jedi Women in 
endorsing NOW's Fight the Right March.

<b>FLOC:  The Road to Beijing</b>
<br>
The Farm Labor Organizing Committee (FLOC) was also profiled in 
CHD's Annual Report, and FLOC President Beldamar Velasquez received the 
CHD Development of People Award in 1992.  According to 
<i>Dignidad</i>, the organization's newsletter, FLOC 
works with WEDO and Greenpeace on the steering committee for the National 
Coalition for Health and Environmental Justice, set up after a 1995 
environmental summit in Albuquerque. WEDO is known as a radical supporter of abortion 
and population control programs. WEDO invited Beatriz Maya, the FLOC 
representative at the summit, to attend the Non-Governmental Organizations Forum 
on Women, which was held in conjunction  with the U.N.'s Women's 
Conference in Beijing, China.

<hr width=50% align=center size=3>
<p>
Maya described the forum in an article entitled 
&quot;ACTIVISM! Breaks Out in Beijing,&quot; 
explaining the negotiations over the conference's Platform for Action.  She included 
the Church in her complaints over &quot;strong conservative opposition&quot; to women 
and their work at the conference.   Maya points out that Argentinean 
women, working for &quot;the right to a safe 
abortion,&quot; are unhappy  that &quot;the Catholic 
Church had forced the government to include [Church] representatives in the 
official delegation and were backing off all promises.&quot;  She went on to assure her 
readers that in spite of these &quot;challenges,&quot; 
the Platform for Action &quot;made significant advances on . . . sexual and 
reproductive rights.&quot;<br>
<p><i>Flocista</i>, another newsletter put out by FLOC, recently hired a new 
Assistant Editor and Development Team member, Alexander Goodrum. The newsletter 
announced that Goodrum &quot;comes to FLOC from many years working for 
grassroots movements fighting for African-American justice and equality, 
international peace and justice, and equality for 
gay, transsexual and lesbian Americans.&quot;  
<p>Like FLOC, the Center for Community Advocacy (CCA) of Salinas, 
CA, was founded to work with farmworkers, and it recently received $35,000 
from CHD.  According to CCA, the group is &quot;Dedicated to improving 
farmworker housing conditions and helping farmworkers help themselves.&quot;  
CCA provides a number of access services to other organizations and boasts about 
its &quot;strong network of contacts.&quot;  
Planned Parenthood is one of the groups CCA &quot;collaborated and provided . . . 
access services to.&quot;  The author<b><i>

conversation with the CCA director, and found the same information in a CCA abstract.

<b>Escaping Poverty</b>
<br>People Escaping Poverty Project (PEPP) of Fargo, ND, has

following description:  &quot;One of the city's 
many newspaper vending boxes . . . takes a direct hit downtown.  This particular 
box dispenses every Washingtonian's favorite rightist Moonie rag, the

during January and February 1991.&quot;
<p>Under the heading &quot;Progressive Links that inspire us,&quot;  the PEPP

<b>Opposition to Defense Spending</b>
<br>Issues of feminism, abortion rights and gay and lesbian rights pose 
the clearest instances in which CHD-funded organizations are at odds with the 
moral teachings of the Catholic Church.  But many CHD recipients are also 
involved in politically liberal causes.  And 
Catholic donors might not support CHD if they were more familiar with these 
organizations.  Baltimore Jobs with Peace has received $55,000 from CHD in the 
last two years.  Jobs with Peace exists primarily to fight federal defense 
spending and, according to Jobs with Peace, 
&quot;continually strives to make connections between poverty and military spending.&quot; 
 Jobs with Peace led other Baltimore organizations in forming the 
Baltimore Peace Network, &quot;a long term network for action.&quot;  According to Jobs 
with Peace, &quot;In its short history, the 
Network has already tackled issues such as hand-gun control and the use of nuclear 
power to fuel space exploration vehicles.&quot;  
<p>The Baltimore Jobs with Peace newsletter describes the activities and 
accomplishments of Jobs with Peace and the Baltimore Peace Network.  It 
features articles calling for the abolition of all nuclear weapons and contrasts 
&quot;Cuts passed in the House&quot; (&quot;500 million 
cut from the Clean Water Act&quot;) with &quot;Pentagon Pork&quot; (which includes money 
for B-2 stealth bombers, military helicopters and improvements to the National 
Guard and Reserves).  A half-page of the newsletter proclaims:  &quot;Boycott French 
Products . . . Join the worldwide protests against French products until France 
reverses its decision to resume nuclear weapons testing in the South Pacific.&quot;  
<p>In an article entitled &quot;Little Guns Demand Activists' Attention, Too!,&quot; a 
Jobs with Peace board member describes the &quot;cynical pitch&quot; of the &quot;gun lobby&quot;  
which &quot;piously pleads that gun control endangers the civil rights of Americans.&quot;  
According to the newsletter, this &quot;cynical pitch . . . benefits only the arms 
manufacturers, the political right wing, and the corporate culture which spawns 
them both.&quot;  The article continues:  &quot;The 
more `respectable' pushers invoke the `constitutional right to bear arms' another inaccuracy.  But a growing army of 
right wing extremists get right down to cases.  They speak openly of a need to 
protect their homes against `government invasion,' which will destroy America's 
patriotic ideals!&quot;

		Were parishioners who gave money to CHD told their 
		contributions would be going to support socialized medicine and 
		to fight the Contract with America?
</pre>
<hr width=50% align=center size=3>
<p>
The article continues:  &quot;Of course, this not-so-subtle racist code implies that 
the growing ranks of the unemployed and the homeless, especially the 
minorities, will one day invade the homes of the `haves,' and must be stopped by a 
fully armed and prepared citizenry.  Blowing up an occasional Federal building 
evidently helps test that `preparedness.' But whatever the disingenuous patter 
for free access to handguns and automatic weapons, the results are indisputable: 
 blood on the streets in the economic ghettos of America  a kind of 
genocide on the poor  an extension of the `Contract on America' in its most 
murderous form. . . . Military and domestic 
violence have an insidious link in the fantasy of 
the gun as arbiter.&quot;
<p>The article concludes by referring to the &quot;gun lobby&quot; as &quot;the enemy&quot; and 
as the &quot;merchants of death, whose sales pitch is world power through fire power!&quot; 
 Aside from its fallacious and fevered rhetoric, the Jobs with Peace 
article raises the question of why the U.S. Catholic Conference is funding 
overtly political, left-wing organizations 
involved in volatile issues that have no 
connection to the causes or interests of the 
Catholic Church.

<b>ACORN:  Still Going Strong</b>
<br>A longtime recipient of CHD grants, the Association of Community 
Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN), claims to work for the poor by 
organizing unemployed workers and fighting for laws &quot;that require employers to hire the unemployed.&quot; In the last two years, 
CHD has given $784,000 to ACORN.  ACORN endorsed the Fight the Right March 
and sponsored the Feminist Majority Expo.  Maude Hurd, President of ACORN, 
and Marilyn Ashley, Director of Training, both spoke at the Expo.  ACORN's 
 involvement with pro-abortion, feminist groups is only the latest episode in 
a history of left-wing activism.  <i>Organization 
Trends</i> has reported on ACORN's antics in the past: coercing 
businesses into compliance by threatening legal action, pressuring financial regulators, 
picketing small businesses, and harassing public figures.  Banks are prime targets. 
 ACORN pressures them to increase set-aside loans for favored groups 
by threatening to use the federal Community Reinvestment Act against 
financial organizations that refuse to comply with its demands.  ACORN activist 
Cynthia Mason summed up the group's policy when she said:  &quot;The lesson is that . . 
. when you do an action like that, you know you have the powerand 
that's what its all about.&quot;
<p>ACORN has been fighting for a minimum wage increase, but ACORN's 
leaders have apparently ceased to believe their rhetoric.  ACORN received 
press attention earlier this year for filing 
for exemption from paying minimum wage to its own employees in California.  
As cited in an article by Richard B. Berman of the Employment Policies 
Institute, ACORN supports the minimum wage because it improves the standard of 
living of workers and &quot;employment levels increase.&quot;  However, ACORN 
doesn't want to pay minimum wage to its own workers because, according 
to ACORN's legal brief, &quot;. . . the more that ACORN must pay each individual 
outreach workereither because of minimum wage or overtime 
requirementsthe fewer outreach workers it will be able to hire.&quot;    In other words, 
ACORN continues to fight for a minimum wage increase knowing it will cause more 
unemployment.  ACORN's legal brief explains that &quot;California's minimum 
wage laws as applied to Plaintiff [ACORN] affect the quality and quantity of 
staff which Plaintiff can retain.&quot;  Is the 
Campaign for Human Development comfortable with this kind of hypocrisy?

<b>Senior Citizens Threaten War</b>
<br>Massachusetts Senior Action Council (MSAC) is another politically liberal 
organization receiving CHD funds.  MSAC's own publication exposes 
the group as radically liberal, bordering on socialist.  The back page of the 
MSAC Spring 1996 newsletter is taken up by an ad for &quot;A Forum on Consumer / 
Provider Advocacy Featuring Ralph Nader.&quot;

<p>  
The Winter 1995-96 edition of the newsletter describes the MSAC Convention, 
where &quot;conventiongoers . . . resolved to advocate for a single-payer national 
health care system.&quot;  Kip Tiernan, a speaker at the convention, announced, &quot;We're 
madder than hell and we're just not going to take it any more.&quot;  The &quot;theme&quot; of 
the convention was &quot;`Defending Our Lives:  Fight the Cuts!  Rip up the 
Contract!'&quot; and posters read, &quot;`Newt!  WE 
DID NOT SIGN YOUR CONTRACT!'&quot;  MSAC President Madeline Therrien 
said, &quot;If the right wing wants war, it is war they will get.&quot;  In another article, 
MSAC Vice-President Oscar Farmer describes the proposed Republican budget as 
&quot;fascism.&quot;  
<p>MSAC is not shy about its politics.  Several Democratic state 
representatives have placed ads in the MSAC newsletter, in which many of the 
articles condemn the Republican party or Republican members of Congress.  In 
one article Kip Tiernan complains that &quot;The medical cuts being offered by the 
Republicans . . . will cost local hospitals 71,000 jobs. . . . But it will be great 
news to the privatizers [of health care].&quot;  
Proposed health care reforms are called &quot;a perverse, greedy method of 
re-distribution.&quot;  The article reveals that MSAC wants a Canadian-style health care 
system, and it lauds Hillary Clinton's early plans for universal health care.  
Defenders of CHD deny that this kind of activism is political.  Yet would they argue 
that MSAC is not political?  Were parishioners who gave money to CHD told 
their contributions would be going to support socialized medicine and to fight the 
Contract with America?
<p>A close look at CHD recipient groups paints a disturbing picture.  Catholic 
parishioners are donating millions of dollars to fringe groups that place political 
organizing above charity.  These groups are motivated not so much by a desire 
to good as they are by an unwavering faith in the welfare state.  Disconnected 
from reality, they remain wedded to the redistributionist policies of the 1960s. 
 Even worse, in far too many cases they involve themselves in causes hostile 
to Catholicism.
<p>The Campaign for Human Development is seriously negligent in 
examining the goals, leadership and activities of 
the groups receiving CHD funds.  Moreover, it is clear that CHD staff 
and directors are oblivious to economics and recent history.  Like the groups 
they bankroll, they are dedicated to a discredited collectivist vision.  For them, the 
era of big government will never end.
<p>CHD betrays a trust in accepting money from loyal but unsuspecting 
parishioners to use for projects that most Catholics would not otherwise support. 
 There is now talk that the bishops are considering reforming the Campaign.
<p>The Catholic Conference has been engaged in a protracted search for a 
new CHD executive director.  It is imperative that Catholics make known their 
displeasure with this failed program.  On Sunday, November 21, parishioners 
should drop a note to their bishop in the collection basket, and save their 
hard-earned dollars for a more worthy cause.

<P>
<dd>&quot;Don't go anywhere alone.  Always take somebody 
with you when you're walking in the neighborhood.  We'll 
have bathrooms in the Boys and Girls club.  You can use them 
at lunchtime.  Don't go into anybody's apartment.&quot;  Mary 
Lyman Jackson, a small woman with a marked southern 
accent, wearing jeans and a t-shirt is addressing her troops. It's 
a muggy summer morning in Washington D.C. and a 
hundred volunteers have turned out for  one of Exodus Youth 
Services' urban clean-up days. Mary thanks everyone for coming, 
and assures them that, despite the ominous sound of the 
liability release forms, nothing bad is going to happen.  &quot;These 
people are my friends,&quot;  she shouts, &quot;they're my family.  They love 
us, and they'll welcome us.  They're really looking forward to 
our coming.  This is a high spot in the year for them.&quot;
<dd>She introduces a priest, who reads the gospel from 
yesterday's Feast of Saints Peter and Paul, then raises his hands in 
blessing over the assembled group, sprinkling them with holy water 
in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  She 
urges people to car pool because parking is scarce where they 
are going.  In that amazing process by which confusion 
becomes order, in five minutes everybody is in a van, and a 
procession of vehicles pulls out of the parking lot, following 
&quot;Streetside,&quot; an enormous RV with a garish design on its side.
<dd>The Festival of Hope, 1996, for Langston Terrace 
has begun.  Exodus Youth Ministries is in full swing.  
<P>
<P><CENTER>*   *   *</CENTER><BR>
<dd>An exodus is usually about leaving.  This Exodus is all 
about entering:   Exodus Youth Services Inc. enters the inner city 
of Washington, D.C., that the people may go forth out of 
slavery and into the promised land.   Every Tuesday, Thursday, 
and Friday night since 1987, Streetside has been driven through 
the streets of Washington, D.C. Once parked it is a staging 
ground from which Exodus volunteers talk about God's love and 
help local residents find in Him freedom from the slavery of 
poverty and drugs and violence.  
<dd>&quot;We're an ecumenical Catholic ministry serving the 
poorest of the poor in the Nation's Capital,&quot; says Mary Lyman 
Jackson, 39, the President of Exodus and widow of its founder, 
Rev. K. Logan Jackson.  &quot;We're a 50l(c)(3) [nonprofit], 
incorporated under the laws of the District of Columbia, and we 
focus on serving children and families in the metropolitan 
Washington area, particularly the homeless, runaways, latchkey 
children, and refugees.  Our main mission is to bring the gospel 
of Our Lord Jesus Christ to the poor so they come to know 
Him as their personal Lord and Savior, and then get them into a 
local church.&quot;
<dd>During the eleven years that Exodus has existed, 
seminarians from every denomination with a theological school in 
the nation's capital have done internships or volunteered 
with Exodus Youth Ministries. They have overcome their 
own fears, and learned to love.  One year, Logan Jackson received Goodwill Industries of America's Edgar J. Helms Award 
for outstanding service.  In 1990, Logan was honored by 
<I>Washingtonian</I> magazine as &quot;Washingtonian of the Year.&quot;    
<dd>Letters of appreciation and testimony about Exodus, 
from Episcopal, Lutheran, Catholic, Moravian, and 
non-denominational seminarians fill the ministry files. All have learned 
from Exodus.
<dd>Not all the letters of endorsement are from religious 
organizations and leaders.  Edwin J. Feulner, President of the 
Heritage Foundation, describes himself as &quot;increasingly 
enthusiastic about its ministry.&quot;  <I>Dallas Morning 
News</I> columnist William Murchison has written that Mary Lyman Jackson 
&quot;is entitled to that special awe attending what our sad, 
sordid world accounts sacrifice.&quot;  
<P>
<P><a name="poor">
<B>The Poorest of the Poor</B><p>
<dd>Exodus has written a Streetside Catechism, which aims 
to teach the truths of the Catholic Faith, based on Scripture, 
the Catechism of the Catholic Church, and the lives of the saints. 
 It is geared toward the illiterate and marginalized.  It 
targets everyone older than two years of age.  Written by two 
professors of theology, one at Catholic University and one at 
the Franciscan University of Steubenville, it awaits an 
<I>Imprimatur</I> from Cardinal Hickey, and it will then be distributed 
nationwide. 
<dd>Another Exodus publication is the &quot;Streetside 
Epistles.&quot; These are weekly letters of hope that evangelize 
residents without telephones that the van doesn't get to visit.
<dd>Right now, Exodus is working with over 4000 individuals 
in five neighborhoods: Langston Terrace NE, Adams 
Morgan NW, Morton Street/Georgia Avenue NW, Potomac 
Gardens SE, and Stanton Dwellings SE.  These are areas 
largely forgotten by the rest of the world, with the exception of 
Adams Morgan, a diverse neighborhood with many trendy 
African and Caribbean restaurants.  
<dd>&quot;The only hassling we ever get is from tourists in 
Adams-Morgan, who don't want to see the poor,&quot; says Mary Lyman. 
 &quot;They just want an exotic dinner.  Druggies don't bother us. 
 Usually they come and ask us to pray for them.  There was 
one who was the drug lord in a neighborhood.  He'd jump start 
the van whenever it needed it.  He didn't want us to pray 
for him...once I ran half a block after him, yelling at him to 
hold still so I could pray for him....  He protected us fine.  He's in 
jail now for bouncing checks.&quot; 
<dd>When your clients are so far down that the drug lords feel 
protective of them, you know you are working with the poorest 
of the poor. These are the ones who fall through the cracks of 
other systems, the ones who are &quot;unreachable&quot; and unreached, 
the ones whose problems are so overwhelming that no 
bureaucrat would touch them.  
<dd>The District of Columbia is bankrupt;  these days one 
cannot even be sure that the trash will  be picked up, let alone any 
more sophisticated service performed.  Back in 1986, the D.C. Task 
Force on Runaway and Homeless Youth admitted that &quot;No real 
`system' of services to runaway and homeless youth currently exists. . . 
Services are neither coordinated, consistently available nor easily 
available to those who need them.&quot; And things have only gotten 
worse since then.
<dd>But Exodus gets help where it can. When necessary it 
works with other agencies and ministries in the Washington area 
for referrals and outreach, food, clothing, furniture, shelter, 
job placement and training, emergency groceries and rent, funerals, adoptions, physical and mental health care, and dentistry.
<P>
<P><a name="pics">
<B>The Pictures Tell the Stories</B><p>
<dd>Logan Jackson incorporated the ministry in 1986 and 
with a large grant from the Bingham Foundation of Louisville 
he bought &quot;Streetside,&quot; a large recreational vehicle.  
Originally, the vehicle had &quot;Health Screening and Referrals&quot; printed on 
its side, as Exodus had doctors travelling with its 
volunteers, looking to physical needs while they tended to the soul. 
But Exodus got out of the healthcare business when the 
D.C. Government started something similar.
<dd>The Exodus home office is a rented old frame house 
in suburban Maryland, perhaps one of the summer 
cottages which constituted Old Town Gaithersburg a hundred 
years ago.  It is worn, and the floors are bare, but it is neat and clean. 
 While I was there, a truck pulled up with lawnmowers, and 
a crew of teenage boys began to mow the lawn.  Mary 
Lyman knows them by their first names; they are from a 
landscape company owned by a friend.  Is the work done 
<I>pro bono</I> or for pay?  &quot;I don't know,&quot; she says absently. &quot;I forget what 
the arrangement is this summer.&quot;   Her attention is on the 
pictures that line the walls of the staircase--pictures of Exodus 
volunteers helping kids with arts and crafts, doing puppet shows, 
standing with arms around people, praying.  Sometimes Mary 
Lyman calls it &quot;friendship evangelism.&quot;  
<dd>The pictures often tell harrowing stories. &quot;That boy sitting 
in the Greyhound bus was a refugee.  He had come across 
the border with his dad in a cattle car and gotten separated,&quot; 
Mary Lyman told me.  &quot;Somehow the boy had wandered all the way 
to Washington alone; and one night, speaking no English, he 
walked up to our great big RV.  Exodus found his dad; the picture 
was taken as he was leaving D.C. on his way back to him.&quot;
<dd>The two sullen-looking punks are upper-middle class runaways. 
 &quot;Lots of it is peer pressure, but a lot of it is because of 
emotional abuse.  It's not a political statement, it's an actual way of life.  Once they get on the street, 
they get into prostitution, drug trafficking...  Their life 
expectancy is three years....   If there isn't an intervention within the 
first weeks on the street, they develop neuroses from the 
pressure, the lack of sleep, lack of nourishment, despair.  
They're exposed to things they've never seen before.  They get 
STDs too.&quot; 
<dd>There's an eviction scene, a small boy's face distorted with grief as he watches 
his kitten being taken away by an Animal Control warden.
<dd>There's a bed, shoved into a corner between two dirty walls.  The bed is 
piled high with crumpled laundry.  &quot;Sometimes they just wear clothes until they're too dirty, then they 
go down and get more, because they can't afford the soap 
and laundry expenses.&quot;  Does Exodus give away clothing?  
&quot;We have in the past, but not now.  They can go other places to 
get it for free.&quot;
<dd>A bearded man, with a child in a backpack, looks straight 
out at the camera.  &quot;He was a contractor, but his clients didn't 
pay up, so he lost his house.  He lived out of his car, with his six 
kids and pregnant wife ....  
<dd>&quot;If families go into shelters, the shelters will split up 
the husbands and wives.  There was a case in '88, a woman had 
left an abusive husband, and she and her kids were in the 
welfare hotel with  300 other kids.  We got her into counseling.  
We went to court to get her custody of those kids.  Exodus 
had arranged for a Christian transitional living arrangement 
in Virginia.  The day before the court date, D.C. welfare took 
her kids away from her....  She was suicidal....&quot;
<dd>When Exodus is involved in cases of abuse, they find 
the mother and children a safe place, arrange for medical care 
and emergency money, find psychological support, and then 
a home in Washington, Maryland or Virginia.  &quot;We have 
quite a network,&quot; Mary Lyman smiles.  
<dd>There is a picture of two little girls, toddlers, on a 
bare mattress. &quot;Their mom has HIV, and according to her 
will, when she dies, those girls will be mine.&quot;
<dd>A picture of a little girl with an eager expression on her face. 
 &quot;She was left toddling in a stairwell when she was two. 
 Nobody ever saw her mother again.&quot;  
<dd>&quot;We're child advocates.  We go to local police, courts, 
and so on, on behalf of children when no one else will.  We do 
the same type of work as a guardian <I>ad litem 
</I>in court proceedings.  There was a 17-year old boy who had a heart attack, and he 
was diabetic.  He was at Greater Southeast Hospital, which is 
not where you'd want to be with that problem.  Children's 
Hospital has a much better cardiology unit.  I talked to more people 
than I can remember to get it arranged so he could be transferred....&quot;
<dd>There are pictures of young adults sharing their faith 
with street youths; a young man earnestly talking with four 
toddlers on a streetcorner.  &quot;When the children come to the van, 
we make the sign of the cross on their forehead in oil, seal them 
in the sign of the cross, and tell them `You belong to God, 
you have dignity as a child of God.'  They line up to be prayed 
with, even the Muslims.  They begin to know that God loves them. 
<dd>&quot;We started out being good-works oriented.  And then 
the Lord really showed us that the needs of these people were 
so drastic, the only thing that would really work is Jesus.  Jesus 
is the way of rescuing them from the kingdom of darkness....  
Our primary focus is spiritual, to bring them to Jesus, to 
incorporate them into the Body of Christ, to disciple them and help 
them give their lives to the Lord.&quot; But doing that cannot be 
separated from the work of meeting the material, medical, and 
physical needs of the people.
<dd>In the waiting room and office--once a living 
room--a large framed poster proclaims in bright primary colors 
the names of God: &quot;And thou shalt call His name Jesus, Prince 
of Peace, Mighty God, Wonderful Counselor, Holy One, 
Lamb of God...&quot;
<dd>There is also a picture of Logan Jackson, the founder 
of Exodus Ministries, on a sidewalk next to Streetside, in 
a wheelchair with a headrest, surrounded by street people. 
<dd>Logan had Lou Gehrig's disease, and he progressively 
lost the use of his entire body.  At the time that picture was 
taken he could not even move his head and could speak only in 
a whisper, but he was there praying with them and 
encouraging them.  Mary Lyman nursed him around the clock for 
ten months before he died.  &quot;When you have that disease, 
ultimately you die of suffocation, which is how Jesus is thought to 
 have died on the cross.  He had a very special relationship 
with Jesus, but especially at the end.&quot;  The end came for Logan 
on June 9, 1993.  His wife, Mary Lyman, had been named head 
of the ministry by its board of directors in 1990. 
<P>
<P><a name="logan">
<B>Logan and Mary Lyman Jackson</B><p>
<dd>While Exodus was still recovering from the strain of 
Logan's illness and death,  his 17-year old son, Mercer Jackson, 
almost died. On February 10, 1995 Mercer was in a car accident 
that broke his cheekbone, eye socket, jaw, shoulders, wrist,  
leg, and every rib.  Before the accident, two colleges had 
offered Mercer lacrosse scholarships.  It took a long time for him 
to recover, and it hit the family hard.  But the ministry rolled 
with the punches.  &quot;Everybody helped out,&quot; says Mary Lyman.  
A friend, John Boughton, who had been running a ministry 
in Bosnia, was visiting at the time.  He cancelled his return 
to Bosnia to temporarily take charge of Exodus.  A team of 
girls recently graduated from the Franciscan University 
of Steubenville were doing some missionary work with 
Exodus at the time, and they stayed on.  Volunteers abounded, and 
the work continued.
<dd>Mercer is back in school again, John Boughton has gone 
on to seminary, and Mary Lyman runs the ministry from her 
home and the office.
<dd>Eileen Jones, director of Streetside, marvels at how well 
the system works.  &quot;No matter where Mary Lyman is, that's 
where the phone rings.  If she's home, the phone rings there; if 
she's here, it rings here.  She doesn't tell people where she's 
going to be, they just seem to know.&quot;  Mary Lyman has a beeper, 
and the people on the street have her numbers.  They call her 
to encourage her sometimes.  But they usually call to ask for help. 
<dd>During Logan's illness, neither Logan nor Mary Lyman 
had time for fundraising and money became tight.  They 
didn't know where the next dime would come from.  But it seems 
as though that experience confirmed God's pleasure with 
the ministry.
<dd>&quot;We had a George Mueller experience,&quot;  Mary 
explains. &quot;He started orphanages in England in the 1800s, and he 
wasn't much at asking for money.  He would pray and pray and 
pray, and orphans would come in the thousands.  He would pray 
and pray, for days sometimes, and then the money would come in. 
 So from March to June, 1990, we prayed and prayed, and 
we literally received checks to the penny for everything 
the ministry needed.  Volunteers kept coming and the 
ministry went through a spiritual transformation.  We became 
explicitly Christian rather than interfaith, which was how we 
started out.&quot;  
<dd>The ministry's total revenues for 1994 were $136,016; 
for 1995, $173,501.   Currently, Exodus has two paid staff 
positions. Eileen Jones, director of Streetside, fills one of them 
and there's an opening for an administrative assistant. The 
ministry has 30 regular volunteers. Several thousand others, if 
you count the schools, civic organizations, and parishes that 
help with special projects pitch in over the course of a year.   
And then there are the volunteers in the neighborhoods and on 
the streets.  They contribute a significant part of the work to 
events like the Festival of Hope in Langston Terrace.  Big days 
like that are organized in every season.  
<dd>Two teachers from a school a half hour away came by 
the office during this reporter's visit.  They celebrated the end of the school year, and carried in boxes of mustard and mayonnaise packets, sodas leftover from the teachers' party, and 
a few plastic bags with clothes--items the kids never 
claimed from Lost and Found all year, they said, sort of sheepishly. 
 Obviously, they had been to Exodus  before.  They're 
probably in the category of friends, rather than volunteers. No 
one registered the items when they left.  They were not logged 
in. It is possible that Exodus might have more volunteers than 
it realizes.  
<dd>Occasionally, Exodus has had involuntary volunteers, 
people referred by courts to do mandatory community service.  
&quot;We had a Congressman once.  Then there was this skinhead 
who was assigned to us by a judge.  He sat in the office for three 
days and didn't say a word.  We prayed with him most of those 
three days, and after that, he opened up and told us his story of abuse. 
 When the community service was finished, he stayed on as 
a volunteer.&quot; 
<dd>Still, there is the need for money.  The rent has to be 
paid, gasoline has to be bought, repairs must be completed, the grass must be mowed. 
 Where does it come from?  Exodus is in the Combined Federal Campaign 
and the Catholic Network of Volunteers.  According to its audit report, 
contributions make up the lion's share of revenues, with in-kind donations 
adding about 25%.  The donations come from individuals, corporations, and 
foundations.  Exodus maintains a house list, and about once 
every quarter, it sends out fundraising letters.  They bring results,  
but it's not a top priority:  &quot;If we're supposed to be doing a 
letter, and someone dies, we do the funeral instead,&quot; says 
Mary Lyman.  
<dd>The books show contributions from corporations like 
Phillip Morris and Hechingers, a chain of super-hardware stores in 
the Washington area.  There are lots and lots of in-kind 
contributions, of course.  And some foundations such as the 
Abell Foundation and the George E. Coleman Jr. Foundation 
also contribute.
<dd>Mary Lyman gets restless talking finances.  &quot;I can be 
a businesswoman, or I can be an evangelist,&quot; she says.  &quot;If I 
talk like a businesswoman,  I can tell you we'll come close to 
our projected budget.  We could do a business analysis, but it's 
not going to mean beans, because that's not how God works. 
 When I talk as an evangelist, I can tell you that this ministry 
has survived not on human cleverness but on God's providence.  
If God wants us to expand, He sends us a little more; if He wants us to 
cut back, He sends us a little less.&quot;
<dd>Yes, she knows that there are professional ways, proven ways of 
raising money.  &quot;I try to do it,&quot; she acknowledges.  &quot;But it's not 
systematic.  We don't have a full-time Director of Development.  We 
have volunteers.  I'll get a phone call, with someone recommending I go 
visit someone.  And nine times out of ten, when I meet with corporate 
executives, they give us money.  But I'm not making a concerted effort at it.  
I fit it in.  If I did it, we'd probably have a lot of money.  But the way 
it works, when there have been things I've felt the Lord wanted us to do, 
the money comes.  And when there are ideas, and I'm not sure God wants 
us to do them, then he holds back the money.  The unique thing about us 
is that we pray for the funds.&quot; 
<P>
<P><a name="called">
<B>Called By God</B><p>
<dd>While praying for funds is unusual,  the ministry's 
beginnings were unique as well.  
<dd> Logan Jackson was a quiet man, a gentle priest at St. James 
 Episcopal outside Louisville.  At the seminary, he had 
been known to his classmates as a conservative. In the diocese 
he was known in the same way--as someone not prone to 
flights of fancy. 
<dd>His wife, Mary Lyman was living on a five-acre horse 
farm, busy with three babies, ten Welsh Corgis, and her career as 
a concert pianist, when Logan heard God telling him in 
prayer that he should leave everything and seek first His kingdom 
by helping children. The only other time Logan had ever 
heard from the Lord so clearly was in his calling to be a priest.  
<dd>They could tell that God was softening their hearts.  And 
so they left, not knowing where they were headed.  
Logan's bishop,  however, thought it was their heads that had gone 
soft and offered to pay for psychiatric counseling.  Their 
families thought the bishop's offer should be considered.
<dd>But the Jacksons  were determined. They put their 
belongings in storage and lived in an abandoned Anglican convent 
in Tennessee for six months while Logan travelled around, 
visiting such places as Covenant House in New York City, 
the Seattle Rape Center, and Boston's Bridge Over 
Troubled Waters.  It was there that he conceived the idea of the 
&quot;Streetside&quot; van, and along the way, God told him Washington, D.C. 
was where He wanted him.  So they moved into the city, 
and initially ministered from their home. Logan would bring 
the street to their house, and Mary Lyman would teach.
<dd>They had an office in a rundown neighborhood in 
Washington, but after a while they learned it wasn't realistic to 
expect the poor to come to them.  It was a better use of time and 
money to go directly to the poor.  When they found out that Logan 
was dying, they moved out of the city to Gaithersburg--a suburb 
at the end of the Washington Metrorail  system.  It was 
cheaper, and it seemed a better place to be.  Along the way, each 
member of the family had spontaneously been drawn to 
Catholicism, and they converted as a family in 1992.  For Logan, it was 
in no way a rejection of his Episcopalian identity, but rather 
a fulfillment of it, a way to experience closer communion 
with the Lord whose sufferings he was already sharing in his body. 
<P>
<P><a name="langston">
<B>Langston Terrace Clean-up</B><p>
<dd>A  short drive down North Capitol Street and across H 
Street brings the caravan of vehicles to Langston Terrace, the 
nation's oldest public housing development.  It contains 308 units.  
The three-story flat-roof brick buildings are somewhat 
overgrown with nondescript shrubs, and the playground features 
socialist-realist concrete sculptures and is uninviting. But the place 
is not as littered with trash as it used to be.  Mary Lyman 
offers the explanation that Exodus has been coming here 
regularly for eight years, and you can see in the neighborhood what 
is reflected in the hearts and minds of the residents:  &quot;If you 
know you're worth something, you want your environment to 
look like something.&quot;
<dd>At ten o'clock in the morning the streets are for the 
moment bereft of people.  Exodus has come for a Festival of Hope. 
The day will include free food, landscaping services, and 
activities for neighborhood residents and their children. Teams 
assemble and orders are given.  Blue, Red, Green, Peach, 
and Black teams line up to unload plants from the 
heavily-laden Streetsideit takes a good twenty minutes to do the job.
<dd>A local politician strolls up to try to wheedle some 
landscaping services for Carver Terrace, which adjoins Langston. 
&quot;I'm from the Mayor's office,&quot; he says in a tone of intimacy which 
he expects to bring results.  Mary Lyman comes out of the van 
to negotiate. She explains why she can't oblige him.  In the end, 
she hands him a flat of impatiens, and he leaves happy.  &quot;These 
people are my family, they'd kill me if I didn't keep my word.&quot;    
Obviously she is familiar with the ways of local politicians.
<dd>The landscaping teams start raking through grass that hasn't been cut all summer, and around rusted chain link fences rolled around their posts.  It would have been easy to remove 
the useless chain link, but it required a tool that no one had. 
There's lots of broken glass, but surprisingly few cigarette butts. 
Two local boys, maybe seven or eight years old, ask if they can help. 
 A few mothers emerge from the buildings to go to the 
mailboxes, then disappear again.  A teenage boy and his 
little brother, maybe eight years old, leave an apartment building, the big brother 
adjusting a key on a chain around the neck of his sibling.  They separate as they 
go down the sidewalk, away from the people who have come to clean up their 
neighborhood.
<dd>The work continues.  Mary Lyman distributes shovels, with a warning 
&quot;Don't let anybody get hold of them but you.  We'll never see them again.&quot;  A 
local man who runs a rehab program teaching landscaping skills to ex-prisoners 
arrives with his truck, on which are lawnmowers and edgers.  
The power tools are manned by a volunteer skilled in 
operating such equipment and an older man, who drove a van of 
young folks down from New Jersey for the day.
<dd>A priest working with Exodus is on the sidewalk, 
praying with three women.  Janice McCree, the President of the 
local Residents' Council, leads a volunteer team leader to the Council's offices, which are to be painted that afternoon.  
The Council is in the basement of a building, through a 
padlocked steel grate door.  There are two air conditioners in the 
offices, which run the length of the basement.  One doesn't work at 
all, the other works well, but it drains inside rather than out.  
A steady stream of water drips down the wall and puddles on 
the floor.  Later, when the wall has been painted, the water drips down 
through the fresh paint, and a milky-colored pool collects on the floor.  
<dd>Walking down the sidewalk with Janice is an experience.  She 
makes eye contact with everyone, no matter their age, and she knows their 
names. They all return the eye contact and speak respectfully to her.  
Janice says she has lived in Langston Terrace for 34 years.  Later in the 
day, she shows me pictures of her son's wedding.  He's a teacher at 
Towson State College in Maryland.  Her daughter is an entertainer, 
presently in Spain.  With a son and daughter on the road to  middle-class lives, 
why is she still living in Langston Terrace?  Her leadership and 
influence at Langston Terrace are answer enough.  
<dd>The basement of another building houses the Langston/Carver Case Management and 
Community Building Project, &quot;a collaborative effort of the 
Department of Health and Human Services and the D.C. 
Housing Authority,&quot; according to a posted flyer.  This basement 
is divided into smaller rooms, and features file cabinets 
and tables filled with AIDS/HIV information, and meeting 
announcements such as one for a baby care training 
evening sponsored jointly by Georgetown University and 
Children's Hospital.  Volunteers come through looking for a 
bathroom facility.  There is a toilet and sink, and they take turns 
holding the door closed for each other. There is no toilet 
paper, however, and no towels. 
<dd>During lunch break, the landscaping team carries 
their shovels to the courtyard and suddenly life seems to abound.  Children are all over the place.  Mothers stand in clumps.  
A few adult males have appeared.  &quot;The ones who are addicted 
to crack will be thin, so thin.  Their face will have a gray, 
pasty color to it.  They'll be standing around out of focus,&quot; 
Mary says.  Some match that description.  
<dd>Exodus has barbecue grills fired up on which are sizzling 
hot dogs and hamburgers for the residents.  But volunteers 
eat prepared sandwiches from long bread bags.  Enormous 
plastic bags of cut watermelon and trashcans filled with ice and sodas 
 round out the meal.  For forty minutes volunteers relax on 
steps and on the base of the 1940s concrete sculpture which some 
say is an elephant, some a mountain lion.  The feast for 
the residents continues through the afternoon, long after the 
volunteers have gone back to work.  The Yellow team starts up 
the arts and crafts program after lunch, manning the puppet stage. 
 The drama is the story of the Good Samaritan in street 
dialect, using animal hand puppets. 
<dd>The front yards of rowhouses comprise the sides of 
the courtyard.  Most are neglected, though a few show signs of 
past effortsa rose bush, or some planters.  Off to one corner of 
the courtyard, though, is a front lawn as green and tidy as any 
in a posh suburb.  A table is set up in front of the door, in the 
shade of a large tree, and a family--men and women and 
children--seem to be playing cards.  The children do not mingle 
with those running and screaming in the courtyard.  The adults 
seem to have their own food, their own entertainment.  One 
wonders what accounts for the difference.  That scene of 
domestic stability and contentment is probably close to the vision FDR had when he opened the Langston Terrace.  But unfortunately it is the exception.
<dd>Mary Lyman circulates through the crowds, speaking 
with everybody, greeting most by their first name, familiarly, 
comfortably.  Everybody knows her.  She gets smiles from 
everyone, as do the volunteers she's with.
<dd>&quot;The first time I went on the streets with my husband, 
God transformed me.  It was around Dupont Circle, and a 
homeless man was dying.  I was crying, I didn't know what to do, it 
was my first time.  The homeless guys put their hands on me and prayed over me.  I'd never heard speaking in tongues before.  But that day, my solidarity with the poor started.  The 
poor bring us Jesus.  We don't bring Jesus to them.  We pray, 
we catechize, we do the social worker stuff too.  But on that 
first night, I became their little sister.  I have learned so much 
from the poor, they have given me so much joy....&quot;<BR><BR>

<center><h2>MAKING AMERICANS PAY: THE MACARTHUR FOUNDATION'S PLAN FOR A GLOBAL IRS</h2>
<h3>by Cliff Kincaid</h3></center>
One of America's largest foundations, the $3 billion John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, has moved ever leftward in recent years.  From the increasingly bizarre choices of recipients for its celebrated "genius" awards to the funding of Parliamentarians for Global Action, MacArthur Foundation grants have come to exemplify "progressive philanthropy" at its most cutting-edge.
Many MacArthur programs fund predictable if radical attempts to shape policy and opinion on public issues.  MacArthur, for instance, funds the far-left Institute for Policy Studies ($650,000 in 1993) for the purpose of developing "A New U.S. Foreign Policy for the 21st Century." Other programs, however, have staked out new ground.  One new endeavor is the field of "international governance" to which the foundation committed $1,589,902 in 1994.  It is the focus of the Foundation's Peace and International Cooperation Program.<p>
At first glance "international governance" might appear to imply support for the programs of the United Nations and its affiliated institutions.  But a closer look suggests something more.  A review of MacArthur Foundation annual reports and MacArthur-funded organizations discloses findings that are certain not to please American taxpayers.<p>
 To finance an expansion of the U.N.'s military, environmental and population control programs the MacArthur Foundation is leading a chorus of voices that over the last several years has been advocating the imposition of international taxes on the United States and other countries.  "International governance" has become a euphemism for encouraging nonprofits, governments and international bodies to undertake projects, task forces, conferences, seminars, monographs, reports and other activities that will help build a constituency for world government that will be supported by ordinary American citizens through payments to an international version of the I.R.S.<p>
MacArthur is careful not to use the term "world government" to describe this ambitious agenda.  But the projects underwritten by the foundation, in particular the private Commission on Global Governance, are partly designed to give the U.N. an independent taxing authority.  If successful, the cash-strapped world body would have the wherewithal to become a full-fledged government and it would become independent of U.S. influence.<p>
Of course, this is a sensitive topic that is subject to countless qualifications and preconditions.  Warnings of "world government" are easily dismissed as fever swamp fantasies.  But those who follow foundation grantmakers notice that they increasingly seek to fund "global solutions" to problems that do not suffer interference by national sovereignty, constitutional limits, individual rights or private property ownership.<p>
The MacArthur Foundation refused to respond to our inquiries.  Asked to comment on global taxes and MacArthur's grant to the Commission on Global Governance, Ray Boyer, communications director for the foundation, declared, "We choose not to do an interview with Foundation Watch."  The "no-comment" may reflect MacArthur's uneasiness over previous Capital Research Center disclosures of its activities.  CRC visiting fellow Martin Morse Wooster, in his work The Great Philanthropists & the Problem of "Donor Intent,"  described the foundation's failure to honor the intentions of its benefactor, John D. MacArthur, whose $3 billion fortune is being used to further the goals of individuals and groups for which its founder had no documented sympathy.  A champion of free enterprise, MacArthur intensely disliked government bureaucracies and regulations and opposed attempts to restrict economic development.<p>
Yet the MacArthur Foundation has underwritten groups that are dedicated to more taxes, more public spending and more regulation of the private sector.  The Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) is only the most radical example of this trend.  IPS sympathies for leftist revolutionaries, apologies for communist tyranny, and strident attacks on U.S. foreign and domestic policies were notorious before the collapse of Communism.  The current interest in "international governance" by grantmakers like MacArthur merely represents the worm's turn in new-plowed soil. The impulse to create new international bureaucracies that impose proscriptions and issue mandates is irrepressible.<p>
Direct MacArthur funding of international institutions, including the U.N. and its controversial conferences, is substantial.  For example, in 1992 the foundation directly provided $225,000 to the U.N. Office of the Secretary General "in support of United Nations Peacemaking and Peacekeeping Activities."  It gave $20,000 for the U.N. Office for Disarmament Affairs and $300,000 to the U.N. Development Program (more on this later). MacArthur gave $235,000 for the 1995 U.N. Conference in Cairo on Population and Development, where the U.N. and the Vatican wrangled over abortion policy.  It gave $102,000 for the U.N.'s 1994 Fourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing, capital of a country that controls women's childbearing.  MacArthur also funds the U.N. Association of the United States (UNA-USA).  The premier nonprofit supporter of the United Nations received $565,400 in 1992.
Certainly the foundation's board of directors should realize that waste, fraud and abuse pervade the organization.  The November 1995 Reader's Digest provides a convenient summary of the organization's problems in an article entitled "The United Nations is Out of Control." One U.N. staffer managed to embezzle  $560,000 before getting caught.  Even Madeleine Albright, U.S Ambassador to the U.N., has admitted that she cannot "justify to the taxpayers of my country some of the personnel arrangements, the sweetheart pension deals, the lack of accountability, the waste of resources, the duplication of effort and the lack of attention to the bottom line that we often see around here."<p>
In spite of such problems, the MacArthur Foundation's committment to international governance reflects unquestioning support for the U.N., its agencies, and their mission.  As described in MacArthur's 1994 annual report, the promotion of international governance means "encouraging attention to transnational relations, multilateral agreements, and international institutions crucial to managing and mediating future conflicts."<p>

<h4>MACARTHUR'S  GLOBAL I.R.S. IN YOUR FUTURE</h4>
In 1993 the MacArthur Foundation gave $500,000 to the peculiarly-named Commission on Global Governance. This private group also received financing from foreign governments, including the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Canada, Denmark, India, Indonesia, and Switzerland.  The government of Japan arranged for the Commission to receive funding from "two United Nations trust funds."
Of 28 members on the Commission, two are Americans:  Barber Conable, the former World Bank president who was earlier a Republican congressman from New York, and Adele Simmons, president of the MacArthur Foundation. [See box] The Commission was charged with conducting an "in-depth review of institutions involved in global and regional cooperation."  From September 1992 to October 1994 it held a series of meetings which resulted in an extraordinary report entitled "Our Global Neighborhood."  If implemented, the report's recommendations would end national sovereignty as we know it.  "In certain areas," the report argues, "sovereignty must be exercised collectively, particularly in relation to the global commons."<p>
Most of the 410 page report discusses ways of strengthening U.N. authority in world affairs, such as by creating a U.N.-sponsored criminal court. The Commission on Global Governance is quite straightforward in explaining how these activities will be financed.  It declares that global taxation will be required.  The summary of "Our Global Neighborhood" announces:
<blockquote><i>It is time for a consensus on global taxation for servicing the needs of the global neighborhood.  A start must be made in establishing schemes of global financing of global purposes, including charges on the use of global resources such as flight-lanes, sea lanes, and ocean fishing areas and the collection of revenues agreed globally and implemented by treaty.  An international tax on foreign currency transactions should be explored as one option, as should the creation of an international corporate tax base among multinational corporations.</i></blockquote>
The section which deals with global taxes is only five pages long.  However, these pages are the most explosive.  Americans should take a particular interest in this section.  Our nation was born from a tax revolt and we can be expected to bear the major burden of the Commission's tax schemes. Conscious of this history, the Commission warns that it will not be easy to enact global taxes.  Taxes are generally unpopular and, the Commission observes, "even a tightly knit group such as the European Union  has not advanced far in tax raising powers."  But aware also of the example of the successes of the international environmental movement and the proliferation of U.N. peacekeeping missions around the world, the Commission voices the hope that: 
<blockquote><i>The time could be right, however, for a fresh look and a breakthrough in this area.  The idea of safeguarding and managing the global commons -- particularly those related to the physical environment -- is now widely accepted; this cannot happen with a drip-feed approach to financing.  And the notion of expanding the role of the United Nations is now accepted in relation to military security.</i></blockquote>

<h4>DOES 'INTERNATIONAL GOVERNANCE' MEAN WORLD GOVERNMENT?</h4>
The Commission indicates that it does not favor locating the taxing power within the U.N.  It prefers instead a system by which member states would adopt a treaty or convention to impose taxes worldwide.  Yet it urges that proposals for global taxes be "initiated in the UN system" and negotiated and approved by the U.N. General Assembly before member-states ratify them through an international agreement. Once the specific recommendations of the Commission are understood, the terms "international governance" and "global goverance" make sense.  "International governance" doesn't have the clarity of "world government," but it means the same thing.<p>
In a January 1996 BBC interview U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali publicly embraced global taxation.  He advocated a "light international tax" to pay for U.N. operations.  Such a tax would give the organization "independence."  The Secretary-General declared, "I will not be under the daily financial will of the Member States."  Asked whether the tax was likely, he replied, "It takes time.  I am sure that we will win in the end and that we will obtain from the international community [recognition] that we need to have our own income."<p>
Boutros-Ghali provided additional detail in a January 1996 lecture at Oxford University.  In order for the U.N. to "operate on a secure and steady independent financial foundation," he proposed "measures for consideration."  These included a fee on speculative international financial transactions, a levy on fossil fuel use or its pollution; a small earmarked portion of the anticipated decline in world military expenditures; a stamp tax on international travel and travel documents; or a separate levy on global currency transactions.  Boutros-Ghali added, "Finding the right formula will be a project of vast importance for the future of the international community.  It will be the role of the Secretary General to bring this project to successful fruition in the twenty-first century."
The report of the Commission on Global Governance is careful to deny that global taxes to fund U.N. operations constitutes world government.  "As this report makes clear," declared Commission co-chairmen, Sir Shridath Ramphal, former Secretary-General of the [formerly British] Commonwealth, and Ingvar Carlsson, Prime Minister of Sweden, in their foreword to the document, "global governance is not global government.  No misunderstanding should arise from the similarity of the terms."  But Richard Hudson, executive director of the Center for War/Peace Studies, is skeptical.  The disclaimer, he suspects, masks the real potential that the U.N. and its associated agencies can become instruments of world government.  Hudson, editor of the group's Global Report, wrote, "The possibility of a rational debate on the issue of 'world government' has been muddied in the past few years by the introduction into the international dialogue of the term 'global governance' by the Commission on Global Governance."<p>
Hudson said he asked one-time senior U.N. official Sir Brian Urquhart, a member of the Commission, what "global governance" meant.  Urquhart responded, "Nobody knows what it means.  I was opposed to that name and suggested instead something like Commission on Global Management.  The term governance doesn't even exist in French or Spanish."<p>
Hudson says he suggested to Commission co-chairman Ramphal that "global governance" was an oxymoron for "global government" and that Ramphal replied, "Well, maybe we need some oxymorons."  Hudson may have confused a euphemism for an oxymoron, but his point was understood.  If MacArthur President Adele Simmons and the other members of the Commission on Global Governance believe in world government, shouldn't they say so?  Their report calls for global taxes and a World Court which will have compulsory jurisdiction over the nations of the world.  Unfortunately, MacArthur Foundation communications director Ray Boyer refuses to discuss the matter with Foundation Watch.<p>

<h4>BUILDING INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR GLOBAL TAXATION</h4>
The U.N. has been more forthcoming about its ideas.  Peter Hansen, the former executive director of the MacArthur-funded Commission, was named U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs under Boutros-Ghali.  In this capacity, Hansen gave a presentation last September before a pro-U.N. group, the National Assembly on the United Nations and the U.S.  His talk, "Alternative Sources of Financing the UN System," described ideas for new "money raising approaches" for the U.N. as "very, very persuasive," and he favorably cited proposals for a carbon tax and a tax on international currency transactions. "It is time to take some action here," he declared. Even before Boutros-Ghali's public statements endorsing global taxes, economist Jan Tinbergen was writing in a 1994 Human Development Report of the U.N. Development Program (UNDP), "Mankind's problems can no longer be solved by national governments.  What is needed is a World Government."  Tinbergen added, "This can best be achieved by strengthening the United Nations system."<P>
The head of the UNDP is James Gustave Speth.  As president of the nonprofit World Resources Institute and a member of Bill Clinton's transition team, Speth coordinated the incoming Administration's environmental appointments.  In 1982 he founded WRI with the help of a $15,000,000 grant from  the MacArthur Foundation. In the fall of 1994 UNDP administrator Speth endorsed global taxation.  Anticipating the March 1995 U.N.-sponsored World Summit for Social Development to be held in Copenhagen, Speth declared in a speech:
<blockquote><i>Indeed, we have a unique opportunity to strike some new global compacts in the Social Summit next year in Copenhagen.  The [1994 UNDP Human Development] Report offers several concrete proposals...A global human security fund -- financed from global fees such as the 'Tobin tax' on speculative movements of international funds, an international tax on the consumption of non-renewable energy, global environmental permits and a tax on arms trade...These proposals demand a great deal from the international community.  But they are all doable.</i></blockquote>
The 1994 Human Development Report, issued by Speth's UNDP, was explicit.  It said:
<blockquote><i>...[A] serious search should begin for new sources of international funding that do not rely entirely on the fluctuating political will of the rich nations.  Global taxation may become necessary in any case to achieve the goals of global human security.  Some of the promising new sources include tradable permits for global pollution, a global tax on non-renewable energy, demilitarization funds and a small transaction tax on speculative international movements of foreign exchange funds.</i></blockquote>
The 1994 Human Development Report went even further.  It added details on the taxes on energy and international currency transactions that it proposed: 
<blockquote><i>A second logical source of funds for a global response to global threats is a set of fees on globally important transactions or polluting emissions....One is a tax on the international movements of speculative capital suggested by James Tobin, winner of the Nobel Prize for Economics....[It] could raise $150 billion a year...Another is a global tax on energy: a tax of $1 on each barrel of oil (and its equivalent on coal) during 1995-2000 would yield around $66 billion a year.</i></blockquote>

<h4>THE TOBIN TAX</h4>
The 1994 Human Development Report featured an article by James Tobin, winner of the 1981 Nobel Prize for Economics.  Tobin estimated that his proposal could produce revenues of $1.5 trillion a year: 
<blockquote><i>An international uniform tax would be levied on spot transactions in foreign exchange...The revenue potential is immense, over $1.5 trillion a year for the 0.5% tax...It is appropriate that the proceeds of an international tax be devoted to international purposes and be placed at the disposal of international institutions.</i></blockquote>
Proposals for global taxes were seriously offered and debated  at the March 1995  World Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen.  One leading proponent was France's late president, Socialist Francois Mitterand, who spoke to the conference just a few months before his death.  <i>The New York Times</i> reported, "He supported a proposal to tax speculative international currency transactions as [a] way of raising money for development...President Mitterand...said he had no illusions about the difficulty of establishing a tax on financial transactions.  But he challenged the audience of more than 115 government leaders to make a real commitment." <i>The Washington Post</i> also took note of the "Tobin Tax":  "Another idea, proposed by James Tobin, an American who won the Nobel Prize for economics in 1981, called for a tax on speculative currency transfers to raise funds for development aid.  A tax on short-term currency deals as small as 0.05 percent, U.N. officials say, could raise as much as $150 billion a year  and produce the added benefit of discouraging disruptive financial speculation." <P>
	The UNDP's follow-up 1995 Human Development Report referred to the ongoing "global human development debate" which had led to "concrete policy proposals" on taxes.  It added that these include "finding new sources of funding for global human security, such as the 'Tobin Tax' on international speculative movements of currency or internationally tradable permits for global emissions. At the recent World Summit for Social Development, proposals such as the 20:20 compact [a proposal for international financial assistance to poor countries] and the Tobin tax attracted widespread interest from many quarters." In an April 1995 article endorsing global taxes in <i>Choices</i>, the official organ of the UNDP, UNDP historian Ruben Mendez proposes a variation on the Tobin tax.  He urges that a "Foreign Currency Exchange" be established as a U.N. agency to "generate vast revenues" for the world body and declares, "It is time to make an intellectual quantum leap, and to look beyond the nation-state for new, innovative and independent transnational sources of funds."<P>
	Mendez had earlier endorsed the Tobin Tax in a 1993 report to the Commission on Global Governance.  But in the 1995 article he expressed his fear that the Tobin Tax was unworkable because "formidable obstacles stand in its way."  He explained, "Foreign exchange transactions are often loose and informal.  They leave no 'paper trail' by which they can be monitored and taxed." By contrast, Mendez' "Foreign Currency Exchange" (FXE) would operate as foreign securities exchanges do, but by offering lower rates they would be less expensive.  The FXE would be a "publicly-owned entity" run by the U.N.  A 1.0 percent rate for fees and commissions could generate $840 million a day, he claimed. Former <i>Forbes</i> magazine staff reporter Steven Solomon provides another variation on the theme in his book <i>The Confidence Game</i> (Simon & Schuster, 1995).  Solomon urges formation of a "world economic directorate" to manage national economies and adoption of a global tax on international currency transactions.  The Solomon version brings in $13 trillion a year.<P>
	"Such great sums," he enthuses, "could be used to pay the cost of administering new financial regulations.  Some could be turned over to the Basel club [i.e. central bankers] to pursue interventions to stabilize currencies and to carry out lender of last resort missions.  Some could finance the World Bank for economic development, or an IMF that might be restructured to evolve into a world central bank and seat of a genuine world economic directorate."  In a footnote, Solomon acknowledges that his proposal is a variation of the Tobin Tax.<P>

<h4>MORE CLEVER TAX SCHEMES</h4>
Because foundations understand that no single commission or report is adequate to build support for political change, they fund a variety of approaches.  The Ford Foundation, for instance, which contributed to the support of the Commission on Global Governance, also subsidized a 1994 study, <i>Renewing the United Nations System</i>, by former U.N. officials Erskine Childers and Brian Urquhart, a Commission member. Their report notes that "a range of international taxation schemes" have been proposed, including a "United Nations surcharge" on arms sales, land-mines, the international movement of currencies, international trade, international air and sea travel, and the production of materials such as petroleum and hydro-carbons, and raw mineral commodities.  Despite their sympathy for global tax proposals, Childers and Urquhart acknowledge that, "Schemes for additional financing of the UN are...easy to suggest but would not be at all easy to implement."  Nonetheless, they cannot stop themselves from making an additional proposal to designate: <i>one day in each year as 'United Nations Communication Day,' when all postage charges and telephone calls (and a fraction of broadcasting advertising revenues?) would carry levies accruing to the UN, with special public information on the world organization.</i><P>
Childers and Urquhart realistically warn that for all global tax proposals, "Each member-government would have to agree to levy any such taxes, and collect and transfer them to approved parts of the UN System.  Thus, international taxation revenue would essentially rise through and stay under the control of member-governments."  Cleverly, they devise an alternative that has worked for state governments and Indian tribes, and propose an annual "United Nations lottery, administered by a special authority under the Secretary-General," and licensed by member-states.<P>
It would be a mistake to dismiss these ideas with ridicule or to assume that they are purely hypothetical.  In one key area the U.N. already has made progress in securing global taxing authority.  The Law of the Sea Treaty provides for a precedent-setting Seabed Authority.  As the MacArthur-funded United Nations Association (UNA-USA) notes, "Only the Seabed Authority created by the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, which entered into force in late 1994, has authority today to directly collect international revenues to finance its activities."  The treaty, to which the U.S. is not yet a party, is awaiting U.S. Senate ratification and its prospects are uncertain.<P>

<h4>WHAT SHOULD AMERICA DO?</h4>
One should not take comfort in the belief that Senate ratification of international treaties is a fool-proof block against global taxes.  The U.N. Charter is not entirely clear about how the organization will be financed.  Article 17 only says that the General Assembly should consider and approve the budget of the organization and that the expenses "shall be borne by the Members as apportioned by the General Assembly."  Moreover, the third part of Article 17 says that the General Assembly "shall consider and approve any  financial and budgetary arrangements with specialized agencies..." And Article 29 says "The Security Council may establish such subsidiary organs as it deems necessary for the performance of its functions."  These might well be tax-raising agencies and they conceivably could be established by a vote of the permanent members of the Security Council.<P>
Fortunately, the U.S. Constitution remains a bulwark against bureaucratic inventiveness.  Even if the Executive branch supported a Security Council proposal and even if the U.S. Senate ratified an international treaty, the Constitution says bills to raise taxes must originate in the U.S. House of Representatives.  At least for the moment, it is unlikely that the House will listen to foundation grantmakers and international bureaucrats on this issue. In 1996 now Republican Presidential contender Bob Dole and Senators Jesse Helms and Judd Gregg formally requested the General Accounting Office (GAO) investigate the status of these proposals.  Congressional hearings have been promised by Senator Helms.  The Senators threatened legislation to cut off all funds to the U.N. if the world body attempts to implement global taxes.<P>
The reaction of the Clinton Administration has been fascinating and yet predictable.  Quickly responding to the Boutros-Ghali speech, the State Department issued a strong statement through spokesman Nicholas Burns headlined: "U.S. Opposition to Worldwide Tax to Support the U.N."  It said: 
<blockquote><i>The United Nations does not have the authority to impose or collect any form of tax, and the U.S. Government would not consent to any proposal to grant it such authority. The United States continues to believe that the best way to ensure adequate and predictable funding for the United Nations system is through reforms which result in a fair system of financing, and which reduce overall costs and allow reinvestments of savings in areas of high priority to member states.  An approach to fundraising that involved any form of international tax would be inconsistent with the intergovernmental nature of the organization and could undermine the sovereignty of member states.</i></blockquote>
The Clinton Administration is now on the public  record opposing Boutros-Ghali's proposal for global taxes. But there is no hint here that one of the Administration's top people at the UN, James Gustave Speth,  favors just that initiative.<P>
As head of the U.N. Development Program, Gus Speth has been encouraging the global tax schemes that the State Department says it opposes.  Speth was appointed to his U.N. post at the urging of the Clinton administration. Luckily, the United States is still a constitutional republic, and despite the best efforts of the MacArthur Foundation, the prospect of increasing taxes to pay for the United Nations runs counter to the tax-cutting message of this year's presidential campaign. The anti-tax feeling among the American citizenry is not hard to understand.  And apparently growing opposition to Boutros-Ghali in the U.N. might also delay the establishment of an international  I.R.S. This is understandable. Imagine the reaction of the MacArthur Foundation if someone were to propose a hefty levy on tax-exempt foundations to support a  project of which it apparently did not approve -- such as strengthening American sovereignty.<P>

<center><h2>GLOBALLY MINDED MACARTHUR 'GENIUSES' REFLECT PAROCHIAL CONCERNS</h2>
<h3>by Martin Morse Wooster</h3></center>
<p>
In keeping with a global pattern of thinking,  the MacArthur Foundation in past years has given its genius awards to such planet-minded environmentalists as Stephen Schneider, Paul Ehrlich,  Amory Lovins, and Lester Brown -- each of whom has put international obligations to the Lonely Planet ahead of the national rights of the United States.  The 1996 laureates of the MacArthur Fellows Program fit this familiar pattern. Just as in the past, a third of the twenty-one fellows are scientists, a third are avant-garde artists, and a third are leftist activists.  As usual, conservatives, traditional artists, and entrepreneurs have been shunned.
<p>
The MacArthur Fellows Program is a relatively small part of the MacArthur Foundation's activities. MacArthur awards $142 million in annual grants but only some $7.6 million to its "geniuses."  Fellows typically receive about a quarter of a million dollars for a period of five years, with the exact amount determined by age.
<p>
Despite its relatively small budget the Fellows program generates much of MacArthur's publicity.  Because private foundations make so few grants to individuals the MacArthur Fellows program seems more exceptional than is actually the case.   It would be a routine occurrence if the MacArthur Foundation awarded five-year, $250,000 grants to Self-Help, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Scribe Video Center, YouthBuild U.S.A., and the Manchester Craftsmen's Guild.  But because the foundation gives grants directly to the presidents  of these organizations--Martin Eakes, Robert Greenstein,  Louis Massiah, Dorothy Stoneman, and William Strickland--the grants appear bold and unconventional, even though these recipients will almost certainly use their prize to enrich the organizations they created.
<p>
Though fifteen of the 1996 MacArthur Fellows work for organizations, there's still a veneer of rugged individualism about the program.  "Old John D. MacArthur would perhaps be horrified by some of the labor organizers and activists who have gotten his money," essayist Richard Rodriguez noted in a 1994 article in the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>.  "Yet, there remains about the MacArthur prizes a faith that is deeply Protestant, individualistic, and capitalistic.  Give the artist big money and you will create big art."  Or, as.J. Roderick  MacArthur, son of the founder of the foundation, announced in a 1979 interview in <i>Forbes</i>,"Like the Renaissance princes, we'll find Michelangelo."
<p>
But where is he? If the MacArthur Foundation has made any review of the program, it has never made them public. Henry Louis Gates, Jr., received a MacArthur Fellowship in 1981 as an untenured member of the Yale faculty and free-lancer Tina Rosenberg was awarded a  MacArthur fellowship in 1987 at age 27 to write an interesting book about Latin America. But the Gates and Rosenberg cases are unusual. They won their MacArthurs when they were young and untenured.
<p>
It is  more typical for a MacArthur recipient to be a tenured university professor.  This year, for example, nine of the Fellows are professors, and seven of these nine are full professors, who have tenure. As <i>Los Angeles Times</i> reporter Elizabeth Venant observes, the MacArthur Fellowship "has not redirected the work or lives of most winners with full-time university jobs." Most of the professors Venant interviewed used their MacArthur  windfall to finance an IRA, help pay for the college education of their children, or as a down payment on a house.  Confirming this finding, <i>The New York Times</i> reported that 1996 winner Rebecca Goldstein would use her money to pay her daughter's Harvard tuition and consolidate her debts, a boost for a family with an annual income of over $100,000 and a retirement portfolio "well into the six figures".
<p>
Four of the 1996 MacArthur Fellows are 50 or over, and seven others are between 45 and 49.  When Roy Hoopes interviewed MacArthur recipients who were 50 or over for the AARP's <i>Modern Maturity</i>, he found the MacArthurs primarily served to generate income from lecture fees and assignments.  Some of the people Hoopes interviewed regretted that they did not receive the award when they were younger and hungrier.  
<p>
When J. Roderick MacArthur was dying of cancer in 1984, he predicted that it would take a decade for the effects of the MacArthur Fellowships to be made clear.  Now that it has been 15 years since the MacArthur Fellowships were started, it is clear that the MacArthurs have made much less of a difference than most people expected when the program was launched in 1981.  A few young scholars have used their MacArthurs to produce interesting work and many older MacArthur winners have had a more comfortable retirement.  Yet in spite of the help of more than 1,000 anonymous talent scouts who have nominated Fellows (but whose names have never been disclosed to the public), the MacArthur Foundation has failed to find anyone as talented as Michelangelo.
<p>
If the MacArthur Fellows primarily reward obscure leftists, the lustre of the prizes will dim, particularly since many of the current fellows' achievements are quite arcane.  How many people eagerly await 1996 MacArthur Fellow Allan Berube's forthcoming book, <i>Shipping Out:  Gay Life and Activism on the Great Luxury Liners</i>?  The MacArthur Fellows program is, at its heart, a philanthropic enterprise that borders on farce.  The story is not tragic or heroic, but comic. It is the tale of an unclothed emperor of the charitable world, an emperor now wishing to spread its influence and prestige through the mechanism of global taxation for the United Nations.

<center><h3>LETTERS TO THE EDITOR</h3></center>

Regarding Robert Huberty's recent review of <i>The Legacy of Inherited Wealth: Interviews With Heirs</i>, we would like to correct an inaccurate impression that Mr. Huberty creates about The Inheritance Project.
<p>
Much of this review is to be commended. It astutely outlines the common emotional patterns which mar the lives of the heirs featured in our collection. It is, in fact, the careful analysis contained in the first part of the review which makes the reviewer's logical leap at the end so glaring.
<p>
From among the seventeen heirs included in this book, Mr. Huberty selects three who have supported what he calls "radical causes" in their charitable giving. He takes exception to their philanthropic choices, arguing that "heirs who contribute to radical causes that prevent the accumulation of wealth overcome the conditions that leave them feeling guilty. The resulting condition leaves everyone poorer."
<p>
Mr. Huberty is certainly entitled to his opinion about what constitutes good or bad philanthropy.  However, when he equates the choices some of our subjects have made with the goals and philosophy of our organization, he makes a leap which we find both mystifying and unethical. To accuse The Inheritance Project of "discouraging heirs from becoming true philanthropists" is to seriously misrepresent us. We do not espouse any particular approach to philanthropy. We believe that the simple act of sharing one's resources has both outer value as well as inner merit, the latter perhaps known only to the heart of the giver.
<p>
In writing this book, The Inheritance Project aimed to represent as many different experiences as possible. We interviewed more than forty heirs before we published the book, and each of them described a unique set of attitudes towards wealth and toward philanthropy. Some said they give to the traditional institutions valued by their parents, some favored grassroots causes, and some were too paralyzed to think about philanthropy at all.  We neither judge nor side with any one of them.
<p>
The Inheritance Project has put together presentations on philanthropy for a wide range of groups, from the Council on Foundations to the more progressive Impact Project. More than anything, we are interested in helping heirs to untangle their confusion about their wealth so that they can more effectively use it to benefit others. If that means, in Mr. Huberty's opinion, that we are discouraging heirs from true philanthropy we can only offer our humble apologies.<p>

In Foundation Watch (volume 1, number 5) it is reported that the Council on Foundations is an enthusiastic supporter of affirmative action.  But if that is the case, why do men outnumber women on their board of directors when women outnumber men in the general population?
<p>
More important, why are women and men chosen from elitist circles and not from the rank-and-file they claim to represent?  Because any group that dines on "pecan chicken mousse in bouchees" is not exactly known to associate with the Big Mac crowd. Is this not an example of classism at its worst?
<p>
And by the way, what are bouchees?

<title>Why did a reclusive widow...</title>

<center><h2>
Why Did a Reclusive Widow Give the Washington Opera Eighteen Million Dollars?
</h2></center>
<center><h3>by Shayna Cook</h3></center>
<p>
Betty Brown Casey surprised the nation's capital last March when she donated eighteen million dollars to buy the Woodward and Lothrop department store.  Casey made a gift of the magnificent downtown flagship of the now-bankrupt chain so that the building could be transformed into a world class Opera House by the year 2000.  Mrs. Casey attends the Opera regularly, and her hope is that the new facility will provide both "a world-class opera house in the nation's capital" and "a center for the musical arts that will be available to literally thousands of children in this community,"  according to an Opera spokeswoman. The new facility will seat 2,100 in its main theater and include offices, a rooftop restaurant, and space for its educational programs.  Livingston Biddle, President Carter's Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts and longtime Opera Board member, praised Casey's move, describing the arts patron as "dedicated, committed to excellence in the arts, tenacious and bold."  Her lawyer Brendan Sullivan, who represented Oliver North in the Iran-Contra affair, says Mrs. Casey is "an extraordinary woman who possesses a strong character and an exceedingly generous heart."
<p>
Charitable and cultural contributions have consistently been Casey's personal concerns.  Preferring privacy to acclaim, she had maintained a low profile for years while giving millions to various charities in the Washington, D.C.  metropolitan area.  Her timing has been perfect. World-renowned tenor Placido Domingo was delighted to declare on his first day as Artistic Director, "It's really, really tremendous.  It is a wonderful decision and a great day for the Washington Opera."   Now the Opera will have to raise $100 million to complete the facility and chances look very good indeed. Attendance has averaged 98 percent over the last eleven seasons, and the Opera receives $4 million in private contributions annually from friends all around the world who have spent time in diplomatic assignments.  With the addition of Domingo (one of PBS's "Three Tenors") to the cast, demand for tickets has been unprecedented.  Domingo's singing, acting, and conducting make him "a true renaissance man in music," says Italy's Corriere della Sera newspaper. Newsweek called him "the King of Opera." Domingo has Opera in his blood. As a child he worked for his parents' opera  company in Mexico City.
<p>
This fall the star tenor will star in the Washington Opera's season opener: Antonio Carlos Gomes' Il Guarany, an Indian extravaganza directed by German film dirctor Werner Herzog (Aguirre, Wrath of God).  Excited at the new management and new repertorie, the Opera's education director Debra Blount declares Domingo "is the best ambassador for opera there is."  In a recent appearance on Conan O'Brien's late night television show, the enthusiastic and personable Domingo persuaded the entire studio audience to sing along with him.
<p>
Casey's own life has been in many ways as dramatic as one of Domingo's productions.  In 1955 she married Eugene B. Casey, a prominent New Deal Democrat who worked for Presidents Roosevelt and Truman and at one time owned more real estate than anyone in the United States. Surely she suffered from reminders that her husband went to jail for tax-evasion in 1946 (and was pardoned by President Truman in 1951). After her husband's death in 1986,  Casey endured her own personal ordeals, including a bomb planted in her Mercedes in 1990 as an attempt on her life and a bitter 1993 lawsuit from ten of her late husband's grandchildren from previous marriages over her inheritance.
<p>
Despite the Opera's obvious successes, it had to overcome opposition from the notoriously difficult D.C. government.  The city's Zoning Commission had restricted the use of the Woodies building to retail in order to generate tax revenues for the city.  Attracting business was a worthy objective, but two other department store buildings still remained empty  and downtown. One commissioner, Howard Croft,  protested the interjection of culture into a panhandler-ridden area of the city: "Art for whom? . . . Downtown [should be] for all the people who live in the metropolitan area."  Luckily for the Opera, Croft was defeated by a vote of 4 to 1 on July 1 when the Commission met and approved the building renovation. Officials at the Opera are quick to rebut Croft's contention that opera is elitist.  Opera deals with universal human themes of passion and suffering, and "every culture enjoys music and storytelling," spokeswoman Suzanne Stephens points out.  The field of Opera rewards musical and dramatic talents regardless of financial background.  In the words of executive director Patricia L. Mossel, opera "cuts across all economic and age barriers."  The Washington Opera makes its performances accessible through English surtitles and extensive community outreach programs.  Currently such programs reach 20,000 students in D.C., Virginia, and Maryland annually.With the new facility more students will be able to participate in Opera programs: from trying on costumes and waving a conductor's baton to meeting the performers and attending a performance.  On the verge of bankruptcy, DC schools are eliminating music and arts from their curriculum.  So, the Opera sends performers and docents to some of the district's poorest schools.  According to Blount, "the only negative comments we get from the children is that they wanted to see more."
<p>
Exposure to opera at such a yound age increases the odds that some of the children will grow to be opera fans.  Domingo contends that he can see young people in the audience from the stage, and is constantly searching for young potential artists: he sponsors a singing competition in Mexico City that seeks out fresh talent.  Domingo, described by Opera insiders as "the most accessible human being," is determined to keep the Washington Opera open to its DC neighbors.  He will personally make sure that tickets are distributed to the underprivileged.
<p>
And there is sure to be demand because in America today, the art form is thriving.  "There is an explosion of opera in the United States," Stephens says.  She vows that any non-fan can be converted, no matter how old they are: "My answer to them is to find the right opera."  And if the sell-out crowds provide any evidence, the Washington Opera has put on "the right opera" for many people.  The Opera operates purely though popular appeal to individual ticketholders and donors.  Unlike some European houses, the Washington Opera does not depend on public funds. It receives no subsidy from any state agency, and a $72,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts accounts for merely .017 percent of total contributed revenue.  The example of the Washington Opera has given the lie to  NEA lobbyists who claim cutting federal funding of the arts will undermine the survival of art itself.  According to Stephens, "The NEA has never been a large percentage of our budget . . .we have learned to go about surviving and thriving without it."  Thanks to the sterling example of Betty Brown Casey and the artistic brilliance of  Placido Domingo, the Washington Opera will do its part to help the nation's capital survive and thrive as well.

<font size=+1><b><i>June 1996</i></b></font>
<H2>Why did a nice young composer <br>like Frederick Stocken<br> become the British musical establishment's<br> hated heckler?</H2>
<H3>by Laurence Jarvik</H3>
<p>
<a href="#lament">Lament for Bosnia went to the top of the charts...</a><br>
<a href="#irk">In March, 1994, irked at the realization...</a><br>
<a href="#press">The press was not nice to Stocken.</a><br>
<a href="#future">What does the future hold?</a><br>
<p>
Frederick Stocken calls himself "Britain's most backward-looking composer."  Born in 1967, Organ Scholar at Cambridge University's St. Catherine's College and a graduate of Chetham's School of 
Music, the prize-winning Fellow of the Royal College of Organists is a composer of  organ works, songs, 
wood quintets, string quartets, an oratorio, and a violin concerto.  Stocken is best-known for his lush string 
composition Lament for Bosnia (Chatsworth CD, 1993).  A private commission by wealthy English arts 
patron Todd Longstaffe-Gowan, the piece was recorded by The Strings of the New Queen's Hall Orchestra 
under the direction of John Lubbock, using gut strings instead of metal to allow for a greater warmth of 
tone. The recording session took place at EMI's  Abbey Road studios made famous by The Beatles. 
<p>
Soon he was dubbed "one of the most promising talents of his generation" by Malcolm Williamson, Master of the Queen's Musick. Williamson said of Stocken's composition, "As music becomes more 
complex and unintelligible, it is refreshing to find a composer who is producing music which is clear, 
profound, free-flowing, and superbly composed."  Stocken said that he composed the Lament "not only for 
artistic reasons, but also to raise money for the victims." Stocken and his publisher had arranged for a 
portion of the sales to go directly to "Feed the Children," a British charity which has been aiding refugee 
families in the former Yugoslavia since 1992. In this effort, Stocken combined a commitment to traditional 
British romanticism in the manner of Ralph Vaughn Williams with his own personal belief in private 
charity and private support for the arts. The Evening Standard praised Stocken fulsomely, declaring,  "At 
last a young English composer has chosen to write accessible, beautiful music which is unashamedly 
passionate and melodic."  The Spectator music critic declared, "It is music which makes me believe that a 
new Sibelius or a new Elgar has been born. Try it."
<P>
<a name="lament"></a>
<CENTER><H3>Lament for Bosnia went to the top of the charts... </H3></CENTER>
on a double bill with Samuel Barber's Adagio for String Orchestra, and the set became the number one best selling CD in London's Tower Records by early 1994. Shortly 
thereafter, Stocken began work on a violin concerto, which he planned to dedicate to Margaret Thatcher.  
But there were some clouds on Stocken's horizon. Stocken had discovered composers who wrote 
hummable melodies are black-balled by the British musical establishment. He learned this lesson the hard 
way, after he was rejected by the Royal Academy of Music with the comment: "We do not use key 
signatures here at the Academy." Stocken later acidly retorted such a remark was "equivalent to being 
turned down by an art college with the comment: 'We do not use perspective here at the Slade.'"Denied 
acceptance by the official guardians of his chosen field, Stocken plotted his next move.
<P>
<a name="irk"></a>
<CENTER><H3>In March, 1994, irked at the realization...</H3></CENTER>
that the very musical competitors  who had black-balled him enjoyed substantial taxpayer subsidies through the BBC and the Arts Council for what he considered atonal "modernist plink-plonk," 
Stocken placed a classified advertisement in The Spectator. It gave his home telephone number and read: 
"THE HECKLERS: Too afraid to boo at Modern Music? Join The Hecklers and provoke change." The 
target was an April 14, 1996 performance of Sir Harrison Birtwistle's 1989 opera Gawain. Birtwistle is the 
most prominent living composer in Britain, knighted by the Queen and recipient of an estimated $350,000 
in annual support from British institutions. <p>
Stocken took on this pillar of the musical establishment directly, 
declaring his compositional efforts to be "sonic sewage." Stocken then published a manifesto in The 
Evening Standard announcing "this evening, The Hecklers will rise to their feet, a militia for melody" as 
Birtwistle's opera Gawain "squeaks and splutters to a close at the Royal Opera House."  The event, Stocken 
told Culture Watch, "was a very feeble protest." With about two dozen colleagues, he politely waited until 
the performance had ended, stood up, and booed. The small group of protesters sitting in the top balcony 
were overwhelmed by the standing ovation the opera received from the cream of British society in the 
stalls, the cheering led by no less a personage than the chairman of the British Arts Council himself, Lord 
Gowrie.
<P>
<a name="press"></a>
<CENTER><H3>The press was not nice to Stocken. </H3></CENTER>
He was damned as a "Thatcherite," called a "self-appointed cultural policeman," 
and his group labelled "a group of young fogeys" by Classical Music, which 
concluded in an editorial that "Mr. Stocken and his bunch of halitosis-ridden hoorays are not the first [to 
protest concerts]...it was very popular with the Nazis." On May 2nd The Times condemned Stocken and his 
Hecklers as "The Red Guards of Taste" and declared "Sir Harrison...is the finest modern British composer, 
some would say of all time..." Stocken's support was slight:  a column by Miranda Jackson in Classical 
Music, an elliptical comment by Prince Charles in favor of melody, an editorial in the Journal of the 
Institute of Economic Affairs, and an article in the Sydney Morning Herald pointing out that Australians 
know that Italians boo opera all the time were all he could show in his defense. Perhaps wary of a 
controversy on unfamiliar terrain, Thatcher declined to attend the upcoming premiere of her concerto and 
Stocken has removed her name. (However,  Minister for National Heritage Virginia Bottomley will attend.) 
<p>
Yet despite the establishment's disapproval, Stocken's protest has struck a chord with the music-going 
public. British concertgoers now boo modernist performances. In August, 1995 they booed Birtwistle's 
Panic when the BBC orchestra performed it at the Proms in Royal Albert Hall. Just this April, they booed a 
modernist staging of Verdi's Nabucco -- portraying the Babylonian captivity in Auschwitz -- at the Royal 
Opera House, an incident reported on the front page of The Times. Stocken did not in attend. Instead he 
was at work on a new composition, a Mass. Stocken recently converted to Roman Catholicism at the 
Brompton Oratory where his Mass will be performed. Stocken says he wishes to dedicate his music "to the 
service of the Church" and to private patrons.  
<P>
<a name="future"></a>
<CENTER><H3>What does the future hold?</H3></CENTER>
As Washington Post music critic Tim Page told Culture Watch when asked about the Birtwistle vs. Stocken debate, "If this guy just manages to stick 
around, he'll probably be one of the old fogeys himself, someday."

<p>
Kathleen Teltsch, who covered the philanthropy beat for The New York Times from 1979 to 1994, was 
interviewed upon her retirement by a writer for Foundation News and Commentary, a publication of the 
Council on Foundations.  She told the following story about her initiation into the world of nonprofit 
organizations. <p>
	Herb West, then president of the New York Community Trust, welcomed Teltsch's new 
assignment and took her to lunch, giving Teltsch what she considered "practical, much-needed advice."  
The advice was also in the form of a story.  It concerned the experienced foundation hand who greeted a 
young executive to his first foundation job by telling him, "Welcome to the field: you'll never eat a bad 
meal or hear an honest word." <p>
	Such is the reputation of philanthropy as understood by a correspondent of the most prestigious 
American daily newspaper.  And perhaps no organization better embodies the "field" than the Council on 
Foundations, the premier organization in American philanthropy.  Headquartered in Washington, DC, the 
Council serves over 1500 grantmaking foundations in the U.S. and abroad, helping them learn from one 
another and representing their interests to Congress and the agencies of government.  The grantmakers who 
are members of the Council hold an estimated $100 billion in assets. <p>
	Last month, the Council held its annual convention in Atlanta.  It was called "Philanthropy, 
Democracy, Participation: Work in Progress" and it met from April 22nd through April 24th at the Atlanta 
Marriott Marquis hotel.  The Marriott, a John Portman-designed 1671-room behemoth whose pod-like 
glass-enclosed express elevators speed guests through a 50-story indoor atrium, is home to the city's largest 
hotel ballroom (28,826 square feet).  And it was filled to the rafters when former President Jimmy Carter 
graced the convention's opening ceremonies, speaking to what Atlanta Constitution writer Dan Hulbert 
called "deep pockets." <p>
	No shrinking violent, Carter took the opportunity to openly pitch programs, including the troubled 
"Atlanta Project" supported, Carter mentioned, by Coca-Cola, United Parcel Service, Mariott Hotels, and 
Delta Airlines, among others. Carter also plugged the more successful, religiously-inspired Habitat for 
Humanity, and the Task Force on Disease Eradication, which with help from Precision Fabrics in 
Roanoake, Virginia  has indeed helped successfully eliminate guinea worm disease. He also put in a word 
for "Erasing the Stigma of Mental Illness," a favorite cause of former First Lady Rosalyn Carter.<p>
	Carter concluded, "I hope in the next few days you will consider a few of the things I've said and 
how we, together, can go on to greater things." It was an effective fundraising speech, and received 
tumultous applause. <p>

Foundation Watch was there, too, and found Teltsch's characterization of philanthropic discourse - and diet - to be entirely 
accurate.  The convention's opening ceremonies were organized by the Host Committee for the 1996 
Olympics. The food, described by Constitution writer Hulbert as "a buffet wonderland," was indeed 
plentiful and delicious.  It was organized around the theme, "A Taste of the South."  [See box on page four..]  Foundation executives were greeted by Chinese Lion Dancers and the Hotlanta Dixieland Jazz 
Band as they mingled at the bar exchanging business cards.  Once seated at dinner, they were entertained 
by a program meant for "an influential cadre of out-of-towners" and intended to "create future funding 
opportunities for Atlanta arts groups," according to the Constitution.<p>
	The evening's entertainment was predictably multicultural and politically correct.  Its deficiencies 
in taste would foreshadow the Council's vision of philanthropy, one which would unfold during the 
subsequent days' conference sessions.
<p>        Instead of high culture, Council guests were subjected to high modernism:  the Atlanta Ballet 
performed "Read My Hips," an apparent allusion to President Bush's ill-fated promise to the electorate.  
The number featured dancers clad in black leotards engaged in what appeared to be Greco-Roman 
wrestling choreographed to a techno-pop beat. 
<p>         Mercifully, the duo of Cephas and Wiggins, Piedmont blues musicians, followed for a musical 
interlude.  They did a creditable job getting the notably rythmically-challenged crowd in a festive mood.  
Unfortunately, they were followed by some dreadful local theatre groups, including the "Cotton Patch 
Gospel" which made fun of Baptists.    
<p>        A most remarkable number was then performed by South Africa's Soweto Street Beat Dance 
Company.  "Upiyane" featured male dancers in African masks and loincloths leaping to drum beats.  After 
the techno-pop of the predominantly white Atlanta Ballet, the number provoked uneasy memories of the 
Jim Crow South among some in the audience, recollecting the delight white audiences once took in 
displays of black athleticism and imagined primitivism.  That the sterotypical number was imported from 
the country to which former Council on Foundations president James Joseph had been posted as American 
Ambassador made its selection seem ironic for the capital of the "New South."
<p>        Indeed, had the program organizers not possessed impeccable liberal credentials, the race-
consciousness of the evening's entertainment might have incited more than grumbles and muttering.
<P>
<a name="racial"></a>
<CENTER><H3>THE RACIAL POLITICS OF PHILANTHROPY</H3></CENTER>
What followed over the next several days in Atlanta had a similar tone and texture.  The lectures, panel 
discussions and symposia sponsored by the Council on Foundations seemed bent on purifying the work of 
philanthropy through ever more refined racial filters.  Modern philanthropy is troubled by appearances and 
anxious to ward off misunderstandings that it does much to create.  Hence, no act of generosity is so simple 
that it may not appear to be racially patronizing.  No call for assistance so heartfelt that it may not strike 
some as arrogant.<p>
	For instance, a panel discussion "exploring issues of democracy and civil life and the elements of 
effective civic participation" followed President Carter's speech. [For more on this topic, see Foundation 
Watch vol.I, no.1, "PBS's National Issues Convention."]  This was chaired by Roger Wilkins, who keeps 
the flame of the Great Society lit from a professorial sinecure at George Mason University.  The panel 
discussants were Elaine Jones, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund; Raul Yzaguirre, president of 
the National Council of La Raza; Patsy Mink, a Democratic member of the House of Representatives from 
Hawaii; William Kristol, editor of  The Weekly Standard; Leslie Lenkowsky, president of the Hudson 
Institute; and gaiashkibos, a "Consultant and Technical Advisor to Tribal Governments" who is a "Member 
of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of the Lake Superior Chippewa Indians" from Couderay, Wisconsin and 
who begged the audience not to think of Indians as rich because many tribes are entitled to many billions 
of dollars in legalized gambling revenues.
<p>        Wilkins' introduction of the panelists began with pointed remarks linking "white males" to 
conservative politics.  Of course, there are Black, Hispanic and Asian conservatives just as there are white 
male liberals.  But Wilkins was content to indulge in stereotyping, and then allowed other panelists to make 
casually disparaging remarks about the political proclivities of white males. 
<p>        The racial routine was played out in other panels at the Council on Foundations convention.  
White males were selected to represent the voice of conservatism.  They included Father Richard John 
Neuhaus, founder of the journal First Things and John Von Kannon, a vice president and treasurer of The 
Heritage Foundation. The message was clear: white male conservatives were the ruling class, reminders of 
the realm of privilege that foundations were mobilized to fight.  As such they might occasionally be on 
display, but they were excluded from the real political work of the convention. 
<p>        Nuts-and-bolts issues such as voter registration, dealing with the media, and responding to the 
"Istook Amendment," the proposal by Rep. Ernest Istook (R-OK) to prohibit advocacy by federal grantees, 
were handled in more action-oriented sessions.  Members of OMB Watch, the Advocacy Institute, the 
Center for Public Integrity and other liberal advocacy groups used these sessions to organize their forces 
and plan strategies.  This was particularly true for the pre-conference sessions of the so-called "affinity 
groups."  [See box on the California Civil Rights Initiative on page 6]. 
<p>        If the conference program had featured Dinesh D'Souza, Christina Sommers or Thomas Sowell it 
might have ignited real fireworks.  But the conference organizers preferred a dialogue of the deaf.  When 
Hudson's Leslie Lenkowsky told Mark Rosenman of the radical Union Institute that private grantmakers 
should compensate for spending cuts in federal programs, the audience responded with silence.  However, 
Rosenman's defense of the status quo was praised and his remarks were echoed by many in the audience, 
which included Rockefeller Foundation president Peter Goldmark.  [See Foundation Watch vol.1, no.5. 
"The Rockefeller Foundation: The Big Money Behind Multiculturalism" for more.]

<CENTER><H3>NOT TRUE BELIEVERS, JUST BUREAUCRATS</H3></CENTER>
Reflecting on his convention experience, WeeklyStandardeditor William Kristol told Foundation Watch,  
"It was in a certain way a comedy of philanthropic correctness. I was confirmed in my sense that liberalism 
was exhausted, that they're not true believers - they're just bureaucrats."
<p>        "This is good news and bad news," he added.  "They don't have much of an answer when you ask: 
'Why don't you judge by results?'  But the institutional momentum is hard to penetrate."
<p>        Heritage's John Von Kannon was struck by the way the members of the Council on Foundation's 
mispronounced the name Istook.  "They called him "Ish-took."  They pronounced the name like a Nazi war 
criminal."  However, Von Kannon says he was pleased to speak to the convention.  "I went up to 
[moderator] Judy Woodruff and said, "I want to thank you for not attaching an ideological label to The 
Heritage Foundation."  I even met a man who came up to me afterwards, saying he was delighted to find 
another conservative there."
<p>        The stultifying and politically correct nature of the Council on Foundations has been often noted.   
Dr. Marvin Olasky, author of The Tragedy of American Compassion, has published two scathing analyses 
of the Council on Foundations for Capital Research Center.  A 1985 monograph in Capital's Studies in 
Philanthropy series concluded that "Council leaders over the years have been consistently liberal, and the 
programs they have informally advanced have been consistent with that ideology."  Referring to the 
Council's fear of isolated and un-networked philanthropy by eccentric millionaires, Olasky observed, 
"There are worse things than Lone Ranger foundations - one is a nonprofit octopus." 
<p>        Eight years later Olasky revisited the Council in Philanthropically Correct: The Story of the 
Council on Foundations, the fourteenth monograph in the Capital series. Attending the national conference, 
which was held in Chicago, Olasky interviewed a number of Council members and officials.  His 
conclusion became even more bleak:  "The Council on Foundations' utopian search for perfect systems 
derives from hatred of man as he is.  And this is not philanthropy at all."
<p>        And in 1995 The New Republic sent writer David Samuels to cover the Council on Foundations 
annual convention in San Francisco.  His lengthy article, The Failure of American Foundations: 
Philanthropical Correctness, recalled Olasky's descriptions.  Said Samuels, "To wander the halls of the 
council-sponsored conference in San Francisco is to see the cartoon pages of William Bennett and Dinesh 
D'Souza brought spectacularly to life...A startling shift in foundation funding has occurred, away from 
research and toward the support of advocacy groups and the kinds of social service programs best 
accomplished by government and private charity."  In other words, the Council on Foundations was a Pied 
Piper leading philanthropists away from philanthropy.  
<P>
<a name="blood"></a>
<CENTER><H3>NEW BLOOD, SUBTLE CHANGES</H3></CENTER>
Samuels' essay was indicative of the new critical attitude that the press and Congress were taking toward 
philanthropy. It was one of a number of developments which had a measurable effect on the Council on 
Foundations. 
<p>        The article had appeared just as Congress began debating the "Istook Amendment," the proposal 
to insure that government grants to nonprofit organizations did not end up indirectly subsidizing political 
activities.  That amendment, opposed by the Council on Foundations, when combined with The New 
Republic piece, and scandals surrounding the United Way and New Era Foundation,  had far-reaching 
consequences.
<p>        Veteran Council president James Joseph, a Yale-educated minister in the United Church of Christ, 
resigned in 1995 after fourteen years in office to take a Clinton appointment as ambassador to South 
Africa.  He was followed in retirement this year by Council board chair Marjorie Craig Benton, the wife of 
Benton Foundation president Charles Benton and a trustee of the leftist Bernard Van Leer Foundation of 
the Netherlands.  The Van Leer Foundation  has funded Israeli organizers of "Peace Now" demonstrations 
(as well as Israeli peace advocates who urge Jews to "forget" the Holocaust).
<p>
Those replacing Joseph and Benton seem to be politically better connected and more savvy about 
what a Republican Congress and a "triangulating" President will expect from the nonprofit sector.  Yet 
despite their mainstream credentials and careful acknowledgement of a new political climate, Skip Rhodes 
and Dorothy Ridings continue to articulate a liberal vision of philanthropy's purpose.
<p>
The incoming chairman of the Council on Foundations board was born and raised in Berkeley, 
California. Rhodes is a graduate of the University of California, Berkeley.  He joined Chevron in 1959 and 
has served in a number of positions, including marketing, antitrust litigation, business planning, 
government affairs, and public affairs.  Since 1986 he has been manager of Chevron's $45 million annual 
corporate contributions program.  (It is rated 4.88 out of a possible 8 - a "gentleman's C" - by Austin Fulk 
in the most recent edition of Capital's annual directory, Patterns of Corporate Philanthropy.) 
<p>         Rhodes told Foundation Watch that Chevron maintains an affirmative action program, a smoke-
free workplace, a recycling program, and actively participates in the Ms. Foundation's annual "Take Your 
Daughter To Work Day."  He added that the company was "considering" adding a "Take Your Son To 
Work Day" but had not considered a co-educational experience.
<p>        Rhodes argues that his chairmanship of the Council on Foundations "shows the inclusiveness plus 
the plurality of the membership."  He was on the board of directors only three years before being elected to 
the chairmanship this year. Rhodes took the job "because it was an opportunity to help the sector and to 
help my company."  Mixing with many foundation officials enables Rhodes to "network" and to "learn 
how others do it."  He says the activity of "sharing best practices" is a "win-win situation."  It will "expand 
my education."  
<p>        Rhodes told Foundation Watch that he hopes to rebut the anti-corporate feeling of some 
foundation officers, and he expressed pleasure that President Carter in his address had praised American 
business for its philanthropy.  Carter had applauded DuPont, which provided special filters at no cost to 
eliminate water-borne parasites such as the guinea worm in the Third World. The Chevron executive noted 
that as the first corporate officer in a decade to head the Council, he represented a minority group - 
corporate America - which accounted for only ten or twelve percent of its membership. He said he is 
grateful for the opportunity, but did not know if fears of Congressional action and the controversy over 
politically correct philanthropy were a factor in his selection.

<CENTER><H3>RIDINGS TO THE RESCUE</H3></CENTER>
Replacing James Joseph as president on February 5th was Dorothy S. Ridings, the editor of  Knight-
Ridder's Bradenton [FL] Herald.  Born in Charleston, West Virginia in 1939, Ridings is married to a 
businessman, Donald J. Ridings, and is the mother of two.  She earned journalism degrees from 
Northwestern's Medill School of Journalism and the University of North Carolina.  Ridings has been 
affiliated either as a board member or consultant with four major foundations - the Ford, Benton, Mary 
Reynolds Babcock, and John S. and James L. Knight Foundations.  
<p>        Most importantly, Ridings was president of the League of Women Voters and chair of its 
501(c)(3) Education Fund from 1982-86.  Proclaiming itself nonpartisan, especially when it seeks sole 
sponsorship of the presidential debates, the League spends about $5 million annually promoting liberal 
positions on policy issues under the guise of good government.  Described in 1992 as "just another liberal 
special interest group" by The Wall Street Journal, the League has opposed term limits and school choice, 
and supported gun control and regulatory mandates.  In 1994 it joined former House Speaker Thomas 
Foley in a legal challenge to a term limits measure that was approved by Washington state voters.  The 
action was a factor in Foley's defeat.
<p>        Ridings has promised to make the Council more open and accountable.  Her conference keynote 
address urged grantmakers to be more forthright about their activities and more accessible to the press.  
Why has she made this her goal?
<p>        "The perception was that organized philanthropy was an elitist activity," Ridings told Foundation 
Watch.  "I think a lot of grantmakers have not been media savvy and have been less than forthcoming for 
no reason other than they don't know what to do." 
<p>        The former newspaper executive confesses that some foundation leaders have not welcomed 
opportunities to explain their actions to the larger public. "There are those who say, 'That's not for us.' for 
reasons of family wealth or personal safety, or not wanting to be self-aggrandizing."  But Ridings seeks to 
reassure grantmakers that she is "not saying we all have to march to the same drummer."  Rather, she 
argues, "We ought to talk about what we do.  And the people whose work we fund ought to talk about what 
they do. We really have an obligation to help our grantees tell their story better."
<p>        Asked if a policy of openness, like Gorbachev's perestroika might not bring with it the risk of 
public disapproval, Ridings was confident.  She told Foundation Watch, "I'm a real believer in being open 
to people. It's more risky that way but in the long run it serves you better.  We're in a public business and 
we say we operate under the public trust."
<p>        Ridings says she believes the Istook amendment is a "symptom" of the "overall climate of 
distrust" surrounding philanthropy.  She hopes the Council can "become catalysts for a more open, 
encompassing public debate" about the purposes and methods of philanthropy.  "I believe debate and 
discussion educates and challenges us," she said.  Although she has a "quibble" whether her attraction to 
argument comes from a Southern sensibility, Ridings asserts that, unlike Yankees, Southerners have "never 
been very secretive" and have been "open about prejudices."  Some of this she attributes to a "strong caring 
for other people."
<p>        However, it is in her definition of caring for others that Ridings discloses the attitudes that made 
her palatable to those who named her Council on Foundations president.  Ridings takes strong exception to 
those who would limit charitable contributions to direct services to the needy, and she makes a strong case 
for the importance of advocacy activities.  "One of the reasons we have public charities is to advocate on 
behalf of the powerless," she told Foundation Watch.  "Charity is not just providing services.  A very 
important part is advocating on the part of those for whom you are providing the services."
<p>        "This is not a Lady Bountiful era of charity.  It is not food baskets and blanket distribution.  It is 
not just one thing.  You ought to be able to go down to the city council and say there: 'Charity cannot fill in 
all the gaps.'"
<P>

<CENTER><H3>PHILANTHROPY IN THE INFORMATION AGE</H3></CENTER>
A highlight of the conference was the presentation of the Wilmer Shields Rich Awards for Excellence in 
Communications.  At this grand ceremony in the grand ballroom, the Council on Foundations awarded 
prizes for best annual reports and newsletters, special reports and magazines, public information 
campaigns, published guidelines and World Wide Web homepages.  So that all might have some share of 
glory, awards were made in varying categories: for community foundations, corporate grantmakers, family 
foundations, and private foundations.  Similarly, the size of the foundation was acknowledged under $15 
million, over $15 million, over $25 million as well as the member's purpose public grantmaker or 
operating nonprofit.  
<p>        A beautiful brochure listed Gold, Silver, and Bronze award recipients.  All told, there were more 
than one hundred awards distributed for what were essentially achievements in public relations.
<p>        Each year the Council on Foundations also bestows the Robert W. Scrivner Award on a 
grantmaker "making a critical difference in a creative way"  and its Distinguished Grantmaker Award "to 
honor an individual whose long service and long-term commitment have helped elevate standards in the 
field."
<p>        Oddly, the Council has no award for the most cost-effective grants program that has delivered 
lives from welfare dependency, helped substance abusers overcome their addictions, placed abandoned 
children in loving homes, helped the handicapped, or found cures for sickness.  In other words, awards for 
actually doing good.
<p>        Ridings hesitated when Foundation Watch asked her if the Council might not institute awards of 
this sort.  "Maybe we ought to take a broader look at providing services," she said.  "But looking at awards 
programs, I'm not high on adding up more awards."  
<p>        When asked why the annual convention did not place as much emphasis on serving people 
directly as on formulating strategies for advocacy, Ridings responded, "The members make the program." 
<p>        The Council on Foundations does not need more public relations awards, nor does it require more 
rhetorical promises of "openness" or "accountability." Philanthropy's problems are not public relations 
problems, they are real ones.
<p>        What the Council needs to do is to reaffirm the centrality of service to the mission of 
philanthropy.  It ought to recognize what Bradley Foundation President Michael Joyce has called "a deep 
sense of disappointment, dismay, even shame, at the spectacle of the once-proud, optimistic, and 
forward-looking American charitable sector suddenly going AWOL at the precise moment the American 
public had turned to it with high expectations and hopes."
<p>        Unfortunately, Dorothy Ridings' declaration that "this is not a Lady Bountiful era of charity" gives 
little solace to those who were looking to her for a new era of leadership at the Council on Foundations.
<p>        Perhaps she and Skip Rhodes might reconsider their priorities  -- and put delivery of charitable 
services to the truly needy and the strengthening of traditional charitable institutions such as churches, 
orphanages, hospitals, and asylums at the top of their list.

<center><h3>COUNCIL AND AFFINITY GROUPS HOLD STRATEGY <br>SESSION TO FIGHT CCRI BALLOT 
MEASURE: <br>PLANNING SESSION MINUTES EXPOSE MULTIMILLION<br> DOLLAR FOUNDATION 
PUSH THIS  YEAR</center></h3>
<p>        Among the strategy sessions at the Council on Foundations event in Atlanta was one on fighting 
affirmative action, specifically the California Civil Rights Initiative scheduled for the November ballot.  
<p>        A copy of the minutes of the "joint affinity group meeting" on April 21st has been obtained by 
Foundation Watch. Called "Affirmative Action: What's at Stake," the action-oriented session was 
sponsored by Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders in Philanthropy; the Association of Black Foundation 
Executives; Hispanics in Philanthropy; the National Network of Grantmakers; Woman & Philanthropy, 
Women's Funding Network; the Working Group on Funding Lesbian and Gay Issues and the Council on 
Foundations,   "in cooperation with" the Council on Foundations and the Committee on Inclusiveness.<p>
<DD>    Some verbatim excerpts follow: 
<p>"This is an example of collaboration at its best, the mother of all collaborations,"stated Dot 
Ridings, the new president of the Council on Foundations, welcoming a large audience to an historic 
collaborative meeting of eight affinity groups in philanthropy.
<p>"I am a beneficiary of Affirmative Action, in spirit if not in letter. I am out today as a beneficiary, 
and I will do all I can not to retreat," asserted Cynthia Carey Grant, steering committee member, part of the 
statewide coalition "No on CCRI" - the so-called California Civil Rights Initiative on the ballot in 
November.
<p>        Bonnie Erbe, host of the PBS news magazine "To the Contrary" outlined the context in which the 
current attacks on affirmative action are occuring. She targed the "freelance economy" in which good jobs 
are lost, replaced by contract and contingent jobs with no benefits.
<p>        "At stake is not only affirmative action, but our collective vision for the year 2000," said [Karen] 
Narasaki [executive director of the National Asian Pacific Legal Consortium]. "Will we go back to the 
1950's or embrace the globalization of culture an economy and make it a positive force for change?"
<p>Behind the attack on affirmative action is a broad attack on women by the radical right, said Carey 
Grant. Affirmative action is only one item on their agenda. Who do they oppose? Not the extreme left, but 
moderates, centrists, even conservatives - anyone who wants to promote the welfare of the majority of the 
people.
<p>        Attacks on affirmative action always peak before elections. This is not a socially driven issues, but 
a political issue, said Barbara Arnwine, executive director of the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights 
Under Law and head of the national consortium called Americans for a Fair Chance.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>The Strategies:</H3></CENTER>
	<B>Come together. </B>The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights is coordinating the legislative 
strategy. Asian Americans and women are important in the stuggle not to be divided (sic).
<p>        <B>Appeal to white women. </B>Surveys and focus groups indicate the more they learn about affirmative 
action, the more they support it. Equal Rights Advocates.
<p>       <B> Increase public educations.</B> Americans respond to information. Following public service ads 
conducted by Americans for a Fair Chance (a consortium of civil rights and women's rights groups in 
support of affirmative action), support among white men increased four percent; among white women it 
increased 13 percent.
<p>        <B>Hire the marketing professionals</B> - don't leave the ads to lawyers!
<p>        <B>Raise voter turnout</B>, especially minority and immigrant populations. Go to citizen classes, 
swearing in ceremonies. Support youth actions.
<p>        <B>Identify supporters in the business community.</B> Get your business allies to speak out. Citizens 
Commission on Civil Rights has documented business support on video.
<p>        <B>Support litigation</B> - court decisions are news items and thus public education tools.
<p>       <B> Show the opposition how they have benefitted.</B> Pull up our talented younger people of color; 
diversity is in the lower ranks.
<p>        <B>Use consumer power.</B> Women spend 80 cents of every consumer dollar.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>The challenge:</H3></CENTER>
	The right has coopted the dialogue. How can we get back in the discussion with a unified voice? 
Bonnie Erbe.
<p>        We  need to change the debate from who gains, who loses, to what society as a whole has gained 
and what it will lose. Karen Narasaki.
<p>        Tony Romero, program officer at the Ford Foundation agreed. Grantmakers fear that IRS 
restrictions do not allow them to defend affirmative action, he said; our staff attorneys have assured us we 
can. This a moral issue for funders he added - "we need to put our grant dollars where our mouths are."
	
<p>        According to Fall/Winter 1995 Women & Philanthropy News, an "affinity group" publication, the 
Ford foundation has awarded $1.4 million to 12 organizations to support affirmative action. Other 
foundations "actively funding affirmative action intiatives" are the Rockefeller Foundation, the Carnegie 
Croporation of New York and the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation which have granted hundreds of 
thousands of dollars to the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law for the National Affirmative 
Action Consortium.

<center><h3>LESSONS FROM THE FALL:<br> FOUNDATIONS AND THE CRISIS IN ARTS FUNDING<br>
BY ROBERT HUBERTY</center></h3>
<P>
	Art Lessons: Learning for the Rise and Fall of Public Arts Funding by Alice Goldfarb Marquis 
(Basic Books, 1996, paperback, 304 pages).
<P>
	The names Mapplethorpe and Serrano ignite passionate debate on the nature and purpose of art.  
Can we know when art is obscene and blasphemous?  Should art depict obscenity and blasphemy?  If it's 
obscene and blasphemous, is it art?  Should government officials try to answer these questions before they 
spend public funds on whatever art is?  Why should government fund works of art at all?  And, the 
ultimate liberal handwringer, is refusing to fund art censorship?  
<p>        Art Lessons, Alice Goldfarb Marquis' engaging and instructive history of U.S. public funding of 
the arts, manages to put these questions into an entertaining context.  Her deft and amusing narrative 
surveys forty years of shenanigans by politicians, bureaucrats and wealthy patrons who scheme to spend 
public and private money for the creation and consumption of what is for them a valuable commodity: 
more good art.  The debate which is now culminating in bitter protest over who is responsible for squalid 
public displays began innocently enough as an exercise in high-minded liberal - and Republican - 
philanthropy.  Indeed, by carefully describing how private philanthropy made public arts funding possible, 
Marquis' study implicates it in the scandals that have led to the NEA's downfall.
<p>        Marquis does not begin her tale in 1965 when President Lyndon Johnson signed legislation 
enacting the National Endowment for the Arts.  She starts in the dark ages of the late 1950s.  A time that 
most Americans remember as happy days was for intellectuals an "age of anxiety," a time when televised 
and commercial mass culture threatened the life of the mind.  It was also a time when worried big city 
mayors watched their tax base erode as the middle class fled to their T.V. sets in suburbia.  City fathers, 
desperate for a solution to urban decay, seemed to find one in the performing arts complex, the cultural 
equivalent of the shopping center.   
<p>        Art, music and theater, they reasoned, would attract tourists and new business, lure suburbanites 
back to town at night, and give senior citizens and juvenile delinquents something useful to do.  An 
uncontroversial social benefit, art was good public relations.  So private philanthropy came to the rescue, 
working in "partnership" with public agencies to create venues for art.  John D. Rockefeller III mobilized 
Manhattan's civic elite to plan fundraising for construction of Lincoln Center; President Eisenhower signed 
legislation donating federal land for what became the Kennedy Center; and Governor Nelson Rockefeller 
established the first state arts council.  
<p>        The art moguls in Marquis' telling hardly attempted to answer the question of what art is.  Largely 
ignorant or indifferent to aesthetic questions, they were more at ease developing social and economic 
justifications for art's sake.  And they positively jumped at opportunities to work on the comparatively easy 
problems of finding money for art and developing new ways to spend it.  
<p>    Much of Art Lessons is an almost farcical recounting of the bureaucratic consequences of public 
spending on the arts.  As the NEA budget surged from $5 million to $40 million from 1969 to 1973 under 
director Nancy Hanks, a Nixon appointee, and from $100 million to $165 million from 1975 to 1979 under 
Carter appointee Livingston Biddle, there was a boom in grant administrators, categories, and applications 
(27,000 by 1982). 
<p>        Everyone wanted to get in on the act.  Big and small states jockeyed for NEA money for their arts 
councils - whose purpose is to lobby for more NEA money.  The multi-billion dollar film industry lobbied 
for NEA funding for the American Film Institute.  Dance companies multiplied on the expectation of 
continuing grants, and every congressman lobbied for his district's symphony orchestras.  
<p>        Even commercially successful art found ways to tap the federal treasury.  Since jazz ensembles 
already had ticket-paying audiences, the NEA set up and funded a nonprofit whose purpose was to fund 
presenters of jazz concerts.  The NEA even added a musical theater grants program after NEA council 
member Hal Prince, a highly successful Broadway producer, complained that composers were forced to 
move to California to write for the movies to survive.  
<p>        To be sure, arts activities rapidly increased in the 1960s and 70s.  But the Ponzi scheme of more 
groups pursuing public and private grants was sure to collapse.  NEA supporters, not Jesse Helms, 
weakened the faltering agency's capacity to identify and reward artistic excellence by demanding more 
subsidies for ever more arts groups.   
<p>        One ironic lesson of public arts funding is that it has made nonprofit arts organizations more 
financially insecure.  Marquis astutely observes that artists have been tempted by foundation philanthropy 
and by the availability of NEA grant money to overextend themselves while neglecting money-making 
opportunities.  By becoming nonprofits, the prerequisite for public funding and a mark of status for 
foundation elites, artists have forsaken the main chance - the commercial marketplace.  
<p>        Despite new technologies, artists have been led to believe that the arts cannot be self-supporting 
because they cannot achieve economies of scale.  Living hand-to-mouth on $5000 grants, they take the 
risks while administrators of foundations, arts agencies and advocacy groups reap the reward. 
<p>        Last month NEA director Jane Alexander protested Congress' $99 million appropriation and asked 
for $136 million for the next fiscal year.  These inflation-ravaged figures are a pittance.  But they represent 
the agency's continuing effort to credential arts groups, attract political patronage, and steer private funds 
toward privileged favorites.  Art Lessons does not inspire confidence that the agency can credibly fulfill 
this role.              By contrast, private philanthropy gave an estimated $9.6 billion to the arts, 
culture and humanities in 1994 (7.5 percent of all philanthropy).  A reading of Alice Marquis' study 
suggests that its credibility is also at risk.

I read your story on the Rockefeller Foundation [vol.1, no.4] today.  While we at the Foundation do not deliberately "avoid the limelight" as 
you charge in your story, we did choose in this isolated case, not to respond favorably to your requests for 
interviews.
<p>        Your story has confirmed my initial judgement and that of others we consulted -- that we would 
not get accurate reporting of Rockefeller Foundation positions in your publication.
<p>        Any of your readers who are interested in receiving complete and accurate descriptions of our 
current funding priorities, including our support for arts and humanities worldwide, are encouraged to call 
or write us for a copy of our 1995 annual report. We can be reached on (212) 852-8414 or by writing the

<P>
	We would be happy to correct any specific errors you might care to point out. We did find one 
mistake in the story after it went to press. Peggy Dulany is David Rockefeller's daughter, so the family does 
have a living presence on the foundation board -- even though the name of Rockefeller has disappeared.
<P>
	I was delighted recently to discover Foundation Watch.  As a one-time denizen of the City of 
Light, the issue [vol. 1, no. 2] devoted to the decline and fall of the American Center in Paris and the 
liquidation of its jazzy, spanking new building designed by Frank Gehry was especially appalling. 
<p>         It was also a riveting read.  Your post-mortem account represents lively, no-holds-barred cultural 
reportage of a sort seldom seen in the main-stream press - particularly where international matters are 
concerned.
	Your profile on the Rockefeller Foundation [vol. 1, no. 4] was equally revealing.  The common 
thread, of course, is cutting edge philanthropy run amuck, propelled by the best and the worst of intentions.  
The excesses you have detailed (and the actions of the players you have, dare I say, outed) can be blunted 
only by rigorous investigative pieces such as these.  I look forward to more of the same.

<h2><B><FONT SIZE=4>Welfare Reform in the States: Part II<BR>
</FONT></B></h2>
<p>

<i> This month we conclude our survey of state-level welfare reform
with articles by analysts from ten state think tanks.</i>
<p>

<a href="#nev">Nevada: Private Alternatives to Welfare</a><br>
<a href="#ala">Alabama: Lessons from a School that Works</a><p>
 Sally C. Pipes and Katherine Post, president and policy fellow,
respectively, of the San Francisco-based Pacific Research Institute,
applaud a major welfare reform plan for California and highlight
two charities that offer effective alternatives to state welfare
programs.  By contrast, Joseph Bast, president of the Heartland
Institute in Palatine, Illinois, criticizes recent reforms, noting
that political leaders in Illinois seem uninterested in fundamental
change.
<P>
 Amy Frantz, research director at the Public Interest Institute
in Mount Pleasant, Iowa, and Peter S. Barwick, research associate
at the Harrisburg, Pennsylvania-based Commonwealth Foundation,
emphasize the importance of work requirements for welfare recipients.
 Barwick addresses three criticism often made against work-based
welfare reform while Frantz notes that nonprofit organizations
may help Iowa's needy through newly created Individual Development
Accounts.  This is also a feature of South Carolina's reform package,
discussed by Mike Hubbard, Senior Policy Analyst at the South
Carolina Policy Council Education Foundation in Columbia.
<P>
 Kelly McCutchen, executive director of the Atlanta-based Georgia
Public Policy Foundation, discusses recent reforms and notes the
importance of building public support for changes in Georgia's
welfare policy.  The significance of obtaining federal waivers
to achieve change in Ohio's welfare system is emphasized by Samuel
R. Staley and Douglas Hyne, vice president for research and research
assistant, respectively, of the Buckeye Institute for Public Policy
Solutions in Dayton.  John Hood, president of the Raleigh-based
John Locke Foundation, warns that Medicaid, the nation's most
expensive welfare program, must be overhauled before its costs
overwhelm both federal and state budgets.
<P>
 Finally, effective private alternatives to government welfare
programs are highlighted on pages 4 and 5.  Writing for the Reno-based
Nevada Policy Research Institute, State Senator Maurice E. Washington
describes three faith-based organizations that are helping the
needy achieve self-sufficiency.  Gary Palmer, executive director
of the Birmingham-based Alabama Family Alliance, discusses a Christian
elementary school that can serve as a model for private efforts
to prevent welfare dependency.

<P>
<B>A Promising Reform Plan</B>
<P>
<B>by Sally C. Pipes and Katherine Post</B>
<P>
 Perhaps no other issue in California is as pressing as welfare
reform.  In 1995, approximately 2.7 million (one in twelve) Californians
were on AFDC.  Californians account for 12 percent of the nation's
taxpayers, but support 17 percent of the national AFDC caseload.
 Worse, California's payment of high AFDC benefits--the fourth
highest in the country and the highest among the ten most populous
states--accounts for more than a quarter of the nation's welfare
expenditures.  Finally, and perhaps most damning, an astounding
60 percent of adult (over 18) AFDC recipients in California have
been on welfare longer than two years.  As Governor Pete Wilson
has said, welfare should be a safety net, not a hammock.
<P>
 Debate over welfare reform in California begins in earnest this
spring.  In January, California's Department of Social Services
issued a proposal for redesigning the state's welfare system.
 Devised by Director of Social Services Eloise Anderson and endorsed
by the governor, it is the most promising welfare reform plan
in recent state history.  However, it relies on the President
signing into law block grant legislation to end the fundamentally
flawed federal welfare system.
<P>
 Ms. Anderson notes that the single most important element of
reform is a reduction in welfare payments.  To a large extent,
California's history of high AFDC benefits is responsible for
the entrenched cycle of poverty that many now decry.  The Governor's
reform package would introduce a &quot;flat grant&quot; to replace
the current system of sliding benefits.  This would have four
main elements:
<P>
<ul>
 <li>Benefit levels would be lowered and one standard payment set,
based on equity for lowincome families.  Welfare would not pay
more than work.
<P>
 <li>The grant would be flat, i.e., not adjusted for any increase
in the number of adults or children in the household.  It would
thus restore the principle of personal responsibility and establish
fairness, since working families do not receive wage increases
when they have more children.
<P>
 <li>Eligibility would be timelimited, encouraging recipients to
view welfare as a temporary handup rather than as a career path.
<P>
 <li>The grant would eliminate eligibility requirements that make
aid available only when one parent is deceased, disabled, missing,
or unemployed.  Eligibility would instead be based on a simple
income and asset test, as well as on the presence of a child under
18 years of age.  This would hopefully restore the state's endorsement
of the traditional two-parent family.
</ul>
<P>
 A second key component of the governor's plan is a set of four
programs designed to move recipients from welfare into the labor
force.  Two of these seek to move families toward independence
as quickly as possible.  One sets a twoyear limit on aid, and
the other, for persons with little or no previous job history,
sets a fiveyear limit but provides noncash benefits such as vouchers.
 The other two programs address the needs of those who face the
greatest barriers to independence.  One, for families with a disabled
child or parent, provides aid for the duration of the disability.
 The other provides unlimited assistance for children living with
relatives in lieu of foster care, but puts a twoyear limit on
aid for parents who are themselves ineligible for aid.
<P>
 While these proposals sound promising, California's welfare record
is far from outstanding.  The state has been fundamentally unable
to respond to the particularities of individual cases.  Herein
lies an opportunity for philanthropic alternatives.  Pacific Research
Institute's 1995 privatization competition, titled &quot;Beyond
the Welfare State: Celebrating Private Initiative in Social Services,&quot;
examined social-service programs that receive less than 25 percent
of their funding from government.  We found programs throughout
California that were meeting human needs in meaningful ways without
relying on the state for funds or oversight.  Two programs in
particular stood out:
<P><ul>
 <li>Chrysalis: Jobs for L.A.'s Homeless, is a nonprofit group in
Los Angeles that helps the homeless become economically selfsufficient
through steady jobs.  Its mission states that &quot;Chrysalis
doesn't give people jobs.  We teach them how to find jobs themselves,
by providing intensive classroom instruction and the simple resources
they need to find work.&quot;  Resources include resume assistance,
personal-case managers, bus fare to interviews, a mail and message
center, a set of interview clothes, and food and hygiene items.
 By the end of 1995, Chrysalis had helped almost 3,000 homeless
people find fulltime jobs in the private sector.  It did so with
no government funding.
<P>
 <li>The Redwood Gospel Mission, a 30-year-old faith-based organization
located in a small town in Northern California, likewise shares
a commitment to the ideals of personal responsibility and selfsufficiency.
 It is the only 24hour, fullservice shelter and recovery facility
in a fourcounty area, providing 6,116 hot meals and 2,256 beds
in a typical month.  With the aim of &quot;teach[ing] men how
to fish,&quot; it offers both practical and spiritual support.
 Its tough-love approach has a proven record of moving residents
into society as productive, independent adults.  Like Chrysalis,
it neither accepts nor solicits government money.
</ul><P>
 Welfare reform in California must be a partnership between public
and private assistance, with the common goal of restoring personal
responsibility and selfsufficiency.  This is not simply an economic
necessity, but a social imperative.  The governor's plan offers
dramatic steps to reform welfare, but we must emphasize the importance
of private efforts that are successfully addressing the critical
and massive problem of repairing the damage done by the welfare
state.  Private programs offer powerful, individual-oriented approaches
that no government initiative can match.
<P>

<P>
<B>Behind the Curve</B>
<P>
<B>by Joseph Bast</B>
<P>
 Efforts to reform welfare in Illinois have taken three forms:
steps that are too small, throwing good money after bad, and reshuffling
bureaucracies.  In 1994, Governor James Edgar proposed enrolling
Medicaid beneficiaries in a $5-billion-a-year state-run health
maintenance organization.  Many observers questioned whether the
state was competent to run such an enormous new program.  A proposal
to issue health-care vouchers to the needy, redeemable by an array
of private insurance companies, was dismissed as too radical.
<P>
 Recent attempts to reform the Department of Children and Family
Services, the chief child welfare agency in Illinois, are also
fundamentally flawed.  Rather than reconsider the agency's far-reaching
mandate, and perhaps return it to its original mission of enforcing
child abuse laws and inspecting foster homes and other child-care
facilities, the state has poured hundreds of millions of dollars
into new computers, caseworkers, and consultants.  The result
has been even longer delays in placing children into safe homes
and more children returned to abusive parents.
<P>
 In his 1996 State of the State Address, Governor Edgar proposed
creating a welfare super-agency by merging seven cabinet-level
agencies and many other boards, commissions, and programs.  A
background paper distributed by his office noted that such consolidation
would mend the &quot;fractured&quot; state of current welfare
services and allow the government to &quot;focus on the entire
person or family unit and their needs.&quot;
<P>
 While there is certainly a need to consolidate--and scale back--the
state's welfare leviathan, other reforms could generate much greater
benefits more quickly:
<P><ul>
 <li>Issue health-care vouchers that would give the needy a wider
choice of medical providers and insurers.
<P>
 <li>Turn the care of abused and neglected children over to private
agencies that have a better track record of placing children into
safe and stable homes.
<P>
 Two reforms of AFDC would also produce immediate positive results:
<P>
 <li>Limit eligibility to two years, rather than offer the current
lifetime entitlement.
<P>
<li>Remove from the rolls all those who fail to report to state
offices when told to do so.  In November 1995, fewer than half
of 8,000 recipients responded to a call-in for a job-training
workshop--and half of those who responded failed to attend a follow-up
meeting.  Those 6,000 recipients who did not fulfill even the
simple obligation to attend these meetings should be dropped from
the rolls.</ul>
<P>
 The key to welfare reform in Illinois may lie in <I>Building
Communities from the Inside Out</I>, a new book by John P. Kretzmann
and John L. McKnight of Northwestern University's Center for Urban
Affairs and Policy Research.  The authors call for replacing government
programs with &quot;capacity-focused development&quot; driven
largely by private community-based  organizations.  The role of
government, write Kretzmann and McKnight, should be to gather
data on the capacity of the community and remove barriers to job
creation.  Other researchers have noted how Illinois' zoning laws,
occupational licensing laws, corrupt and under-performing public
school system, and politicized economic development program have
reduced job creation and income growth, undermined local self-improvement
efforts, and contributed to welfare dependency.
<P>
 Unfortunately, Illinois' current crop of elected officials--both
Democratic and Republican--is conspicuously lacking the vision
needed to dismantle the state's welfare complex.  As a result,
Illinoisans will carry a costly and counterproductive welfare
burden into the foreseeable future.

<B>Investing in Families</B>
<P>
<B>by Amy Frantz</B>
<P>
 In 1993, the Iowa state legislature enacted a welfare reform
program designed to help welfare recipients become self-sufficient.
 With several waivers from the federal government, AFDC was replaced
with the Family Investment Program (FIP).  FIP provides cash benefits
to participants based on their assets, income, and family size.
 Participants may also be eligible for Medicare, food stamps,
and other assistance.
<P>
 FIP participants must sign a contract, called the Family Investment
Agreement, in which they promise to participate in Iowa's employment
program, Promise Jobs.  This is administered by several state
agencies, including the departments of human services, employment
services, and economic development.  Services provided by Promise
Jobs include education and job training, resume writing, and interviewing
techniques.
<P>
 Each participant must meet with a caseworker, who helps identify
the individual's work and educational background, child-care and
transportation needs, and barriers to work.  After identifying
steps that must be taken to become self-sufficient, the contract
is negotiated by the participant and caseworker.  The participant
must agree to meet a timetable for achieving self-sufficiency.
 The state agrees to offer assistance in exchange.  Those who
fail to make progress toward self-sufficiency due to circumstances
beyond their control, such as the absence of child care, may renegotiate
their contracts.
<P>
 Exemptions to the Promise Jobs program include the disabled,
those with children under three months of age, and those already
working at least 30 hours per week in unsubsidized employment.
 Parents under the age of 19 who have not completed high school
or an equivalent must pursue their diplomas to receive benefits,
regardless of the age of their children.
<P>
 Those who refuse to sign a Family Investment Agreement must enter
a Limited Benefit Plan.  This pays reduced benefits for three
months, then terminates all benefits.  Individuals and any other
household members affected by a cut-off are ineligible for benefits
for six months.  After that time, they may negotiate a Family
Investment Agreement.  However, if they do not earnestly try to
become self-sufficient, benefits are terminated again for six
months.
<P>
 According to the Iowa Department of Human Services, the number
of families participating in the Family Investment Program fell
from 36,583 in October 1993, when the program was implemented,
to 33,091 by February 1996.  In addition, the percentage of families
participating in FIP who have at least one employed member increased
from 18 percent in 1993 to 33 percent by early 1996.  This success
is likely attributable to individuals' helping to tailor their
own self-sufficiency plans and to the reduction or termination
of benefits for those unwilling to pursue self-sufficiency.
<P>
 Iowa has also created programs that allow private organizations
to help those in the Family Investment Program.  One of these
is the Individual Development Account (IDA) pilot program.  IDAs
are held by low-income individuals and can be used for post-secondary
education, the purchase of a home, or starting a small business.
 They are opened with private banks and managed by community-based
organizations.  In addition to funds that individuals contribute
to their IDAs, community-based organizations can provide matching
funds.

<B>Changing Welfare by Requiring Work</B>
<P>
<B>by Peter S. Barwick</B>
<P>
 The single most important and politically feasible step that
can be taken to reform welfare in Pennsylvania is to impose up-front
work requirements on all able-bodied recipients.  The state must
enact this change if it is serious about helping welfare recipients
achieve long-term self-sufficiency.
<P>
 Governor Tom Ridge recently unveiled a welfare reform plan that
moves in this direction, but it does not go far enough.  For a
better example of how to use welfare to promote work, Pennsylvania's
policymakers should consider the Full Employment model, first
developed in Oregon.  This approach takes money already allocated
for the three largest welfare programs--AFDC, Food Stamps, and
Unemployment Insurance (UI)--and uses it to subsidize jobs for
welfare recipients in the private sector.
<P>
 Full Employment legislation, known as JOBS Plus, was passed by
the Oregon legislature in 1993, and has operated on a pilot basis
for the past two years.  Because of its impressive results in
reducing both welfare costs and caseloads, the legislature voted
last year to implement JOBS Plus statewide.  The Oregon model
has been influential in shaping reform in nearly a dozen states
to date, including Arizona, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Tennessee,
Virginia, and Wisconsin.
<P>
 Participation in JOBS Plus is required of virtually everyone
who qualifies for AFDC, Food Stamps, or UI.  Participants initially
receive help in finding regular full-time jobs.  Those unable
to find traditional employment are placed in subsidized jobs with
private-sector employers, who are reimbursed by the state for
the minimum wage plus the employers' share of social security,
unemployment insurance, and workers' compensation premiums.  Subsidized
jobs are temporary, lasting four months, with an optional two-month
extension.  Child care and health care are available to all participants.
<P>
 The benefits of JOBS Plus are numerous.  Most importantly, it
recognizes that work requirements are essential to helping the
poor escape from dependency and enter mainstream society.  As
today's welfare system so clearly shows, without the salutary
influence of employment, self-destructive and anti-social patterns
of behavior are often left unchecked, resulting in the degradation
and destruction of welfare recipients' lives.
<P>
 Other benefits of the Full Employment approach include:
<P><ul>
 <li>Providing participants with practical work experience;
<P>
 <li>Involving the business community in the fight to reduce poverty;
<P>
 <li>Eliminating the perverse incentives of the current welfare
system, which reward non-work and penalize work;
<P>
 <li>Eliminating fraud perpetuated by those who collect benefits
while simultaneously earning unreported income.</ul>
<P>
 Despite offering clear benefits, work-based welfare reform raises
important questions.  Foremost among these is how it will affect
the family.  Some critics, noting that most of those on welfare
are unmarried mothers with children, argue that putting these
women to work will further erode the family by separating mothers
from their children--children who lack the presence of fathers
to begin with.  This concern, while valid, must be weighed against
the danger of children learning habits of dependency from mothers
who have no constructive goals.  If our experience with welfare
over the past 30 years is any guide, the harm resulting from welfare
dependency is far worse--both for welfare recipients and society
in general--than the harm of separating children from their mothers
during the working day.
<P>
 A related concern is the impact of work-based welfare on family
formation.  Some critics believe that work requirements may discourage
marriage by enabling unmarried women to earn enough income to
stay unmarried.  This concern also has validity, but it does not
change the fact that as long as welfare exists, benefits must--for
the good of those receiving them--be linked with work requirements.
 Furthermore, by making welfare less attractive, work requirements
may actually encourage single mothers to marry.
<P>
 Finally, some believe that work-based welfare does little to
help participants achieve self-sufficiency because it places them
in dead-end, low-wage jobs.  These critics view work-based reform
as a thinly disguised attempt to provide business with a pool
of cheap labor.  This criticism is misplaced for two reasons.
 First, Full Employment programs actually require a great deal
from employers.  Under JOBS Plus, employers must provide participants
with on-the-job training and mentors to assist them in learning
the personal and job-related skills necessary for success in the
workplace.  They must also contribute funds to an education account
for each employee.  Second, since poverty often stems from a non-existent
work ethic, putting the needy to work will help them learn positive
habits such as perseverance and punctuality which are necessary
for achieving self-sufficiency.

<P>
<B>Headed in the Right Direction</B>
<P>
<B>by Mike Hubbard</B>
<P>
 South Carolina has joined a growing number of states that have
enacted major welfare reform.  Last year, the General Assembly
passed the Family Independence Act, requiring the South Carolina
Department of Social Services to reorient its mission from distributing
welfare checks to helping welfare recipients find jobs.
<P>
 To implement several proposed reforms, the federal government
must give South Carolina waivers from certain federal laws and
regulations.  Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration is fighting
the state over most of these, delaying the full impact of reform.
<P>
 Nonetheless, the Family Independence Act is a good step in the
right direction.  Among its provisions:
<P><UL>
 <li>&quot;Success&quot; for state agencies is defined as a shrinking
caseload and an increase in the number of recipients placed in
jobs.
<P>
<li>New welfare applications are not processed unless applicants
can prove they have been looking for work.
<P>
<li>The state helps recipients relocate to areas with better job
opportunities.
<P>
<li>Employers are given a tax credit for hiring and maintaining
recipients.
<P>
<li>Benefits are limited to 24 consecutive months, and 60 months
in a lifetime.  Exceptions are made for those truly unable to
work.
<P>
 <li>Mothers who give birth to children showing evidence of maternal
substance abuse are ineligible for AFDC unless they submit to
drug testing and/or undergo treatment.
<P>
<li>Teenage unwed mothers must live with a parent or guardian,
unless doing so would jeopardize their safety or that of their
children.
<P>
<li>The Department of Social Services must eliminate its &quot;no
daddy&quot; rule, thereby making two-parent welfare families eligible
for programs in financial planning, parenting, and the like.
<P>
 <li>Individual Development Accounts are created, encouraging families
to save money for a small business or home.
<P>
 <li>Drivers licenses, hunting and fishing licenses, and professional
licenses are revoked if fathers fail to pay child support.</ul>
<P>
 In addition, a federal rule that requires state welfare agencies
to keep a large portion of each child support payment is revoked
under the Family Independence Act.  All child support will be
passed on to mothers and their children.
<P>
 South Carolina has also sought to involve nonprofits and businesses
in welfare reform.  The Job Training and Partnership Act provides
funds to private organizations that teach job skills.  The future
of welfare in South Carolina will rely increasingly on such private
initiatives.

<B>Making Progress</B>
<P>
<B>by Kelly McCutchen</B>
<P>
 Many of the welfare reforms implemented in Georgia in recent
years lack the boldness of initiatives in other states and contain
too many exceptions to be truly effective.  However, Governor
Zell Miller's most recent reforms, combined with a thriving state
economy, appear to be having a positive effect.  From August 1994
through July 1995, the number of families on welfare decreased
by 6,000, from 141,000 to 135,000.
<P>
 Probably the greatest problem facing Georgia's welfare system
is the state's illegitimacy rate, among the highest in the nation.
 Georgia has enacted two reforms designed to discourage out-of-wedlock
births:
<P><ul>
 <li>In 1994, it began to deny benefits to unwed teen mothers who
choose to live on their own.  The following year, the number of
teen mothers living independently dropped by 50 percent.
<P>
 <li>As of 1996, it no longer increases benefits to welfare recipients
who have additional children.  Although it is too early to judge
the success of Georgia's &quot;family cap,&quot; a similar policy
in New Jersey has shown favorable results.</ul>
<P>
 Georgia also recently enacted three reforms intended to encourage
work:<UL>
<P>
 <li>Able-bodied welfare recipients who quit or refuse to take full-time
jobs face a reduction in benefits.
<P>
 <li>In a pilot project in ten counties, able-bodied recipients
are required to work 20 hours per month in assigned jobs at government
or nonprofit agencies.
<P>
 <li>The newest initiative, Work First, seeks to change the character
of welfare in Georgia from income maintenance to employment. 
The state is advising social workers that finding jobs for recipients
is their number one objective.  It is also offering businesses
tax credits and subsidies, giving them an incentive to hire and
train welfare recipients.</ul>
<P>
 Public support is vital to achieving any controversial change
in public policy.  To better gauge public opinion on welfare reform,
the Georgia Public Policy Foundation (GPPF) conducted a statewide
survey of registered voters in December 1994.  We found strong
support for many fundamental reforms.  Surprisingly, support was
uniform across racial and party lines:
<P><UL>
 <li>Nine out of ten Georgia voters support requiring unwed mothers
on welfare to name the fathers of their children.
<P>
 <br>Nine out of ten favor requiring able-bodied recipients to work
40 hours per week.
<P>
 <li>By a better than 5-to-1 margin, Georgia voters support limiting
welfare payments so that recipients cannot receive more than those
working at minimum-wage jobs.
<P>
 <li>A majority favor allowing recipients to be paid less than the
minimum wage to increase the likelihood that they will look for
work.</ul>
<P>
 GPPF supports three key elements of welfare reform:
<P><ul>
 <li> <I>Establish paternity at birth</I>.  Georgia has had great
success in recovering child-support payments.  As one of the first
states to privatize child-support collection, Georgia now ranks
sixth in the nation in removing families from welfare by finding
fathers and making them support their children.  The state must
send a clear message to teenage boys that they will be held financially
responsible for any children they engender.
<P>
 <li><I>Reduce benefits</I>.  Welfare recipients should not be better
off than those who work.  According to the Cato Institute, the
wage equivalent of the overall welfare benefits received by a
Georgia mother with two children greatly exceeds the amount most
Georgians earn in entry-level jobs.  Their benefits total $8.37
per hour, the equivalent of a $17,400 annual salary.
<P>
 <li><I>Require work</I>.  Welfare recipients must not be allowed
to stay at home and collect benefits.  We must return to a system
that expects a full day's work in return for assistance.</ul>
<P>
 Although these steps are important, effective reform must go
beyond establishing paternity, reducing benefits, and requiring
work.  Most welfare recipients face tough problems that they cannot
solve on their own, and experience shows that one-size-fits-all
government programs will not promote self-sufficiency.  When government
moved into social welfare, other institutions--families, businesses,
churches, and charities--were shunted aside.  They must once again
assume primary roles.
<P>
 Worthwhile organizations must be identified.  GPPF is currently
working with Robert Woodson of the National Center for Neighborhood
Enterprise to identify grassroots organizations in Georgia that
have a proven record of helping the needy achieve self-sufficiency.
 These groups, including the Georgia-based Habitat for Humanity,
will form the foundation for effective alternatives to government
programs.
<P>
 A successful approach to welfare reform requires a balance of
compassion, fairness, and common sense.  It would be an easy but
tragic mistake to simply transfer federal programs to the states.
 Instead, Georgia will create welfare reform approaches that work
by requiring more responsibility from the needy and by engaging
an active citizenry in the &quot;tough love&quot; initiatives
of local organizations.

<P>
<B>From Welfare to Work</B>
<P>
<B>by Samuel R. Staley and Douglas Hyne</B>
<P>
 Welfare spending rose dramatically in Ohio during the 1980s.
 As a result, the state has either scaled back, restructured,
or eliminated several welfare programs.  General Assistance, which
gave over $100 per month to more than 146,000 able-bodied adults
in 1991, began to be phased out in 1992 and was eliminated in
1995.  This has already saved the state $900 million since the
phase-out began and should save an additional $885 million over
the next four years.
<P>
 Ohio has also implemented the federally mandated Job Opportunities
and Basic Skills (JOBS) program.  This requires a large number
of welfare recipients to enroll in job-training programs.  Refusal
to participate results in a loss of welfare benefits.
<P>
 A recent federal waiver also allows Ohio to require recipients
of Aid to Dependent Children (ADC) to participate in JOBS or lose
benefits.  This is expected to dramatically increase the number
of JOBS participants, which already is higher than in any other
state.  Combined with state-mandated self-sufficiency contracts
that outline steps recipients must take to prepare for employment,
Ohio's JOBS participation sanctions are considered some of the
toughest in the nation.
<P>
 Another federal waiver has allowed Ohio to &quot;cash out&quot;
ADC and food stamp benefits as wage supplements.  In a pilot project
now operating in five major urban counties, welfare recipients
are placed in jobs paying between $8 and $11 per hour.
<P>
 In 1989, Ohio implemented the Learning, Earning and Parenting
(LEAP) program.  This offers teen mothers $62 per month to stay
in high school.  The governor's office reports a 10 percent decline
in the dropout rate since 1991.  It also credits the program with
encouraging 13 percent of dropouts to return to school.
<P>
 In addition, ADC parents are required to establish paternity
and support their dependents or face penalties.  And those who
have committed welfare fraud are required to pay back benefits.
 Even those under the age of 18 risk losing Medicaid coverage
if they have received benefits under false pretenses.
<P>
 Additional federal waivers will allow Ohio to implement Ohio
FIRST, a comprehensive welfare-reform initiative.  Spearheaded
by Governor George Voinovich and passed by the General Assembly
with strong bipartisan support, it will:
<P><ul>
<li> Increase the income families may earn before losing ADC benefits;
<P>
 <li>Eliminate work-history requirements for able-bodied married
couples.  (These encouraged divorce since only single parents
without work histories qualified for welfare.);
<P>
 <li>Increase the maximum allowed value for an automobile, allowing
recipients to take jobs that require personal transportation;
<P>
 <li>Allow married couples who work more than 100 hours per month
to retain benefits.  (Previously, only single parents could do
so.).</ul>
<P>
 Another key component of recent welfare reforms is timelines.
 Under these:
<P><ul>
 <li>JOBS participants enrolled in a GED program must complete their
schooling within two years to retain benefits.
<P>
<li> ADC benefits are limited to three years.</ul>
<P>
 Ohio is also testing a version of the Electronic Benefits Transfer
(EBT) smart card.  Similar to ATM bank cards, EBT cards are issued
by the state and can be used by welfare recipients to purchase
food, housing, and other goods.  The cards are expected to reduce
both administrative costs and fraud.
<P>
 These and other efforts appear to be paying off.  Ohio's welfare
caseload fell from 811,219 in 1991 to 569,405 by February 1996,
a 30 percent drop.  ADC payments are nearly $300 below the national
average.  The number of ADC recipients fell 25 percent between
1992 and February 1996.  And Medicaid spending, expected to consume
30 percent of the state's General Revenue Fund Budget over the
next two years, grew by only 1.4 percent between 1994 and 1995--the
slowest growth in twenty years.  Ohio has also received a federal
waiver that will let it place more low-income families in cost-efficient
managed-care programs.
<P>
 Ohio should explore additional welfare reform options.  Tax credits
and other incentives could be used to encourage donations to charities
serving the needy.  By restructuring its own tax code, Ohio could
help relieve some of the welfare burden without having to deal
with the federal bureaucracy.

<P>
<B>Untangling the Medicaid Mess</B>
<P>
<B>by John Hood</B>
<P>
 Lawmakers and the general public most often think of welfare
as cash assistance programs such as AFDC.  These are the least
popular and, to many, the most infuriating.
<P>
 But AFDC is not the largest welfare program.  That distinction
belongs to Medicaid, the joint federal-state program designed
to subsidize health care for about 36 million poor, disabled,
and elderly Americans.  Federal taxes support two-thirds of this
$160-billion program while state and local governments contribute
the remainder.  Astonishingly, the cost of Medicaid has tripled
just since 1988.  If welfare reform is to succeed in its twin
goals of reducing dependency and costs, it must include serious
federal and state reforms of Medicaid.
<P>
 Nationwide, Medicaid pays for one-third of all births, more than
half of all nursing home bills, and a significant part of the
bill for those with mental illness, physical disabilities, and
AIDS.  In North Carolina, the scope of the program is even larger,
paying for nearly half of all births and three-quarters of all
nursing home bills.
<P>
 The costs of Medicaid are rapidly outstripping the ability of
federal and state governments to pay the bill.  The Congressional
Budget Office estimates that Medicaid costs will almost double
by 2002.  A recent study by the Heritage Foundation estimates
that by the same year states will spend a combined $100 billion
on the program, up from $70 billion in 1995.  Such increases would
likely be funded by higher taxes or cuts in other state programs
such as education and crime control.
<P>
 A viable reform strategy must recognize that Medicaid is not
a program but a set of programs with different goals and different
problems.  Created in 1965 as a health insurance program for the
poor, Medicaid has become an amalgam of at least three social
welfare programs.  These cover:
<P><ul>
 <li>Poor children and adults;
<P>
 <li>Disabled children and adults;
<P>
 <li>Elderly residents in nursing homes.</ul>
<P>
 These three populations have very little in common.  Most of
the Medicaid population qualifies through eligibility for cash
welfare programs such as AFDC.  While these low-income individuals
certainly have health-care needs, their main problem is welfare
dependency.  They need help learning job skills, getting off drugs,
and becoming self-sufficient.
<P>
 Instead of automatically being enrolled in Medicaid, these recipients
should receive vouchers to purchase private health insurance,
enroll in managed care, or make deposits in medical or other savings
accounts.  These would be subject to the same time limits, work
requirements, and other rules set for welfare benefits.
<P>
 Medicaid recipients who are disabled may be thought of as long-term
wards of the state.  Per capita, their health-care costs are the
highest.  But being less numerous than the elderly, they do not
account for the largest share of Medicaid spending.  Disabled
Medicaid recipients should receive care as part of subsidized
assigned-risk pools and through competitive contracting.
<P>
 Finally, elderly recipients in nursing homes, who are a minority
of the Medicaid population, account for the largest share of Medicaid
spending.  Often, they are middle-class Americans who have transferred
their assets to their children in order to qualify for Medicaid.
 They must be encouraged to plan for their own health-care needs
through individual savings and long-term care insurance.
<P>
 One way to do this is to amend the income-tax system to treat
premiums for long-term care insurance the same as for medical
insurance.  Also, the payment of long-term care benefits, either
from insurance or medical savings, should not be considered taxable
income.  The potential savings to taxpayers of this change would
be massive.  According to the American Health Care Association,
if most people over age 55 had long-term health-care insurance,
the percentage of those subsidized by Medicaid in nursing homes
would fall from a current 67 percent to 25 percent within 25 years.

<B>Private Alternatives to Welfare</B>
<P>
<B>by Senator Maurice E. Washington</B>
<P>
<I> &quot;It has so happened in all ages of the world that some
have labored and others have without labor enjoyed a proportion
of the fruits.  This is wrong and should not continue.  To secure
to each laborer the whole product of his labor or as nearly as
possible is a most worthy object of any good government.&quot;
 Abraham Lincoln</I>
<P>
 Lincoln's statement distills the essence of what I have learned
about life and human nature in relation to the current welfare
morass.  As a pastor and member of the black community, I have
watched the traditionally strong morals and family structure of
black families destroyed by the false god of welfare entitlement.
<P>
 In 1994, when I was elected to the Nevada State Senate, I began
work on a sweeping welfare reform proposal.  Dubbed the Nevada
Self-Reliance Act, its goals are to end welfare entitlements,
strengthen the fragmenting family unit, and restore individual
responsibility.  It also seeks to build partnerships between the
public and private sectors and provide relief from the escalating
tax burden caused by welfare programs.
<P>
 Three programs with which I am familiar underscore the vital
role that local nonprofits can play in welfare-reform efforts:
<P><ul>
 <li> The Center Street Mission in Reno provides a full range of
services to help the needy become productive members of society.
 Founded in 1989 by Mickey Lafkin, C.M.S. and funded by individuals,
foundations, churches, and local government, it provides showers,
clean clothes, evening meals, and help in finding housing and
employment.  It also offers spiritual support.  Over 2,000 participants
have found jobs and a new start in life--a 92 percent success
rate.  The Mission also reaches out to prisoners and parolees
through weekly Bible study programs.
<P>
 <li>Friends in Service Helping (FISH) in Carson City was created
17 years ago to provide temporary and emergency assistance to
the needy.  Private contributors, including individuals, churches,
businesses, and civic clubs provide over 90 percent of FISH's
support.  FISH operates a food pantry, dining room, temporary
homeless shelter, and immunization clinic.  It also provides counseling,
free G.E.D. classes, and an interim housing project for eight
families.  Nearly 150 families are served each month.  FISH's
effectiveness is evident from the fact that Carson County, the
third largest county in Nevada, employs only one part-time state
social worker.  Residents have chosen to support an effective
private organization over a government bureaucracy.
<P>
 <li>Center of Hope Christian Fellowship in Sparks is the church
that I pastor.  When I helped create it six years ago, many of
our members were on welfare.  Today, every one is employed.  None
receive welfare.  Like the Center Street Mission and FISH, our
programs are locally controlled and operate in partnership with
the community.  Paid staff are few.  Volunteers provide most services.
 In return for spiritual and moral support, recipients are expected
to change self-defeating or self-destructive behavior.</ul>
<P>
 The principles by which these organizations operate should serve
as models for future welfare reform efforts.
<P>

<P>
<B>Lessons from a School that Works</B>
<P>
<B>by Gary Palmer</B>
<P>
 Perhaps the best example of what true welfare reform could be
in Alabama is the Cornerstone School.  Located in a low-income
minority community in Birmingham, Cornerstone is a privately funded
Christian elementary school which charges no tuition.
<P>
 According to Cornerstone's executive director, Dr. Vernard Gant,
the best way to break the cycle of dependency is through a combination
of strong character and morals, a good education, and a vision
for the future.  Gant insists that students from inner-city, low-income
families can excel in school and learn the social skills necessary
for success as adults.
<P>
 As soon as students are admitted to Cornerstone, they are given
a battery of tests to identify educational deficiencies.  Teachers
then tutor individual students to bring them up to the appropriate
grade level.  The wisdom of this approach is evident in the results.
 Third grade students with barely a second grade education who
enrolled in August 1995 saw their achievement scores jump an average
of 54 percent as of January 1996.  The fifth grade class, half
of whom enrolled with less than a fourth grade education, improved
its overall score by 38 percent.  Math skills for both classes
are now above the national average.
<P>
 Cornerstone makes parental involvement a high priority.  Before
a child is admitted, parents must sign a covenant, pledging to
participate in their children's education.  They are required
to have their children to school on time, attend all report card
conferences and parent meetings, work with faculty to promote
appropriate speech, behavior, and social development, and provide
a distraction-free environment for doing homework.  Teachers stay
in constant contact with parents through meetings, after-school
visits, and by telephone.  Despite these demands, there is a waiting
list for admission to Cornerstone.
<P>
 Religious education is central to Cornerstone's effort to elevate
students above poverty and dependency.  A recent Heritage Foundation
report shows that religious values are critical factors in avoiding
unwed pregnancy, drug use, alcoholism, crime, divorce, and other
circumstances that can lead to welfare dependency.  It found that
students who receive a religious education also place a higher
value on academics, are more likely to dismiss racism as an obstacle
to reaching their goals, and are more likely to have serious and
realistic goals for the future.
<P>
 Cornerstone judiciously selects its teachers on the basis of
the &quot;Three M's:&quot; mentor, model, and mission.  Every
teacher is a mentor and a model of integrity and determination.
 Each is also a missionary to both students and parents.
<P>
 Cornerstone students are admitted from the surrounding area,
primarily on the basis of need.  Tuition and operating funds come
from individuals, foundations, corporations, and churches.  Cornerstone
also has a &quot;Partners&quot; program for those who make an
annual contribution of $2,500.  Partners agree to be mentors and
role models and to attend up to four Partners' Day programs each
year.
<P>
 Governor Fob James recently visited Cornerstone to see first-hand
how private, faith-based education helps future generations of
at-risk children from becoming welfare victims.  He saw that private
initiative can accomplish what government programs have so often
failed to do: prepare a generation to be responsible, self-supporting
adults.

Conspiracies involving traffickers in illegal drugs are covered
extensively in the media. So are stories about individual drug
users who would like to grow, obtain and use drugs legally. But
very little has been written about the prominent individuals and
nonprofit organizations that have made the legalization of drugs
an issue in public policy. A worldwide network of people and groups
is coalescing to work to end the criminal penalties attached to
the sale and use of currently illegal drugs. Most Americans are
not aware of how serious and determined these efforts are. But
the public needs to realize that the availability of drugs, the
extent of drug use, and even the corrupting effects of illegal
drug trafficking are only part of the story. What has not been
adequately discussed is the political influence of the pro-drug
legalization movement and the economic, social, cultural and moral
consequences of its activities. 

<P>
Because most experts in law enforcement agree that the &quot;war
on drugs&quot; launched by President Nixon in 1970 has not been
won, much of the public has become skeptical of claims that authorities
are committed to fighting drugs. Increasingly indifferent to the
anti-drug rhetoric of politicians, many Americans are starting
to listen more attentively to a growing, widespread, and well-targeted
public relations campaign aimed at making them more accepting
of public policies that would tolerate drug use. 
<P>
Contributing to this are well-intentioned and well known individuals
such as financier George Soros, Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke,
and commentator William F. Buckley Jr., who have become convinced
that legalization is the answer. They are among the most prominent
public figures who have lent their voices -- and their respectability
-- to calls for drug legalization. 
<P>
Television &quot;documentaries&quot; are often supportive
of legalization arguments. MTV's &quot;Straight Dope&quot; (April
1994), ABC's &quot;America's War on Drugs: Searching for Solutions&quot;
(April 1995), and The Discovery Channel's &quot;The Cronkite Report:
The Drug Dilemma&quot; (Fall 1995) were all sympathetic to legalization
and calls for so-called &quot;alternative&quot; drug policies.
PBS programs, including <I>Firing Line</I> and <I>The Charlie
Rose Show</I>, have questioned the wisdom of the drug war and
the prohibition of illegal drugs -- as have <I>National Review</I>,
<I>New York Magazine</I>, <I>The New York Times</I>, and <I>The
Los Angeles Times</I>. All use phrases like &quot;harm reduction,&quot;
&quot;responsible use,&quot; &quot;alternatives,&quot; and &quot;decriminalization,&quot;
which have become code words used to mask a pro-legalization agenda.

<P>
The cover story in the February 12, 1996 issue of William
Buckley's magazine, <I>National Review</I>, was devoted to drug
legalization, with a series of essays making the case for ending
the legal prohibition. The journal that arguably established the
intellectual foundations for the modern conservative movement
is now providing a forum for these opinions. Most politicians,
government officials, as well as the majority of the American
people still dismiss pro-drug legalization arguments. But a broad
array of well-funded nongovernmental organizations across the
political spectrum is developing programs to legitimize drug legalization.

<P>
The financial backing and political and social support for
legalization arguments comes from a variety of sources, including
George Soros's Open Society Fund, the Soros Foundation and his
own Lindesmith Center, the Drug Policy Foundation, and the National
Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML). Together
with such organizations as the American Civil Liberties Union,
ACT-UP, and the New York chapter of the American Bar Association,
they make up the pro-legalization chorus. 
<P>
In addition, a number of other groups, including prominent
foundations like the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation,
Twentieth Century Fund, Carnegie Corporation, RAND Corporation,
and the Ford Foundation, do not advocate legalization, but provide
indirect support. They fund projects that not only criticize current
law enforcement policies, but lend support to the argument that
the drug war is a lost cause. Contending that the supply of drugs
can never be halted, these groups call instead for more treatment
facilities and programs for drug users and less law enforcement
and interdiction against drugs. They insist that many drug offenders
are non-violent and should not be imprisoned. Yet their arguments
confuse the consequences of drug use with its cause. As Robert
Peterson, the former Illinois drug czar, has said, &quot;You cannot
win the war by treating the wounded.&quot; 
<P>
Political figures like Representative Barney Frank (D-MA)
and former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders have spoken out, joining
Hollywood notables like producer David Geffen and actor Richard
Dreyfuss, and writers Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, John LeCarre,
Jorge Castaneda, and Gabriel Garcia Marquez, in seeking decriminalization
of drugs. 
<P>
Arguments that lend support to the pro-legalization movement
are advancing on all fronts. They are adapted and modified to
persuade different segments of the public. Thus, taxpayers are
warned that drug prohibition wastes public resources and is not
cost-effective. Law enforcement officers are reminded that an
unsuccessful drug war breeds disrespect for all laws. Parents
are counselled that kids are more likely to respect them and keep
themselves safe if they aren't forced into back alleys in dangerous
neighborhoods to buy their &quot;recreational drugs.&quot; The
health conscious are enlightened with data that purports to show
that cocaine is a &quot;unique source of vitamins and minerals&quot;
and that government needle bans promote unsafe and unnecessary
needle exchanges that are responsible for HIV infection among
those who inject their drugs. The arguments are unending to help
Americans overcome the repressions of a &quot;hypocritical&quot;
society. 
<P>
<a name="soros"><B>An Evening At Soros's</B> </a>
<P>
<I>Editor's note: Ms. Ehrenfeld attended the event she describes
below.</I> 
<P>
&quot;Cocaine is as good a stimulant as coffee with less harmful
effects on the body,&quot; said a drug legalization advocate in
New York. A colleague from Duke University chimed in, &quot;And,
it fills a spiritual vacuum in the deep void left by our shallow,
materialistic society.&quot; 
<P>
Caricature? Not at all: These are some of the comments made
by the respected guests of billionaire financier George Soros
at a gathering at his opulent Upper East Side Manhattan duplex.
Having spent hundreds of millions of dollars to foster the democratic
values of an &quot;open society,&quot; and claiming credit for
bringing down Communist rule in Eastern Europe, Soros is now mobilizing
some of his vast resources to fight against the &quot;evils and
misguided policy of the drug war.&quot; During last September's
Gorbachev Foundation &quot;The State of the World Forum&quot;
meeting in San Francisco, Ethan Nadelmann, director of Soros's
Lindesmith Center, introduced those ideas as part of the New World
Order while moderating the session on &quot;creative approaches
to the international drug crisis.&quot; 

<p>Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott has described Soros
as &quot;a national resource -- indeed, a national treasure.&quot;
Yet the sixty-six-year-old, Hungarian-born Soros seems to be the
treasury of the movement to legalize drugs. He is the godfather
of the pro-legalization, decriminalization, harm reduction and
&quot;responsible use&quot; movements, all of which are interconnected.

<P>
Since the early nineties, Soros has donated $6 million dollars
to the Washington-based Drug Policy Foundation (DPF), and he apparently
hosts DPF's New York office in his own offices on 7th Avenue.
Soros also gave at least $4 million dollars to the Lindesmith
Center, and $3 million dollars to Drug Strategies, which, according
to its president, Mathea Falco, promotes &quot;more effective
approaches to the nation's drug problem.&quot; 
<P>
In 1994 Soros, through his foundations, made grants totalling
at least $13 million dollars to a variety of organizations involved
in drug policy-related projects. In 1995, he &quot;provided $450,000
to Human Rights Watch for their first ever project on the abuses
of the war on drugs worldwide.&quot; Other non-American organizations
that have benefitted indirectly from Soros's largesse include
the Canadian Foundation for Drug Policy, which was formed in 1993;
the International Anti-Prohibitionist League, which is based in
Montreal and has offices in Europe; and the Australian Drug Law
Reform Foundation. 
<P>
These and other Soros-funded groups organize and help to fund
international conferences to promote marijuana and drug legalization
policies, and &quot;harm reduction,&quot; a term that refers to
programs designed to reduce the ill effects of illegal drugs.
They have played key roles in organizing and funding meetings
in the U.S., Italy, the Netherlands, Australia and Canada. They
also arrange for overseas legalization advocates to speak in public
forums in the U.S. and elsewhere, by covering their expenses and
providing honoraria. 
<P>
Soros poses as being open-minded on the drug issue, and in
public he calls for debate. Yet in press interviews his spokesman
on drugs Ethan Nadelmann has recalled that Soros told him: &quot;We
are basically in agreement . . . [I] empower you to accomplish
our common objectives.&quot; Nadelmann's objective is to &quot;legalize
the personal use of drugs by adult Americans. . . .&quot; And
Soros &quot;is comfortable with that,&quot; says Nadelmann. He
must be, because he is paying for it. 
<P>
Other guests were equally unrestrained at this memorable evening
at Soros's. New York district judge Robert Sweet, who favors decriminalization,
remarked, &quot;This [drugs] is a phony issue. People want to
change their state of mind because they don't have jobs, they
are deprived . . . And it is a lie that violence is caused by
drug addicts . . . The harm comes from the drug laws, not from
drugs.&quot; &quot;And let's not forget that drugs are fun,&quot;
added a well-known pro-legalization jazz musician. 
<P>
Interviewed by <I>High Times</I>, a magazine published by
NORML, Nadelmann asserted: &quot;It is important to see drugs
as a human rights issue,&quot; said Nadelmann, because &quot;it
is typically the same sorts of people who mount major wars on
Communists and major wars on drugs.&quot; He added that &quot;.
. . from a scientific perspective cocaine is not a dangerous drug
for the large majority of the people who use it&quot; -- and as
for legalization, &quot;take the chance and come out of the closet
. . . the way homosexuals . . . came out. . . . When all of a
sudden your cousin or your childhood friend or your daughter comes
out, your whole view of it begins to get normalized.&quot; 
<P>
He passionately added that &quot;Millions of Americans have
to lie to their kids because they think if their kids know they
smoke pot they'll report them. . . . That's a tremendous travesty.
The fear that children will put loyalty to the state ahead of
loyalty to the family is a lot more like Stalinist Russia or Nazi
Germany than traditional American values.&quot; 
<P>
Comments of this kind aim to establish a new intellectual
climate. Those who make such assertions see America's distrust
of drugs as an expression of its hangups. They think people who
oppose drugs are also opposed to sex, rock 'n roll, good times,
freedom, and love. The counter-culture of the 1960s and 1970s
lives on: But its most influential partisans are not on college
campuses or in Greenwich Village coffee houses. They are meeting
at receptions and conferences where the well-connected and well-to-do
gather. 
<P>
The president of a leading &quot;harm reductionist&quot; organization
told the gathering at Soros's that the U.S. should emulate Colombia.
In 1991, Colombia decriminalized drugs and made the corrupt profits
legal. Of course the violence continues, and Colombia is to the
international drug rackets world what Cicero was to Chicago in
the days of Al Capone. In March, the United States finally decertified
Colombia's eligibility for foreign aid because of its failure
to combat drugs. 
<P>
Yet despite Colombia's example, the pro-legalizers in the
U.S. receive a respectful hearing. With former Surgeon General
Joycelyn Elder's invitation to study legalization, Bill Buckley's
endorsement of legalization, and Soros's munificent funding, it
is not surprising that many well-intentioned people who began
as firm opponents of drugs have mistakenly concluded that, &quot;If
you can't beat 'em, join 'em.&quot; 
<P>
<a name="drug"><B>Drug Policy Foundation</B> </a>
<P>
In Washington, D.C., every cause needs its own think-tank.
In 1987 Arnold Trebach, a law professor at American University
in Washington and a long-time proponent of drug legalization,
established the Drug Policy Foundation (DPF). 
<P>
DPF represents the Brooks Brothers wing of the decriminalization
movement. Besides Trebach, DPF's board includes Yale law professor
Steven Duke, ACLU Executive Director Ira Glasser, Hoover Institution
Fellow Joseph MacNamara, Judge Robert Sweet from New York, Baltimore
Mayor Kurt Schmoke, Harvard psychiatrist Lester Grinspoon, Milton
Friedman, and David Boaz, executive vice president of the Cato
Institute. The media organ of DPF is <I>The Drug Policy Letter.</I>

<P>
In the May 5, 1994 issue of <I>Rolling Stone</I> magazine,
Aryeh Neier, president of Soros's Open Society Fund, was quoted
as saying, &quot;Soros doesn't think the drug war makes any sense
from an economic standpoint.&quot; The article explained that
in 1993 Soros gave DPF a &quot;set of suggestions to follow if
they wanted his assistance: Come up with an approach that emphasizes
`treatment and humanitarian endeavors,' he said . . . target a
few winnable issues, like medical marijuana and the repeal of
mandatory minimums.&quot; Apparently, they took his advice.

<P>
Besides generous support from Soros, the group has over 20,000
dues-paying members who are urged to be forthright, not furtive,
in their advocacy. Says David Condoliffe, DPF's vice-president
and the former New York City &quot;drug czar&quot; during the
Dinkins administration: &quot;Each person who cares about drug
reform must become actively involved, paying what he or she can
for DPF membership and listing five or more friends or associates,
and hosting fundraising events -- even on a small scale.&quot;
It has also received funding from such prominent philanthropies
as the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, J. Roderick
MacArthur Foundation, Harold Simmons Foundation, Public Welfare
Foundation, and the Chicago Resource Center. 
<P>
The DPF organizes educational lobby sessions with documentaries,
coffee, and cake on Capitol Hill. They train drug legalization
advocates from Canada, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany,
England, Australia, and Israel. 
<P>
A common feature of DPF activities is its careful avoidance
of direct references to drug legalization. Instead, spokesmen
call for &quot;alternative drug policies,&quot; harm reduction,
needle exchange programs, and &quot;responsible drug use.&quot;
DPF is also a grantmaker. According to <I>The Drug</I> <I>Policy
Letter</I>, DPF's Grant Program awards funds to &quot;successful
harm-reduction programs looking to expand their efforts, ranging
from needle exchange programs to peer counseling projects aimed
at `street youth'; for action-oriented grass-roots groups using
both the Internet and other communications methods to link reformers.
Furthermore, DPF believes that the drug policy debate cannot be
advanced unless Americans learn more about pioneering experiments
overseas.&quot; Perhaps the U.S. can emulate Switzerland, where
heroin and syringes are provided by the government. 
<P>
DPF grants have gone to such groups as the Cannabis Action
Network in Berkeley, California ($25,000), the Foundation on Drug
Policy and Human Rights in Amsterdam, the Netherlands ($15,000),
and Clean Needles Now in Los Angeles ($25,000). (See box).

</UL><P>
According to the its<I> Drug Policy Letter</I>, DPF expected
to award one million dollars in additional grants by the end of
1995. However, the DPF and the Soros foundations do not publicly
list all the grants they award. 
<P>
DPF shares offices with several computer on-line groups such
as the Marijuana Policy Project (MPP), formed in January, 1995,
and the Drug Reform Coordination Network (DRCNet), in action since
1993. Together with an on-line service run by the Lindesmith Center,
these services alert drug legalization advocates to what's happening
in Congress on drug issues and of current information on drug
enforcement, prevention, and treatment efforts. They also provide
warnings when more stringent laws are under consideration or when
new or extended anti-drug activity is undertaken. And they offer
advise on how to undermine government efforts to control drugs
and how to lobby for &quot;drug reform.&quot; 
<P>
<a name="NORML"><B>NORML: Selling Freedom?</B> </a>
<P>
Whereas DPF courts the establishment, the National Organization
for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) speaks for the beads
and sandals crowd. It makes no attempt to conceal its clear pro-legalization
stance. Founded by attorney Keith Stroup in 1970, NORML, which
is also based in Washington, is probably the best known of the
pro-legalization groups, and it was the first to lobby for the
legalization of marijuana in the U.S. Richard Cowan, who currently
heads the organization has claimed for NORML: &quot;We are selling
freedom, not marijuana.&quot; (<I>USA Today</I>, Nov. 25, 1994)

<P>
NORML contends that the ban on the use and sale of marijuana
threatens &quot;basic civil liberties.&quot; It supports the &quot;removal
of all penalties for the private possession of marijuana, cultivation
for personal use, and casual non-profit transfers of small amounts.&quot;
Large scale distribution would be taxed and regulated. 
<P>
NORML's board includes Kary Mullis, winner of the 1993 Nobel
Prize in chemistry; Louis Lasagna, Dean of the Sackler School
of Biomedical Science at Tufts University and chairman of the
National Academy of Science committee to study marijuana; Professor
John Morgan, author of the drug abuse section in the celebrated
<I>Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy</I>, and Lester Grinspoon,
a Harvard psychiatrist. 
<P>
NORML receives funds from eclectic sources. In addition to
grants from DPF and private contributions, rap groups such as
<I>Sacred Reich</I>, <I>Blues Traveler</I>, and <I>Cypress Hill</I>,
that perform under labels owned by Sony and Time Warner, are forwarding
to NORML the proceeds from the sales of their joint album <I>Hempilation</I>
(Capricorn Records), suggesting that &quot;because hemp is marijuana,
this will further the marijuana legalization efforts.&quot; (The
quote appears on the liner of the album along with a NORML membership
application.) The collection of songs is devoted to the &quot;wonders
of weed.&quot; These groups often display the marijuana leaf on
their albums, at their concerts, and on their promotional posters,
T-shirts and hats. Some of this merchandise is made of hemp, which
NORML promotes as an environment-friendly source for paper.

<P>
The group has over 100 chapters and affiliates around the
country. 
<P>
<a name="moral"><B>Moral Leadership: Where is it?</B> </a>
<P>
It is surprising that in this election year, drugs are not
a significant issue. Although there are no quick or easy fixes,
our political leaders ought to exercise moral leadership in speaking
out against the easy availability of drugs and those who sell
them. First Lady Nancy Reagan's &quot;Say No to Drugs&quot; campaign
demonstrated leadership. George Soros, on the other hand, is demonstrating
yet again what money can buy. What is spare change for him has
made important inroads in the public's opinions about drugs.

<P>
The counter-offensive against the drug war is succeeding by
causing the American public to begin to doubt its wisdom. Americans
need to understand the full magnitude of the movement to surrender
to drugs. 
<P>
The pro-legalization movement is far from winning the &quot;war
against the war.&quot; But if the proponents of legalization are
victorious, it would not be the first time that a persistent counterculture,
led by highly educated individuals in elite institutions, heavily
funded, and supported by many in the media, was able to reverse
deep-seated beliefs and the will of the majority of the American
people. Only this time, it will lead to the devastation of our
culture and society.

<h2>The Real History of Orphanages
<p></h2>
<b><I>Accentuating the Positives
</I></b><BR>
<p>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>By Marvin Olasky</FONT></B>
<P>

<a href="#over">Oversimplifications Have Consequences</a><p>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Orphanage!  The word connotes bleakness;  Charles Dickens' British
vision has become our own, with some Faulkneresque grotesque added
in. Here Dr. Olasky argues that the conventional history of American
orphanages is a tale of sound and fury directed against the helpless,
with the absence of close government oversight leading to unmitigated
child abuse.  The real story, however, is richer; it shows how
good orphanages combatted both material and spiritual poverty
among children who would otherwise have been the truly wretched
of the earth. According to Olasky our bias toward accentuating
the negative in the history of orphanages has often led us to
eliminate the positive.</i>
<P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;The first orphanage in what is now the United States opened
in 1729 in New Orleans.  The second, the Bethesda Orphan House,
emerged in Georgia a dozen years later through the ardent fund-raising
of famed evangelist George Whitefield.  Such early efforts were
rare; not until the nineteenth century did homes specifically
devoted to orphaned or abandoned children become common in a land
where families were big and extra water for an orphan was often
thrown into the soup.     In the colonial era small children without
parents were taken in by relatives or cared for informally by
neighbors; older children were indentured to a master who would
teach them a trade. Apprenticeship bore no stigma since it was
common to send a child at 13 or so into another person's home
for training or education; all who had hands capable of work were
expected to use them at an early age.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;   The growth of towns and the disruption that the Revolutionary
War created  led to a more structured approach toward orphans
by the end of the century.  The British seizure of Charleston,
S.C., in 1780 destroyed not only buildings but families so that
when the tide of independence after Yorktown washed out the occupying
forces some orphans remained. The Charleston city council appointed
commissioners to gather up parentless children and lodge them
in private homes, with the government paying for room and board.
 &nbsp;&nbsp; A few years later the commissioners appealed to the public for
contributions to build an orphanage, and-according to a mid-nineteenth-century
 account-&quot;all classes of citizens vied with each other in
the grateful work of contributions in money, labor, material and
services.&quot;    The Charleston orphanage was completed in 1794
and occupied by 115 children. 
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; By 1800 there were five or seven orphanages in the United States;
sources vary as to the exact number.   Local governments promoted
the efforts by urging citizens to contribute to them, with members
of legislatures sometimes offering part of their salaries.  Typically,
a &quot;society of citizens&quot; would take the initiative; in
New York City, the New York Orphan Asylum Society in 1806 rented
a two-story frame house in Greenwich Village, hired a &quot;pious
and respectable man and his wife&quot; as superintendent and matron,
and mandated that &quot;The orphans shall be educated, fed and
clothed at the expense of the Society and at the Asylum.  They
must have religious instruction, moral example, and habits of
industry inculcated on their minds.&quot;  The &quot;Asylum&quot;-in
those days the word meant merely a place of security-opened with
twelve orphans in 1806, and soon expanded into a facility housing
200 orphans.
<P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Orphanages during those years shortly after passage of the first
amendment were religiously motivated; concerns about separation
of church and state voiced privately by Thomas Jefferson were
not in public evidence.  The Charleston city council in 1801 proposed
a contributions drive to erect a building for religious services
on orphanage land, with provision that the building &quot;be open
to the clergy of all denominations.&quot;  
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; After a few years the New York Orphan Asylum Society received
a state subsidy for its care of orphans, but the emphasis on religious
instruction remained.  Americans understood in the nineteenth
century that government was not to establish any particular denomination
as a state church, but that government should not try to banish
God. 
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The number of orphanages grew throughout the first half of the
nineteenth century largely in connection with an outpouring of
evangelical benevolence, with women often in the forefront.  Petersburg,
Virginia females petitioned the legislature in 1812 for authorization
to set up an orphan asylum, for they were &quot;deeply impressed
with the forlorn and helpless situation of poor orphan female
children... and wish to snatch [them] from ignorance and ruin.&quot;

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Every epidemic, such as the cholera disaster of 1832, created
orphans and new orphanage efforts; by 1850 there were between
71 and 77.  Individual and church contributions paid most of the
cost, but it was not unusual to have municipalities pay up to
a third, and for expenses to be held down through some work by
the orphans themselves; boys learned manual skills while making
repairs and girls under the instruction of a sewing teacher often
made clothes for all the residents. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  By mid-century orphanages often were impressive buildings; the
orphan house in Charleston, after undergoing remodeling and enlargement
from 1853 to 1855, contained a spacious five stories.  The first
floor contained three dining rooms, three play rooms, and ten
other rooms, including a kitchen, pantry, and laundry room.  The
second story included classrooms, parlor and reception rooms,
and other rooms for sewing and office space.  Three upper stories
were largely bedroom space, with steam heat throughout.  Architects
reported that the building contained 2,355,000 bricks, 222 doors,
298 windows, and 39,000 feet of piping. 
<P>
<a name="net"><B>A Massive Network</B></a>
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The Civil War greatly expanded demand for orphanages, and the
supply skyrocketed to over 600 by 1880.  Character as well as
quantity changed however; early in the century a &quot;half-orphan&quot;
was supposed to live with a surviving parent, but in the late
1800s children of destitute single parents increasingly found
their way to orphanages.  The Protestant monopoly also disappeared
as Catholic and Jewish child care institutions proliferated. 
The New York Catholic Protectory, established in 1862, became
the largest children's institution in the United States.  Jewish
organizations dated from shortly before the war-both the Jewish
Foster Home of Philadelphia and the Association for the Relief
of Jewish Widows and Orphans on New Orleans were founded in 1855.
But deaths and massive immigration led to a huge network of institutions
that reached its peak between 1880 and 1920.  Most orphanages
were segregated by race, with institutions such as the Colored
Orphan Asylum in New York City becoming prominent. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The most comprehensive report about orphanages during this period
grew out of investigations by William P. Letchworth, commissioner
of the New York State Board of Charities in 1875.  Letchworth
visited some 130 institutions for children and came away with
positive impressions concerning nutritious food, safe living conditions,
and factors such as &quot;a high standard of personal cleanliness.&quot;
  Letchworth also emphasized religious and moral training, which
he thought a matter for the public interest because good citizenship
arose only when a child learned his &quot;obligations to the Deity&quot;
and was &quot;taught the importance of living an upright life.&quot;
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Letchworth's 470 pages of detailed notes on his site visits
to the institutions throughout the state are valuable not only
for his physical descriptions but for his reporting  of how orphanage
managers saw their work. He quoted Mrs. Helen Mercy Woods,  the
 very trustworthy matron of the Onondaga County Orphan Asylum
in Syracuse, as explaining (contrary to our current stereotypes),
&quot;I do not believe in shutting children up, frightening them
or making them go without their meals.... I try to impress upon
them, especially upon the boys, that it is not what people do
for them that is going to avail, but what they do for themselves.
&nbsp;&nbsp; I endeavor to convince the boys that they can be any thing they
please if they will only try for it.  I do not see why they should
not fill positions of respectability as well as others.&quot;

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Orphanage directors during the second half of the nineteenth
century saw their mission as not merely furnishing basic material
needs but creating model American citizens-particularly when they
dealt with children of immigrants.  They tried to instill virtues
such as thrift, self-reliance, and sobriety, and to create a capacity
for hard work; they believed in busy daily routines and strict
discipline. 
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The morning schedule at the Philadelphia Orphan Asylum featured
children rising at daybreak, attending a chapel service thirty
minutes later, and then marching quietly-two by two and holding
hands-to large dining halls with long tables.  There they were
segregated by sex, and anyone wishing an extra helping had to
raise his hand.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Similar schedules were followed throughout the land.  Mrs. F.B.
Tufts, matron of the Utica (New York) Orphan Asylum, was proud
of the routine her charges had in 1875: &quot;The children rise
at six o'clock, dress and wash, after which prayers are said in
the sitting room.  After breakfast the older children go to their
work.  The boys clear off the table, sweep the dining room, and
the girls make their own beds with the assistance of the superintendent.
 All assemble in the school at nine o'clock and remain there until
twelve, with the exception of an intermission of fifteen minutes.
Dinner is served at twelve, after which there is recreation until
half-past one, when they enter the schoolroom again and remain
till half-past four. After school they have recreation till five
o'clock.  Supper is served at five.  In winter they have supper
very soon after school.  The little girls set the tables and assist
in light branches of housework.  After supper the children play
till bedtime.  In winter the younger children go to bed about
seven, but the older ones are permitted to stay up a little later.
 Prayers are said before retiring.  Sometimes the children sing;
sometimes they repeat psalms.  The exercise is varied.&quot;
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Observers at the time generally considered such disciplined
activity to be benign, but critics of orphanages over the years
have muttered about regimentation and mean-spirited harshness.
 &nbsp;&nbsp; From 1850 on records show an increase in questioning whether
orphanage life was best for children in distress.
<P>
<a name="homes"><B>City Kids, Country Homes</B></a>
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Constructive questioning underlay the efforts of Charles Brace,
a writer and missionary who felt called to gain firsthand knowledge
of how the orphaned or abandoned lived.  Settling in New York
City at mid-century, Brace visited &quot;centres of crime and
misery,&quot; and was then able to describe how &quot;the street-boys
were trained by older pickpockets and burglars for their nefarious
callings,&quot; and how &quot;little girls who flitted about with
baskets and wrapped in old shawls became familiar with vice before
they were out of childhood.&quot;   Brace soon set up six homes
for orphans and abandoned children that provided not only shelter
but classes in reading and industrial arts, along with Bible lessons.
&nbsp;&nbsp; The largest of the lodging houses served about 90,000 children
from 1854 through 1872.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Brace emphasized rules that would &quot;discourage pauperism&quot;
and show the rewards of honest work.  Instead of handing out clothes
upon request, Brace preferred to &quot;give the garments as rewards
for good conduct, punctuality, and industry.&quot;   Once they
came to know the children, housekeepers who saw cases of  dire
need could relieve them with less likelihood of deception and
without harm to the character-building process.  The best way
to turn often-troubled children into good citizens, he knew, was
to give them the security of adoption by a family. But there were
not enough willing families in New York City, and Brace agonized
over questions like, &quot;How were places to be found?... And
when the children were placed, how were their interests to be
watched over, and acts of oppression or hard dealing prevented
or punished?&quot;  
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Brace hit upon the idea of allowing adults who took in children
to do good and do well at the same time.  He decided to try sending
children (aged seven to seventeen) to farmers' homes where-in
return for room, board, education, and personal attention-the
children would work part-time. Brace began by sending out to fellow
evangelicals a circular that proposed the economic arrangement
but also stressed the theological reasons for personal involvement:
&quot;Something must be done to meet the increasing crime and
poverty among the destitute children of New York.  As Christian
men, we cannot look upon this great multitude of unhappy, deserted,
and degraded boys and girls without feeling our responsibility
to God for them.... We bear in mind that One died for them, even
as for the children of the rich and happy.&quot;
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Response was enormous; as Brace wrote, &quot;Hundreds of applications
poured in at once from the farmers and mechanics all through the
Union.&quot;  Brace and his associates then relied on  volunteer
committees in towns in upstate New York and throughout the Midwest-a
committee usually included the mayor, a minister, a newspaper
editor, a banker, and a storekeeper-to  each assume responsibility
for the placing of several dozen New York City boys in local families.
When a committee contacted Brace and told him it had publicized
the need through newspaper articles and preaching, and made plans
for temporary housing and feeding of the children, Brace would
send a carload of children on what became known as an &quot;orphan
train.&quot;    
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  When the children arrived, the committee attempted to make sure,
in Brace's words, that the children would &quot;find themselves
in comfortable and kind homes, with all the boundless advantages
and opportunities of the Western farmer's life about them.&quot;
That sounds too good to be true, but it generally was true for
over 91,000 children placed by Brace between 1853 and 1893. This
was for several reasons.  First, in small towns and in rural areas,
committee members had personal knowledge of applicants, and perversities
were hard to keep secret. Second, as Brace wrote, the process
of placing the children &quot;is carried on so publicly ... that
any case of positive abuse would at once be known and corrected
by the community itself.&quot;  Third, an agent visited newly-placed
children within a few months and checked for either pampering
or overwork-both of which were seen as pernicious.  In a culture
that preached compassion and practiced neighborly surveillance,
it appears that cases of neglect or abuse were rare.  
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Brace's New York Children's Aid Society did prosecute two cases
of child abuse and occasionally removed children, generally when
parents reneged on their agreement to provide education.   Records
show occasional cases of farmers working children too long, and
of a few even evicting children when the demands of the harvest
were past.  Some children were placed several times before a good
match was made. But the typical result, even critics of the program
admitted, was portrayed in one report of an inspection tour: &quot;Wherever
we went we found the children sitting at the same table with the
families, going to the school with the children, and every way
treated as well as any other children.  Some whom we had seen
once in the most extreme misery, we beheld sitting, clothed and
clean ... and gaining a good name for themselves in their village.&quot;

<P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;One reason for success probably was the willingness of Brace
and others to use economic incentives.  Since extra hands were
so useful on farms, some observers worried that the &quot;farmer,
while he appeared to be influenced by high motives, might be thinking
too much of the economic gains he would secure through the children
placed in his home.&quot;
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Brace, however, argued that taking in a child from the slums
was often an emotionally-draining activity that should not be
economically-draining as well.  In an agricultural economy, Brace
suggested, child placement could be win-win for both child and
farmer.  His message was clear:  How much better to get orphans
into fresh air and a fresh life than to keep them cooped up in
an institution! 
<P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Journalistic support, for which Brace worked hard, helped to
spread that message.  &quot;I made it a point,&quot; he wrote,
&quot;to keep our movements, and the evils we sought to cure,
continually before the public in the columns of the daily journals.
Articles describing the habits and trials of the poor; editorials
urging the community to work in these directions [made the public]
thoroughly imbued with our ideas and a sense of the evils which
we sought to reform.&quot;
<P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Brace's Children's Aid Society was flattered by widespread imitation
of its methods.  The New York Foundling Hospital began sending
some young children to the New England and mid-Atlantic states.
 The Chicago Orphan Asylum sent its charges to downstate farms,
where farmers agreed to clothe and feed the children, treat them
kindly, and provide religious instruction. 
<P>
<a name="late"><B>The Late-nineteenth Century Mainstream</B></a>
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The number of children in orphanages continued to grow during
the late nineteenth century, moving from 74,000 in 1880 to close
to 90,000 in 1900 and 110,000 in 1910.  The word &quot;orphanage&quot;
itself became a misnomer, as children of parents who were still
living but had problems with finances or alcohol found the institutions
safer and better than life at home.  Backers of orphanages near
the turn of the century still looked around and saw good work.
 Charleston Mayor George S. Bryan wrote  upon the 100th anniversary
of his local orphan house, in 1891, that &quot;I have lived long,
and have witnessed many anniversaries in Charleston, but none
ever gave me such unalloyed and absolute satisfaction.&quot; 
Bryan praised &quot;the discipline which has molded this matchless
institution, and which has harmonized all its details, and combined
them into a perfect and symmetrical whole.&quot; 
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Praise for orphanages did not come only from politicians; journalists
and the children themselves noted the close relationships between
resident children and the superintendents who developed a long-term
bond with their charges.  Some 1960s-style historians sniffing
for oppression have scorned reports and records that show positive
interactions of most children and most supervisors, but Nurith
Zmora, in her excellent recently-published history of Baltimore
orphanages, provides specific detail of compassion at work.  One
orphanage principal, she notes, &quot;was everywhere, watching
carefully every detail of the girls' education, discussing their
future vocations with them, and encouraging them to excel.  She
knew when to be soft and kind and when to be tough and strict.&quot;
 &nbsp;&nbsp;Another superintendent &quot;knew each child's tendency, talents,
and weaknesses and was there to encourage and develop the talents
or correct the mistakes.&quot; 
<P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Some late19th- and early 20th-century orphanages did provide
fodder for stereotypes, but many others displayed patterns of
discipline combined with love.  When a pastor from Vicksburg journeyed
to the Palmer Home for Children in Columbus, Mississippi  to drop
off four children, he ended up staying two days. He wrote to the
superintendent: &quot;I have never seen a healthier or happier
looking lot of children.... What pleased me most was the family
atmosphere of it.... I noticed that the children ran over to your
house whenever they felt like it with the same confidence that
any little child runs to its father's house.&quot;   Some orphanages
battled not criticism but also the patterns of segregation that
dominated American society.  When Father Edward J. Flanigan opened
his Boy's Home in Omaha, which soon became the famed Boy's Town,
he made it officially color-blind, and stuck to his policy of
integration even when townspeople protested the &quot;mingling
of races.&quot;
<P>
 
<P>
<a name="critic"><B>Early Critics</B></a>
<P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, even though the quality of care was evident to observers,
reporting of orphanages started to turn negative in tone.  Much
of the criticism had an ideological tinge, portraying  what had
seemed to be a virtuous solution to children's needs as materially
satisfactory but psychologically inhumane.  In 1893, two years
after the Charleston celebration, Chicago orator Jenkin Lloyd
Jones praised with faint damn the eleven homes for children within
the windy city: &quot;It is not that these massive buildings with
their 'modern improvements,' well-heated and well-ventilated,
and in the main well managed, are not much better than something
worse.&quot;  He noted that orphanages had trained many children
in &quot;habits of usefulness, making of them self-reliant and
self-supporting men and women.&quot; 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  But that was not enough, according to Jones.  &quot;I believe
there is a more excellent way,&quot; he exulted.  &quot;I know
not which to pity the more, the boy who knows not where his tomorrow's
dinner is to come from, or that other boy, dressed in uniform,
at least when he goes to meeting, who is scrubbed by rule, fed
from a printed bill of fare, who always knows on what days bean
or potato soup is to be expected; who knows which are pie and
which are pudding days; the boy who is marched to the table, marched
to his playground, marched to his bed....&quot;  Jones made it
clear that he pitied the child in that &quot;unnatural classification&quot;
known as an orphanage, because he was being forced to abandon
his old, free nature and take on a new style of thinking and living.

<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The positive example of what Charles Brace and others had accomplished,
along with the negative reputation orphanages were beginning to
have, combined to push orphanages down a slippery slope of early-1900s
social unpopularity.  Two White House Conferences on the Care
of Dependent Children in 1909 and 1919, bent in an anti-orphanage
direction: single mothers were to receive financial aid so children
could stay at home, and orphans or those completely abandoned
should be placed in foster care.  The 1919 conference specified
that, &quot;The carefully selected foster home is for the normal
child the best substitute for the natural home.&quot;   Orphanages
were places where matrons suppressed that &quot;old, free nature&quot;
of children. Washington-centric social workers tended to overlook
the ways in which orphanages were functioning as a good alternative
for many children who would otherwise have led miserable lives.
  
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; On the eve of World War I large cities sported an amazing variety:
Baltimore had 28, including twelve Catholic, two Jewish, seven
declared Protestant, and seven labeled private but organized and
run by Protestant philanthropists.  (There were also race and
ethnic divides: six were for blacks, three for Germans, two for
the Irish, and one for Russian Jews)   As Nurith Zmora notes,
some of today's historians would call the typical Baltimore orphanage
&quot;a jail-like institution; they would assume that it was depressing
in appearance  and oppressive in its overreliance on harsh discipline,
rigid routine, and lack of respect for the individual.&quot; And
yet, orphans themselves, interviewed later, tended to attribute
their &quot;success in life to the upper-middle-class education
and culture provided by the charitable institution....&quot; 
 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The number of children in orphanages peaked in the 1920s, with
the census bureau recording 143,000 residents in 1923.  Most were
small, with one-fourth holding fewer than 30 children and 65 percent
housing fewer than 80.  But anti-institutionalism was flourishing
in the roaring twenties-one founder of a family care agency, Dr.
Henry Dwight Chapin, argued in 1926 that the United States was
an &quot;institution-ridden country.&quot;  Orphanages of all
sizes were tarred with that brush.  Furthermore, as more children
of living parents who were troubled or temporarily impoverished
entered orphanages, the children frequently became short-timers
and one of the pro-orphanage arguments-the stability that they
could bring to the lives of confused children-became less salient.

<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The Brace concept of emphasizing homes rather than institutions
for orphans triumphed finally in the 1930s, but with a twist.
 As early as the 1880s and 1890s, a few agencies, convinced ideologically
that labor was not good for children, had begun paying foster
parents for boarding children so that the children would not have
to work.   By the 1930s, however, there was little choice in the
matter; industrialization and urbanization had so transformed
the American landscape that open-armed farm families were no longer
available in abundance.  
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;  Brace had done wonderful work in his time, and most of the
charitable procedures he fought for in the nineteenth century
were still usable in the twentieth, but this one was not.  When
families that housed children would no longer be financially recompensed
they now had to look to government for their monthly bread, and
that government was heading toward bloated bureaucracy. 
<P>
<a name="over"><B>Oversimplifications Have Consequences</B></a>
<P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Other problems with the new conventional wisdom soon emerged:
 Institutions were bad, homes were good. But most of the children
who needed help had a surviving parent or parents who had not
freed children for adoption, so the homes they would find would
be temporary, and children yanked from home to home were in less
stable conditions than the orphanages had provided.  Homes were
good, but non-farm parents would have to be paid to provide temporary
shelter, and such responsibility in the New Deal era was of course
governmental, so states started to pay for foster care.  Government
bureaucrats who supervised foster placement developed an empire-building
economic incentive to keep children in foster care rather than
place them in permanent adoptive homes.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Even in the 1920s there were wrenching scenes at the Hebrew
Orphan Asylum in Baltimore as children were selected for foster
families; many not wanting to leave behind orphanage friends and
siblings, but having to go.   By the late 1940s it was clear that
foster care was not a panacea; Michael Sharlitt, who grew up in
an orphanage and later ran one, noted at that time the problem
of children becoming disoriented as they went through a succession
of foster homes.  Nevertheless, federal funding emerged for urban
area foster care in 1951; the increase in available dollars, along
with an epidemic of journalistic articles about child abuse during
the 1960s, led to a dramatic increase in foster care.   Orphanages
were largely forgotten in the popular press until Newt Gingrich
brought up the subject late in 1994, and gave journalists an opportunity
to clank the chains of Christmas past.

<P>
I don't have to look at a U.S. flag in the toilet to know it's
wrong,&quot; Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich said on April
2nd. He was calling on the Phoenix Art Museum to cancel an exhibit
which featured one flag draped inside a porcelain toilet surrounded
by a jail cell and another placed on the floor to be stepped on.
<P>
Outside the museum American Legion veterans had protested the
flag abuse while inside eleven-year-old Fabian Montoya took up
the banner from the floor and folded it carefully. Museum curators
quickly replaced the flag. Director Jim Ballinger defended the
action, telling the Arizona Republic that to protect the flag
&quot;would be censorship.&quot; He declared, &quot;the artists
here are just celebrating their First Amendment rights.&quot;
<P>
Gingrich responded, &quot;When I talk about elite versus classic
American values, I think the Phoenix art exhibit is a perfect
example.&quot;
<P>
The culture that permits an arts administrator to defend flag
desecration is in great measure the culture created and funded
during the past fifteen years by the major foundations. And among
all the foundations supporting the arts, perhaps the most committed
to the goals of cultural affront and multicultural diversity --
and the anti-Americanism which goes with it -- is the Rockefeller
Foundation. It is the legacy of a living dynasty whose members
are still active in business, politics, and the arts.
<P>
Historian John Fonte wrote recently in National Review that schoolchildren
now learn &quot;that instead of one people the United States of
America consists of many diverse 'peoples.'&quot; He argues that
a multi-ethnic America has been reinterpreted through the lens
of &quot;the multiculturalist agenda [that] is shattering the
American identity.&quot; For at least a decade, that agenda has
been official policy for the Rockefeller Foundation.
<P>
<a name="rock"><b>ROCKEFELLER VS. STANDARDS</b></a>
<P>
John Frohnmayer, former chairman of the National Endowment for
the Arts during the Bush Administration, claims that since the
NEA's establishment in 1965, the Rockefeller Foundation has been
important precisely because it has &quot;sought out the under-represented
outside the mainstream in the arts.&quot; While some grantmaking
foundations fund the popular arts and others give to traditional
venues such as the opera, symphony orchestras and ballet, the
Rockefeller Foundation, says Frohnmayer, has consistently supported
the &quot;cutting edge.&quot;
<P>
Reached at his home in Bozeman, Montana, Frohnmayer told Foundation
Watch that he &quot;always considered the Rockefeller Foundation
very valuable in supporting the National Endowment for the Arts.&quot;
The Rockefeller Foundation's support is more than moral: it has
supplied millions of dollars in matching funds over the years
for NEA special projects.
<P>
The Rockefeller Foundation's early arts funding was praiseworthy,
focusing on both popular and high art and on support for performing
arts complexes such as New York City's Lincoln Center and the
American Center in Paris [see Foundation Watch vol.1, no.2 for
an account of the Center's demise]. However, according to its
own official history, presented in Senate testimony in 1990, the
Rockefeller Foundation gradually came to see its role as &quot;supporting
work which is not yet validated by time and which may not be recognized
or valued by others.&quot; This is the sort of new work, funded
on the basis of &quot;judgement of peer artists and experts&quot;
that would get the NEA in trouble in 1989.
<P>
While the Rockefeller Foundation might have gotten the NEA off
the political hook by privately funding the most controversial
works that were receiving NEA grants, instead it chose to strong-arm
the NEA to continue its support for the avant-garde.
<P>
The result: NEA funding dropped from a high of some $180 million
to its current $99.5 million appropriation. Mired in a series
of federally-funded fiascos over the works of Andres Serrano,
Robert Mapplethope, Joel-Peter Witkin, Karen Finley, Holly Hughes,
Tim Miller, John Fleck, Ron Athey, and the most recent flag incident
in Arizona, the NEA continues to confound its supporters and infuriate
its opponents by being unable to see the difference between insulting
and honoring the public's trust.
<P>
In 1990, Rockefeller Foundation president Peter Goldmark, Jr.
testified to Congress against &quot;standards&quot; for NEA-supported
art in the wake of the Mapplethorpe and Serrano controversies.
<P>
He argued, &quot;I think if it is possible to make a strong case
to put into law a standard about whether something is religiously
acceptable or whether it is obscene, no matter how harmlessly
it appears to be phrased, then I think it will likely be possible
for someone else to say we ought to have a standard that has to
do with whether the art appears to support evolution or whether
it does not, or whether it appears to be patriotic or whether
it does not. I would suggest to you, let us stay away from the
road of State involvement in content. I would argue to you that
is the only safe way in our society for the State to support the
arts.&quot;
<P>
Despite Goldmark's testimony, the NEA was reauthorized in 1990
with the stipulation that NEA awards should be made after consideration
of &quot;general standards of decency and respect for the diverse
beliefs and values of the American people.&quot; Goldmark had
failed to convince Congress, but his minions had more luck with
officials at the NEA.
<P>
<a name="friend"><b>WITH FRIENDS LIKE THESE...</b></a>
<P>
In his memoir of his life as a federal arts bureaucrat, Leaving
Town Alive (Houghton Mifflin, 1993), Frohnmayer recalls that he
suspended a NEA grant for a New York art gallery called Artist's
Space in 1989 because its material was &quot;cruder and potentially
more problematic than Mapplethorpe's photos.&quot; Frohnmayer
told Susan Wyatt, the gallery's director, that among other items
in the show, &quot;at least one photo of masturbation was potentially
obscene.&quot; Moreover, the artist, David Wojnarowicz, whose
work was prominently featured, called New York's John Cardinal
O'Connor &quot;a fat cannibal&quot; in the exhibit catalogue.
<P>
Frohnmayer decided to see the New York City exhibit for himself.
Upon arriving at the gallery, he was confronted with demonstrators,
camera crews swarmed about him, and a banner flew from a building
across the street denouncing the National Endowment for the Arts.
Wrote Frohnmayer, &quot;The scene reminded me of Tom Wolfe's descriptions
of the Bronx courthouse in Bonfire of the Vanities.&quot;
<P>
&quot;It was an extremely unpleasant situation,&quot; Frohnmayer
told Foundation Watch. &quot;I went there because I wanted to
talk to them and see the show for myself.&quot; In his book, Frohnmayer
describes a meeting with art world denizens who confronted him
over his decision to suspend the grant.
<P>
The group, he recalls, included David Wojnarowicz and leaders
of ACT UP, a group advocating radical gay rights; Andres Serrano,
whose &quot;Piss Christ&quot; photo of a crucifix in urine helped
start the NEA controversy; Martha Wilson, the director of the
Manhattan &quot;performance space&quot; called Franklin Furnace,
where Annie Sprinkle had offered her private parts for public
examination and told the audience the show was &quot;government
funded,&quot;; Nan Goldin, the curator of the exhibition; and
twenty or so others. Among those there, Frohnmayer clearly recalls,
was &quot;Alberta Arthurs, of the Rockefeller Foundation.&quot;
<P>
How did the group treat the new Chairman of the NEA in his moment
of crisis? Did they offer their services to protect the agency
from a potentially damaging political confrontation while taking
care of their &quot;cutting edge&quot; constituency with private
money? To the contrary.
<P>
Frohnmayer describes the occasion vividly: &quot;I said I had
come to listen. What I heard was a series of ad hominem attacks,
something that never before, in my pleasant existence, had been
directed at me. 'You have politicized the NEA.' 'You are a coward.'
'You have sold out the artists of this country; you should resign.'
'How do you feel about men kissing each other?' 'Why don't you
fight for removal of the language that Congress passed if you
don't like it?'
<P>
&quot;After about thirty minutes of listening to people beat up
on me, I was able to direct the conversation toward what the Arts
Endowment could do in the future,&quot; Frohnmayer wrote. &quot;I
didn't like the personal attacks, but I considered them part of
the price I had to pay to work myself out of this self-inflicted
mess. I was numb; my emotions were on hold. Only a solution mattered.&quot;
In other words, as Frohnmayer put it, &quot;We were in the process
of being had for at least the second time.&quot; And in a most
rude and unpleasant manner.
<P>
While Frohnmayer noted that Alberta Arthurs was present during
his battering, he cautioned that he thought &quot;it was not a
situation orchestrated by the Rockefeller Foundation.&quot; Yet
despite his visible discomfort, Arthurs (director of Arts and
Humanities for the Rockefeller Foundation) had said not a word
to defend Frohnmayer while he endured the torrent of verbal and
psychological abuse.
<P>
Frohnmayer confessed he was grateful to have been there in New
York for the experience. &quot;I felt the Rockefeller Foundation
was a valuable ally,&quot; he told Foundation Watch. &quot;They
had the very strong feeling that the underrepresented voices ought
to be heard.&quot; And who were the &quot;underrepresented?&quot;
Frohnmayer said it was &quot;clear&quot; that &quot;the group
way on the left was underrepresented.&quot; He estimated these
were &quot;about 20-30% of the American population.&quot;
<P>
Frohnmayer's own account to Foundation Watch presents a scene
of ideological rectification worthy of Darkness at Noon. He had
obviously strayed from the art world party line, had to endure
a self-criticism session with the relevant arts commissars and
ideological enforcers, and confess to his sins before returning
to Washington.
<P>
In retrospect, Frohnmayer concludes, &quot;They wanted to make
a point. You have to say they made their point.&quot; And he adds
that following his visit to New York, &quot;I restored the grant.&quot;
<P>
The NEA funds &quot;cutting-edge&quot; works like these, in part,
because, like a battered spouse, it has come to depend on being
tormented by grantmakers like the Rockefeller Foundation. While
the Foundation purports to defend the NEA from attacks by Congress,
it joins the &quot;arts community&quot; in abusing the NEA's processes
while denouncing the agency's integrity. The Rockefeller Foundation,
for instance, made grants to the American Civil Liberties Union
and others to sue the NEA on behalf of the artists denied grants
for offensive material: The ACLU claimed &quot;free expression&quot;
required overturning the law that the NEA respect &quot;general
standards of decency.&quot;
<P>
<a name="ludlow"><b>THE LEGACY OF LUDLOW</b></a>
<P>
No member of the Rockefeller family currently sits on the Foundation's
fifteen-member board of trustees. The family absence is a legacy
of the Foundation's role in the aftermath of the &quot;Ludlow
Massacre,&quot; which occured in 1913, the same year the Foundation
had been established. That year two women and eleven children
living in a striker's camp at the Rockefeller-dominated Colorado
Fuel and Iron company died during a raid by National Guard troops.
As Martin Morse Wooster notes in The Great Philanthropies and
the Problem of Donor Intent (Capital Research Center, 1994), &quot;the
'Ludlow Massacre' quickly became a cause celebre for the left.
Novelist Upton Sinclair picketed John D. Rockefeller's home, and
in New York City, four members of the Industrial Workers of the
World died when a bomb [intended for Rockefeller] exploded prematurely
in their apartment.&quot;
<P>
At the suggestion of Harvard president Charles Eliot, the Rockefeller
Foundation hired Mackenzie King, a Canadian politician to study
labor relations at Rockefeller-controlled businesses and improve
John D's image.
<P>
The move backfired badly. In public hearings government officials
grilled King and Rockefeller public relations advisor Ivy Lee,
and concluded that &quot;the huge philanthropic trusts, known
as foundations, appear to be a menace to the welfare of society&quot;
because they gave the wealthy a mechanism &quot;to become molders
of public thought.&quot;
<P>
Under pressure, Rockefeller transferred control over his fortune
to his children in 1916, and control over the foundation to his
son John D. Rockefeller, Jr. who, according to Wooster, made it
a principle to &quot;erect a firm wall between the Rockefeller
Foundation and the Rockefellers' personal affairs.&quot; The younger
Rockefeller also replaced his father's friends and business associates
on the Foundation board with pillars of progressivism.
<P>
Soon the reconstituted Foundation was rejecting a grant proposal
from John D. Rockefeller himself. He wanted to replace textbooks
&quot;calculated to lead astray and do harm rather than good&quot;
and he proposed to fund education with &quot;the most sane and
practical and possible views of life rather than...socialism and
some forms of Bolshevism.&quot; Rockefeller's lawyer, Starr Murphy
&quot;was aghast&quot; at this proposal and wrote &quot;it would
be extremely unwise for any donor to attempt to place limitations
on the character of the teaching which shall be given in an institution
to which he contributes.&quot; The divorce of the family from
the foundation was set.
<P>
To reconnect the Rockefeller families to the charities it had
created, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund was created in 1941 by
John D. Rockefeller 3rd, Nelson, Lawrence, Winthrop, and David.
Subsequently, the Rockefeller &quot;cousins&quot; also created
their own charitable vehicles. But the original Rockefeller Foundation
itself remained firmly in the hands of a liberal establishment
independent of the family.<a name="vocab"></a>
<P>
<b>THE MULTICULTURAL<br>
VOCABULARY OF THE BOARD</b>
<P>
Today, the legacy of an independent Rockefeller Foundation lives
on. One current board member characterizes the Rockefeller Foundation
Board of Trustees as &quot;more of a Who's Who board than a Social
Register board.&quot;
<P>
The current chair is Alice Stone Ilchman, president of Sarah Lawrence
College. Establishmentarians past and present like C. Douglas
Dillon, Cyrus Vance, and the late Dean Rusk have served, as have
media figures like pundit Bill Moyers, actor Alan Alda, and former
Times-Mirror Chairman Tom Johnson, now head of CNN, and the late
Disney exective Frank Wells. It is no surprise, then, that the
Rockefeller Foundation enjoys exceptionally good press coverage.
<P>
Moreover, as one observer remarked to Foundation Watch, &quot;When
you have two billion dollars you don't have any public relations
problems. Everybody loves you&quot;.
<P>
Perhaps for these reasons, and despite the increasing notoriety
of multiculturalism's excesses, the role of the Rockefeller Foundation
has escaped public criticism. The Rockefeller Foundation's officers
and staff have been careful to avoid the limelight and declined
to respond to Foundation Watch's requests for interviews. However,
several current and former board members freely offered their
opinions of the Foundation's cultural agenda.
<P>
The immediate former chairman of the Rockefeller Foundation board
of directors is Dr. John Robert Evans, a Canadian physician and
educator who is currently chairman of the parent company of the
Toronto Star. He told Foundation Watch that the board of trustees
had approved the Foundation's commitment to diversity and multiculturalism
because of the importance of &quot;understanding difficulties
across cultures&quot; and the need to appreciate &quot;the strength
of African American and Hispanic arts.&quot; Evans, who has served
on the Rockefeller Foundation board for fourteen years, explained
that the board's &quot;general tendency was to look at 'emerging'
areas&quot; in the arts and humanities rather than fund traditional
artistic disciplines and institutions. He said the &quot;style
of the Rockefeller Foundation&quot; was that &quot;non-expert
trustees take an interest&quot; in all areas of giving, including
the cultural realm.
<P>
Another Rockefeller director said the board was influenced greatly
in the direction of multiculturalism by a Hudson Institute report
called Workforce 2000 issued in the early 1980's. Its analysis
of demographic trends suggested that women and and minorities
held the key to America's social and economic future. However,
a source close to the Hudson Institute told Foundation Watch that
the Rockefeller Foundation &quot;took the wrong message out of
Workforce 2000. The message was that there was a problem in levels
of skills and education, not that we needed 'cultural sensitivity
training.'&quot; The source added that Hudson is currently working
on Workforce 2000 Revisited, which will make an explicit case
against multiculturalism.
<P>
Trustee Daniel P. Garcia, a vice-president of Warner Brothers
and head of the Los Angeles Airport Commission, also told Foundation
Watch that the board of directors was committed to multiculturalism
and diversity. Garcia is a former chairman of the now-defunct
Los Angeles Festival, a multi-ethnic assemblage of street fairs
and performances which banned Eurocentric theatre and dance. The
L.A. Festival was supported in part by the Rockefeller Foundation.
<P>
A Vietnam veteran and advisor to Republican Los Angeles Mayor
Richard Riordan, Garcia says he is proud that a Rockefeller Foundation
grant enabled &quot;the Bellas Artes&quot; dance troupe to come
from Mexico City to New York. Culture, he asserts, &quot;is not
a Eurocentric affair.&quot;
<P>
No art lover would deny Garcia's truism, but there is a vast difference
between a national folkloric dance ensemble and the ethnocentric
&quot;performance artists&quot; Time magazine critic Robert Hughes
has called &quot;all-purpose Barbarians.&quot;
<P>
In The Culture of Complaint (Oxford, 1993), Hughes points out
that &quot;multiculturalism means something less than genuine
curiousity about other cultural forms.&quot; It is unavoidable,
says Hughes, that, &quot;Most art made by white Americans is mediocre.
Most art made by black Americans is mediocre. Most art made by
Chinese-Americans, Japanese-Americans, and American Indians is
mediocre, too. And most art made by women is as mediocre as most
art made by men. The same applies to gays and straights and to
all the other polarities. We must therefore be extremely wary
of the sentimentality that institutional multiculturalism brings.&quot;
<P>
Yet this common-sense view from a respected art critic is out
of favor at the Rockefeller Foundation. Garcia says that Alberta
Arthurs, the Rockefeller Foundation's director of arts and humanities
for the past decade, has promoted diversity and multiculturalism
by following the &quot;general policy&quot; of the board of directors.
In 1990, Rockefeller Foundation president Peter Goldmark submitted
a copy of this policy to the U.S. Senate.
<P>
Its declared goal: &quot;The encouragement of creative artists...whose
work can advance international and intercultural work in this
country...supporting the flow of art between Third World cultures
and the United States, and increasing opportunities...for ethnic
populations in the United States.&quot;
<P>
At least one insider, however, is not impressed with Rockefeller's
policy, noting: &quot;What goes on at Rockefeller is that they
are just another group following the way culture seems to be going.
Large foundations are followers, not leaders, of what's going
on in the world.&quot;<a name="record"></a>
<P>
<b>THE ROCKEFELLER RECORD</b>
<P>
This was not always the case. The official mission of the Foundation
is to promote &quot;the well-being of mankind throughout the world.&quot;
In the sciences, for example, the Rockefeller Foundation has a
proud legacy of leadership in eliminating such infectious diseases
as yellow fever and hookworm. The Foundation also has played a
leading role in the so-called &quot;green revolution&quot; that
has spurred agricultural productivity through scientific research.
To this day, approximately fifty percent of the Foundation's budget
goes to three areas where it has been a pioneer: public health,
agriculture, and population control. Indeed, John D. Rockefeller
3rd once joked to reporters, &quot;If my parents had been exposed
to today's ideas of family planning, my brothers Win [Winthrop,
former Governor of Arkansas] and David [former chairman of the
Chase Manhattan Bank] might not have made it.&quot;
<P>
The Rockefeller Foundation is the eighth largest foundation in
the United States, with an asset portfolio worth some $2,364,552,922,
according to the most recent accounting in The Chronicle of Philanthropy.
In 1993 the Foundation distributed grants of some $93,260,988,
a little under four percent of assets.
<P>
Today the Foundation has an annual arts and humanities budget
of about $13 million, not including the Bellagio Study Center
in Italy, which provides accomodation for scholars and artists.
From 1965 to 1989 the Foundation spent about $73 million on the
arts. In 1993, the Rockefeller Foundation ranked eleventh in giving
to the arts and seventh in giving to the humanities, according
to appendices in Looking Ahead: Private Sector Giving to the Arts
and Humanities (December, 1995), a Foundation-sponsored study
for the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities. Author
Nina Kressner Cobb's analysis reveals that Rockefeller spent about
three times as much on the arts (161 grants totalling $10,403,575)
as on the humanities ($3,405,150 for 38 grants).
<P>
But Rockefeller's influence exceeds even its large size. The reasons
are manifold. The Rockefeller name alone, despite the absence
of actual family control, associates the Foundation not only with
great wealth, but with great American cultural institutions: the
University of Chicago, New York's Museum of Modern Art and the
Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, institutions which command
respect and due deference. Moreover, the Rockefeller family and
various Foundations have been enormously influential in the formation
of a national arts policy, a notion unheard of before the 1960s.
<P>
For example, The Rockefeller Brothers Fund, a family grantmaker,
paid for the 1965 study The Performing Arts: Problems and Prospects
(McGraw-Hill) conducted by a Rockefeller Panel chaired by John
D. Rockefeller 3rd, and staffed by Nancy Hanks, later to become
National Endowment for the Arts chairman. The establishment of
the National Endowment for the Arts can be traced directly to
that report.
<P>
Just as the Rockefellers rationalized, bureaucratized and attempted
to monopolize the oil industry, their institutional offspring
have performed the same function for a once-freewheeling arts
world. The arts grantsmakers have mangaged the growth of arts
administration by funding the creation of a corporate and government
arts bureaucracy (sometimes called &quot;public-private partnership&quot;)
to replace the once all-powerful individual impresario. For the
Rockefeller Foundation, three individuals have been key.<a name="hanks"></a>
<P>
<b>NANCY HANKS: PRESENT AT THE CREATION</b>
<P>
Nancy Hanks did not work directly for the Rockefeller Foundation.
Beginning in 1953, Hanks worked as confidential assistant to Nelson
Rockefeller, with whom she &quot;fell hopelessly in love,&quot;
according to Alice Goldfarb Marquis's account in Art Lessons:
Learning from the Rise and Fall of Public Arts Funding (Basic
Books, 1995).
<P>
Over the years, Marquis says, Hanks &quot;was so enchanted with
her lover that she mended his socks, baked his birthday cake,
and paid for lunch, when, as usual, he had no cash in his wallet.&quot;
<P>
In return, &quot;Nelson showered her with gifts, including airline
tickets, drawings and etchings by Degas and Picasso, and a $200,000
securities portfolio.&quot; Marquis says the romance ended in
1955 when a press aide to the newly-elected Governor of New York
State told Rockefeller he had to &quot;get her out of here.&quot;
In 1956 she was made a key staffer for the Special Studies Project
of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund.
<P>
Although she had been &quot;shipped out,&quot; Hanks &quot;remained
a creature of the Rockefeller family,&quot; researching arts policy
for the Rockefeller report and helping to found the Arts Council
of America, still a powerful arts lobby.
<P>
Former NEA Chairman Livingston Biddle, then a top staffer for
Senator Claiborne Pell (D-RI), remembers that Nancy Hanks accompanied
John D. Rockefeller 3rd when he testified before Congress in 1965
on the NEA's behalf. Biddle recalled in his memoir, Our Government
and the Arts (American Council on the Arts, 1989), &quot;I am
sure that Nancy's fine hand was visible in the Rockefeller statement.&quot;
<P>
After the election, and backed by &quot;Rockefeller Republicans,&quot;
Hanks was appointed the second chairman of the NEA by Richard
Nixon in 1969. On her watch the NEA budget increased fifteen-fold.
In 1966 the agency had only 28 full-time staffers. By 1977 Hanks
presided over 220 employees processing over 14,000 grant applications
annually.
<P>
Then-Congressman John Brademas (D-IN), later to serve on the Rockefeller
Foundation Board and currently chairman of the President's Committee
on the Arts and Humanities, is reported by Marquis to have &quot;noted
with some envy that 'a well-placed call from Nancy triggers calls
from all over the country and these people can exercise considerable
pressure.'&quot;
<P>
When President Nixon reappointed Hanks to the NEA chairmanship
in 1973, he joked that NEA funding had increased by 900 percent.
&quot;That is why we are reappointing you here,&quot; he said.
&quot;We don't want anything else increasing by that amount.&quot;
<P>
Even when controversy erupted over the NEA's support of controversial
items like Erica Jong's feminist comic best-seller Fear of Flying
or a one word poem _ the word was &quot;LIGHGHT&quot; _ which
received a $500 grant, Hanks used her connections and political
savvy to quell opposition. While not an employee of the Rockefeller
Foundation, Hank's example has inspired the generation of cultural
bureaucrats who followed her.<a name="center"></a>
<P>
<b>THE CENTER AND THE MARGINS</b>
<P>
The Rockefeller Foundation has not always always been committed
to the cultural margins. In the 1960's, most of the grants were
for more mainstream projects. A Rockefeller Foundation time-line,
called The Rockefeller Foundation: 1913 to 1988, bears witness
to this trend.
<P>
In 1935 the Foundation established the film library at the Museum
of Modern Art in New York. In 1936 it supported travelling productions
of Shakespearean drama. In 1942 the academic discipline of American
cultural studies was established with Rockefeller funds, which
also subsidized Dumas Malone's biography of Thomas Jefferson.
<P>
In 1946, Rockefeller gave some $7.5 million for education of Southern
blacks.The Rockefeller and Ford Foundations were among the earliest
backers of Lincoln Center in New York, giving matched donations
of $2.5 million each in 1957. In 1962 the Rockefeller Foundation
gave $7 million to support publication of the Lincoln, Hamilton,
Madison, and Wilson papers. In 1963 some $85 million provided
scholarships for black university students, and summer tutoring
programs at Princeton, Dartmouth and Oberlin. In 1967 major grants
went to the Eliot Feld Ballet, the North Carolina Dance Theatre,
and the Agnes de Mille Dance Theater.
<P>
However, in 1967 major grants also went to the &quot;experimental&quot;
La Mama Theatre Company and to Joseph Papp's Public Theatre. In
1973 Rockefeller began funding &quot;women's studies&quot; programs
at Radcliffe, Sarah Lawrence, and Harvard Divinity School. In
1978 the Foundation commissioned a report on the &quot;crisis&quot;
in the humanities. In 1981 the Foundation supported minimalist
composers Philip Glass and Steve Reich.
<P>
After the NEA became operational in the late 1960's the role of
the grantmaking foundations changed. Instead of providing grants
which would allow arts institutions to flourish in an essentially
private sector economy, the foundations would now make provocative
grants to supplement the public sector support on which arts institutions
grew increasingly dependent, and to &quot;leverage&quot; public
support for the avant-garde.
<P>
Michael Straight, NEA's deputy director in the Nixon administration
indicates in his book Twigs for an Eagle's Nest (Devon Press,
1979) that &quot;A number of foundations agreed [with the primacy
of the federal role] and decided to cut back their support for
the arts.&quot; Straight, who later confessed that he was the
&quot;fifth man&quot;- turned FBI informant in the 1930s Kim Philby
Cambridge spy ring, was Nancy Hanks's troubleshooter at the NEA,
responsible for &quot;flagging&quot; controversial grants such
as one to George Plimpton's The American Literary Anthology for
a pornographic Ed Sanders story.
<P>
That was then. Private sources could and did take up the slack
in the &quot;flagged&quot; cases. But in the 1980's the Rockefeller
Foundation decided that its priority would be not only to fund
that which would not otherwise be funded, but to insist that the
Federal government fund it, too.<a name="power"></a>
<P>
<b>PETER GOLDMARK: POWER OPERATOR</b>
<P>
By the mid 1980s The Rockefeller Foundation's had strengthened
its commitment to the multicultural agenda. That agenda is shared
by two key figures, Peter Goldmark and Alberta Arthurs. Through
their control of Rockefeller's arts budget, they share responsibility
for the trend in giving which places &quot;diversity&quot; ahead
of quality in the arts.
<P>
Peter C. Goldmark, Jr., age 56, is the current president of the
Rockefeller Foundation. He was recruited to his position in 1988
by his employer, Times Mirror president Thomas Johnson who, as
a Foundation director, headed a search committee established by
the board. At the time, Goldmark was a senior vice-president of
the Eastern division of Times Mirror. (Goldmark's succeeded Richard
Lyman, a former Stanford University president who resigned under
savage criticism over his performance. Lyman's record was &quot;slouching
towards senility,&quot; wrote Waldemar Nielsen in The Golden Donors,
a major study of grantmaking foundations.)
<P>
The son of the maverick inventor of the long-playing record who
later became head of CBS Labs, Peter Goldmark Jr. is a Harvard
graduate, was once a prep-school history teacher at the Putney
School in Vermont, and worked in the War on Poverty's Office of
Economic Opportunity during the Johnson Administration. A seasoned
political veteran, he also has worked for New York Mayor John
Lindsay, New York Governor Hugh Carey, and Massachusetts Governor
Francis Sargent.
<P>
Goldmark is a former executive director of the Port Authority
of New York and New Jersey. But although praised for his personal
style as an administrator, he has a spotty record of accomplishment.
Former Governor Hugh Carey gives Goldmark a mixed review. &quot;He
didn't succeed fully at what he had hoped to do,&quot; Carey told
an interviewer for Manhattan, Inc. in 1988.
<P>
Likewise, a 1988 New York Times business section profile offered
this faint praise of Goldmark: &quot;He cannot completely hide
the boredom brought on by narrowing his sights to the challenges
facing a single company. It is obvious to those around him that
he will fit more naturally into his new role, where he can spread
his attentions to global concerns.&quot;
<P>
Goldmark's global concerns are embodied in the rhetoric of social
obligation and racial awareness. In 1968 he co-wrote the preface
for the Kerner Commission Report, which was the Johnson Administration's
response to civil unrest. His words include the famous refrain,
&quot;Our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one
white _ separate and unequal. What white Americans have never
fully understood _ but what the Negro can never forget _ is that
white society is deeply implicated in the ghetto. White institutions
created it, white institutions maintain it, and white society
condones it.&quot;
<P>
Upon taking the Rockefeller post, Goldmark told The New York Times
that he would concentrate his attention on &quot;the underclass.&quot;
&quot;Nobody knows who they are, what they do, how they stay alive,
or why they are so totally cut off from the institutions of American
life. The only institution they come in contact with is the criminal
justice system,&quot; he told The Times' Kathleen Teltsch. &quot;The
underclass is not a topic to pursue from the library. You get
out and look for them.&quot;
<P>
Another guilty liberal? In the 1991 Rockefeller Foundation annual
report Goldmark's sense of shame assumed universal proportions:
&quot;To survive as a species of promise rather than a race of
destruction will require of us a degree of planetary cooperation
that we have barely begun to imagine. That should prompt us to
prepare soberly for the test of effectiveness. The history of
the 90's demands it.&quot;
<P>
Goldmark is well-regarded by associates and has been described
as charming and considerate. The secretaries of Rockefeller Foundation
board members know him for his Christmas gifts, which usually
are &quot;third world crafts, a pillow or embroidery,&quot; according
to one recipient.
<P>
Behind the geniality and the social conscience, however, Goldmark
runs hard. He craves power, Goldmark told Manhattan Inc. &quot;We're
very bad about talking about power in American culture. We're
probably more awkward talking about power than we are about sex.
We don't have much of a vocabulary of how to talk about power,&quot;
he said. &quot;But to exercise power...you have to believe that
every action you take is important, that every word you say is
heard.&quot;<a name="woman"></a>
<P>
<b>ALBERTA ARTHURS: A WOMAN OF INFLUENCE</b>
<P>
In the art world, power is typically exercised quietly, gloved
in velvet, behind panelled doors. As Tom Wolfe noted in The Painted
Word, the public is not invited into the decision-making process.
The results are merely announced, like weddings and funerals,
in the pages of The New York Times. This is certainly true of
Alberta Arthurs and her management style as Director of Arts and
Humanities. Immensely influential, while extremely private, Arthurs
is in the vanguard of Rockefeller's arts and humanities efforts.
She annually distributes about $13 million to some 200 successful
applicants.
<P>
While Goldmark's attentions are focused on the broadest aspects
of urban affairs, global environmental matters, and the goals
of free expression, Arthurs has made sure for over ten years that
the interests of feminism, multiculturalism, and &quot;diversity&quot;
define the Rockefeller Foundation's politicized giving in the
arts.
<P>
Among the recipients of Rockefeller Foundation largesse during
her 1994 term:
<P><ul>
<li>$25,000 to the ACLU Foundation, Inc. for the &quot;Arts Censorship

<li>1994-95 Rockefeller Foundation Humanities Fellowships advertised

at Princeton University, and Claiming Social Equity and Cultural
Rights, Centro de Studios Pertorriquenos, at Hunter College, New
York.</ul>
<P>
This list is just a sampling of the venues and artists Arthur's
Rockefeller program supports. And this Foundation support for
the &quot;cutting edge&quot; can clearly be laid at Arthur's feet.
<P>
For Arthurs was already in charge of Rockefeller's arts and humanities
grants under Richard Lyman, Goldmark's predecessor. An ardent
and active feminist whom some critics call &quot;the Wicked Witch
of the West Side,&quot; she is a career academic and former college
president. A 1954 graduate of Wellesley College, Arthurs married
in 1959 and taught English at Rutgers University from 1964-73.
She earned a Bryn Mawr Ph.D. in English completing a dissertation
on landscape in the work of Jane Austen in 1972.
<P>
In 1973 Arthurs became Dean of Admissions at Radcliffe College,
then was named Dean of Undergraduate Affairs at Harvard from 1975-77,
and then served two years as president of Chatham College, a small
liberal-arts institution near Pittsburgh. She has been director
of Arts and Humanities at the Rockefeller Foundation since then.
<P>
In the late 1980's the Rockefeller Foundation began to provide
an annual one million-dollar grant to establish a new organization,
National Video Resources, Inc. Arthurs became chairman of the
board of the new enterprise. It helps to distribute &quot;independent&quot;
and &quot;avant-garde&quot; videos to libraries, schools and colleges.
To do this, it &quot;trains&quot; librarians, distributes bibliographies,
and sometimes arranges for donations.
<P>
In other words, National Video Resources subsidizes receptivity
to the type of marginal productions the Rockefeller Foundation
typically funds _ productions which would not ordinarily be included
in school curricula or library holdings without this outside &quot;incentive.&quot;
In the for-profit sector, such operations are sometimes called
bribery, kickbacks, and public relations.
<P>
No matter. Arthurs had been unafraid to advocate on behalf of
both the NEA and the NEH. Daniel Garcia, a Rockefeller Foundation
trustee, told Foundation Watch that Arthurs had &quot;given millions&quot;
over the years in matching grants to NEA projects.
<P>
Since Frohnmayer's capitulation, Arthurs has been vocal in lobbying
for the NEA. In 1993 Arthurs co-authored an op-ed piece for The
Los Angeles Times with NEA Visual Arts Policy panelist Douglas
Davis called &quot;News Flash To Washington: Americans Like the
Arts: Culture: Polls Show Strong Support For Government Leadership
and Assistance In All Fields of Creative Endeavor.&quot;
<P>
Arthurs was unrepentant, despite public outrage at the NEA's track
record of pornography, blasphemy, and horror, and despite punitive
budget cuts approved by a Democratic Congress spearheaded by the
then-Appropriations Committee Chairman, Senator Byrd (D-WV), Arthurs
argued for &quot;additional dollars&quot; for the NEA and NEH.
<P>
As recently as last year, Arthurs testified on behalf of the National
Endowment for the Humanities before the a Senate committee. Supporting
the NEH's multiculturalist promoter Sheldon Hackney, Arthurs declared
&quot;the Endowment is essential for scholarship.&quot; This was
shortly after former NEH chairmen William Bennett and Lynne Cheney
both called for the abolition of the Humanities Endowment.
<P>
If the Rockefeller Foundation faced the truth it would acknowledge
that its policies of multiculturalism and diversity have put the
future of the Arts and Humanities endowments in peril. The Rockefeller
Foundation's insistence that the federal cultural agencies maintain
these policies in the face of public outrage has sealed their
doom.

<b><i>Why the Wealthy Give: The Culture of Elite Philanthropy </i>by Francie
Ostrower (Princeton University Press, 1995, 190 pages)
<P>
Reviewed by Robert Huberty</b>
<P>
Why the Wealthy Give won't really help a fundraiser searching
for tips _ it's too poorly written for one thing _ but it does
present some useful ideas and information to suggest why the nonprofit
sector is in its current fix.
<P>
Ostrower, a Harvard professor of sociology, interviewed 88 very
wealthy New York City-area donors in the late 1980s. She wanted
to see whether philanthropy shaped a distinctive outlook and way
of life.
<P>
The author looked for differences and tensions in her group, which
she had randomly selected from lists of big givers. Categorizing
donors by religion and ethnicity, sex and marital status, and
areas and amounts of giving, she was able to discover some interesting
variations. And by getting the donors to talk about themselves,
she learned much about what they thought they were doing.
<P>
What these unidentified donors told Ostrower has led her to conclude
that they think of themselves as a distinctive social elite, and
they regard philanthropy as an activity of their class and a symbol
of their status.
<P>
Many organize their daily lives around philanthropy: they conscientiously
serve on nonprofit boards, generously volunteer their time and
expertise, and enjoy evenings at fancy galas and receptions that
raise money for favorite charities. They recognize each other
at such events and are proud to feel an obligation to contribute
to what one called, &quot;the whole range from what's acutely
necessary to what is desirable.&quot;
<P>
However, while most Americans' philanthropy goes heavily to religion,
this figured less prominently in Ostrower's donors' priorities.
The reason may have to do with Ostrower's methodology. Surprisingly,
when Ostrower constructed her initial database she did not include
churches or synagogues.
<P>
This biases her study, since it makes her sample appear less religious
than wealthy New York City donors may be. Certainly, it resulted
in fewer interviews with wealthy Catholics, distorting the world
of philanthropy which Ostrower claims to be describing.
<P>
In other words, while Ostrower may accurately describe &quot;her&quot;
social elite, it may not be representative of New York's let alone
the nation's.
<P>
Still, the results are interesting. Ostrower's donors' favorite
causes are education (especially higher education) and cultural
institutions. Hospitals and other health-related groups follow.
Those who graduated from the most prestigious private institutions
were more likely to have made large gifts to alma mater. This
will give no comfort to those hoping for more alumni help in fighting
political correctness.
<P>
Social service agencies received more support from Jews and unmarried
women. Married women were more likely to give to culture. Public
policy, advocacy, and environmental causes had few supporters.
Jewish-federations were well-funded, no doubt because 49 donors
in the sample were Jewish, more than half.
<P>
Ostrower's sampling are typically American in many ways: they
respect individual accomplishment, distrust government power,
and believe private institutions can carry out many functions
better than government.
<P>
They value individual choice and they believe government funding
will politicize decision-making.
<P>
Unlike many Marxist academics who think such attitudes disguise
selfish class interests, Ostrower takes the donors at their word.
She thinks their sense of mission is sincere, and generally finds
their approach to giving open-minded, self-critical and pluralistic.
<P>
Yet her donors also voice attitudes which betray certain limitations
in their thinking. These prevent them from doing as much good
as they might hope to achieve. And they contribute to serious
problems in philanthropy.
<P>
One trouble with social elites is that they don't want to interact
too much with other people. It's hard to involve donors with anyone
other than their own kind.
<P>
Ostrower found that her donors did not want to give to individuals.
Rather, they contributed to prestigous organizations. Or, as she
puts it in the language peculiar to social scientists: &quot;Identifications
with organizations become a central focus of donor loyalties and
concern.&quot;
<P>
Her donors seem to exert too little muscle, not too much. Some
donors gripe that they have no influence over the nonprofit professionals
who set their groups' agendas. Others seem only to want the status
of an institutional affiliation.
<P>
But by holding themselves aloof, donors fail to exercise a power
of the purse which is uniquely theirs. Organizations cannot be
accountable to donor intentions if they don't express them.
<P>
Ostrower's sample is also not very charitable. Because building
prestige institutions is so important to them, Ostrower discovered
that her donors sharply differentiate philanthropy from charity
to individuals.
<P>
Many saw direct services to the needy _ homeless shelters, soup
kitchens, disaster relief and the like _ as an entirely separate
activity. Said one donor, &quot;I do not give money to buy clothes
and food for individuals. My tax money goes for that.&quot; What
the comment demonstrates is that the rich, like the poor, will
succumb to the culture of welfare dependency.
<P>
Finally, Ostrower's donors don't seem to have given enough serious
thought to the long-term and public policy consequences of their
wealth. They believe they have a right to choose who will receive
their money, but are ambivalent about leaving estates to their
children, and leery about philanthropy by bequest -- recognizing
that their intentions may not be honored.
<P>
Almost unanimously, they rejected a hypothetical proposal to eliminate
the tax deduction for charitable giving in order to increase government
support for welfare and cultural activities. Says Ostrower in
one of her clearer sentences, &quot;Money that goes to government
is seen as taken away, while money donated to philanthropy is
seen as money given away.&quot;
<P>
Yet large majorities agreed that government should spend more
for health care, the arts, higher education, social services,
and environmental and animal protection.
<P>
The problem is Ostrower's donors want their philanthropy to &quot;make
a difference&quot; but they can only imagine this within the context
of the familiar. They relate philanthropy to personal attachments
and social networks more than to individual charity or public
policies towards broad social goals. 
<P>
In wanting to &quot;protect&quot; their philanthropy from welfare
and other social problems that they perceive as intractable, the
rich, like all of us, may really be yielding to a despair that
nothing can be done about the poor. That's a mistake which philanthropy
can correct once donors recognize that government isn't taking
care of the big problems now, and can't be expected to do so in
the future.

<P>
 Welfare reform is well under way in the states.  Despite President
Clinton's recent veto of welfare reform legislation, many states
have received or are seeking waivers from the federal government
to reform their welfare systems.  This issue presents contributions
by leaders of state public-policy think tanks.  It examines reforms
already made in six states and proposes new ideas to make charities
and nonprofit organizations key providers of private welfare services.
<P>
 Lawrence W. Reed, president of the Midland, Michigan-based Mackinac
Center for Public Policy, describes Michigan Governor John Engler's
ambitious welfare reforms.  He notes, however, that charities
must become more involved in these efforts.  David G. Tuerck,
executive director of Boston's Beacon Hill Institute, offers a
tax-credit proposal that would address Reed's concern.  It would
shift welfare responsibilities from government to charities.
<P>
 Three articles follow which emphasize the importance of moving
welfare recipients into the workforce.  Andrew Bush, a research
fellow and director of the Welfare Policy Center at the Indianapolis-based
Hudson Institute, argues that Indiana should adopt an aggressive
work-based welfare program.  Michael E. Hartmann, Director of
Research at the Milwaukee-based Wisconsin Policy Research Institute,
describes a strong workfare program likely to be signed into law
this month by Governor Tommy Thompson.  Tom Tancredo and Dwight
Filley, president and senior fellow, respectively, of the Golden,
Colorado-based Independence Institute, discuss the role of fatherlessness
in long-term welfare dependency and propose workfare and other
programs to address this problem.
<P>
 Two concluding articles from Washington state think tanks emphasize
why private efforts to help the needy are more likely to succeed
than government programs.  John Carlson, chairman of the Seattle's
Washington Institute for Policy Studies, uses a &quot;thought
experiment&quot; to outline principles that should be the basis
of any welfare reform effort.  Lynn Harsh and Bob Williams, executive
director and president, respectively, of the Olympia-based Evergreen
Freedom Foundation, discuss ways to implement some of these principles
in their state.
<P>
 Next month's issue will carry additional articles by state think
tank leaders on state-level welfare reform.
<P>
<B><A NAME="mich">Michigan: Have We Gone Far Enough?</A></B>
<P>
<B>by Lawrence W. Reed</B>
<P>
 Welfare programs may well be the most unpopular of all government
initiatives--criticized by social scientists who observe the results,
disdained by taxpayers who pay the bills, and often unloved by
many of those who collect the benefits.  Even the Maryland State
Conference of the NAACP says that welfare &quot;is a major contributory
factor to the crime problems we face today.&quot;  Unlike private
efforts that stress character-building, one-on-one mentoring and
a spiritual dimension, the impersonal public dole does nothing
to overcome &quot;behavioral poverty&quot;--the breakdown in values
and behavior needed to promote self-sufficiency and build stable
families.
<P>
 Michigan Governor John M. Engler recognized this in 1991 when
he embarked on what has become one of the most ambitious efforts
to reform welfare in the states.  Michigan abruptly ended the
General Assistance program for able-bodied, childless adults in
October 1991 and adopted a &quot;social contract,&quot; whereby
welfare recipients are expected to seek work, go to school, or
perform community service in exchange for benefits.
<P>
 To encourage work, the state now allows welfare recipients to
keep more of their earnings without having that count as income
against their welfare checks.  Before this change, the tax-free
value of AFDC, food stamps, and Medicaid for a family of three
in Michigan (about $1,000 per month) was roughly equal to the
income one could earn at a minimum wage or entry-level job.  This
hardly promoted work over welfare.
<P>
 The Engler reforms have produced tangible results.  Nearly 25
percent of Michigan's AFDC recipients are now working.  This is
three times the national average and up from 16 percent just two
years ago.  Average earnings from work and hours spent in volunteer
activity are up as well.  Fewer families are receiving assistance
than at any time since 1989.
<P>
 While those results are welcome, it's too early to break out
the champagne.  Governor Engler himself expressed a healthy skepticism
about both federal and state welfare reforms when he told ABC's
David Brinkley in November 1994, &quot;Replacing liberal micromanagement
with conservative micromanagement would only be a slight improvement;
it's time for wholesale reform.&quot;  By this, he means further
reducing the role of government and making welfare a largely private
initiative.  In the words of columnist John Fund of the <I>Wall
Street Journal</I>, &quot;Ask yourself: If you had a financial
windfall and wanted to help the poor, would you even <I>think</I>
about giving time or a check to the government?&quot;
<P>
 In Michigan, a growing number of private initiatives to help
the poor are already underway, some of which sprouted in direct
response to the state's abolition of General Assistance.  For
instance, Hard Times Cafe in Harrison provides counseling, job
placement, and other services to the needy.  Clients earn &quot;Hard
Times Dollars&quot; that are redeemable for personal-needs items
such as soap and toothpaste.  These are donated by individuals
and local businesses.
<P>
 With hardly a murmur about separation of church and state, the
state of Michigan has contracted with the Salvation Army to operate
a statewide network of 120 homeless shelters.  For the amazingly
low cost of $10 per person per day, the Army provides a bed, two
meals, and personal interaction with the needy aimed at reducing
behavioral poverty.
<P>
 The privatization of welfare could be pursued in a number of
ways.  A cold turkey approach would simply abolish welfare and
rely on families, churches, and charities to help the needy. 
The response might pleasantly surprise some who think that only
government can perform this task.  A more gradual transition to
a privatized scenario would provide more public recognition of
charities and greater incentives for charitable giving.  State
and local governments might also contract out more welfare services,
giving those in need a choice between increasingly proscriptive
and punitive government programs and private charity, which is
more likely to offer personalized help.
<P>
 Our welfare system has produced such disastrous consequences
that it's hard to imagine how a radical overhaul could make things
worse.  If we revitalize the American ideals of charity and self-help,
we might end up spending less for success than the government
now spends for failure.
<P>
<B><A NAME="mass">Massachusetts: Why State-Level Reform Won't Work</A></B>
<P>
<B>by David G. Tuerck</B>
<P>
 Welfare reform is progressing in many states.  Even if President
Clinton vetoes future federal welfare reform bills, a number of
states will continue to undertake reforms of their own.  Massachusetts,
justifiably infamous for its bloated welfare state, adopted sweeping
reforms last year under Governor William Weld:
<P>
<ul>
 <li>Ablebodied welfare recipients whose youngest children have
entered school must work at least 20 hours per week in a job or
community service program.
<P>
 <LI>Parents under age 18 must live with a responsible adult or
in a supervised group home.  They must stay in school or in a
GED program.
<P>
 <LI>A family cap denies additional benefits to recipients for children
born after August 1996.
<P>
 <LI>Ablebodied recipients' benefits are cut by 2.75 percent.
<P>
 </ul>Just to make a point, Massachusetts renamed its welfare bureaucracy:
the Department of Public Welfare became the Department of Transitional
Assistance.

<P>
 Overdue as these reforms are, they do not go to the heart of
the problem.  The reason lies in the method by which we fund welfare.
 Under the existing system, taxpayers send their money to Washington,
where most flows into a welfare bureaucracy and only a fraction
eventually reaches the pockets of the poor.  As long as welfare
is taxpayer-funded but government-controlled, it will remain an
expensive entitlement offered by a faceless bureaucracy.  The
seeds of poverty will be left to sprout anew.
<P>
 The best reform approach is to make welfare taxpayer-funded and
taxpayer-controlled.  A Beacon Hill Institute Policy Study, <I>Giving
Credit Where Credit Is Due: A New Approach to Welfare Funding</I>,
proposes that individual taxpayers, both itemizers and non-itemizers,
receive a 100 percent federal tax credit for contributions to
eligible charities for up to 25 percent of their federal tax liability.
 This would shift control of $115 billion in federal welfare spending
from government to individuals.  Eligible charities would be 501(c)(3)
organizations that offer services now provided by government under
meanstested programs, such as AFDC, Food Stamps, and housing assistance.
 These organizations would vie for taxpayer support by offering
superior services to the needy.
<P>
 Why so radical a proposal?  A few facts show why the welfare
system is broken.  Although the poverty rate declined from 1959
to 1994, there are still more than 38 million Americans (14.5
percent of the total population) living in poverty.  Poverty affects
women and children more than others.  The poverty rate was 54
percent for single female headsofhousehold in 1994.  The rate
for children rose from 14.9 percent in 1970 to 21.8 percent in
1994.
<P>
 These statistics stand out against the backdrop of a vastly expanded
welfare system.  Combined federal and state spending on direct
public aid increased tenfold from $15 billion in 1970 to $142
billion in 1990.  Furthermore, government welfare spending is
highly inefficient.  Only 41 percent of all povertylevel families
receive any government benefits at all.  And almost half of those
receiving benefits are not poor.  More than two-thirds of all
federal welfare spending ultimately ends up in the pockets of
people who are not poor.
<P>
 Welfare is commonly viewed as something the government provides.
 But this view is highly myopic.  Individuals currently give about
$17 billion to private charities that provide services similar
to those provided by government.  Total spending for direct-service
programs is about $132 billion, equal to the $115 billion spent
by the federal government plus $17 billion spent by private charities.
 Contrary to those who believe that charity cannot compensate
for a loss of government welfare payments, a tax credit can be
expected to increase the total amount of welfare for at least
four reasons:
<P>
<ul>
 <LI><I>Increased giving</I>.  The provision of a tax incentive
for charitable contributions amounts to a reduction in the price
of private giving.  This price is equal to the cost, after taxes,
of giving an additional dollar.  Under present law, the price
of giving for a federal taxpayer in the 28 percent tax bracket
is 72 cents.  A 100 percent tax credit would reduce this price
to zero (for donations up to a 25 percent limit).  Provision of
a full tax credit would cause private giving to expand by more
than tax revenues contract, thus causing the total amount of welfare
to expand.
<P>
 <LI><I>Increased voluntarism</I>.  A recent Gallup poll finds that
29 percent, or 70 million, of all Americans volunteer in their
communities.  Those who volunteer also give more to charities.
 The creation of a tax credit would add at least 2 million people
to the pool of volunteers.
<P>
 <LI><I>Increased efficiency and savings</I>.  Most research has
found that the private sector is more cost-efficient than government
in delivering services.  Moreover, nonprofit organizations rely
more on unpaid volunteers than either government or businesses.
<P>
 <LI><I>Reduced crowd-out</I>.  Government spending has been shown
to crowd out private giving.  A one-dollar increase in government
spending decreases private giving by an estimated 10 cents.  The
proposed 100 percent tax credit would eliminate this problem.
</ul>
<P>
 Devolving welfare to the states is one path to reform.  But it
will not succeed if states merely substitute their bureaucracies
for federal bureaucracies.  Optimum welfare reform would shift
responsibility for welfare to private charities.  And tax credits
are the most effective public-policy instrument for achieving
this change.
<P>
<B><A NAME="ind">Indiana: Reorienting Welfare</A></B>
<P>
<B>by Andrew Bush</B>
<P>
 Whether or not the federal government introduces welfare block
grants to the states, Indiana should use the considerable flexibility
it already has to transform the way it helps its neediest families.
 The focus of Indiana's welfare policy should be to help families
become self-sufficient.  Government can best achieve this goal
by recognizing its own limitations and by drawing on the strengths
of charities, community-based organizations, and other private
service providers.
<P>
 The Indianapolis Independence Initiative, or I-3, probably offers
the best model for reforming Indiana's welfare system.  As a graduated
work-based plan currently proposed as an alternative to AFDC in
Marion County, I-3 would dramatically change the orientation of
welfare in two ways:
<P>
<ul>
 <LI>Consistent employment by at least one parent is about the closest
thing there is to a ticket out of poverty.  I-3 would focus on
giving needy families that opportunity by helping able-bodied
parents find immediate work.  Unsubsidized, private-sector employment
would be the primary goal, but those not yet able to obtain such
employment could build their skills and work histories through
partially subsidized jobs or fully subsidized community-service
jobs.  Those with temporary disabilities could &quot;earn&quot;
cash support by performing tasks that would prepare them to support
their families.  I-3's focus on employment and earnings would
help families move quickly into the mainstream working world and
become acclimated to the lifestyle it demands.
<P>
 Rather than ending assistance when parents find jobs, I-3 would
treat initial employment as a first step.  Money used for welfare
benefits would be channeled into services and subsidies to help
low-income working parents remain employed and increase their
capacity to be self-supporting.  Child care, health care, employment
services, and counseling would be available to help families become
and remain employed.
<P>
 <LI>I-3 would open public aid to a wide range of non-government
service providers that would help families pursue self-sufficiency.
 Networks of provider organizations would operate under performance-based
contracts.  By opening up the public-assistance provider system
and judging organizations by performance standards, public assistance
would become more useful, creative, and efficient.
</ul>
<P>
 Private charities and other community-based organizations have
an important role to play in systems such as I-3.  The danger
is that they might seek to recreate the current welfare system.
 It is essential that charities summon all their creativity and
expertise to make work-based public assistance a reality.
<P>
<B><A NAME="wis">Wisconsin: Work Requirements for All Welfare Recipients</A></B>
<P>
<B>by Michael E. Hartmann</B>
<P>
 Wisconsin has imposed stringent work requirements on welfare
recipients and has successfully moved many able-bodied recipients
into productive work.  Only hard-core recipients remain on welfare
in Wisconsin.  A bill that has just passed both houses of the
state legislature by wide margins, &quot;W-2--Wisconsin Works,&quot;
would require all recipients to work.  Spearheaded by Governor
Tommy G. Thompson, it is likely to be signed into law this April.
<P>
 A January 1995 study by welfare expert Lawrence W. Mead found
that between 1989 and 1993, the national AFDC caseload grew by
29 percent, from 10.2 million to 14.1 million.  State caseloads
increased by an average of 35 percent.  But according to the Wisconsin
Department of Health and Social Services, Wisconsin's welfare
caseload fell by 24.5 percent from January 1987 to July 1995--from
98,300 to 70,300 cases.  According to Mead, this was partly because
Wisconsin implemented the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills (JOBS)
program in 1988.  Mandated by Title II of the federal Family Support
Act, JOBS required caseworkers to closely monitor and motivate
welfare recipients in their search for employment.
<P>
 In July 1993, Wisconsin implemented an even tougher employment
requirement for some AFDC recipients, called &quot;Work, Not Welfare&quot;
(WNW).  WNW limits AFDC payments to two years and offers major
job-training services.  To determine the number of hours a recipient
must work or participate in training, WNW combines food stamps
and AFDC into one lump-sum payment that is then divided by the
federal minimum wage ($4.25).  WNW can be credited with reducing
AFDC rolls in Fond du Lac County from 627 in December 1994 to
385 in July 1995 (a 38.6 percent decline), and in Pierce County
from 191 in December 1994 to 117 in July 1995 (a 38.7 percent
decline).
<P>
 If signed by Governor Thompson as expected, the latest proposal--W-2--Wisconsin
Works--will create a &quot;self-sufficiency ladder&quot; for welfare
recipients based on four graduated work options:
<P>
<ul> 
<LI><i>W-2 Transitions</I>.  Recipients unable to perform self-sustaining
work will engage in work activities (e.g., sheltered workshops),
vocational rehabilitation, and counseling.  Twenty-eight hours
of work activity plus 12 hours of job training at $518 per month
will be imposed.  Food stamps will be available.  A time limit
of 24 months may be extended on a case-by-case basis.
<P>
<LI><I>Community-service jobs</I>.  Recipients will learn work
habits and job skills necessary for employment in the private
sector.  Thirty hours of work per week plus ten hours of training
at $555 per month will be imposed.  Like W-2 Transitions, food
stamps will be available and participation will be limited to
24 months.
<P>
<LI> <I>Trial jobs (subsidized employment)</I>.  Recipients' transition
to unsubsidized private employment will initially be subsidized--for
example, when a recipient is willing to work but has little or
no work history.  Forty hours of work per week at market wages
will be imposed, and employers will receive up to $300 per month
in subsidies.  Food stamps and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)
will be available.  Time in the program will be limited to 24
months.
<P>
 <LI><I>Unsubsidized employment</I>.  Recipients will be guided
to the best available immediate job in the private sector.  Forty
hours of work per week at market wages will be imposed, and food
stamps and the EITC will be available.
</ul><P>
 The bill that has just passed the state legislature says that
&quot;the W-2 agency will operate the four major components .
. . in an integrated fashion so that participants are always entering
the highest (i.e., least subsidized) workforce stage possible,
and are moving up to the next level at the earliest opportunity.&quot;
 Those eligible for participation will be &quot;families consisting
of custodial parents and their children age 18 or younger, with
incomes below 115 percent of poverty and with low assets.&quot;
 Health-care and child-care benefits (to which recipients must
make co-payments) are included.  However, to meet predictable
legal challenges to the program by those denied benefits, the
bill states that &quot;an individual is not entitled to benefits
or services under [W-2].&quot;
<P>
 The state legislature modified the governor's original proposal
by:
<P>
<ul>
<LI>Strengthening health-care provisions for pregnant mothers and
new mothers;
<P>
 <LI>Lowering participants' co-payments for child care;
<P>
 <LI>Allowing those in vocational or four-year college programs
to complete their schooling without losing benefits;
</ul>
<P>
 Democratic Assembly Minority Leader Walter J. Kunicki remarked
before passage that &quot;People are afraid not to vote for [W-2].
 No one wants to be on record voting against welfare reform.&quot;
 W-2 is expected to affect more than 53,000 women and their children
and cost $2.1 billion in its first two years--$110 more than under
current welfare spending.
<P>
  Hopefully, Congress will soon pass block grant welfare legislation.
 Otherwise, Wisconsin will have to seek waivers from the Department
of Health and Human Services to implement W-2.  Nonetheless, state
welfare officials see W-2's self-sufficiency ladder as a realistic
way to encourage all welfare recipients, even those heretofore
considered unemployable, to become productive members of society.
<P>
<B><A NAME="colo">Colorado: An Agenda for the State Legislature</A></B>
<P>
<B>by Tom Tancredo and Dwight Filley</B>
<P>
 What if one thing caused most of Colorado's social ills?  And
what if government policies were encouraging that one thing?
<P>
 If these two statements are true, then we can go a long way toward
curing those ills by simply reversing the policies that encourage
that single development.  There is a growing body of evidence
linking the following social pathologies to a common factor: juvenile
delinquency, drug abuse, gang membership, dropping out of school,
homelessness, teenage pregnancy, illiteracy, high infant mortality,
poor prenatal care, poverty, and welfare dependency.  That factor
is the absence of a married father in the household.  Obviously,
the lack of a father is not the only cause, but there is a strong
correlation between these problems and a childhood spent in a
fatherless home.
<P>
 One might think that in an advanced Western democracy, public
policy would be directed toward reducing the number of fatherless
homes and toward encouraging marriage.  But current federal policy
does exactly the opposite.  It penalizes those who are married
and rewards those who are not.
<P>
 The penalties?  A couple considering marriage must get permission
from the government by obtaining a license.  If the government
approves, the couple must pay a fee--a fine if you will.  Once
married, the couple will probably pay a much larger fine--the
so-called marriage penalty of the federal income tax.  They must
pay the fine every year they remain married.  Newspapers have
carried stories about couples who divorce and then live together
to reduce their income taxes.
<P>
 And the rewards for being unmarried?  Government benefits: housing
vouchers, food stamps, day care, and a cash reward--AFDC--that
is paid every month for a child born out of wedlock.  In most
states, this reward is increased with each additional child.
<P>
 What we have here, as they say, is a failure to communicate.
 If the single strongest predictor of the above-mentioned problems
is the absence of a father, why does government policy seem geared
toward driving fathers away?
<P>
 Although Colorado lives under an oppressive burden of federal
laws, we still have considerable latitude to end the perverse
incentives that wreck families and contribute to our social ills.
 AFDC, for example, is a matching fund program.  If the Colorado
legislature refused to fund its share, AFDC would end in the state.
 Similarly, Colorado could revise its income tax code to offset
the federal marriage penalty.
<P>
 The state legislature might also take the following considerations
into account in drafting welfare reform legislation:
<P>
<ul>
 <LI>Recognize that shielding people from the natural consequences
of their destructive actions will result in more destructive actions.
<P>
<LI> Freeze welfare spending at current levels.  This is the only
way to reduce welfare in the long run.
<P>
 <LI>Do not cut funding for current welfare programs that provide
for the disabled and the elderly.
<P>
 <LI>Do not provide government assistance to people who can work.
 If such people are forced to be accountable to their families,
churches, communities, and private charities, they are more likely
to enter the job market and end their destructive behavior than
if they receive aid from an impersonal bureaucracy.  When Michigan
terminated General Assistance for employable, childless adults,
welfare rolls fell by 82,000, and welfare payments by 17 percent.
<P>
 <LI>Enact a meaningful workfare program.  Do not allow a two-year
waiting period before applying workfare requirements.  If workfare
is to succeed in discouraging able-bodied people from going on
welfare, its effect will be strongest at the time of welfare enrollment,
not two years later.
<P>
 <LI>Workfare costs taxpayers more when unmarried mothers have children
under the age of five, because day-care must be provided.  Accordingly,
apply workfare first to able-bodied recipients other than mothers
with young children.  However, mothers who choose to have additional
children while already on welfare should not be exempt from workfare
requirements.
<P>
 <LI>Do not provide welfare to women under 18 unless they live with
a parent or legal guardian.  Too often, the prospect of money
for one's own apartment is an incentive to become pregnant.  Exceptions
should be made if teenagers have left home because of abuse, and
if teenagers lived independently for at least a year before applying
for welfare.
<P>
<LI> Do not increase payments to women who bear more children while
they are welfare recipients.  Working parents get no pay raise
when they have more children.  This policy is already law in New
Jersey, where the number of births to welfare recipients has fallen
by 16 percent.
<P>
<LI> Make AFDC funding contingent upon the mother identifying the
father, if the child was born after 1994.  DNA testing can verify
or refute disputes about paternity.  Require all fathers of AFDC
children born in 1995 or thereafter to pay child support.  If
the father claims that he cannot find employment, put him to work
in community service.  As word spreads that fathering an illegitimate
child will result in a two-decade-long financial obligation, fewer
men may be tempted to &quot;prove their masculinity.&quot;
<P>
 <LI>Consider abolishing AFDC altogether.  Redistribute AFDC funds
to group homes for unwed mothers, adoption programs and, possibly,
orphanages.  A cut-off for AFDC benefits could be phased in to
apply first to women under age 18 (or 21), then extended to women
25 and under (who bear two-thirds of all illegitimate children),
and then to the entire population.  Group homes and orphanages
should be carefully evaluated.
<P>
 <LI>Encourage sex education programs that promote abstinence. 
Many of these have cut pregnancy rates by 40 percent.  By contrast,
programs that provide contraceptive information have virtually
no success in reducing pregnancy.

<P>
<LI> Encourage adoption as the best choice for women who bear children
and lack the resources to raise them properly.
</ul>

<B><A NAME="washi">Washington State: Two Views</A></B>
<P>
<B>I. Needed: A Strong Dose of Common Sense</B>
<P>
<B>by John Carlson</B>
<P>
 &quot;We absolutely will not tolerate the sort of back-door discrimination
against families and children that many today call 'welfare reform.'&quot;
 I can understand Washington Governor Mike Lowry making that statement
in 1966.  But in 1996?  Such unabashed '60s-speak explains much
about the governor's political unpopularity.  He has not learned
from experience.  Experience should tell him that efforts to reform
welfare don't discriminate against the family--the status quo
does.  A young mother can receive a welfare check only if she
doesn't marry the father, doesn't live at home, doesn't find a
job, and doesn't save any money.  You can't get much more anti-family
than that.
<P>
 Statistics bear this out.  Between 1962 and 1992, welfare spending
in the U.S. went up by nearly 1,000 percent in inflation-adjusted
dollars.  At the same time, as former Education Secretary William
Bennett recently wrote in <I>Commentary</I> magazine, poverty
dropped by less than five percent, and illegitimacy soared by
400 percent.  As single-parent households have proliferated, so
have crime rates, drug abuse, drop-out rates in inner-city schools
and teenage pregnancy, keeping the cycle of decay in perpetual
motion.
<P>
 A couple of years ago, after a gang-related shoot-out in one
of Tacoma's rough neighborhoods, a TV station sent in a camera
crew to get people's reactions.  As expected, community leaders
on the scene called for more jobs, fewer guns, and better social
programs.  But one local women knew better.  She looked at the
reporter and simply told the stark truth: &quot;You gotta start
asking, where are the fathers?  What happened to all the men?&quot;
<P>
 That is the question our welfare system cannot answer.  Young
men who father children out of wedlock don't have to take responsibility
for their actions.  The welfare system does it for them.  And
the mother isn't required to identify the father of the child.
 Again, you can't get much more anti-family than that.
<P>
 So what's the answer?  Before getting specific, let's be clear
about standards.  Welfare is supposed to be a temporary, stop-gap
measure to help people who have fallen on hard times.  In that
sense, we should apply the same kind of common sense to welfare
reform that we would use if someone in our own family experienced
trouble.
<P>
 Suppose your divorced sister lost her job.  She has two kids.
 Naturally, you would want to help.  First, you'd give or loan
her some money to pay some bills due at the end of the month.
 Then you'd try to help her find a job.  You'd back up her efforts
to get child support from her ex-husband.  You might buy her some
groceries.
<P>
 But for how long?  Suppose she stopped looking for work.  Suppose
you found out she was using your temporary financial help to buy
drugs.  Or that she was just hanging out with friends at the local
tavern.  Suppose she let her husband off the hook for child support.
 Would you keep subsidizing her behavior?  Of course not.  Which
raises the question, If you wouldn't subsidize the irresponsible
or illegal behavior of your own sister, why are we doing it through
our welfare system for complete strangers?
<P>
 Suppose your sister wasn't irresponsible--she just wasn't motivated.
 Let's say she couldn't find a job that paid as much as she was
earning before.  Wouldn't you expect her to accept a temporary
job that paid less and wait for a better-paying job to come along?
 Would you keep sending her money if she refused to take a lower-paying
job?  What if she couldn't find any jobs in the small town where
she lived?  Wouldn't you tell her after awhile that it was time
to move on to a place where she could find employment?
<P>
 This is the kind of genuine safety net that family members erect
for each other hundreds of thousands of times a year.  It is a
net that would unravel if not tightly woven with reasonable and
sensible expectations about how best to help others.  Why not
apply that same common sense to our welfare system?
<P>
 Fortunately, state Representative Suzette Cooke (R-Kent) has
crafted a welfare reform bill that begins to do exactly that.
 It would limit welfare benefits and include an additional period
of reduced benefits for welfare recipients who are working.  Recipients
who don't look for work would have their benefits reduced.  They
could save money without being penalized, but cash benefits would
not be increased for recipients who have more children.
<P>
 Governor Lowry might find this unfair, but I know him well enough
to say that if he were spending his own money to help someone
in his family, he'd find these conditions perfectly reasonable.
 Extending these standards of common sense to government programs
is long overdue.
<P>
<B><A NAME="washii">II. Dismantling the Welfare Culture</A></B>
<P>
<B>by Lynn Harsh and Bob Williams</B>
<P>
 There she was: a teenage mother pleading her case on TV, warning
state lawmakers of the hardships she would face if her welfare
payments were reduced.  The nicely-dressed, high school dropout
lived with her middle-class parents, but they were financially
stretched, she explained.  The baby's father?  He was not helping
out, nor did she expect him to.  She said that she needed more
time on welfare to get a college education.
<P>
 It was a picture of a welfare system gone awry--a system undergirding
promiscuity and making fatherhood irrelevant; rewarding personal
irresponsibility with a free trip to college; and allowing able
grandparents to shift the responsibility of caring for their grandchild
to the government.  Most Americans have heard similar stories
and realize that the &quot;welfare culture&quot; created by our
current system must be changed.
<P>
 In reviewing new welfare responsibilities that might soon become
the responsibility of states, legislators need to carefully examine
each current program and ask:
<P>
<ul>
 <LI>Is the program a proper function of government?
<P>
 <LI>What is the program's mission, and is that mission worth pursuing?
<P>
<LI>Given the option, would we have mandated the program?  If not,
can it be eliminated?
<P>
 <LI>If government at some level should operate the program, how
can it be done in the most efficient and cost-effective manner?
</ul><P>
 Block-granting welfare money to states should only be viewed
as a short-term approach since it does not substantially change
the relationship between givers (taxpayers) and receivers (welfare
recipients).  As soon as possible, givers must become individuals
and private charities, not different levels of government.  To
move in that direction, states should block grant funds directly
to counties and require them to contract out the delivery of welfare
services on a strict performance basis.  Counties should receive
incentives for involving private charities, and block grants at
all levels should be reduced over time.
<P>
 Washington state legislators began serious welfare reform negotiations
in 1995.  Talks broke down when the Senate refused to discuss
limiting the number of months recipients could collect benefits.
 Negotiations began again this year, but once again faltered over
the issues of time limits, family caps, and cash payments to recipients.
 The House proposal, which will likely be revived again next year,
moves in the right direction.  Among its major provisions:
<P>
<ul>
 <LI>A maximum of 36 months of assistance.  Benefits would be cut
over time.  However, there would be exemptions to the time limit
for those caring for an incapacitated person, a child under two,
and for victims of domestic or sexual assault.
<P>
 <LI> Recipients would sign contracts outlining their responsibilities
and would be required to participate in a job-training and job-search
program (with certain exemptions).
<P>
<LI> Unwed teen mothers would receive no cash payments and would
be restricted in their living arrangements and in the amount of
benefits they could receive.
<P>
<LI> Recipients in job programs would receive full child care and
transitional child care.
<P>
<LI> Unwed mothers would be required to identify the fathers of
their children.
</ul><P>
 We recommend that the state legislature also undertake the following
reforms:
<P>
<ul>
<LI> Stringently enforce child support.
<P>
<LI> Ease restrictions that make adoption difficult.
<P>
<LI> Ease regulations on private charities and offer greater tax
incentives for charitable contributions.
<P>
<LI> Change program incentives so that state welfare agencies redefine
success as the number of people removed from welfare rolls and
placed in long-term employment.
</ul>
<P>
 Interestingly, the mere talk of tough welfare reform seems to
be having an effect.  Fewer people are applying for welfare in
Washington state than last year despite no significant changes
in the law or the economy.  Experts have no explanation for this.
<P>
 We are, however, concerned about the curt dismissal of some programs
that are religious in nature.  Religion-based charities have a
far better track record of helping the needy than centralized
bureaucratic programs.  Mississippi Governor Kirk Fordice's program,
&quot;Faith and Families,&quot; should be replicated in Washington.
 It pairs welfare recipients with a church of their choice and
offers personal, practical, and spiritual guidance.
<P>
 Hundreds of charities, nonprofit organizations, and privatesector
job-training and placement programs already serve the needy. 
Many of them have a proven record of operating efficiently and
with a high degree of accountability.  In the long run, we advocate
abolishing government-run welfare entirely.  Far from being a
cruel or reckless approach, this change would help renew our families,
neighborhoods, churches, and communities--the institutions best
able to serve the needy.  Each of us must set an example and lead
the way.  No government program can compete with that kind of
first-person compassion.

Pick up any news article about crime and somewhere in it you are likely to come across a reference to the  
Sentencing Project, a little known Washington, D.C. think tank which focuses on crime issues.  A Nexis  
search reveals that the group's name has appeared in 219 stories, 71 of them since the start of last year.  <p>
  Although obviously a press darling, the Sentencing Project (TSP) is unlike other Washington think tanks.   
It has none of the glitz of better-known policy groups:  no fancy offices or panelled conference rooms or  
glossy annual report.  What is remarkable about TSP's success is that it promotes its agenda while  
remaining obscure as an organization.  <p>
  Housed in a run-down part of Washington around the corner from the tour buses parked outside Ford's  
Theater, the group promotes what it calls "alternative sentencing programs."  From dingy offices reached  
by an antique elevator, it issues a stream of reports and policy papers whose titles - "Building Alternatives  
Instead of Jails"; "Racial Disparity in `Crack' Cocaine Sentencing"; and "Why `3 Strikes and You're Out'  
Won't Reduce Crime" - remind the reader that the absence of subtlety or nuance is not an invention of talk  
radio.  <p>
  These reports generally hammer away at two points.  The first is that locking up criminals does not reduce  
crime.  The second is that the criminal justice system is rigged against racial minorities.  These conclusions  
find their way to the front pages of major newspapers, the evening television news broadcasts, and the  
speeches of politicians.  <p>
  TSP is virtually a conservative caricature of liberal crime policy.  Rather than focus on the finding of guilt  
and the appropriate punishment for criminal acts, it seeks to uncover the sociology of "root causes" of  
crime.  And it attacks the political motivations of those who favor penalizing criminal behavior.  What is  
astounding is that we are paying for TSP.  The nonprofit 501(c)(3) group is funded through a "major grant"  
from the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Assistance.  <p>
  TSP was founded in 1986 by Malcolm C. Young, who had been associated with the National Council on  
Crime and Delinquency, another liberal crime group.  Young remains TSP's Executive Director.  Assistant  
Director Marc Mauer is its chief spokesman and he writes many TSP reports.  <p>  
  Although most people would consider TSP's notions of justice to be marginal and even kooky, the group  
is not without influence in the criminal law arena, where liberal judges, criminal defense attorneys, and law  
professors continue to take these ideas seriously.  TSP in 1992 increased its visibility by establishing a  
professional association, the National Association of Sentencing Advocates.  TSP also runs the Campaign  
for an Effective Crime Policy, a coalition of "criminal justice professionals" working against  
"demagoguery on crime."  <p>
   Public faith in the criminal justice system has been strained for some time.  Doubts about the system's  
fairness have fueled citizen disgust with political leaders who seem more concerned about the procedural  <p>
rights of criminals than with the suffering of their victims.  How can public confidence be restored when  
tax money is used to finance the advocates of the very policies which provoke the mistrust?  Is it any  
wonder the public is angry?   <p>
  
<a name="race"><b>Race and Imprisonment: What's the Connection?</b></a>  <p>
  The Sentencing Project is best known for its much-publicized work on the nexis between race and  
incarceration.  In 1995, the group released a study which showed one in every three black men between the  
ages of 20 to 29 was under the supervision of the criminal justice system:  either in jail or prison, or on  
parole or probation.  Entitled Young Black Americans and the Criminal Justice System, the study was  
reported in virtually every major media outlet, including the New York Times, Washington Post, Los  
Angeles Times, CNN, and National Public Radio.  Jesse Jackson invoked it during his speech at the  
"Million Man March" in Washington.    <p>
  One major finding of the report is that the war on drugs has a disproportionate impact on minorities.  It  
concludes that the effort by law enforcement authorities to stamp out illegal drugs and various proposals to  
get tough on crime are contributing to a "growing racial disparity in the criminal justice system."  Indeed, it  
claims that the war on drugs has been an "unmitigated disaster" for young blacks.  <p>
  TSP blames the increase in the number of blacks in the criminal justice system on what it sees as a  
lopsided emphasis on convictions relating to crack cocaine.  It attributes this to "police practices that target  
inner-city communities for intensive drug enforcement. . . ."  <p>
  TSP's illogical evasion of responsibility is evident when it blames not drugs but the war on drugs for the  
destruction of a generation of young black males.  Crack cocaine is destructive.  The evidence shows that  
violence is associated with crack cocaine far more than with the powder variety.  As social policy expert  
Douglas Besharov of the American Enterprise Institute has observed:  "The evidence is quite clear . . .  
Crack is a more addictive, violence-creating drug than is powder cocaine.  Period."  <p>
  Underlying TSP's report is the belief that many of those convicted and sent to prison are low-level drug  
offenders who do not pose a threat to society.  However, as Princeton Professor and crime expert John  
DiIulio noted recently in the Washington Post, "virtually all drug offenders behind bars are in for drug  
trafficking, not mere possession" _ and most "have long criminal records."  Says DiIulio, "anyone who  
thinks U.S. attorneys or big-city cops focus their enforcement energies against petty drug criminals must be  
either statistically illiterate or smoking something."  <p>
  The black community has indeed suffered from the scourge of crack cocaine.  But this argues for greater  
vigilance in stamping out its sale and use.  Black families will suffer most from any slackening of law  
enforcement.  While TSP argues that the war on drugs serves to "exacerbate" racial "inequities," its  
solution is to go easy on the drug criminals who devastate inner-city communities.    <p>
  TSP Assistant Director Marc Mauer proposes a "renewed dialogue on drug policy."  He notes obliquely  
that the disciplining of former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders "for advocating a discussion of drug  
policy" indicated a lack of "serious discussion" about substance abuse.  Elders was talking about legalizing  
drugs, and Mauer's euphemistic call for "dialogue" is nothing more than an excuse for starting down the  
road toward drug legalization.    <p>
  TSP's policy research has usefully documented how drug crimes have led to the imprisonment of all too  
many young black men.  But it is tragic for the black community that this research should result in such  
misguided policy recommendations.  These proposals should make the public wary of "policy experts" who  
claim to know the significance of their own findings.  
  <p>
<a name="crime"><b>To Let the Punishment Fit the Crime </b> </a><p>
  TSP's ideas about race and the criminal justice system follow from the group's premise that incarceration  
just doesn't work and that it's simply not an enlightened way to deal with persons convicted of crimes.  The  
group opposes mandatory minimum sentences and "three-strikes-and-you're-out" proposals that require life  
sentences for three-time violent offenders.  TSP says the latter are "harsh" and "divert public attention from  
a full discussion of the causes of violent crime."  Likewise, it opposes truth in sentencing measures that  
restrict parole, and it is hostile to just about anything that increases the penalty for committing a crime. <p> 
  TSP dismisses attempts to introduce greater accountability in criminal law and certainty in sentencing as  
unsophisticated responses to the public's alarm over crime.  It also denigrates them as a way for politicians  
to exploit middle class hysteria.  In 1994, Mauer told the press, "Part of what is driving this [effort to crack  
down on crime] is politicians' simplistic approach to dealing with crime and part is suburban America's  
fears."  <p>  
  Testifying before Congress in 1994, Mauer said that incarceration "has a limited impact on crime" and  
there is no "clear relationship between crime and incarceration."  But if keeping criminals out of prison  
does not increase crime rates one might as well believe that keeping Congress in session will not lead to  
more laws.<p>    
  The Council on Crime in America, a project of the New Citizenship Project, has demonstrated the relation  
of crime and punishment in a recently published study entitled The State of Violent Crime in America.  It  
takes note of the "obvious reality that prisons restrain convicted criminals from committing large numbers  
of crimes that they would be committing if free."  In other words, much serious crime is averted each year  
by keeping convicted criminals behind bars.  The report cites a number of empirical studies which estimate  
that for each additional incarcerated felon, anywhere from 12 to 17 additional crimes will not be committed  
each year.  <p>   
  Moreover, by applying 1973 crime rates to the 1989 population, the report estimates that there were  
60,000 fewer rapes, 323,000 fewer robberies, and 380,000 fewer assaults in 1989.  In other words, contrary  
to the assertions of TSP, increasing the prison population in the 1980s significantly reduced violent crime  
below what it would have otherwise been.  (This is not to suggest that one should take heart about the  
current crime situation; only that it could have been much worse.) <p> 
  This is common sense to most people, but not to TSP, which insists that increasing the number of prisons  
and prisoners has had no effect.  As the Council report observed, "It apparently takes a Ph.D. in  
criminology to doubt that if we released half of all prisoners tonight, we would experience more crime  
tomorrow."<p>  
  Another recent study, this one conducted by the Dallas-based National Center for Policy Analysis,  
bolsters these conclusions.  Focusing on crime in Texas, the report demonstrates how a more aggressive  
incarceration policy has lead to a dramatic reduction in the state's crime rate.  According to the study, the  
overall rate of serious crime in Texas has been cut by 35 percent and is at its lowest level since 1973.  This  
follows a four-year building boom, which has raised prison capacity from 49,000 to 150,000, with the  
state's prison population increasing to 64 percent above the national average.  The data is also interesting in  
that it refutes TSP's mantra that longer sentences do not deter crime:  In Texas, the average time served for  
serious crimes climbed from 1.9 years to 3 years.  <p>
  While TSP argues that prison is a failure, the evidence from the states paints a different picture.  Yet to  
the true believer facts are irrelevant; and TSP remains undaunted.  Not only does it reject the proposition  
that putting criminals in prison reduces crime, it also contends that increasing the number of police will not  
bring the crime rate down.  "There is little relationship between the number of police per capita and crime  
rates," Mauer wrote in a 1994 USA Today op-ed.   
  <p>
<a name="answ"><b>Bad Answers to Foolish Questions</b></a><p>	  
TSP is preoccupied with explaining the "causes" of crime.   
Predictably, it blames the failures on society.  This familiar refrain condemns "abuse and neglect" for crime  
and censures "attitudes toward women" and "the ready availability of firearms in this country" for violence.   
In Mauer's view, "incarceration speaks very little to poor schooling, dysfunctional families, or limited job  
skills."  <p>
  What then is the answer?  More government spending.  TSP wants to spend tax dollars not on stopping  
crimes or catching criminals, but on social programs for more treatment and counseling, for education and  
recreation.  Mauer testified that "programs such as Head Start and Job Corps are cost effective in reducing  
long-term crime control costs."  Washington liberals conclude that every ill plaguing society can be cured  
by a government program; crime is no exception.    <p>
  Mauer actually has gone so far as to suggest that Hillary Clinton's health care task force should serve as a  
"model" for how the country should approach crime policy.  He noted approvingly that President Clinton  
"assembled a team of hundreds of experts to dissect and analyze every aspect of the health care system. . .  
."  And he wondered why there has been no parallel effort with respect to crime.  (Hint:  Hillary's task force  
was a failure!)  TSP sees this as part of a "more rational and humane" approach to crime.  Given the voters'  
revulsion at Mrs. Clinton's health care machinations, what could be more cruel?  <p>
  Former U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese, a Capital Research Center trustee, says TSP operates in a  
"fantasy world."  "Of course crime reflects deeper societal problems," adds Meese, "but that doesn't answer  
the question of what to do about the criminals on the streets right now.  How do we keep known criminals  
from committing more crimes?"  The answer is to "put them where they can no longer harm others _ in  
prison."  <p>
  
<a name="edna"><b>Sources of Funding:  The Edna McConnell Clark Foundation</b></a>  <p>
  TSP reflects the world-view of its benefactor, the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation, a prime patron of  
left-wing causes from the ACLU to the Children's Defense Fund.  With assets of $500 million, the Clark  
Foundation is one of America's largest foundations.  Mrs. Clark's father was the founder of Avon Products,  
and her husband, with whom she established the Foundation in 1950, was chairman of the board of the  
cosmetics business.  The Foundation is unrelated to the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation (see April  
Foundation Watch).   <p>
  Like TSP, the Foundation wants to "move the corrections system away from an overreliance on jails and  
prisons."  Its annual report repeats the buzz phrases of anti-incarceration advocates:  "community-based  
punishments"; "inadequate investment"; "intermediate punishments"; "unnecessary incarceration";  
"nonviolent offenders"; and "alternatives."    <p>
  In 1994 TSP received three grants from the Clark Foundation totaling $195,271.  The year before the  
Foundation awarded TSP two grants totaling $334,000.  Besides providing financial backing to TSP, the  
Clark Foundation's Program for Justice also supports the Families Against Mandatory Minimums  
Foundation, which opposes laws setting minimum sentences for various crimes.  It also funds the American  
Civil Liberties Union's National Prison Project, awarding it $825,000 in 1994.  The National Prison Project  
is a prisoners' "rights" organization that litigates on behalf of incarcerated criminals.  <p> 
  This is elitism at its worst.  The folks at TSP and the Clark Foundation can win kudos from academics by  
theorizing about alternatives to prison.  But the urban poor who must suffer the consequences of crime as  
well as the consequences of naive crime policies have no such luxury.  They are not interested in  
speculating about root causes.  Instead, they want to see criminals swept from the streets.    
<p><a name="fund"><b>Federal Government Funding</b></a>  <p>
  TSP's private foundation funding is augmented by the federal government.  The Justice Department's  
support will enable TSP to "publish a guide for the establishment and operation of defense-based  
alternative sentencing programs."  (According to the most recent information available through FAADS,  
the federal grants database, the Justice Department awarded TSP $125,000 in the last quarter of 1993.)<p>  
  Last year, Congress failed to deal with the problem of government funding of nonprofit advocacy groups.   
Reps. Ernest Istook (R-OK), David McIntosh (R-IN) and Robert Ehrlich (R-MD) were unable to convince  
their colleagues that federal grants should not be given to nonprofit groups engaged in political advocacy.   
But TSP illustrates why action on this front is needed now more than ever.  You wouldn't know it by  
visiting its offices, but TSP is one of the most influential players in the ongoing debate about crime.   
Regrettably, it is the kind of influence we could do without.  <p>
  Media and political elites bemoan what they characterize as public cynicism toward government  
institutions.  They should not be so perplexed.  What else can one expect when citizens discover that their  
tax dollars are squandered so foolishly?  The public demands protection from crime, yet finds its money  
spent on those whose solution is keep criminals out of jail.

<h2>The Ronald McDonald House</h2>
<b><I>The House That Love Built</I></b><BR>
<p>
<B><FONT SIZE=2><a href="#name">By Gwen Vereen Purtill & Patrick D. Purtill, Jr</a></FONT></B>
<P>
  Debbie Wargos voice was cheerful and warm and she got straight to the point.  I was calling three minutes after my husband and I were to have arrived to interview her at the Ronald McDonald House.<p>
  Gwen! I was just taking your name in vain. Are we going to have to reschedule?
  We had come down with an ugly flu last night, I explained, and didnt think we ought to share it with the kids.<p>
  Yes, she agreed, wed have to ask you not to come in under the circumstances. So many of the children here have suppressed immune systems. We agreed to have a preliminary talk by phone and visit 
the House when we were well.<p>
  Debbie is the executive director of the Ronald McDonald House, a 22-bedroom facility in northeast Washington, D.C. Since 1980, it has provided a home away from home to families of children being treated for life-threatening illness in any of the areas hospitals. A family can stay indefinitely as long as their child is under active treatment. This hospitality extends to children who are receiving outpatient care such as chemotherapy or radiation.  The House serves families that live at least an hour away from the hospital where the child is being treated, or that face other circumstances that making it impossible for them to get back and forth. <p>
  The House itself is a large and inviting 1920s style structure, comprised of a main house and pavilion situated on a two-acre plot that allows for a large playground in back. On the ground floor of the main house are generous gathering rooms, the dining room and kitchen. The pavilion bridge houses a 
meditation/consultation room and a small library; on the ground floor of the pavilion is a television/playroom.<p>
  During its fifteen years of operation, the D.C. House has served nearly eight thousand families. The sixteenth of the now more than 160 Ronald McDonald Houses worldwide, the D.C. House is owned and operated by Ronald McDonald House Charities of Greater Washington D.C., a nonprofit organization. 
Roughly 50 percent of those served by the DC House are children from military families being treated at Walter Reed Hospital in Washington.
<p>
<h3>Missys Story</h3>
<p>
  Missy Terry is from such a family. Missy and two of her three brothers and sisters were born in Korea to a military couple. Missys mother, Tara, left the service when  she and her husband Mark were sent to separate duty stations. In January 1995, Mark was posted to Korea for a second time and they decided that 
Tara and the children would move to Illinois to be near Taras family.
  In early March 1995, Tara took four-year-old Missy to see her doctor because she had what looked like a mild cold and had started waking up at night complaining of headaches. Unable to find anything wrong, 
the doctor sent her home. But a few days later, Missys lymph nodes began to swell and her face was noticeably puffy. Tara took her to the emergency room and doctors warned that Missy might not survive the night. Mark was on a plane home from Korea the next morning.<p>
  The diagnosis was Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in which the bone-marrow and other blood-forming organs produce increased numbers of white blood cells. Missys white cell count was 1.2 million, with 92 percent leukemic cells. Three times Missy went through a process that removed the blood from her body 
and cleaned it. After all this, Missys white cell count came down to 350,000seven times what is considered high risk and roughly thirty-five times what is considered normal. Missys ability to fight off infection often is so low that everyday matters like using a drinking glass after her sisters or brother become seriously dangerous.<p>
  Nearly every day for three months, Missy and her family made the 110-mile drive to the hospital in St. Louis where she was being treated. It was a constant drain, remembers Tara. She now wonders why no one at the hospital suggested they stay at the Ronald McDonald House in St. Louis.<p>
   Each time the family adjusted to the demands of a regimen of treatment, it seemed that they were buffeted by something new. At first there was only the shock, but then Missy somehow lived through the initial phase of treatment. Then, Mark and Tara were told that Missy would have to have a broviac (an in-
dwelling catheter) implanted in her chest; it seemed like the end of the world. Next began the day-to day business of contending with chemotherapy, while watching their little girl lose her hair. <p>
  At first, Missy was as frightened as they were. She wasnt feeling all that sick, but suddenly teams of doctors were descending on her. Now, Tara says, Missy is not afraid of anything. She knows how to take care of the broviac, and when a nurse is careless, she tells her what she is doing wrong. At home, she does 
the heparin push in her own tube and always remembers her pills. Tara describes Missy as bright, energetic and an attention seeker. It is easy for onlookers to forget, but kids will be kids. Tara and Mark still have to 
discipline her occasionally, but it is hard. Missy is not allowed to misbehave. But now, says Tara, she and Mark evaluate the situation more generously before deciding that it really is important that Missy is told no.<p>
  In late June of 1995, the family was transferred to Ft. Belvoir, south of Washington, D.C., and Missy became a patient at Walter Reed, one of the armys three major hospitals. The move exacted a terrible emotional toll on the family. It was horrible, Tara says, We knew no one. <p>
  The family went directly to the hospital when they arrived in Washington because Missy had an infection. She stayed there for twenty-three days. The family had no place to live. The first night in town they paid $85 for a hotel room that Tara describes as unpleasant. Taking matters into their own hands they asked a hospital social worker to place them in a Ronald McDonald House. He made the referral, and they stayed there for three weeks until Missy was released.<p>
  During those three weeks, the family stayed in the downstairs bone marrow apartment of the D.C. Ronald McDonald House. The Terrys consider themselves private people, and did not especially relish the idea of staying in a group environment. But the staff helped them to get over their discomfort. At the House there was always someone to talk to who was concerned about their needs. Even now as Tara gets more involved with support organizations, she says that only at the Ronald McDonald House is everyone consistently supportive. <p>
  Tara was especially impressed that the House takes it in stride when residents fail to appreciate what is being done for them. They ask nothing but that you clean up after yourself. Some people do not even do that. They really seem to understand the stress level better even than hospital staff.<p>
 One day, in particular, the Terrys were exhausted and tense. A woman in the kitchen spoke sharply to Missy, who was out of the hospital on a pass. Mark came downstairs and blew his top. Later he went to Barbara Silverman, the Resident Manager, to apologize for making a scene.  Barbara was unruffled; she understood his stress.<p>
  During that time, Missy was in treatment at the hospital for 72 hour periods. But occasionally the hospital would let her leave on a pass for eight hours. Back at the House she could be with her parents and see her brothers and sisters who were at the House all the time.<p>
  Tara thinks her family has been very proactive in doing research and looking into Missys options. But she says the Ronald McDonald House was their only source of support during that period. Without it there would have been more crises. Because you are in the hospital so much, you see a lot. It really gets depressing. But at least we had a place to go. At the Ronald McDonald House, we could see a friendly face, talk to people, and vent our frustration.<p>
  While the family was emotionally needy, they saw many families at the House who were in much worse financial shape. The staff of the Ronald McDonald House gave one family Christmas presents and food vouchers. Tara especially felt for the overseas families that were separated because usually only one parent 
could accompany the child to the U.S.<p>
  After Missys initial stay at the Ronald McDonald House, the family moved to Ft. Belvoir in Northern Virginia, forty-seven miles on the other side of Washington from Missys hospital. If her other children were not in school, they would still be staying at the House. Tara says it is the first place she will look to if Missy should relapse or if Mark is transferred. <p>
  Missy is on a high dose chemotherapy regimen, and has lost her hair. People often mistake her for a little boy, says Tara. One day in the park, kids made fun of her hair, so now she wears a baseball cap all the time. But despite having tubes in her chest, she is very active; she runs and plays. You get to a point in all 
this of feeling sorry for yourself. But she is so strong, so happy, and so outgoingshe keeps us going. She has lost so muchher dance classes and pre-school. She has done very wellbetter than we have.<p>
  Missy currently is in a two-year maintenance phase of her treatment by experimental chemotherapy. They do most of the maintenance at home, including the chemo, which is administered through her leg. She only has to go into the hospital about three days every month. Doctors say Missy has about a 30% 
chance of making it through the maintenance regimen without a relapse. The family had a scare near the end of January when Missys white blood cell count dropped suddenly. If there is a relapse, the initial thirty-day induction stage of intensive treatment in the hospital starts again. It is also likely that doctors 
would prescribe a risky bone marrow transplant, which they have not done yet because none of Missys brothers or sisters are a match.  In either case, the family plans to spend their nights at the Ronald McDonald House while Missy sleeps. <p>
  If all goes well, there will be a final five-year phase of treatment. But it will be at least another seven years before Missy is out of the woods. Meanwhile, Tara now tells other families about the House because she thinks that it can help them through the crisis. When you need them, she says, it really makes the 
difference between whether the situation is bearable or unbearable.<p>
  Tara still feels isolated here. The couple made a few friends at the Ronald McDonald House. But they are finding that it is hard to start new friendships  because they are so emotionally needy and often exhausted. As a result Tara has started working with support groups. At least  everyone there is in the same boat. The House is sponsoring an Easter egg hunt in April, and Tara intends to take the children. Even if you are not staying at the House anymore, they are always open to you if you need it, she says.<p>
<h3>Full House</h3>
  <p>
The week before we visited the D.C. Ronald McDonald House, only five of its twenty-two rooms were occupied. But by the time we arrived on a Monday afternoon, Barbara, the resident manager, was juggling families and rooms. It is impossible to tell from day to day what the need will be. During busy times like 
these, the House has its medical priorities. The original mission of the Ronald McDonald Houses gave cancer and leukemia patients the highest priority as well as any child in an intensive care unit. The level of priority works its way down from there. Debbie tells us that they would never turn away a high priority 
family. If necessary, they will look for a hotel in the area willing to donate a room while the House is full. <p>
  When space is available, grandparents and other relatives may stay at the House. Like immediate family members, they are asked to make the customary $10 per night donation. However, reservations for extended family members are handled on a day-to-day basis.<p>
  Families must be referred by the hospital that is treating the child. Usually a hospital social worker or sometimes a doctor or nurse makes the referral. No walk-ins are accepted at Ronald McDonald Houses. There are few problems because the social workers assess whether the family is looking for a hotel or 
needs a temporary home. Occasionally a family cannot fit into the group setting, but  very rarely is anyone asked to leave. When  family members check in, they go through an orientation during which are asked to agree to, and sign, a handbook specifying  the House rules. Occasionally, a family will decide not to stay, 
but that doesnt happen very often.<p>
   Most families stay for two or more weeks. They live in a group setting and are responsible for doing their own laundry and cooking.  A cheerful plaque that hangs on an interior wall as you enter the kitchen sums up the philosophy and organization of the entire operation: This is a self-cleaning kitchen. Please clean up after yourself. Opposite,  numbered cupboards store the food purchased by families.  A common pantry is provided although the families buy most of their own food. Barbara coordinates emergency provisions for the pantry from local vendors, clubs, organizations, and individuals.<p>
  Most people welcome the opportunity to engage in the normal activities of daily lifecooking their own meals, doing laundry, cleaning up common areas. They want to feel they are doing something useful for their family and others at a time when they may feel helpless in the face of a childs illness.<p>

<h3>A Surrogate Community</h3>
<p>
  There are plenty of restaurants and hotels in the Washington area, but most families simply cannot afford to eat out every night and stay in hotels for a prolonged periodespecially if they already face large medical bills. Hotels leave families isolated at a time when they most need emotional support.  Kate Shafer, a social worker at Childrens Hospital, says the  House provides an opportunity for normal interaction for couples and extended family. They  can sleep restfully  knowing they are five minutes away from their sick child. And the child can sleep soundly knowing mom and dad are minutes away. 
According to Shafer, parents away from home and family find a naturally supportive community of 
people who are uniquely sensitive to their needs.<p>
  Staff believe that this temporary community, while ones own is out of reach, is one of the most important 
services the house provides. Families can sit down together over breakfast and informally compare notes 
on what to expect as treatment progresses. Newer patients can ask those who know the ropes about hospital 
services and staff, or they can find out how to deal with practical problems that arise as they try to take care 
of a child who is in transition from the hospital.<p>
  Like most places that cater to children, Ronald McDonald Houses go all out for holidays. Groups bring in 
Christmas presents or Valentines Day treats. Some will bring little favors or bake cookies. At Halloween a 
group always comes to decorate the stairwell, and the kids go trick-or-treating at Catholic University a few 
blocks away. When we visited, the House was celebrating a mothers birthday.  Barbara provided  a cake, 
and small presents were waiting to be opened. In preparation for Valentines Day, a table in the hall held 
dozens of favors, prepared by volunteers, awaiting the return of the families that evening.<p>
  Giving the House a homey feel is crucial to its mission. Much of that feeling is achieved by the staff and 
volunteers who keep the atmosphere informal. But while hospital staff often try to keep things informal  no 
one has ever left a hospital thinking it had a homey feeling. In this House children are allowed to play. It 
is a place where kids can just be themselvesa place where they feel comfortable enough to allow their 
thinning hair to show. Even structurally, the House encourages community. Rooms dont form an insular 
world the way they do in hotels. There is only one central kitchen. The bathrooms are shared. Telephones 
and televisions are in common areas so families are more or less forced to go out, just as they would at 
home.<p>
  Because of this, the supportive bonds formed at the House often grow into lifetime friendships. Early in 
its history, the House had a number of children with extremely serious cancers, and many of them did not 
make it. Some of those families still keep in touch, and even get together for holidays.<p>
  A very ill teenage girl has been at the D.C. House with her father for several months. Her mother died 
several years ago. When she first came to the House, she told Barbara that all of her friends had dropped 
her because they were unable to understand what she was going through. She has since become attached  to 
the staff and to some of the mothers and children staying at the House, and they to her.<p>
  We are her friends, says Barbara. If you asked her whether she would like to be here or at home, at this 
stage she probably would say here. She was in the hospital, but when it looked as if she was certain to get 
better, she asked if she could stay here during her physical therapy. Shes more comfortable hereexcept 
for Max, her dog. She misses Max.
<p>
<h3>Day by Day</h3>
<p>
  While Debbie Wargo goes out into the community looking for financial and other help, Barbara works 
with the families and the volunteers. Her job is to keep everything functioning and everyone living as one 
big happy family. Says Barbara, she raises all the money and I get to spend it.  Barbara tries to have 
volunteers on hand from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. each day to do everything from answering the telephones 
to checking in guests, checking rooms, attending to light maintenance, doing mailings, and baking cookies. 
Some 50 volunteers come in to help as often as twice a week or as little as  twice a month. Most  family 
activities take place in the evenings or first thing in the morning. But often healthy brothers and sisters are 
in the House during the day. When there is a healthy sibling under age sixteen, there is usually a parent at 
the House also.<p>
  The House rules are mostly just common sense. Children must be supervised by an adult. Quiet time is 10 
p.m. to 7 a.m. Because there is no maid service, families have to pick up after themselves and their children 
in the common areas as well as in their private rooms. And of course, they must make sure that their 
children are courteous to others. No smoking is permitted inside, and no alcohol may be drunk anywhere 
on the premises. Food and drinks are allowed in the dining room and kitchen only, unless a child is 
bedridden. <p>
  Because the House, its staff, and the families seem so cheerful, reminders of the purpose of Ronald 
McDonald House can be slightly jarring. Reading through the House rules is reminder enough. Hand 
washing is taken very seriously here, as is proper disposal of diapers, syringes, and blood specimens. 
House managers must be notified if anyone in the House is exposed to contagious disease; chicken pox can 
be fatal to children with weakened immune systems. <p>
  One of the most remarkable things about Barbara and Debbie is their approach to illness and death
particularly  the deaths of children. Certainly there is grief, which is as much a part of death as death is a 
part of life. But they are both passionate and practical about what they do. They have no soapbox, and there 
is no melodrama as they talk to us about the often terrible suffering of the families and children they serve. <p>

<h3>Practical Services</h3>
<p>
  This practical but caring approach manifests itself in several other services the House provides. For 
instance, a former playroom was converted into a classroom in 1992. Because patients, as well as their 
healthy brothers and sisters, often had no way of keeping up with their schoolwork, Fiorella Carmelino, the 
tutorial coordinator, has recruited and trained about sixteen volunteer tutors. They assist  patients at the 
House, their sisters and brothers, children who are confined to the hospital, and indeed any child at 
Childrens Hospital who requests help. Tutors spend two to three hours per week working with students on 
a one-to-one basis, usually meeting with two or three students per session.<p>
  As the nations capital, Washington offers children educational opportunities that can compensate for 
what they are missing in their schools at home. Volunteers from local colleges and retiree organizations 
serve as tutors and  chaperones on field trips. Outings are organized to such places as the Smithsonians Air 
and Space Museum, the National Gallery, the Lincoln Memorial, the White House, the Capitol, and the 
National Zoo.<p>
  The House also provides for many  families that dont have transportation, especially those who are flown 
in from overseas.  Shuttle vans run four times a day  to any hospital where a child is treated, and to grocery 
stores and to a shopping mall on the weekend. Even those who do bring a car may find  the prospect of 
driving in a large, unfamiliar city daunting.<p>
  And to keep families in touch with friends and relatives, MCI and AT&T have donated special phones  
for brief long-distance calls every day. Regular phone service is also available, and three pay phones are on 
the premises. The House even provides pagers to parents whose children are in intensive care so that the 
hospital can reach them no matter where they are day or night.<p>

<h3>The House That Love Built</h3>
<p>
  The first Ronald McDonald House was the product of a quixotic partnership of an NFL franchise, a 
pediatric oncologist, and local McDonalds franchise owners (see sidebarpage 4). The concept grew out 
of a conversation between Fred Hill, a tight end for the Philadelphia Eagles, and Dr. Audrey Evans, one of 
the doctors treating Hills three-year-old daughter Kim for leukemia. The first house opened near 
Philadelphia Childrens Hospital in 1974.<p>
  Debbie describes their relationship with McDonalds as wonderfulboth in terms of manpower and on a 
volunteer level. If the House needs a van it may ask local franchise owners to  raise the money. 
McDonalds suppliers also help the Ronald McDonald House. The D.C. House, for instance, receives free 
dairy products from the Shenandoah Pride Dairy.<p>
  None of the Ronald McDonald Houses could exist solely on what McDonalds does for them. This is 
especially true for the larger Houses. The D.C. House, for instance, depends on the community for the 
overwhelming majority of its annual operating budget. It fluctuates yearly, but is now at just over 
$700,000.  McDonalds restaurant counter boxes are projected to account for just over 17% of the 1996 
budget.<p>
  Debbie, who has been executive director for seven years, is responsible for public relations, management 
and fund-raising. Her very active, forty member Board, composed of parents of children with cancer, 
doctors, social workers, McDonalds representatives, and community leaders, assists with management, 
finance, fund-raising and special events. Each board member must serve on at least one committee.<p>
  The House had no executive director from the time the House opened in 1980 until Debbie came on in 
1989.  The sole staff person, a resident manager, lived on the premises and the Board filled in as needed. 
Debbie now directs four full-time and four part-time staff members.<p>
  While the D.C. House participates in the Combined Federal Campaign, it does not receive any 
government money. In fact, its fund-raising relies almost exclusively on local projects designed to serve a 
dual purpose, raise the always-needed funds, and increase community awareness of the facility. Special 
events raise a  large portion of their budget. While always happy to accept money, the House also 
welcomes gifts in kind. Right now Debbie is looking for a van and a new plain paper fax machine.<p>
  If the Ronald McDonald House has an event planned Debbie tries to get it on the radio or in the 
newspaper. Often she will put out a call for volunteers to  adopt  parts of the garden, bake cookies, or rake 
the yard. She constantly reminds the community that the House depends upon volunteers every day from 
9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.  This high profile approach helps to insure that the community knows that there is a 
Ronald McDonald House in the area that needs volunteers and money.<p>
  Recalling the role of the Philadelphia Eagles, the largest annual fund-raising event involves the 
Washington Redskins football team. The event, Rally Round the Redskins, was begun in the Houses  
first year of operation. It features a live and silent auction, dinner, and an autograph and photo session 
which the House holds with the Redskins each fall. The entire teamcoaches and playersis invited to 
greet anyone who might be interested in meeting  the players and supporting the House. <p>
  Each year there also is an annual golf tournament and four or five smaller events. These included wine 
tastings, raffles, and a dinner cruise. This March the House held its first annual Ultimate Hunt for the 
Good Egg. Eighty celebrity-decorated Easter Eggs, creations by the likes of by Elton John, Corretta Scott 
King, General Norman Schwartzkopf, President Ford and Bob and Elizabeth Dole were auctioned off. The 
event, cosponsored with Neiman Marcus, culminated in the presentation of the first annual Good Egg 
Award to Donna and Gilbert Giordano, keystone supporters of the House.
<h3>Giving Back</h3>
<p>
  The D.C. Ronald McDonald House asks that families who can afford it pay a $10 fee per daynicely 
splitting the difference between the high ($25) and low ($5) established by the Ronald McDonald House 
International Advisory Board. It is certainly not for the revenue, says Debbie. This may be a matter of 
opinion, but I believe the old saying that when people get something for nothing they sometimes dont 
value it, or they almost forget that it costs something for them to stay here. At least this small stipend helps 
families feel that they belong and that they are making a contribution or giving back.  Debbie and Barbara 
estimate that the fee is  waived for at least half of the families. <p>
  But the House, they are quick to remind us, runs on two things: one is money, the other is volunteer 
power. So they also ask all families to volunteer in the House. As with the fee, help is asked on an as 
youre able basis. Some families have many hours to volunteer, others dont. This often depends on how 
sick their child is and how much time theyre spending at the hospital. But most families are quite willing  
to do things for the common areas like take out the trash and change light bulbs.<p>
  Helping out also depends on how each individual deals with stress. Some people need to keep busy, 
others internalize their energy and become contemplative. One  father who was here during  the 
extraordinary blizzards in 1996 kept the walk clear. It was his way to relieve stress and help out. Barbara 
remembers another father whose child was not going to live. He mowed the lawn to relieve stress. The 
childs mother had to be at the hospital; he had to leave. He had to mow the lawn. Thats how he dealt with 
it. For many guests, being able to pull a weed in the garden not only makes them feel more at home, it is a 
necessary pressure valve.<p>
  Currently Debbie and board members are busy supervising the building of another Ronald McDonald 
House on the grounds of Fairfax Hospital in Virginia. It will be an eight bedroom facility to better serve 
hospitals in the Northern Virginia area. Having received the go-ahead, they have selected the design of the 
House and have found builders. They have a lease in hand, and if all goes well the groundbreaking will be 
in August or September.<p> 
  Meanwhile, they also are expanding the House in northeast D.C. The Board of Zoning has approved a 
manufactured three-bedroom housing unit to house three additional bone marrow transplant families, 
whose children need an even greater levels of isolation because of  their weakened immune systems.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
  As rising medical costs threaten families whose children require treatment over a long period, clearly the 
Ronald McDonald House provides a helpful safety net. Parents may miss work and have trouble meeting 
uninsured  costs.  But at the Ronald McDonald House they at least will have food and shelter for little or no 
cost.<p>
  Yet the House serves an even more important function. At a time when a familys emotional stability is at 
risk and when financial and personal tensions may be high, Ronald McDonald House keeps the family 
together. Painful decisions about who has to stay behind are avoided because the House keeps parents close 
to their hospitalized child. It relieves the necessity of long and frequent drives to the hospital when a child 
is in pain or queasy from treatment. And it allows family members to remain charitable to one another 
under the weight of stress and exhaustion. When families are spending day after day with a loved one at the 
hospital, it is hard to overestimate the healing power of a warm shower, a comfortable bed, and a meal that 
didnt come from the hospital cafeteria.
<p>
<h3>The First Ronald McDonald House</h3><p>
  When Fred Hill, tight end for the Philadelphia Eagles, asked Dr. Audrey Evans, head of the pediatric 
oncology unit at Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia, how he could help the families she was working with, 
neither expected her answer to that question to grow into a household name. <p>
  What Dr. Evans wanted was a house that could serve as a temporary residence for the families of children  
treated at her hospital. She caught Hill at his most receptive. Ever since his daughter Kim had been 
diagnosed with leukemia, Hill and his wife had camped out on hospital chairs and benches, eating food 
from vending machines, and doing all they could to keep Kim from seeing their fear, exhaustion, and 
frustration.<p>
  All around them, other parents were doing exactly the same thing. Many of the families had traveled great 
distances to bring their children to the hospital, but the high cost of hotel rooms was more than they could 
afford. Hill was convinced that Dr. Evans idea for a home-away-from-home for families of seriously ill 
children was exactly what was needed. <p>
  Hill rallied his teammates. Through the Philadelphia Eagles general manager, Jim Murray, the whole 
team offered its support. While Dr. Evans looked for real estate around the hospital, Murray called on his 
friends at McDonalds, who were planning a St. Patricks Day Shamrock Shake promotion. On requesting 
a portion of the proceeds, Murray was told by the local McDonalds that the project could have them all.<p>
  The Shamrock Shake promotion raised some $35,000, almost enough to cover the $40,000 purchase price 
of a four-story, seven-bedroom house that Dr. Evans found near the hospital. The interior required 
extensive renovation to convert it from a student rooming house into a temporary home for kids and their 
families. With help from a local developer whose own daughter had been diagnosed with leukemia, the 
house was gutted, rebuilt, furnished, and opened in October of 1974. <p>
  When it came time to name the house, they decided on the Ronald McDonald House in gratitude to the 
local franchise owners who had helped so generously, and because it was hoped that it would be 
comforting for a hospitalized child to know that his parents would be staying at Ronalds House.<p>
  Within a year, word had spread and Eagles General Manager Jim Murray went to Chicago to help 
Childrens Memorial Hospital and several area residents establish a Ronald McDonald House there. Again, 
a milkshake promotion supported by local McDonalds and their customers provided the fundraising 
centerpiece. The second Ronald McDonald House opened in Chicago in April of 1977. <p>
  By 1979, 10 more Ronald McDonald Houses had opened. In the next five years, local communities 
founded 60 more Houses; then 53 more in the following five years. Today, there are 164 Ronald 
McDonald Houses in 13 countries. <p>
  <b>Kim Hill, the little girl whose illness started it all, is now a mother in California. And Jim Murray, the 
Eagles general manager who helped found the first and many subsequent Ronald McDonald Houses, now 
serves as president of the Ronald McDonald House International Advisory Board.</b>

<b>From The Editor:</b>
<P>
Right now, courts are supervising the child foster care programs in some 21 states.  In the 
District of Columbia, a federal court judge has stripped mayor Marion Barry of control 
over child welfare and replaced the elected city administration with a court-appointed 
consultant.  The judge described the "outrageous deficiencies" in D.C.'s child foster care 
in a March 17th, 1996 news story headlined "A Dickensian Picture" and reported on the 
front page of the Sunday New York Times.<p>
	What readers of the article did not learn from reporter Robert Pear was that almost 
twenty years ago the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation, a private grantmaking 
philanthropy in New York City with current assets estimated at $90 million, laid the 
foundations for what has become the legal struggle to use the courts to revamp the child 
welfare system. <p>
	Led by its energetic and articulate executive director, Margaret C. Ayers, the 
Robert Sterling Clark Foundation is the story behind the re-orientation of the nation's 
thinking on child welfare.  Ayers is admirable for her forthrightness and willingness to 
clarify her views.  She spoke at length with Foundation Watch.  But the opinions she 
expresses and the goals for which she fights reveal the inherent limitations in her liberal 
though anti-bureaucratic stance:  She truly believes the paradoxical slogan "Pro-family, 
pro-choice."<p>
	Though it has funded the legal challenge to failing government child protection 
services, the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation also funds those who support state action 
for abortion rights while attacking the rights of religious groups to establish childcare 
arrangements when parents are absent or unfit.<p>
	Sympathetic government bureaucrats, like Br'er Rabbitt, have often appreciated 
the adverse publicity and legal briar patches into which they are tossed by the Robert 
Sterling Clark Foundation.  Seeming to be opponents, government and its philanthropic 
adversaries have been, in fact, complicit in attempts to expand the power of the state over 
childcare and reduce the influence of independent institutions such as the Catholic 
Church.  <p>
	Although once dubbed a "government accountability project," the Foundation has 
succeeded in removing child welfare programs from the direct supervision of government 
officials who are accountable to the electorate.  Instead, a cadre of professional 
criminologists, sociologists, psychologists, educators and social workers has been 
empowered by the judicial process.  And while it opposes the theories of so-called 
"family preservation," much favored by some prominent child welfare advocacy groups, 
the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation has funded those who would use the courts to 
establish alternative therapeutic regimes for the care of children.<p>
	Perplexingly, the Foundation's advocacy of child welfare derives from Margaret 
Ayers' feminism, which champions women's right to abortion and other so-called 
reproductive rights.  This is the second major funding priority of the Robert Sterling 
Clark Foundation.  The third is increased funding for cultural institutions and the arts.  In 
the past year, Ayers has capped these interests by announcing to the press her 
determination to resist those who are in opposition to the goals she supports.  She has 
organized this effort under the banner, "Fight the Right." <p>

<b>IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD</b><p>

The executive director of the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation has spent a good part of her professional life working to reform the child welfare system.  In the 1960's Ayers spent four years as a New York City social worker who witnessed firsthand the abuse and suffering of children at the hands of an unresponsive bureaucracy.  She left the system after New York City's Commissioner of Welfare banned home visits by social workers in 1968, claiming that they constituted an invasion of privacy and an undesirable form of espionage.  (Ayers does not say this was the reason).  But she did not forget what she had seen nor the benefit of the home visits.<p>
	Ayers told Foundation Watch:  "Mitch Ginsberg [then-New York City welfare commissioner now deceased] separated income maintenance from services.  But the fact is that my colleagues and I were really social workers.  We were not there investigating clients.  We were there trying to help clients; help them get off welfare, substance abuse.  
When income maintenance was separated, the social work staff was reduced.  And the city hired paper pushers who did not provide services.  The caseworkers of the late 60s were not watchdogs.  We were trying to help welfare recipients get into programs that would enable them to lead constructive lives." <p>
	Following her stint in social work, and in a program associate position at the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation (no relation, assets $525 million), Ayers came to Robert Sterling Clark as a consultant in 1976.  She found a small private foundation which gave out grants in an unfocused manner in many areas. <p>
	The Robert Sterling Clark Foundation was incorporated in 1952  to shelter and distribute a portion of the inheritance derived from the Singer sewing machine fortune.  Founder Robert Sterling Clark was the grandson of Edward Clark, a lawyer who founded the Singer company with Isaac Singer in the nineteenth century.  Last year, with a smaller 
$70 million fund, the Foundation gave away about $3.5 million.  A small operation with a staff of five, its giving reflects Ayers' intense personal commitment and leadership.<p>
	Says Ayers:  "The board hired me to look at what they'd been doing and try to figure out what fields it made sense to be in.  At that point the foundation was giving grants in ten fields.  There were lots of small grants in science, health, population, environment, education.  It wasn't a developed grants program.  It wasn't focused beyond 
broad categories.  Some areas were sufficiently broad as to render our grantmaking ineffective."<p>
	Ayers proposed to concentrate Clark's grants in three major areas: child welfare reform, monitoring the performance of government agencies in delivering services, and support for cultural institutions and the arts.  Since then, the Foundation has combined the first two fields, kept support for the arts, and added a third area: "insuring access to reproductive health information and services," which paid out grants totalling $1,406,000 in 1994 (information for 1995 is not yet available).  The largest single grant _ $200,000 _ 
went to The Planned Parenthood Federation of America to conduct research on pro-life activists.  By comparison, projects to improve public institutions in New York City and State were funded at the level of $1,084,000. The Foundation funded the arts and cultural institutions with grants totalling $1,196,080.<p>
	Ayers' concern for child welfare was an aspect of the Foundation's "government 
accountability" project begun in 1979 during the administration of New York City mayor 
Ed Koch. That effort focused on the city's administrative failings in responding to child 
abuse and neglect.<p>
	The Foundation made grants to the New York Civil Liberties Union to support litigation against the city.  In particular, from 1979 to 1994 it earmarked annual grants (excepting 1980 and 1988) to children's rights advocate Marcia Robinson Lowry.  She had come to fame as an attorney in a 1973 case, Wilder v. Bernstein, which forced New York City to end the use of religious criteria in making foster placements of children to Catholic and other religious homes.  In a consent decree, the city agreed that such placements violated constitutional guarantees of separation between church and state.<p>
	Since its first grant in 1979, the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation has given over 
$900,000 to the ACLU's children's rights project, which was headed until last year by Lowry.  In 1994 the foundation gave Lowry's project $80,000.  Last year Lowry left the ACLU to establish her own nonprofit, Children's Rights, Inc., with $90,000 in foundation support from Ayers.  At the ACLU Lowry enjoyed considerable success litigating child 
welfare and adoption cases, including the D.C. case which ended the Barry administration's authority over child protection services.  The essential role of the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation in making those successes possible has received little public 
attention.<p>
	Stanley Brezenoff, who was responsible for child welfare enforcement as first deputy mayor in the Koch administration, says, "The unique thing about Peggy Ayers is that she and the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation don't shrink from cutting edge issues.  <p>
We wouldn't have redoubled our effort to improve such a massive system, so unrelenting, such an enormous system, with thousands of reports of abuse and neglect, without the advocacy and prodding which came from the children's rights project.  We needed to be pushed and prodded.  The ACLU has come down on both sides.  It's not a liberal or conservative issue.  I admire Peggy and that foundation tremendously for what they've done."<p>
	Unfortunately, says Ayers, "A lot of the good we did, came undone," when David Dinkins replaced Koch as New York City's mayor.  Claiming ongoing city neglect of child welfare, Lowry's Children's Rights project at the ACLU filed the lawsuit Marisol A. <p>
v. Giuliani which is currently before U.S. District Judge Robert Ward in New York.  (The case, televised on Court TV, will also set precedent regarding the presence of cameras in a federal courtroom.)<p>

<b>TARGETED GIVING TO "FIGHT THE RIGHT"</b><p>

Passionate" is the word often used by those who know Ayers, executive director of the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation since 1979.  She uses the word herself: "I feel passionately about our work, the work of the foundation." In a universe known for an addiction to euphemism and dissimulation, what Dwight 
MacDonald called the "foundation-speak" of the "philanthropoids," Ayers is a refreshingly straight shooter.<p>
	Ayers is a shrewd politician whose views are respected by others in the world of organized philanthropy.  And she has a reputation as a "hands on" donor:  Ayers not only consults with the CEOs and development officers of the groups she funds, but she works directly with the staff members who run the programs that her grants support.<p>
	In many ways Margaret Ayers is the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation.  A tall handsome brunette in her mid-fifties, Ayers lives in Manhattan in the fashionable East-60's, maintains a country house upstate and is known as a conservative dresser who 
favors Chanel-like suits.  Ayers' annual salary is $150,000, with $22,387 additional in benefits. <p>
	Yet in September, 1995 Ayers told the Chronicle of Philanthropy that her mission 
as head of the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation is to "fight the right."  The battle began, she said, with the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980.  Ayers says she concluded then that the most important threat to women's rights came from the White House and the Republican party.  Observing the appointment of conservative movement activists and religious conservatives to Executive Branch agencies, Ayers persuaded her board that the Foundation should initiate a grants program to support abortion rights.<p>
	In this regard, Robert Sterling Clark has made some extraordinary grants.  For instance, it has paid recipient organizations to engage in "opposition research."  Some 1994 grant projects include:<br><ul>
	<li>  $80,000 to the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League for a 
computer database tracking abortion legislation, court cases, and publication of Sexuality 
In America: A State-By-State Review. 
	<li>  $60,000 to Catholics For Free Choice for A New Rite, a published database 
compiling information on conservative Catholic organizations and individuals.
	<li>  $40,000 to the Feminist Majority Foundation for investigations of pro-life 
groups.
	<li>  $200,000 over two years to Planned Parenthood for "clinic defense strategies" 
and a database of abortion opponents. 
	<li>  $80,000 to People for the American Way for its "Artsave" database of 
controversial art and for publication of Artistic Freedom Under Attack.  
	<li>  $50,000 to the ACLU's "Arts Censorship Project" to represent artists and arts 
organizations that "are under attack by government and private-pressure groups for 
creating and exhibiting works of art that deal with sexual or controversial themes."</ul>
	
	Despite its small size, the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation exerts considerable influence over nationwide abortion rights grantmaking.  Ayers heads the Council on Foundations' official Reproductive Rights Affinity Group, "Grantmakers in Support of 
Reproductive Rights."  <p>
	Formed in 1990 at Ayers' urging in light of the restrictions on abortion contained 
in the Supreme Court's decision in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, the group 
has 80 grantmaker members who "encourage foundations to give more money to organizations that advocate broad access to abortion and birth control." <p>
	The group succeeded a smaller, more secretive and unofficial team organized in 
1984.  Ayers told the Chronicle of Philanthropy in 1990 that one in four foundations 
invited to join the group did so because the decision had "shaken a lot of people to the 
roots."  <p>
	In 1991 Ayers called on the twenty largest foundations that fund abortion rights to 
meet at the Ford Foundation to plan a strategy in response to Rust v. Sullivan, the 
Supreme Court ruling that upheld the federal government's authority to prohibit federally-
funded clinic workers from recommending abortion.  <p>
	In 1993, the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation donated $100,000 to the Center for 
Reproductive Law and Policy, when the pro-abortion group split from the ACLU.  <p>
	The New York Times reported that the new group was meant to attract 
Republicans such as Barbara Mosbacher, co-chairman of the New York State Republican 
Family Comittee and Republican Pro-Choice Political Action Committee, who opposed 
other ACLU positions. <p>
	 "Some people are incensed by some of the ACLU's stances," she told the Times.  
Nat Hentoff, a pro-life member of the ACLU board of directors responded, "It's good for 
the ACLU that this close identification gets  less close."<p>

<a name="pro"></a>
<b>"PRO-FAMILY, PRO-CHOICE": FROM WOMEN'S RIGHTS TO CHILDREN'S RIGHTS</b><p>

As Ayers supported improving the lives of children, she also strengthened her commitment to the pro-abortion cause.  She sees no conflict and offers the argument:  "It is critical to the ability of women to be integral parts 
of our economic system for them to have control over their reproductive lives.  I don't 
want the government telling me what to do in my bedroom.  I don't want the church 
telling me what to do in my bedroom.  I don't want them controlling what I do."<p> 
	During pregnancy, Ayers believes that the rights of the mother are paramount.  
The tables turn at birth.  "The life of the child begins at birth," she declared.  Only in this 
way can one understand the zeal with which the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation 
campaigns to remove children from abusive parents and abusive government programs, 
while funding those who would make it easier for mothers to terminate their pregnancies.<p>
	Ayers' four years in New York's slums and projects apparently have convinced her 
that it is better that some children not be born; but once born, children deserve quick 
removal from bad homes.  Ayers is a strong opponent of "family preservation," a social 
welfare concept embodied in a 1980 law which requires social workers to keep families 
together for as long as possible and balance this requirement against others. Ayers, 
however, favors early removal of abused children "in the best interests of the child."<p> 
	In this, Ayers rejects the position of some of the most prominent and well-
connected children's rights advocates, the Child Welfare League of America, the 
Children's Defense Fund (CDF), and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, its former chair. 
In her new book, It Takes A Village (Simon and Schuster, 1996, reviewed in Capital 
Research Center's Alternatives In Philanthropy March, 1996), the First Lady tries to have 
it both ways, defending the priority of the "best interests of the child" while 
simultaneously arguing for family preservation efforts. "It is not only parents who need 
expert 'coaching' in children's development," she writes. "The rest of the village does 
too."  <p>
	The Robert Sterling Clark Foundation stopped funding the Children's Defense 
Fund in the late 1980's because, according to Ayers, "CDF was not conducting work that 
qualified it to receive funds under any of our programs." It was shortly after Ayers 
discontinued the national child welfare program she had established upon her arrival.  
Although Ayers will not criticize the First Lady or CDF, it should be noted that the 
foundation continued to fund other child welfare projects through its New York-centered 
"government accountability" efforts _ but it still does not fund CDF or its local "New 
York City Child Health Project" (with offices at 111 Broadway in Manhattan). Ayers also 
differs with CDF's refusal to fight against race-based placement for adopted children.  
Indeed, some consider Children's Rights Inc. to be a new competitor to CDF's base of 
philanthropic support.<p>
	Yet, despite her differences with the conventional wisdom of the child welfare 
establishment, some experts don't find that Ayers's position offers much of an alternative.  
Douglas Besharov of the American Enterprise Institute remarks that more money, more 
social workers, and more court supervision of child welfare programs have had no 
positive long term impact on the child welfare system.  <p>
	"My basic thought is that courts can't reform child welfare agencies." he says.  
"Real reform needs the will of the community. The track record of spending more money 
is there, hiring more caseworkers is there, and it doesn't necessarily improve services to 
children because judges and lawyers can't run social service agencies."<p>
	More critical is William Donohue, a sociologist who is president of the Catholic 
League for Religious and Civil Rights in New York City.  He accuses attorney Marcia 
Lowry of attempting to destroy the Catholic child welfare agencies when she filed the 
1973 Wilder v. Bernstein suit (that found payments to religious agencies for foster care 
and adoption in violation of the Constitution's guarantee of separation of church and 
state).  Donohue calls Lowry "anti-Catholic" (though Lowry denies it) and predicts that 
child welfare systems under court monitors will suffer the same legal problems as mental 
hospitals which have been forced to deinstitutionalize patients, prisons which have been 
under court order to release criminals, and school systems which have been ordered by 
courts to raise property taxes to pay for new buildings and more teachers in vain attempts 
to improve student achievement and stop white flight. <p>
	The goal of Children's Rights Inc. lawsuits, says Donohue, is not to improve 
children's lives, but instead to concentrate power in court-appointed monitors who are 
approved by ACLU lawyers like Lowry.  The suits themselves cost millions of dollars 
which are drained from child welfare budgets into the pockets of lawyers and consultants.  
And the result is that accountability is removed from an electorate which has very 
different religious and moral values.<p>
	"The New York foster-care issue represents a fair characterization of the atomistic 
view of liberty," writes Donohue in his critical analysis of the ACLU, The Twilight of 
Liberty (Transaction, 1994).  "According to this perspective, freedom from religion is 
valued more highly than religious liberty, and that is why state encroachment on religious 
institutions is not interpreted as a threat.  If anything, the atomistic view holds that the 
prospects of liberty are advanced by weakening the influence of religiously-sponsored 
institutions."<p>
	Ayers disagrees that religious liberty is endangered when courts take over child 
welfare, arguing that "litigation is the only certain method of shedding light on child 
welfare systems that hide behind confidentiality laws."<p>
	On the other hand, Richard Gelles, a professor of sociology at the University of 
Rhode Island and author The Book of David: How Preserving Families Can Cost 
Children's Lives (Basic Books, 1996), argues that lawsuits such as Lowry's are inevitable 
but entirely off the mark.  The badly-drafted 1980 federal law which is the basis for court 
filings requires cities and states to pursue mutually contradictory policies: family 
preservation and the best interests of the child.  Because it is impossible to do both, 
lawsuits are inescapable.  Yet they will accomplish nothing.  Gelles argues that the only 
criterion should be the best interests of the child. <p>
	"Connecticut had children dying left and right under a consent decree," Gelles 
told Foundation Watch.  "The decree didn't order them to do the right thing.  You can't 
balance family preservation and child safety." <p>
	And Elizabeth Bartholet, a professor of Family Law at Harvard University 
concurs:  "I think family preservation is part of the problem today.  There is an 
overwhelming bias in our laws and funding priorities for family preservation that is 
inconsistent with the best interests of children."<p>
	In this, Bartholet and Gelles agree with Margaret Ayers, who told Foundation 
Watch, "I've been an observer of the child welfare system for thirty years, and I don't 
think there are any studies which show that family preservation works." 	<p>
	But, says Gelles,  "Lowry believes more social workers, more training, more 
intervention can solve the problem.  They can't.  Until the law is changed, things can't 
improve for children." Yet Ayers disagrees about the root problem, claiming "it is not the 
law. The fault lies in its implementation."<p>
	Gelles responds, "You cannot implement a vague, ambiguous, and inherently 
contradictory law. If you change 'reasonable efforts' to 'child safety' then you hold the 
states accountable."<p>
	In the debate over adoption and foster care, Ayers drops ideological arguments 
and partisan rhetoric.  She says, "I hesitate to say whether it is a conservative or liberal 
position. Basically I'm concerned about the well-being of children in a very vulnerable 
situation."<p>
	In this area Ayers seems to have adopted the self-reflexive and self-critical 
position of Naomi Wolf, who wrote in The New Republic, "the best understanding of 
feminism involves holding women as well as men to the responsibilities that are 
inseparable from their rights."<p>

<b>OUR BODIES, OUR SELVES</b><p>

About abortion, however, there 	are no doubts.  In giving grants 	to groups monitoring the politics of the abortion issue, Ayers has put the 
Robert Sterling Clark Foundation firmly on the side of those who regard abortion as 
central to women's liberation.<p>
	Ayers, who never married, is a truly liberated woman. She says she is not 
primarily interested in abortion for "population control" or "environmental" reasons, the 
argument made by some in the philanthropic community.  Instead, she says the right of a 
woman to control her own body is fundamental to a woman's freedom from oppression.  
The ability to terminate a pregnancy at will must be a premise of individual freedom and 
women's liberation.  This outlook has its roots in the feminism of the 1970's and it 
informs her thinking and her grantmaking. <p>
	"We spend a lot of time trying to promote women's access to reproductive health 
care.  And we have abstinence, but that's where conservative groups end the discussion.  
Many of these groups are not supportive of abortion, not supportive of family planning, 
not supportive of sexuality education," says Ayers.<p>
	The Reagan administration agenda was diametrically opposed to hers, she notes.  
"In 1983-84 there was an edict that came out of the Office of Management and Budget 
that all grantmaking agencies had to examine the projects they were supporting and the 
organizations they were giving grants to insure the purposes of the organizations and 
projects were consonant with White House policies."  Ayers refers to an ACLU legal 
challenge that led to the reinstatement of a USAID grant to the Alan Guttmacher Institute.  
She also mentions Department of Health and Human Service regulations on health clinics 
that separated family planning from abortion and the Rust "gag rule"decision. <p>
	In response, the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation made abortion the battleground 
of feminism.  Its fight continues.  Besides the previously cited opposition research  
funding, the Foundation made the following grants in 1994:<br><ul>
	<li>  $75,000 to the New York Civil Liberties Union to pay for "litigation 
challenging the exclusion of abortion services from New York's expanded Mediaid 
program." 
	<li>  $50,000 to Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington for "coalition 
building and grassroots organizing and the development of a database of information on 
the theocratic right and its tactics." 
	<li>  $60,000 to the Ms. Foundation for Women for the "Reproductive Rights 
Coalition Fund." 
	<li>  $50,000 to the NOW Legal Defense and education Fund to "secure legal 
protection for abortion providers." 
	<li>  $60,000 to the National Abortion Federation for "the creation of a Legal 
Clearinghouse" to "combat clinic harrassment." 
	<li>  $200,000 over two years to Advocates For Youth (formerly the Center for 
Population Options) which provides sex education to teenagers. 
	<li>  $40,000 to the Center for Policy Alternatives for a "Support Network for 
Pro-Choice Leaders." 
	<li>	$30,000 to the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy FAIR Health Care 
Reform Project to advocate the inclusion of abortion in health care;
	<li>	$75,000 to the Communications Consortium, for the "Reproductive Health 
Media Strategies Project," whose goal is "achieving better press coverage from the 
pro-choice perspective." 	
	<li>	$55,000 to the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health 
Association to "redress health reform measures that threaten access to reproductive health 
care." 
	<li>	$60,000 to the National Women's Law Center, to "support the Center's 
reproductive rights work." 
	<li>	$41,200 to the ProChoice Resource Center of Mamaroneck, NY to 
"monitor voter identification projects." 
	<li>	$50,000 to the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice, to 
"strengthen its Clergy Network. . .and raise the visibility of the pro-choice religious 
position." 
	<li>  $120,000 over two years to the Sex Information and Education Council of the 
US for "the expansion of the National Coalition to Support Sexuality Education.
	<li>  $60,000 to the Women's Legal Defense Fund for the "National Pro-Choice 
Coalition."</ul>
	Paradoxically, the success of the pro-abortion movement reduces the number of 
babies available for adoption by loving couples unable to have children _the clear goal of 
Robert Sterling Clark's children's rights efforts, which gets only a fraction of the 
Foundation's abortion funding. <p>

<b>A COMMITMENT TO THE ARTS</b>
<p>

Ayers justifies the Foundation's 
		commitment to the arts as in 
		keeping with the personal interests of Robert Sterling Clark, a collector 
who established the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, 
Massachusetts.  But in an unusual move, Ayers has focused her giving on administrative 
and infrastructure projects as well as on proposals purporting to defend free expression.<p>
	Like its schizophrenic policy of children's rights and abortion rights, the Robert 
Sterling Clark Foundation has a Janus-faced view of support for the arts.  It funds both 
business ventures to help generate revenues for arts organizations which conservatives 
would find easy to support,  as well as People for the American Way's "Artsave" project, 
which compiles charges of so-called "censorship" -- which often are just complaints from 
outraged citizens.<p>
	On the other hand, Ayers is very proud of the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation's 
support for income generating projects in the arts.  Among the most successful of these 
was a grant underwriting the scene shop of Playwrights Horizons, a small theatre 
workshop in New York City.  Once headed by Andre Bishop, now artistic director of the 
Lincoln Center theatre company, and Paul Daniels, Playwrights Horizons established 
"Scenic Central," a cooperative storage and construction facility which employed 
non-union labor to build sets for nonprofit theatre companies along New York's 42nd 
Street Theatre Row.  This enterprise created "a million dollar cashflow for the theatre 
company," says Ayers.<p>
	Andre Bishop told Foundation Watch that the scene shop "helped our whole 
theatre world. It grew to be pretty big, and was a way of achieving self-motivated 
financial independence."  Bishop added that "of all the funding sources, Peggy is the most 
knowledgable and sympathetic, very into improving business practices."  Besides "Scenic 
Central," Bishop says Ayers approved grants for new computer systems, audience 
devleopment, and other infrastructure programs.<p>
	However, the flip side of Ayers' union-busting entrepreneurship on Theatre Row 
is her support, on First Amendment grounds, for the most indefensible projects the 
National Endowment for the Arts has to offer.<p>
	By paying for legal defense teams, the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation helps 
insure that the NEA will remain unresponsive to taxpayers and their representatives. They 
approach arts controversies over Mapplethorpe, et. al. as free speech issues rather than 
issues of government accountability _ as the Foundation does over child welfare _ or of 
financial accountability _ as the Foundation does with its other arts grants.  This course 
will doom the NEA.  It caused Congress' two percent cut in the NEA's annual 
appropriations in 1992, then a five percent cut in 1994, a forty percent reduction last year, 
and now NEA's planned termination. For Congress must account for expenditures of tax 
dollars.<p>
	Foundation grants helped pay for  ACLU lawyers who represented the Cincinnati 
Museum of Art and director Dennis Barrie for an exhibition of works by Robert 
Mapplethorpe. They also represented so-called "NEA Four" performance artists.  The 
ACLU won the Mapplethorpe obscenity case, and it settled the grant denials litigation 
with Karen Finley, Tim Miller, Holly Hughes, and John Fleck (now a supporting cast 
member on NBC's Homicide) for a quarter of a million dollars.<p>
	By treating government arts funding as a First Amendment issue, Ayers has 
adopted the same "rights-based" arguments which she has used in fighting the abortion 
issue and that have become the essence of modern liberalism.  In 1994 Foundation grants 
defending the sanctity of the presumed "right" to offend the taxpayer have been made in 
the amounts of $50,000 to the National Campaign for Freedom of Expression, $50,000 to 
the National Cultural Alliance, $50,000 to the ACLU Arts Censorship Project, $25,000 to 
the Alliance for the Arts, and $80,000 to People for the American Way's Artsave Project.<p>
	Ayers fails to see the link between her funding and the NEA controversy, 
however, saying that "the Artsave project didn't really have anything to do with the NEA.  
The purpose was to make people aware of where people were being censored."  One 
suspects that the NEA is now expendable to arts advocates --  if its sacrifice on the altar 
of the First Amendment enables artists to continue to enjoy the myth of  their own 
rebellion.  It would be better if the Foundation concentrated on showing artists how to 
create markets for their work, attract audiences, and continue improving arts 
administration.<p>
	As in much of life, it seems as though the law of unintended consequences has 
directed the activities of the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation and its executive director.  
Despite its civil libertarian self-image, the Foundation has moved the arts into the 
marketplace.  And despite its aggressive advocacy of state-sanctioned abortion, it has 
highlighted the need to defend children from state welfare agencies and misguided 
"family preservation" policies.  In a sense, the Foundation is at a crossroads.  <p>
	For if Margaret Ayers would realize the good that the Robert Sterling Clark 
Foundation has done unintentionally, she might be able to re-orient her grants to match 
her empirical successes.  Ayers might fund maternity homes and orphanages instead of 
abortion clinics, religious instruction and etiquette classes instead of sexuality education, 
and concentrate on generating new profits and audiences for arts institutions and artists.<p>

<b>Robert Sterling Clark Foundations Clubbable<br> Board of Directors</b><p>

	The trustees of the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation have been described by 
those who know them as white shoe, Wall Street, and fiscally conservative.  One 
Ayers friend called them the kind of people [who], if you wanted to join a country club, 
you wouldnt want them to judge your application.  Yet Peggys got them buying 
condoms for high school kids.  Shes brought them around to positions they wouldnt 
ordinarily take.<p>
	The descriptions are entirely accurate.  If there is a Liberal Establishment, the 
Robert Sterling Clark board provides a good sampling of its members worthy of case 
study.<p>
	Winthrop R. Munyan, chairman of the board, is a prominent New York lawyer 
with offices on both Park and Lexington Avenues.  Director Raymond D. Horton heads 
New York Citys Citizens Budget Committee and boasts to reporters of receiving 
personal phone calls from former Governor Mario Cuomo while on vacation in Jamaica.  
Philip Svigals lives in fashionable Upper Montclair, New Jersey.<p> 
	Richardson Pratt, Jr., Williams class of 1946 and Harvard Business School, 
1948, is a resident of Cold Spring Harbor, Long Island, and a trustee of the Federation of 
Protestant Welfare Agencies, Near East Foundation, Brooklyn Botanical Garden, and 
Brooklyn Museum.  He is former chairman of Charles Pratt & Company, a director of the 
Dime Savings Bank of New York, and is now president of the Pratt Institute, a venerable 
art and engineering school in Brooklyn.<p>
	Miner Dunham Crary, Jr., Amherst class of 1942 and Harvard Law, 1948, is a 
Park Avenue lawyer with Crutis Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle.  A member of the Union 
League, Century, and Huntington Country Clubs, he is a trustee of the American 
University in Cairo, the Hecksher Art Museum in Huntington, Long Island, the Sterling 
and Francine Clark Art Institute, and former chairman of the Amherst College alumni 
council executive committee. <p>
	John Niebrugge Romans, Williams, 1964, and Columbia Law, 1967, is also a 
partner at Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle and chairman of the Bar of the City of 
New Yorks Aeronautical Committee.  He is a member of the Princeton and the 
Larchmont Yacht Clubs.<p>
	John Hoyt Stookey, Amherst, 1952, and Columbia, 1955, is the most recent 
director.  He is chairman of Quantum Chemical Corporation (formerly National Distillers 
and Chemical Corporation), director of Riegel Textile Corporation and Rexham

<b>Anti Catholic Opposition Research</b><p>

	 A New Rite: Conservative Catholic Organizations And Their Allies, researched 
and written by Steve Askin,  was first published by Catholics For Free Choice in 1994 
and has been updated in 1995.<p>
	Except for its putative liberal tilt, the document reads like a Ku Klux Klan tract 
from the 1920's, complete with allegations of a Papist conspiracy active in America.  But 
this time, the charge is that the Church supports the Religious Right. Rather than 
advocating lynching, the author merely compiles an enemies list.<p>
	In compiling this directory, we attempted to identify the Catholic organizations -
- and their close collaborators -- whose agendas support this conservative blueprint for 
family and society says Askin.<p>
	Some of the organizations singled out for scrutiny include the Knights of Malta, 
the Knights of Columbus, and the Domino's Foundation (based on the pizza fortune).<p>
	The shrill tone plays to traditional anti-Catholic bigotry by scapegoating Catholics 
even for the activities of Baptists.<p>
	"It was a Catholic...Paul Weyrich... who concocted the phrase 'moral majority' 
and who designed the agenda of the organization that went by that name. It was the 
willingness of the Catholic bishops to speak out 'courageously' on abortion that Jerry 
Falwell cited as the stimulus for his own entry into the political sphere, declares the 
introduction. Pope John Paul II, Jerry Falwell once declared, is the best hope we 
Baptists ever had.<p>
	Askin ominously points out that Phyllis Schlafly... William Bennett... Patrick 
Buchanan... are all Catholics. <p>
	He then goes on to indulge in deconstructing a  newspaper photograph in the 
National Catholic Reporter. Seated on the dais are cardinals John J. O'Connor, 
Bernard Law, Anthony Bevilacqua, James Hickery, and Roger Mahony, whle pounding 
away at the podium before a 'March for Life' audience is a stern faced Jesse Helms...So 
even though the bishops and Helms take opposing positions on virtually every social 
question except reproductive issues, they are political pals.<p>
	Add the pope's anti-Communist crusade to his conservative family agenda, fierce 
opposition to abortion and contraception, lack of recognition of women's rights, an 
authoritarian style of leadership, and one sees a near perfect reflection of the agenda of 
the Religious Right, writes Askin. <p>
	He concludes his introduction with a call for a new crusade against an imposing 
force in public life, with enormous potential to affect politics, public policy, and the 
church. If Weyrich is correct, and this is war, we do well to know the enemy.<p>
  What is surprising is that the board of directors of the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation 
is apparently not ashamed of this document.

<b>Foundation Watch Study</b><p>

A study of recent IRS data has revealed that the median payout rate for grantmaking 
foundations in 1992 was 8.17 percent, up from 7 percent in 1990 as reported in 
Foundation News (March-April, 1994), which used a different method.<p>

  The new analysis, conducted for Foundation Watch, was based on the just-released 
Private Foundations and Charitable Trusts, 1992, in the IRS Statistic of Income Bulletin, 
vol. 15, no. 3.<p>

  The breakdown was as follows:<br><p>

Size of Foundation Average Distributions<br>
<pre>
$100k to $1m		19.7%<br>
$1m to $10m		10.7%<br>
$10m to $25m		10.5%<br>
$25m to $50m		9.1%<br>
$50m to $100m		7.7%<br>
$100m and above		6.4%<br>
</pre>
<p>
  The median payout rate was computed by dividing the median of overall qualifying 
distributions of grantmaking foundations by the median of overall foundation net worth.  
The  average distribution for each foundation size category was determined by dividing 
the net worth on column 46 of the "Private Foundation" spread sheet of the  IRS Statistic 
of Income Bulletin by the qualifying distributions in column 52 of the same document for 
each category.<p>

<h2><B><FONT SIZE=4>The Nonprofit Sector Abroad<BR>
</FONT></B></h2>
<p>
<I> How does the nonprofit sector in the U.S. compare to that of
other countries?  What are American charities and foundations
doing to promote nonprofit organizations abroad?  This issue discusses
the role of nonprofits in Russia, China, and Sweden.  It shows
that the nonprofit sector in each country has evolved differently,
often producing marked differences, and that the involvement of
U.S. organizations in each country varies significantly.
<P>
 Jeffrey Gayner observes how a developing nonprofit sector in
Russia dealing with the aftermath of the collapse of communism
to propel Russia toward a liberal, democratic order.  Mr. Gayner
opened and directed the Moscow Office of the Heritage Foundation
from 1992 to 1994.  He is author of CRC's recent monograph The
Fulbright Program After 50 Years: From Mutual Understanding to
Mutual Support.
<P>
 Eric Brodin discusses China's less visible nonprofit sector and
describes the role U.S. foundations can play in helping to move
China toward free markets and limited government.  He also offers
an interesting case study in how Sweden's nonprofit sector is
dominated by government-subsidized interest groups and how voluntary
initiative in Sweden has been largely supplanted by the welfare
state.  Mr. Brodin is Director of the Foundation for International
Studies in Buies Creek, North Carolina.  He served as the Burrows
T. Lundy Chair Professor at Campbell University from 1980 to 1988.</i>

<HR>
<H2>Russia's Emerging Nonprofit Sector:</H2>

<H3>An Interview with Jeffrey Gayner</H3>

<B> Q.</B> <I>Are U.S. foundations, corporations, and philanthropists
taking a greater interest in Russia than, say, five years ago?</I>
<P>
<B> A.</B> There has been an extraordinary growth of American
involvement in Russia since the collapse of Communism.  This is
best reflected in an extensive survey conducted by the Citizens
Democracy Corps, a Washington, D.C. private nonprofit organization
that has sent over 400 U.S. volunteers from the private sector
to help build democratic institutions and free markets in the
central and eastern Europe.  What began as a short survey, which
I assisted in when directing at the Moscow Office of the Heritage
Foundation, eventually became a 347-page book covering U.S. organizations'
involvement in all of central and eastern Europe.  The study revealed
that as of 1994, 407 American organizations had programs in Russia
and 128 had set up offices there.
<P>
 This only included academic and philanthropic activities.  Business
activities have also expanded rapidly.  Currently, over 800 U.S.
companies are registered with the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.  Moreover,
of an estimated $4 billion in foreign private investments in Russia,
$2.2 billion has come from American companies.
<P>
<B> Q.</B> <I>What are some of the main economic, political, and
social reforms that nonprofits have helped to promote?</I>
<P>
<B> A.</B> Thus far, nonprofits' involvement in social reforms
has lagged behind their push for political and economic reforms.
 Their main endeavors have been academic and research-oriented.
 American universities have established or broadened existing
exchange programs.  Research institutes have studied aspects of
economic and political reform.  And religious and humanitarian
groups have rapidly moved into Russia where their activities were
once prohibited or largely non-existent.
<P>
 Since virtually no academic freedom existed under communism,
serious research was narrowly constrained.  Western groups have
brought a whole new way of operating and thinking into Russian
society.  Individuals promoting free-market economic reforms,
who remained largely underground until recently, readily make
use of the advice and assistance provided by U.S. and other Western
groups.
<P>
 The Heritage Foundation worked directly with leading members
of the parliament in drafting legislation in areas where we offered
American expertise--agriculture and land laws, bankruptcy, banking,
privatization, and regulating lobbying activities.  In the political
realm, the system of creating parties and holding elections relied
heavily on Washington, D.C.-based groups such as the Krieble Institute,
the National Endowment for Democracy and its international Republican
and Democratic Institutes, and the International Foundation for
Electoral Systems, an election monitoring group.
<P>
<B> Q.</B> <I>Are voluntary associations, such as relief organizations,
clubs and associations increasing in number?</I>
<P>
<B> A.</B> Yes.  In particular, business groups are forming that
have published an avalanche of materials and have held numerous
meetings to better understand the new economic environment.  The
Enterprise and Economic Development Program in Moscow, started
by the Citizens Democracy Corps, has sought to create a mechanism
for cooperation among emerging Russian business organizations.
<P>
 Numerous humanitarian organizations have also proliferated, often
started by established Western groups.  Both the Salvation Army
and World Vision have set up relief operations with Russian counterparts.
 Some Russian Orthodox religious leaders have promoted similar
activities, such as Alexander Borisov, who has established a support
mechanism for the Russian Children's Hospital.  Through a coordinated
effort, several Western protestant groups have created Co-Mission,
which seeks to infuse the teaching of ethics and morality into
Russian schools.  The Christian Legal Society was created in Moscow
with the help of the Law and Liberty Trust, based in Virginia,
to create a legal basis for religious freedom in Russia.
<P>
 In addition, individual and group efforts to lobby arose so quickly
in 1992 that the parliament, then the Russian Supreme Soviet,
restricted access to its building to prevent &quot;interruptions&quot;
in its work.  Since the December 1993 elections, which created
a new parliament, more public input has been welcomed.
<P>
<B> Q.</B> <I>What are some of the main obstacles voluntary organizations
face?</I>
<P>
<B> A.</B> Many people are reluctant to join organizations because
they retain a lifelong wariness of speaking and acting in an open
and forthright manner in dealing with controversial issues.  Another
main problem is financial: no recent tradition exists for paying
membership dues.  In a relatively poor society, even modest membership
fees are difficult to collect.  Moreover, the communist party
was the only large membership organization--not an encouraging
precedent.  Furthermore, new businesses, struggling to survive
high taxes and heavy regulation, are largely unwilling to make
contributions to organizations, or even to advertise in publications,
unless they are guaranteed a favorable news story on their behalf.
<P>
<B> Q.</B> <I>What are some areas in which the voluntary sector
can begin to replace government functions?</I>
<P>
<B> A.</B> Given the dismal state of government services, voluntary
organizations have quickly moved in to offer alternatives in a
vast range of areas.  Private education, from non-government schools
to day care to summer camps, has emerged.  Western religious groups
as well as the Russian Orthodox Church have expanded activities,
particularly in providing relief services, such as soup kitchens.
 Neighborhood associations have formed to deal with common housing
problems as well as with setting up security networks to supplement
the police.
<P>
<B> Q.</B> <I>How many market-oriented research organizations
are there now in Russia?  What are the main issues they are studying
and how effective have they been?</I>
<P>
<B> A.</B> Nearly all the research organizations that exist now
in Russia claim the moniker &quot;market-oriented.&quot;  Using
that phrase almost magically opens the door to Western financial
support.  Unfortunately, many longstanding research organizations
simply changed the nameplates on their doors after the demise
of communism and pay mostly lip service to a market philosophy.
 Only six or seven groups have consistently and seriously pursued
the kind of radical economic reform needed to bring about a transformation
of the economy.
<P>
 Most prominent among them have been the Institute for the Study
of the Russian Economy, a small group of independent, market-oriented
scholars; the International Center for Research in Economic Reform,
which has worked as a semi-autonomous research unit closer to
government; and particularly, the Institute for the Economy in
Transition, created by Yegor Gaidar, who headed Russia's Choice
Party in the parliament last year.  These organizations have largely
supplemented the often stagnant work on economic reform done by
government ministries.  But by being outside the formal ministries,
they have avoided much of the bureaucratic legacy that haunts
new Russian policy initiatives.
<P>
 With the recent expulsion of the last leading reformers from
the Russian government, particularly Anatoli Chubais as Deputy
Minister for Economic Policy, it is uncertain how effective genuine
reform-oriented research groups will be in affecting government
policy.  More attention will probably shift to the parliament,
public debate in the press, and work with Western groups and governments
to sustain reform initiatives.
<P>
<B> Q.</B> <I>What promising signs or trends do you see in Russia
that offer hope for the reemergence of civil society?</I>
<P>
<B> A.</B> The most encouraging developments remain the general
openness of Russian society and the genuinely free debate on all
issues.  Unfortunately, as the recent elections have shown, demagoguery
can accompany democracy and adversely impact the election results.
 But important generational differences also exist, with younger
people both acting and voting in a more Western manner.
<P>
 Perhaps most important in the long run is the extensive interchange
of Russians and Westerners at the non-government level, whether
through university educational programs or other exchange programs.
 The Washington, D.C.-based National Forum Foundation and the
San Francisco-based Center for Citizen Initiatives have brought
over 400 Russians to the U.S. to intern with private companies,
news organizations, and research institutes.  This interaction
has hopefully fostered an appreciation of what Russia could become.
<P>
 In Russia, people are quickly coming to realize that they must
rely on themselves and their local communities to improve their
lives.  With a growing understanding of how the non-government
sector addresses problems elsewhere in the world, Russians are
seizing such opportunities.
<P>
<B> Q.</B> <I>What are some of the worrisome signs?</I>
<P>
<B> A.</B> Overcoming the psychological legacy of communism is
proving far more difficult than eradicating its political institutions,
especially among the elderly.  While appalled by the former communist
system, many people nonetheless retain much of the communist criticism
of capitalism.  Many remain wedded to dependency on government
subsidies.  They know that prices, such as for bread, should not
be artificially low, but they rebel against market prices.  People
remain suspicious of anyone who makes money.  The egalitarian
impulse coupled with widely reported abuses under the existing
system has created a reaction against reform.
<P>
 The situation, especially in the political area, will likely
retrogress in the immediate future.  But government incompetence
will also give individuals and local communities wide latitude
to solve problems on their own.
<P>
<B> Q.</B> <I>How can donors identify organizations that are actually
helping the needy or promoting civil society while staying clear
of groups run by con artists or groups that are not really committed
to change?</I>
<P>
<B> A.</B> Donors need on-the-ground-experience to ensure that
their programs reach intended targets.  They must look beyond
the names of organizations and the eloquence with which some Russians
speak English.  Although it is initially more expensive to have
Westerners direct foreign offices, only over time can properly
trained Russians be brought to leading levels of responsibility.
<P>
 Five years has elapsed since the fall of communism, and it is
now fairly easy to tell who actually promotes reform.  Whenever
possible, donors should work with those who challenged the system
from the beginning.  Since many of these people spent time in
prison instead of in academic settings, they may not be particularly
&quot;polished,&quot; but they clearly have the most fervent commitment
to creating a durable civil society.  Similarly, younger people
are among the easiest to deal with since they can absorb change
more rapidly.
<P>
<B> Q.</B> <I>What can donors do to ensure that their gifts are
not diverted?  Can sending in-kind gifts help guard against diversion?</I>
<P>
<B> A.</B> Donors should always try to provide direct or in-kind
support.  It best to bring fax machines and computers directly
into the country, rather than send money.  Equipment can also
be purchased locally, but can be much more expensive.
<P>
 As a demonstration of goodwill, donors should seek out local
organizations to provide additional support.  Avoiding government
institutions is critical because of the expense and bureaucratic
quagmires.  Donors who are harassed about bringing in-kind support
into the country should seek help from local contacts or possibly
the U.S. Embassy.
<P>
<B> Q.</B> <I>What are some organizations that you have a high
regard for?</I>
<P>
<B> A.</B> The most admirable groups are the ones fighting for
the most radical changes, often under the most adverse conditions.
 The Glasnost Foundation, for example, began work by taking advantage
of the initial openness under President Gorbachev.  It has pressed
vigorously for respect for human rights and a complete end to
the totalitarian system.  In recent years, despite continuous
harassment, it has critically examined the role of the KGB, both
in the past and present.  Helsinki Watch and Freedom House, both
in New York City, and the Democratic Russia-USA Foundation and
the Jamestown Foundation, both in Washington, D.C., have similarly
monitored and assisted in the expansion of civil liberties.  All
have offices in Moscow.
<P>
 The New York City-based Soros Foundation/Open Society Fund, created
by Hungarian-born businessman George Soros, has provided massive
private support to the academic community and has supported conferences
that have played a valuable role in stimulating thinking about
the nature of a free society.  The Washington, D.C.-based Krieble
Institute has created a network of fellows throughout Russia and
has held conferences that have made a major contribution to the
development of a reform-oriented political order.
<P>
<B> Q.</B> <I>What do you think the voluntary sector will look
like in Russia five years from now?</I>
<P>
<B> A.</B> The voluntary sector will play an increasingly critical
role in the transformation of Russia in the next several years,
particularly if communists and ultra-nationals do as well in the
presidential election this June as they did in parliamentary elections
last December.  With a government apparently retreating from reform,
the effort to sustain and expand upon reforms already made will
have to rely more on non-government organizations.  The government
may ultimately decide to take action against these groups.  Thus,
the higher international profile they develop in the next six
months may be critical not only to their influence but to their
survival.<P>

<H2>The Giant Awakes:<BR>
The Emergence of Nonprofit Organizations in China<BR></H2>
by Eric Brodin<BR>
<P>
 Napoleon is reputed to have said, &quot;Let China sleep, for
when she awakes, the world will tremble.&quot;
<P>
 The giant is very much alive today.  The People's Republic of
China is the world's most populous country with an estimated population
of 1.4 billion.  It is third largest in land area and the eighth
richest.  GDP is expected to grow from $2,838 billion (U.S. 1994
dollars) to $8,877 billion by 2010.<SUP>1</SUP>  While these statistics
look impressive, however, China's immense population must be kept
in mind: annual per capita income is only about $350.
<P>
 The Heritage Foundation's <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I> says
this about China: &quot;[It is economically] more advanced and
open than it was several decades ago.  Many of the economic reforms
of the 1980s were undone following the Tiananmen Square massacre
in 1989.  However, since that time, China once again has pursued
economic liberalization.&quot;  However, the report warns that
&quot;an overwhelmingly large part of [China's economy] remains
under state control.&quot;<SUP>2</SUP>
<P>
 Wealth is now being created--both legally and illegally--at an
almost furious pace in the coastal areas, such as Fujian province.
 But the as-yet underdeveloped legal system, which is needed to
protect contracts, and oppressive government regulation remain
serious hindrances to liberalization, and China's human rights
record is dismal.  Still, barring unanticipated reversals by China's
aging political leadership, a cautiously optimistic view of China's
future--and the development of its voluntary sector--is warranted.
<P>

<HR>
<H2>China's &quot;Voluntary Sector&quot;</H2>

 Little is known about the voluntary sector in China today, although
China has a rich history of philanthropy.<SUP>3</SUP>  Early in
this century, every large city had voluntary organizations that
provided relief to the needy and promoted civic betterment.  By
the end of World war II, private and semi-private organizations
supported one-third of China's educational institutions, and churches
joined with other charities to provide medical care, education,
and relief services.
<P>
 With the rise of the communist state in the 1950s, independent
charities were forced to cease operation as the government assumed
responsibility for poverty relief, education, and welfare.  Ostensibly,
voluntary organizations such as youth groups, residents' committees,
and professional associations flourished.  Not until the 1980s,
under a policy of decentralization and denationalization, did
genuine charitable organizations again become officially recognized.
<P>
 According to one 1989 study, there are well over one million
organizations in China today, including political organizations,
scientific and professional associations, social clubs, unions,
residents' committees, self-help organizations, and private welfare
agencies.  Most of these, however, receive government funding.
<P>

<HR>
<H2>The Rise of NGOs in China</H2>

 In 1993, leaders of several American foundations, headed by John
W. Cook of the Henry Luce Foundation, traveled to the cities of
Beijing, Shanghai, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Hong Kong to learn about
the role of China's so-called &quot;non-government organizations.&quot;
 The other delegates were: David M. Lampton of the National Committee
on U.S.-China Relations (NCUSCR); Kevin F.F. Quigley, formerly
with the Pew Charitable Trusts; Peter Riggs of the Rockefeller
Brothers Fund; William J. Van Ness, Jr. of the Henry M. Jackson
Foundation; Patricia D. Wright of the Amoco Foundation; and Jon
Vondracek of the Johnson Foundation.
<P>
 A NCUSCR report, <I>The Rise of Non-Governmental Organizations
in China: Implications for Americans</I>, summarizes the group's
findings: &quot;Economic reform . . . is having wide-ranging consequences.
. . .  New social groups, with economic resources at their disposal,
[are] arising and making demands. . . .&quot;  This has provoked
a mixed response from government, which favors new wealth to &quot;help
solve social problems and generate resources, but at the same
time . . . deeply fears the loss of control that such developments
entail.&quot;<SUP>4</SUP>
<P>
 The report notes that the Chinese government is heavily involved
in what can loosely be described as a nonprofit sector, and it
gives examples of what it paradoxically calls &quot;government-owned
non-government organizations.&quot;  These do things quite similar
to Western nonprofits:
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> The China Youth Development Foundation's
Project Hope seeks to educate children in 25 of China's poorest
provinces.  It has created 62 primary schools and provided funds
to 328,000 school dropouts.  In 1993, it gave financial assistance
to about 1,000 secondary school students and 100 college students.
 The report notes, however, that Project Hope's degree of autonomy
is difficult to determine: &quot;It is unclear what relationship
the [foundation] has to local government agencies.&quot;<SUP>5</SUP>
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> The Hwa Nan Women's College was
created around the turn of the century by the Ladies Missionary
Society of Baltimore.  By 1917, it had a fully accredited B.A.
program.  In 1951, the communist regime took it over, merging
it with Fukian Christian College and the Provincial Agricultural
College.  Hwa Nan College has since been reestablished, but like
Project Hope, its autonomy is ambiguous: it remains heavily dependent
on public funding, although individual donors and tuitions provide
some revenue.
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> The Beijing Energy Efficiency
Center is a joint project of Batelle Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory
and China's State Planning Commission.  It seeks to promote energy
efficiency &quot;to achieve economic development and environmental
protection.&quot;  While partly managed by the government, it
is financially independent, receiving all funds from its U.S.
founders.  Its charter calls for eventual independence from the
government.
<P>

<HR>
<H2>Creating a Framework for Nonprofits</H2>

 To support the creation of a nonprofit sector in China, the NCUSCR
report makes the following recommendations:
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> Laws must be passed that would
establish and regulate non-governmental organizations, assuring
their autonomy and requiring accountability;
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> The development of a vibrant
NGO sector would require an updated banking system and effective
taxation practices;
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> NGOs in China must develop good
management practices, including systems that establish organizational
purposes and methods to accomplish them;
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> Control procedures must be adopted
to strengthen the legal status of NGOs.  This would require a
greater openness in accounting and control procedures.  Well-established
American foundations could do much to help establish methods for
fiscal responsibility.
<P>

<HR>
<H2>What U.S. Nonprofits Can Do</H2>

 U.S. nonprofits have a vital role to play in China because the
development of nonprofits there is so uncertain.  While many U.S.
foundations and public policy groups have visited China, those
that have sought to promote a market economy are perhaps doing
the most to create conditions for a genuine nonprofit sector.
 Both the Washington, D.C.-based Cato Institute and the Fairfax,
Virginia-based Atlas Foundation have hosted conferences in Beijing.
 The latter event, co-hosted by the market-oriented Friedrich
Naumann Foundation of Germany, attracted 60 scholars, half of
them Chinese.  To support the creation of a liberal and stable
democracy, both conferences highlighted ways to promote free markets,
privatization, private property, civil rights, and private initiative.
<P>
 While encouraging a nonprofit sector in China, U.S. nonprofits
need to anticipate three trends likely to affect China's future:
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> A growing, educated, and affluent
middle class can be expected to organize itself and express its
concerns;
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> The Chinese traditions of family
self-help and loyalty to one's clan (tong) may serve as catalysts
for locally based private initiatives if China moves toward a
more limited role for government;
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> Under the most favorable scenario,
continued trade with Taiwan and Hong Kong as well as the incorporation
of Hong Kong into mainland China in 1997 may help propel China
toward freer markets and create more opportunities for voluntary
initiatives.

<H2>The Nonprofit Sector in Sweden:<BR>
Personal Reflections<BR></H2>
by Eric Brodin

<P>
 As a young boy I remember walking the streets of my native city,
Gothenburg (G&ouml;teborg), Sweden's second largest city.  On
occasion I would come across a large building on whose facade
was written <I>stiftelse</I>, signifying that this was a charitable
institution founded by a wealthy family with old money.  In the
class-based Sweden of my youth, it was understood that the wealthy
were to part with some of their fortune to help the needy.
<P>
 But when Sweden became a socialist welfare state, the role of
<I>stiftelse</I> diminished.  Since the Socialist Party won a
parliamentary majority in 1932, it has remained in power but for
two brief periods, 1976-82 and 1991-94.  As a result of socialist
legislation, propaganda, and other pressures, the nongovernmental
sector of society has lost much of its independence and sense
of mission.  Instead of allowing a rich diversity of independent
charities to flourish, the Swedish government today heavily subsidizes
organizations that serve protected special interests.
<P>

<HR>
<H2>Nonprofits: Wedded to Government</H2>

 Unlike American nonprofits, most organizations in Sweden are
closely tied to local and central government.  In this respect,
the are more like the &quot;non-government organizations&quot;
of China.  John Boli of Sweden's University of Lund makes these
observations:
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> With some 200,000 organizations
and over 31 million memberships in a population of 8.3 million,
Sweden's per capita membership in organizations is among the largest
in the world;
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> Swedish organizations focus on
social reform and political advocacy, recreation, and the protection
of organized interests;
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> There are few private organizations
that run Swedish schools, provide health care, or offer welfare
services.  Charitable efforts are directed primarily to poor countries
in Africa and Asia.
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> Swedish groups work closely with
local and central government.  They are heavily dependent on taxes
and receive little private funding.<SUP>1</SUP>
<P>
 Observers of Swedish society have noted that individualism is
little valued by Swedes while membership in and identification
with groups is widely approved.  Roland Huntford notes that &quot;the
country is adapted to dealing, not with the individual, but with
corporate bodies, and the citizen is therefore expected to belong
to some organization catering to his occupation and interests.&quot;<SUP>2</SUP>
 Swedish national life is dominated by <I>f&ouml;reningar</I>,
or associations representing workers, renters, the elderly, and
other interest groups.  These serve as ombudsmen or official moderators
between organized interest groups and the government.
<P>
 Organizations associated with the socialist and labor movements
receive particularly heavy government subsidies.  In 1986-87,
adult education groups also received 70 percent of their revenues
from government.  A 1980 survey of six municipalities found the
following proportions of government funding: sports groups, 29
percent; scouting groups, 43 percent; temperance societies, 51
percent; religious groups, 25 percent.<SUP>3</SUP>  Even the Lutheran
Church, the official state church of Sweden, to which 90 percent
of the population belongs, is funded by general tax revenues and
a special church tax.  Until recently, non-Lutherans were required
to pay 60 percent of the church tax on the grounds that the Church
maintained vital records.
<P>
 Most other religious groups also receive government subsidies
for their youth and charitable work.  These include mainline evangelical
groups, such as the Methodists, Baptists, and Pentecostals, and
so-called &quot;foreign&quot; churches, including the Roman Catholic
and Greek Orthodox faiths.  Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses, however,
have refused all forms of state aid.  Interestingly, these are
the fastest growing religious denominations in Sweden.
<P>

<HR>
<H2>Associations and Foundations</H2>

 Sweden has many charities and foundations that benefit children
and the disabled, that support museums and theaters, and that
recognize athletic achievement.  Many of these were created by
wealthy families and individuals, and some are still controlled
by private companies or descendants of the original donors.  As
in the U.S., Swedish charities and foundations are generally exempt
from taxation if they serve a &quot;public good.&quot;  However,
contributions to charities are not tax-deductible.  Unlike U.S.
nonprofits, most Swedish organizations now receive much of their
funding from government.
<P>
 A look at the Stockholm telephone directory shows a tremendous
range of foundations, charities, and advocacy groups similar to
those in the U.S.:
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> The Women's Forum Foundation
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> Friends of Sobriety Foundation

 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> Computers for the Handicapped

<H2>&quot;The Atrophy of Personal Charity&quot;</H2>

 The role of associations, charities, and foundations in Sweden
today largely reflects a political atmosphere created by a half-century's
growth of the public sector.  Acts of voluntarism that many Americans
would praise are often viewed with suspicion or hostility by Swedes.
 Volunteers in hospitals and at school crossings are often opposed
by vested interests such as unions.
<P>
 Sweden is therefore an instructive example of what the late Russell
Kirk called &quot;the atrophy of personal charity.&quot;  When
the government is expected to provide an array of services funded
through taxes, we feel less obliged to practice small acts of
personal kindness and giving.  The desire to overcome common difficulties
through voluntary effort is largely lost.<BR>

<H2>A Village Called Washington<BR>
Hillary Clinton's <I>It Takes a Village<BR>
</I></H2>

 Recent years have seen an outpouring of books, reports, and articles
examining the status of children in the U.S. and proposing largely
political remedies to the problems they face.  To this can be
added Hillary Rodham Clinton's <I>It Takes a Village and other
Lessons Children Teach Us</I> (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster,
1996, 318 pages).  Writing from the perspective of one who has
been both &quot;mother, daughter, sister, and wife&quot;--and
staff attorney at the liberal Children's Defense Fund--Mrs. Clinton
seeks to offer &quot;lessons&quot; to help us better understand
and satisfy the needs of children.
<P>
 The irresolute reader is cautioned: despite Mrs. Clinton's claim
that the book is not &quot;a textbook or an encyclopedia,&quot;
it often resembles a discourse on anything and everything related
to children.  Included are tips on child-rearing--&quot;Applaud
and encourage learning for learning's sake, whether it's cloud-watching
or understanding what keeps a kite in the sky or mixing paints
to make new colors&quot;--as well as nutritional advice--&quot;[eat]
more grains, beans, fish, fruits, and vegetables and less meat,
fat, and sugar.&quot;  Some remarks reminded this reviewer of
the proverbial dinner guest who stays until three in the morning--&quot;It
surprised us to discover that Chelsea did not like hot dogs and
hamburgers--when we went to McDonald's, it was strictly Chicken
McNuggets for her.&quot;
<P>
 Despite its long-windedness, the book is less concerned with
how to raise children than with drumming up support for federal
laws, regulations, and programs that the author believes are needed
to protect children.  According to Mrs. Clinton, children today
are &quot;under unprecedented threat&quot; from &quot;anti-government&quot;
extremists.  We may soon see &quot;a decrease in federal pollution
standards&quot; and &quot;the elimination of federal regulations
that protect us from outbreaks of contaminated drinking water.&quot;
 Current efforts to devolve authority in these areas to state
and local governments are ignored by the book's not-so-subtle
theme: federal downsizing will hurt children.
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton believes that the main challenge facing us today
is to agree on &quot;a common vision&quot; of how &quot;to build
strong families and communities&quot;--what she calls a caring
&quot;village&quot; that will help children reach their full potential.
 But what she offers is the status quo, plus a few more federal
programs.  The key institution of the village is a strong central
government that provides extensive support to parents and communities
in all aspects of child care, from vaccinations to food assistance
to day care.  The author never recognizes that to fund the many
programs she favors, resources must be taken from the private
sector, leaving parents and communities with fewer resources of
their own to meet childrens' needs.
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton does have some reasonable ideas.  She wants to reduce
foster-care and adoption roles by 100,000 annually, partly by
terminating biological parents' rights more quickly.  She favors
charter schools and choice among public schools.  She also praises
community-based programs that are addressing crime, drug abuse,
and other problems.  But while urging readers to resist &quot;the
lure of extremist rhetoric,&quot; she seems unable to resist the
lure of greater federal activism.
<P>
 Among the responsibilities she sees for government: &quot;to
provide essential services,&quot; &quot;to support families at
work and at home,&quot; and &quot;to build communities that fulfill
their obligations to families, the environment, and those who
need and deserve support.&quot;  This everything-under-the-sun
role prompts her to call for more government-funded job training,
an increase in the minimum wage (&quot;a modest increase,&quot;
she claims, &quot;does not cost jobs&quot;), and praise for a
host of supposedly vital programs that many Americans have never
heard of, such as C. Everett Koop's Shape Up America, the U.S.D.A.'s
Team Nutrition, and the President's Council on Physical Fitness
and Sports.
<P>
 But Mrs. Clinton suggests that the federal government do more.
 The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, which allows employees
of large companies to take 12 weeks' unpaid leave to care for
newborns, is a &quot;good beginning.&quot;  The real models, however,
are Germany, which grants tax-funded paid maternity leave for
14 weeks, and Sweden, which pays a full 15 months' leave.  France
is praised for its extensive government-funded preschool system
which provides &quot;sparkling classrooms&quot; and highly credentialed
teachers.  The author notes in passing that &quot;the price for
such generous social programs is felt across the board in higher
taxes.&quot;  She might have also mentioned less economic growth,
higher unemployment rates, and staggering national debts.
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton often seems oblivious to the benefits of choice
in the marketplace as well as to the costs of her suggestions.
 A major problem with day care in the U.S., she believes, is the
&quot;dizzying&quot; variety of options: care in private homes,
commercial day-care centers, university and parochial preschools,
nannies, relatives, and babysitters.  &quot;Many parents do not
know what to look for when choosing child care.&quot;  Presumably,
the local bookstore or library--can best address this &quot;problem&quot;
the government--not advice from neighbors or information from
of too many choices.  She also suggests a need for federal oversight
of day care, since home-based and commercial day-care providers
are subject to a &quot;hodgepodge&quot; of regulations and licensing
requirements that vary by state.  That federal requirements would
drive up day-care costs, adversely affecting lower-income parents,
goes unnoticed.
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton believes that Americans do not want a &quot;rollback&quot;
of government, only &quot;reform.&quot;  Yet more Americans seem
to think that the cost of big government--both in terms of dollars
ill spent and in weakened responsibilities for families, charities,
and voluntary associations--has become too high.  The voluntary
institutions that comprise real villages will thrive--as her husband
suggests--only by ending the era of big government.

<P>
The scheme to impose a government-controlled health
care system on the American public was not buried by the 1994
elections.  It's not even dead.  Advocates of Hillary-style health
care, stung by defeat in 1993, have reformulated their strategy,
changed their terminology, and shifted their venue.  Instead of
a frontal assault on the private provision of health care, they
are now sneaking their statist health agenda through the statehouse
and schoolhouse door.</FONT>
<P>
  Health care reform has been reincarnated as welfare
and education reform.  With financial support from major private
philanthropies like the Robert Wood Johnson, Henry J. Kaiser Family,
Annie E. Casey, and Rockefeller foundations, and the Pew Charitable
Trusts, proponents of national health care have reorganized and
repackaged their ideas into a number of state-based programs.
Instead of universal health care mandates on an entire population,
they propose a new framework of public-private education and welfare
partnerships.  And since these are touted as serving the &quot;needs&quot;
of children, lawmakers find them much harder to oppose.</FONT>
<P>
* * * * *</FONT>
<P>
  The Pennsylvania General Assembly's House of Representatives
recently passed a resolution, introduced with bipartisan support,
which authorized its Education Committee to investigate how the
state's public school system was being used to provide health
programs for students and their families.  Hearings were held
last year, and many legislators were shocked to discover that
in several districts school-based health clinics were already
providing extensive health services.  These clinics were established
and funded to provide a battery of services without the knowledge
or consent of the Pennsylvania General Assembly.</FONT>
<P>
  The Pennsylvania state legislature is learning
what other state legislators are learning:  that its constitutional
authority has been ignored and its prerogatives undercut by officials
in the Clinton Administration and the National Governors' Association
who are working with bureaucrats in state departments of education,
health, and public welfare, and with officials from private philanthropic
foundations, including the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the
Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, the Pew Charitable Trusts,
the Kellogg Foundation, and the Annie E. Casey Foundation.  (For
more information on the Casey Foundation, which is headed by United
Parcel Service Chairman Kent C. Nelson, see the December 1995
issue of Organization Trends.)</FONT>
<P>
  Legislatures are also discovering that programs
and proposals that claim to be intended for America's children
actually represent the spearhead of a renewed assault on private
health care.  Hundreds of boxes of documents labeled &quot;confidential&quot;
assembled by the once secret and largely still mysterious Clinton
Health Care Task Force in 1993, which are as yet uncatalogued,
but in the custody of the National Archives in College Park, Maryland,
disclose the Administration's thinking.  They contain extensive
references to child health programs as a fallback position in
case the Administration failed to secure a comprehensive and universal
national health system.  As a matter of public policy and political
strategy, the Clintonites consciously had decided to use children
to phase-in health programs ultimately intended for all Americans.</FONT>
<P>
  The documents suggest that the Clinton Administration
looked  carefully at Goals 2000, an education initiative begun
during the Bush Administration, and Medicaid, the government health
program for the poor jointly funded under complicated formulas
by the states and the federal government.  These programs would
be the vehicles to integrate and coordinate publicly-funded health
and human service programs.  </FONT>
<P>
  They would use school districts as delivery sites
for providing greatly expanded health services.  And they would
be responsive to signals from private philanthropic foundations
that would provide start-up funds that, when combined with subsequent
tax dollars, could draw almost every American citizen into a web
of new government health programs. <BR>

<h3>The Children's Initiative:  It Takes A Child To Disguise
A Policy</h3>

  The Clinton Administration has elevated into an
art form the use of children as tools of social policy.  By devising
new social programs so that children are the first beneficiaries
of government entitlements, Administration policymakers get the
public to acquiesce to programs that have far more ambitious goals.
Hillary Rodham Clinton's new book on children, It Takes A Village,
is meant to be a cozy literary paraphrase of Administration policies.</FONT>
<P>
  In 1988, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Robert
Wood Johnson Foundation, and the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation
provided grant monies that enabled the National Governors' Association
(NGA) to produce a manual for Goals 2000, a series of vague pledges
by the states to set more rigorous standards for public education.
One year later, the Bush administration and the NGA, chaired
by then-Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton, held an &quot;Education
Summit&quot; that further developed but did not clarify the goal
of national education standards.  </FONT>
<P>
  In 1994, while the Clintons' health reform proposals
were flailing, Goals 2000 became law.  Now a national mantra,
Goals 2000 is invoked by many in the education establishment to
justify the latest fads flowing through academia, e.g., outcomes-based
education.  Less noted is how it has been used as a cover to authorize
programs in health care.</FONT>
<P>
  Federal and state agencies and private nonprofit
organizations are currently seeking public and private funds for
the &quot;The Children's Initiative,&quot; which appears to be
a name assigned by the Philadelphia-based Pew Charitable Trusts
to describe the collaborative efforts of private foundations working
with government to develop, coordinate and support a panopoly
of health service programs in the nation's public school systems
_ a plan almost Byzantine in its complexity.  Particularly in
treating problems of student behavior, these programs have begun
raising eyebrows.</FONT>
<P>
  Under this initiative, Goals 2000 is creating a
system in which children selected by teachers are regularly tested
for emotional, social, mental, and physical disorders in clinics
established within public schools.  These disorders include what
is called Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) or Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).  Once children are diagnosed and
labelled as subject to this condition according to a scale of
supposed &quot;norms&quot; of mental and emotional health, school
health officials have the authority to treat them by prescribing
and administering such medications as Ritalin, Valium, Lorazepam
and Prozac.  These officials derive their authority from new,
looser prescription-writing standards developed under Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation initiatives to liberalize state restrictions
on who can prescribe medications, thus allowing nurse practitioners
and physician assistants to prescribe drugs.  The consent of parents
is sometimes required, and sometimes not.  </FONT>
<P>
  Goals 2000 proposals receive funding from federal
programs, including Medicaid and Maternal and Child Health (Title
X) block grants, comparable state programs, and philanthropic
foundations.  Some school districts and state legislatures have
resisted Goals 2000.  And at least four states, including Virginia,
have refused to apply for federal funds to implement it.  But
many Governors, unable to resist the lure of the hard coin, are
using Executive Orders to implement state programs to meet Goals
2000.<BR>

<a name="Quiz"></a>
<h3>The School Quiz: It's Different</h3>

  How did the problem of student misbehavior in school
become a national health issue?  In 1991, the U.S. Department
of Education formally recognized ADHD as a handicap under the
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and Section 504 of
the 1973 Rehabilitation Act.  The Department directed all state
education officers to ensure that local school districts established
procedures to screen and identify ADHD children and provide them
with special educational and psychological services.  Naturally,
&quot;school-wide&quot; interventions are favored by the Department.
Programs are now being developed for all children in public schools
and their parents.  </FONT>
<P>
  The parents of elementary school children in Gateway
School District in Pennsylvania recently came face to face with
the implications of all this.  Two projects named &quot;Pharmacological
and Psychosocial Treatment for ADHD&quot; and &quot;Community-Based
Treatment for ADHD: Summer Treatment Programs and School-Wide
Interventions&quot; were funded by a private foundation grant
to the University of Pittsburgh and the Gateway School District
in Pennsylvania.  The Pittsburgh-based foundation will not allow
its name to be disclosed.  The federal National Institutes of
Mental Health provided matching public grant monies, in amounts
as yet to be disclosed.   </FONT>
<P>
  One portion of the project is called the Pittsburgh
School Wide Intervention Model (PSWIM).  The Principal of Pitcairn
Elementary School, Alex J. Balla, described PSWIM in a letter
to parents:  &quot;Many parts of the PSWIM program are designed
to help children get along better with one another.  One part
uses a procedure called sociometrics, in which children are asked
to answer questions about the kids in their class.  Each child
... will be asked about who their best friends are, who they do
not want to be friends with, and to rate how much they like the
other kids in the class ... All information is kept confidential
and children will be told that it is very important that they
do not discuss their answers with the other kids.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
  The PSWIM program produces daily &quot;behavior&quot;
report cards and a &quot;behavior&quot; Honor Roll.  &quot;Positive&quot;
report cards go to students who do their homework, return homework
assignment sheets signed by a parent and &quot;break two or fewer
rules during the day.&quot;  There are only six rules, and all
are benign (e.g. be respectful of others; stay in assigned seat;
work quietly; and obey adults).  </FONT>
<P>
  The Behavior Honor Roll seems merely to codify
the tradition of &quot;teacher's pet.&quot;  Honor Roll kids ages
5 to 8 &quot;earn special class jobs and/or privileges,&quot;
and wear special badges.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  However,
PSWIM also requires each teacher to fill out an eight page &quot;Teacher
Rating Scale&quot; questionnaire for each five to eight year old
and check the applicable descriptions:</FONT>
<P>

<ul>
<li> has run away from home overnight at least twice
while living in a parental or parental surrogate home.
<P>
<li> often initiates physical fights with other members of his or her household.
<p>
<li> has forced someone into sexual activity.
<P>
<li> often stays out at night despite parental prohibitions.
<P>
<li> has stolen while confronting a victim (e.g. mugging,
purse snatching, extortion, armed robbery).
<P>
<li> teases or calls other children names.
<P>
<li> is disliked by other children.
<P>
<li> is simply ignored by other children.
</font>
<P>
<font size=2 > For five to eight year olds?  Reading the list,
one is struck by the gross disparity in behaviors.  The descriptions
range from normal childhood pranks and grievances to criminality.
Where would teachers have access to such information?</font>  
<P>
<font size =2>  The answer is that comprehensive health and education
data on all the children who participate in PSWIM is contained
in records at the Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic at
the University of Pittsburgh.  Under the professional services
agreement between the University and Gateway School District,
PSWIM was implemented by an individual with a Masters degree in
education who was supervised by an individual with a Ph.D. _ not
an M.D. _ at Western Psychiatric Institute.  The individual with
the Masters degree interviewed the children in order to gather
the data.</FONT>
<P>
  Alarmed parents from PSWIM area elementary schools
protested the program, its taxpayer funding, and the use of undisclosed
private grant money.  Concerned parents met with baffled legislators
and recalcitrant state education officials, and made appearances
on local media.  They demanded that the program be ended.  It
was terminated on November 21, 1995.<BR>
</FONT>

<h3>Education Policy: <br>
Surrogate for Health Care</h3>

  Though it failed to pass health care reform in
1993, Congress in 1994 passed three major pieces of education
reform legislation sought by the Clinton Administration:</font> <p> 
<B>Goals 2000:</b><p>

<ol>
<li>Educate America Act;<p> 
<li> School-to-Work Opportunities Act;<p>
<li> The Improving America's Schools Act of 1994, which reauthorized
the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA).<p>
</ol></font>
<P>
  The way the Clinton Administration has implemented
these laws reveals that its health reform agenda did not fail
_ it only failed to pass the Congress.  Education reform has become
a road to health reform.  State agencies and private foundations
are the Administration's willing accomplices in skirting the legislative
process to change health policy.</FONT>
<P>
  Thirteen states now participate in the U.S. Department
of Education's Integrated Services Project, &quot;Creating Schools
That Work for Everyone&quot; (CSTWE).  CSTWE was created by the
Department of Education in 1994.  It aims to integrate within
the public school system many health and human services provided
by government.  This includes services from Medicaid programs,
Aid to Families with Dependent Children, Maternal and Child Health
block grants, and services created by new monies available to
school systems under the three new education acts: Goals 2000,
the School-to-Work law, and the reauthorization of ESEA.  The
thirteen states currently participating in CSTWE are California,
Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi,
New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Texas.</FONT>
<P>
  CSTWE project consultants have been hired by the
U.S. Department of Education.  They include several Washington,
DC-based 501(c)(3) organizations:  The Institute for Health Services
Management, the National Alliance for Restructuring Education
(NARE), the New American Schools Development Corporation (NASDC),
and the National School Health Education Coalition.  NARE and
NASDC are also working with the states of Arkansas, Kentucky,
New York, Vermont, and Washington, city governments in Rochester
(NY), White Plains (NY), and San Diego, and the Farrell Area School
District of Pittsburgh.  NARE claims that its state and city work
accounts for twelve percent of the nation's schoolchildren.  These
consultants are now embroiled in the New York State Attorney General's
investigation of the National Center for Education and the Economy
and its ties to prominent political figures, including Hillary
Clinton, North Carolina Governor James Hunt, former New York Governor
Mario Cuomo, and health care czar Ira Magaziner.  In part, the
investigation concerns payments made to Mrs. Clinton by the Rochester-based
Center.</FONT>
<P>
<hr>
<a name="Brave"></a>
<h3>Kentucky's Brave New World</h3>

  While it is too early to say exactly what CSTWE
will accomplish, information uncovered through open records requests
in Kentucky give some indication of what its proponents seek.</FONT>
<P>
  For instance, Wade Mountz, Chairman of the Kentucky
Commission on Families and Children (set up by Governor Brereton
Jones to help implement the controversial Kentucky Education Reform
Act), has defined his Commission's goal as the &quot;provision
of a wide range of education, health, mental health, and social
services that are delivered in a coordinated and comprehensive
way to families and their children.&quot;  The Commission has
focussed its work on school districts in Louisville and Owensboro.
In seeking a grant from the Annie E. Casey Foundation, one which
required a matching grant of taxpayer dollars, Mountz wrote a
March 30, 1995 grant application to Casey's Associate Director
Anthony Cippollone.  After discussing the need to coordinate health
and human services in the school system, Mountz explained why
Kentucky was the right state for an investment of Casey Foundation
money:</FONT>
<P>
  &quot;We will have a change in administration in
December 1995.  The Commissions' [sic] job is to produce selected
local communities whose plans are so attractive that the new administration
and the legislature will be compelled to cooperate with the approach&quot;
(emphasis added).</FONT>
<P>
  What sorts of plans are envisioned?  The Kentucky
Legislative Research Commission in 1992 hired a consulting firm,
Leadership Development Associates, to assist the Kentucky Task
Force on Education Reform.  It proposed six alternative models
for local governments and school districts to govern the web of
human service programs envisioned by the Kentucky legislature:
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>

<ol>
<li> Total Educational Governance System for Lifetime Learning
<P>
<li> Reconstituting Local Government for Education and Well-Being;
<P>
<li>Educational Development Territories;
<P>
<li> Large Regional Operating Districts;
<P>
<li> Fine-Tuning the Present System; and
<P>
<li> The Unitary District Plan.<br>
</font>
<p>
<br>
</ol>
  The consultants, in the syntax expected of their
sort, explained that Model One's lifetime learning approach &quot;is
a much larger expectation for each citizen.&quot;  It suggested:
&quot;a reconsideration of the compulsory education requirements
pushing taxpayer responsibility both downward and upward through
the age ranges.  Obviously lifetime learning has tremendous implications
for educational finance moving away from traditional concepts
of funding toward new ideas such as individual entitlements to
be expended throughout the lifetime.  Each citizen would have
a lifetime learning account to draw on as needed.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
  Model Two, &quot;Reconstituting Government for
Education and Well-Being,&quot; strikes a tone reminiscent of
Brave New World:  The consultants imagine local-level &quot;Chancellors
of Well-Being&quot; who would govern as elected officials.  Leadership
Development Associates explained, &quot;Well-being does not have
the same political connotation as welfare often does.&quot;  The
Chancellors would be charged with protecting and enhancing community
well-being.  As the consultants explained:</FONT>
<P>
  &quot;Although the nation's commitment to general
well-being is anchored in the Constitution, we have treated it
casually, almost with indifference.  We have created units of
local government, such as school districts, and charged them with
part of the responsibility for well-being, but not the whole of
it.  Schooling may well be the flagship of a flotilla of approaches
to well-being but it is not the all of it.  Schooling must be
joined more fundamentally by other contributors of well-being
....&quot;</FONT>
<P>
  The proposal recommends that the Kentucky General
Assembly appoint a permanent &quot;Joint Well-Being Oversight
Committee,&quot; and replace the existing State Board of Elementary
and Secondary Education with a new fifteen member &quot;State
Board of Well-Being.&quot;  The State Board of Well-Being would
be led by the &quot;State Chancellor of Well-Being,&quot; which
runs the &quot;Division of Well-Being Services&quot; _ &quot;a
range of well-being oriented programs and services, including
many of those that traditionally have been offered through the
department of education.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<hr>
<a name="Medicaid"></a>
<h3>The Medicaid Program in Pennsylvania:  Out of Control</h3>

  Officials in the Clinton Administration's Department
of Health and Human Services, including Heath Care Financing Adminstration
chief Bruce C. Vladeck (a former Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation
trustee and former vice president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation),
have indicated plans to expand Medicaid eligibility to 40 million
Americans.  By granting &quot;waivers&quot; from Medicaid's eligibility
restrictions, the Administration has nearly achieved that goal.
More than half the states currently operate their programs under
such waivers, which expand the definitions of the word &quot;provider.&quot;
Even school districts can now be considered &quot;Medicaid providers&quot;
and they can bill state and federal Medicaid authorities to be
reimbursed for services they provide.  </FONT>
<P>
  School-based health service programs take advantage
of Medicaid by drawing on its &quot;Early Intervention Services&quot;
program which offers a benefit known as &quot;Early Periodic Screening,
Diagnosis, and Treatment&quot; (EPSDT).  EPSDT provides vision,
hearing, and dental testing.  It also provides &quot;other necessary
health care, diagnostic services, treatment, and other measures
. . . to correct or ameliorate defects and physical and mental
illnesses and conditions discovered by the screening services
. . . whether or not such services are covered under the state
plan.&quot;  The 1989 Budget Reconciliation Act required the states
to make the EPSDT benefit available to all eligible Medicaid recipients
age 21 and under, even where a state's Medicaid plan does not
provide state funding for reimbursement.  In such cases, the federal
government must cover EPSDT payments.  </FONT>
<P>
  The law further provides that the state must take
&quot;effective&quot; steps to inform all those eligible for EPSDT
of its availability.  Moreover, a D.C. federal court has held
that the statute is sufficiently specific to create &quot;an enforceable
right of action&quot; under the 1964 Civil Rights Act.  </FONT>
<P>
  EPSDT is out of control.  In Pennsylvania, the
legislators did not know how it was affecting school decisionmaking
until they began to hear from parents.  That state's Goals 2000
plan specifically identifies school-based clinics as essential
to achieve its first Goal, &quot;Readiness for School.&quot; 
And an October 5, 1994 memorandum from the Pennsylvania Commissioner
for Elementary and Secondary Education, Joseph F. Bard, to Pennsylvania
School Administrators and Intermediate Unit Executive Directors,
describes how school officials will achieve the goal:  &quot;The
Department has initiated...a program which will allow [school
districts, intermediate units, and approved private schools]...to
obtain federal reimbursement for administrative costs incurred
in providing health related services to medical assistance eligible
students.</FONT>
<P>
  &quot;The use of these funds to supplement the
district's health program will not only provide additional need
health services to the district's student population, but will
increase the district's expenditures for health care services
and thus increase further drawdown of administrative funds under
Title XIX.&quot; </FONT>
<P>
  Pennsylvania's Department of Public Welfare has
applied to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to
amend the state's Medicaid plan to expand Early Intervention Services
so that schools can request reimbursement beyond the minimum vision,
hearing, and dental tests.  In a June 29, 1995 letter to HHS,
Deputy Secretary Nancy R. Thaler created a virtual &quot;wish
list&quot; of ten program services she would like to offer: social
work, audiology, nursing services, occupational therapy, physical
therapy, psychological services, speech pathology, initial &quot;early
intervention&quot; screening, special instruction, and service
coordination.  Under this proposal, school districts could bill
Medicaid for up to 20 units of service activity per year at $20.00
per unit for each program service it offered.  In other words,
Medicaid might be required to reimburse every school district
up to $4,000 annually per child eligible for the full list of
services.  </FONT>
<P>
  Currently six school districts _ Farrell, Towanda,
Allentown, Philadelphia, Lancaster, and Central Fulton _ operate
school-based health clinics under a Medicaid waiver.  Pennsylvania
still awaits approval of its wish list, but these districts currently
provide the following EPSDT services:  mental health/counseling,
health education, physical examinations/screening, anticipatory
health guidance, referral/tracking of health problems, and dental
services.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>

<a name="Robert Wood"></a>
<h3>Robert Wood Johnson Foundation: &quot;Leveraging&quot;
Government Funding</h3>

  The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) began
its Mental Health Services for Youth Program in 1989, the same
year Congress authorized federal payment for EPSDT services. 
RWJF grants from this program to state agencies in Pennsylvania
and Kentucky are responsible for creating the procedures that
enable school districts to apply for and receive federal Medicaid
reimbursement for mental health services.</FONT>
<P>
  In 1989, the Johnson Foundation reached the one
billion dollar mark in grants distributed, a goal that took seventeen
years to achieve.  In 1995, just six years later, the Princeton,
New Jersey-based philanthropy awarded its two billionth grant
dollar. The Foundation has said, &quot;The work accomplished,
more than the money awarded, is the true measure of RWJF's achievements.&quot;
That claim bears examination.  The Foundation proudly extolls
the practice of &quot;leveraging public funds.&quot;  Not content
to wait for public agencies to pick up the costs of programs it
has started, the Foundation often requires co-funding committments
from government before it initiates new programs.   </FONT>
<P>
  For instance, RWJF awarded the state of Kentucky
a $100,000 planning grant from the Mental Health Services for
Youth Program.  Kentucky subsequently received Phase I and Phase
II Implementation grants of more than $2,400,000.  The Foundation
has stated, &quot;The major objective . . . is to improve mental
health services for seriously mentally ill children and youth
by developing comprehensive services systems under the aegis of
multi-agency, state-community partnerships that can make major
changes in financing, organization, and delivery of services.&quot;
 </FONT>
<P>
  Clearly, affecting state government policy is central
to RWJF's grantmaking.  The Foundation has indicated that it will
give priority to projects that demonstrate &quot;evidence of collaboration
of multiple agencies at both the state and community levels, including
agreements with institutional care providers to assure appropriate
movement among levels of care,&quot; and &quot;a high likelihood
that the project will continue following the conclusion of Foundation
support and that lasting changes will be made in the state's mental
health services delivery and financing systems.&quot; </FONT>
<P>
  Foundation documents are even more specific.  For
Kentucky, they reveal that &quot;every grant dollar is expected
to leverage five dollars in public monies.&quot;  By carefully
using its grant dollars to promote interagency agreements on mental
health for youth, RWJF is well on its way to achieving comprehensive
health reform in this area in Kentucky.</FONT>
<P>
  How does RWJF secure the cooperation of state officials?
Kentucky's participation was secured after North Carolina Governor
James Hunt, chairman of RWJF's national advisory board for its
Mental Health Services for Youth program, wrote Kentucky's then-Governor
Wallace Wilkinson and invited him to apply for a Foundation grant.
A grateful Wilkinson responded, &quot;The goals of the Robert
Wood Johnson Foundation Initiative are very much within the mission
of the CYSB [Kentucky Children's and Youth Services Bureau].&quot;
 </FONT>
<P>
  The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation has used the
power of its private money to rearrange one state's public finances.
It has not been shy about what it expects from Kentucky state
lawmakers.  In Kentucky's proposal for grant funds _ which funds
it received _ the state Secretary for the Cabinet for Human Resources
promised:  &quot;We will be seeking major legislation that sets
in statute for the whole state the system of care for children
and youth with severe emotional problems.  Legitimating this effort
in statute will assure that changing administrations and their
shifting priorities will not hinder the system of care effort.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
  In 1990, the Kentucky Legislature passed a bare-bones
statute that was intended to apply to 54 identified children who
had severe mental health problems.  Yet RWJF grants of more than
$2.4 million plus state and federal funding in excess of $10 million
have had their effect.  Because almost any child can be examined
under the EPSDT benefit for &quot;mental health&quot; problems
in Kentucky, local school districts and state agencies can now
tap into both federal and state Medicaid funds.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<hr>
<a name="Final"></a>
<h3>Final Considerations</h3>
<P>
  It is time for Congress and state legislatures
to re-examine how children have become pawns in political struggles
over power and money.  They must also exercise rigorous legislative
oversight of state applications for federal Medicaid &quot;waivers.&quot;
Lawmakers need to examine whether it is appropriate for private
foundations to distribute grants to government agencies.  And
Congress should consider enlarging the federal Anti-Deficiency
Act, which prohibits the use of private monies to create and pay
for new staff positions at public agencies _ thereby creating
a deficiency since the taxpayers are eventually expected to foot
the bill.  Finally, a vigilant citizenry and press need to apply
more scrutiny to foundations, demanding greater accountability
than currently exists.<BR>

Rediscovering Heroes, Remembering Dreams<p></h2>
<b><I>A Challenge to Change Lives</I></b><BR>
<p>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>By Marvin Olasky</FONT></B>
<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;My goal today is to help each of you think more clearly
about the welfare problem so that you become an agent of change.
Our emphasis should be on change that moves people out of poverty.
We should not be agents of spare change, the distribution of which
merely enables people to stay in poverty. Many citizens today
are agents of spare change.  They hand out quarters or dollars
at street corners with good intentions and support more federal
welfare spending.  Those intentions are often reflected in church
bulletin announcements about the homeless.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are a few of those announcements that have been
brought to my attention: First: &quot;Thursday night... Dinner
for the homeless.  Meditation to follow.&quot; Here's another:
&quot;At the evening service tonight, the sermon topic will be
'Seeing Hell close-up...Come early to meet homeless visitors.&quot;
One more: &quot;Don't let homelessness kill you...let the church
help.&quot; 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;These are honest mistakes, but they show why we must
go beyond sentimentality and learn how to fight poverty the right
way, the biblical way, the way that was practiced in America until
recent decades.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A large part of our current problem arises from the
twisting of Scripture.  If a supporter of the contemporary welfare
state were to rewrite the parable of the prodigal son, he might
write something like this: &quot;One young man set off for a distant
country and there squandered his wealth in wild living.  After
he had spent everything, he was in need and took a job feeding
pigs. The job was miserable, and the man visualized an alternative:
'I will go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned.'
He was about to return  home, but an official from  Beds for
the Homeless saw him and convinced him to spend the night.  The
shelter offered free food, housing, clothing, and medicine, and
did not require any work in return.  The prodigal son stayed on
and became used to panhandling in the morning, drinking fortified
wine and smoking some joints in the afternoon, and watching movies
at the shelter in the evening.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Meanwhile, the father sat on his porch in the
late afternoon, hoping to see the prodigal son trudging home.
Day after day the father yearned for the opportunity to hug him
and prepare a feast, but the son never came.&quot; 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That's the tale of the prodigal panhandler, and I
could give you other brand new revised version stories. One of
my favorites is, &quot;Jesus Food Stamps the 5000.&quot;  The
Bible is where we learn how to provide effective compassion for
prodigals.  That God created each of us in His own image, and
that He provided for us a way to be delivered from our inclination
to deface his image, underlies everything I say here.<BR>

<P>
<H3>Forgotten Heroes</H3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are the two propositions I would like to put
before you:  First, the reason why government welfare programs
must be transformed is not that they are too expensive.  The real
problem is that they are too stingy about doing what is truly
important: treating people as human beings made in God's image,
not as animals to be fed, caged, and occasionally petted.  Second,
private programs can do a better job if they  are challenging,
personal, and spiritual-most often, when they are religiously
based.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of you have gained experience working with the
poor and I want to hear what you have learned. But I'm speaking
to you after having spent a year in the bowels of the Library
of Congress searching through old records.  I'm here today to
testify to the work of many people forgotten by the standard history
books-men like Charles Brace.  Over a 40-year period Brace built
lodging houses in New York City that provided shelter to several
hundred thousand abandoned children.   He placed 91,000 of them
in adoptive homes.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Women like Helen Mercy Woods.  From 1881 to 1903 she
ran a shelter in Chicago for pregnant and unmarried women.  Month
after month she gave personal attention to each newcomer and rejoiced
as their babies were born. She helped some of her charges to get
married, others to place their children for adoption, others to
get jobs.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm here to testify about now-forgotten heroes like
Annie Richardson Kennedy.  She ran a home for unwed moms in New
York City between 1900 and 1920.  Her goal was to first bring
the girls in touch with their Savior, and then build character.
She provided love and opportunity for thousands, and then disappeared
into the fog of history. When I visited the site of her shelter
several years ago, it was occupied by the consulate of Yemen.
The guard didn't understand much English, and I was not making
his day when I asked him if anyone knew what had happened to a
home for mothers and babies that was there 70 years before. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My wife doesn't mind when I fall in love with women
like Helen Mercy Woods and Annie Richardson Kennedy, because they've
all been dead for a long time. The textbooks are silent, but I'm
here to testify about the contributions they made.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You might think that the work of an historian is boring,
but it's exciting detective work to blow dust off old reports
in the Library of Congress and learn about people who changed
so many lives for the better.  It may be an acquired taste to
sit in the Chicago Historical Society and read the diaries of
self-sacrificing people hour after hour, until the librarian there
turns off the lights and kicks you out, but it's exciting to uncover
what secular liberal historians ignore. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The big story that they missed is this:  During the
19th century, before the federal government ever got involved,
a war on poverty much more successful than our own was waged
by tens of thousands of local, private charitable agencies and
religious groups around the country. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It was successful in this way: poverty fighters a
century ago did not abolish poverty, but they witnessed movement
out of poverty by millions of people. Successful in this way:
There were springs of fresh water flowing among the poor, not
just blocks of ice sitting in a perpetual winter of multigenerational
welfare dependency.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Successful also in this way: The optimism prevalent
then contrasts sharply with the demoralization among the poor
and the cynicism among the better-off that is so common now. I'm
here to testify that there was a great cloud of witnesses to effective
poverty-fighting, and that they succeeded in large ways by knowing
and doing small but vital things. They knew that the literal meaning
of compassion is not just writing a check, but having personal
involvement with the needy, suffering with them, not just giving
money to them. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They knew that welfare doesn't mean passing a bill,
but helping a person to fare well. They knew that the Constitution
talks about providing for the common defense but promoting the
general welfare-and there's a big difference between renting a
hall for a convention, and manning every booth yourself. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They knew that people should be challenged. When an
able-bodied man came to a homeless shelter, he often was asked
to chop wood for two hours or to whitewash a building.  In that
way he could provide part of his own support and also help those
unable to chop. They knew, and they showed everyone through those
work tests, that even the most run-down person is not just a taker;
he can also be a giver. They knew that everyone is made in God's
image and is capable of helping. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And they knew what to avoid: in fact, they warned
us.  Some of their warnings were amazingly prophetic. Mary Richmond
of the Baltimore Charity Organizing Society said in 1897, &quot;Relief
given without reference to friends and neighbors is accompanied
by moral loss.  Poor neighborhoods are doomed to grow poorer whenever
the natural ties of neighborliness are weakened by well-meant
but unintelligent interference.&quot;  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The New Orleans Charity Organization Society in 1899
wisely noted, &quot;Intelligent giving and intelligent withholding
are alike true charity.&quot; Giving money to a poor person by
itself is morally neutral, because the action can hurt if not
done wisely.   New York charity leader Josephine Lowell said,
&quot;The problem before those who would be charitable, is not
how to deal with a given number of the poor; it is how to help
those who are poor, without adding to their numbers and constantly
increasing the evils they seek to cure.&quot; 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Poverty-fighters a century ago trained volunteers
to leave behind &quot;a conventional attitude toward the poor,
seeing them through the comfortable haze of our own intentions.&quot;
They said, &quot;If drink has made a man poor, money will feed
not him, but his drunkenness.&quot;  They did not use euphemisms.
They said it is  important to &quot;reform those mild, well-meaning,
tenderhearted, sweet-voiced criminals who insist upon indulging
in indiscriminate charity.&quot; They said that government payouts
come &quot;from what is regarded as a practically inexhaustible
source, and people who once receive it are likely to regard it
as a right, as a permanent pension, implying no obligation on
their part.&quot; They were prophetic!<BR>

<P>
<H3>Dream Killers</H3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;They were prophetic, but the historical knowledge
of many Americans today is pathetic.  Let me be blunt:  We don't
know much about history.  We've forgotten America's past successes
in poverty-fighting. The result has been not just the waste of
billions of dollars each year, but the death of  part of the American
dream.   
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time it was considered hardheaded to talk about
dollars and corny to speak about dreams.  The debate in Washington
was always liberals wanting to spend more and conservatives wanting
to spend less, but no one questioning what welfare does to dreams.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;History, though, is made by dreams followed by action.
America was begun by people who resolved to fight for a country
in which both liberty and virtue could flourish.  But now, welfare
kills dreams. It kills the helping dream of many Americans.  
Most of you and millions of other people would like to be generous
when a panhandler asks for spare change.  But if you know that
most homeless recipients will use any available funds for drugs
or alcohol and will put off real change by getting high, you are
likely to end up walking by and avoiding eye contact. A subtle
hardening occurs.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Welfare also kills the dreams of social workers. 
Their common lament is, &quot;All we have time to do is move paper.&quot;
Listen to this sad statement from a social worker who graduated
from college several years ago, lasted on the job for a year,
and then resigned: &quot;I had a calling; it was that simple.
I wanted to help.&quot;  A lot of people are frustrated, worn
down, burnt out. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Welfare also kills the dreams of poor individuals
who gradually become used to dependency.  Some among the poor
are willing to put off immediate gratification and  sacrifice
leisure time in order to remain independent, but they are called
chumps rather than champs. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Welfare kills the dreams of children who grow up without
fathers.  Coach a little league team some time and you'll quickly
see who's in that fix.  Fatherless children alternately cling
and are standoffish in a way that kids with functioning dads do
not. It breaks your heart.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Welfare kills.  Spend some time with AFDC moms or
with homeless men.  You'll see how sad they are.  You'll see the
essential problem, and I'll stress it again:  Governmental welfare
programs should be fought not because they are too expensive,
but because they are inevitably too stingy in what is truly important:
treating people as human beings made in God's image, not as animals.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Should we despair?  No. I'm hear to testify that the
reams of the past can thrive in the future if we recover the
lessons of the past and use them to plan for the future. I am
finding good news as I get around the country now: We are recovering
the lost tools of charitable success.  We are  seeing a new great
cloud of witnesses.  We are living in an era with many heroes
or, I should say, ordinary people who become heroic as they show,
through hard suffering with, that the American dream of compassion
is not dead. <BR>

<P>
<H3>Modern Heroes</H3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish you could come with me and visit Bob Cote in
Denver.  He's a tall, white, ex- boxer who spent a year on the
streets as an alcoholic in the early '80s and then pulled together
a few of his fellow winos and junkies to start a program that
has become known as Step 13.  Bob welcomed me to his four-story
building and showed me how  people from off the streets can, step
by step, come back to life.  They can get jobs of increasing responsibility.
They can get rooms within that building that gradually reflect
greater independence, until a person is ready to go out on his
own.  They can go through a tough, time-intensive process.  Cote
has lived it himself and he's there to help others. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish you could come with me and visit Hannah Hawkins,
who lives  in Anacostia, the poorest part of Washington.  She's
short, black, and retired, and she voluntarily runs an after-school
program which has several dozen children doing their homework
and receiving the love they often don't get at home. Sometimes
they run around like lost sheep, but she knows each of her lambs
by name. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish you could come with me and visit Freddie Garcia
in San Antonio.  He's a softhearted but hardheaded Hispanic ex-addict.
He formed Victory Outreach 25 years ago in San Antonio to help
substance abusers.  Groups based on his teaching have now spread
throughout Texas and California and even to Peru.  I've sat in
his home and watched the way he patiently counsels and teaches
those whom everyone else has abandoned. I've been blessed to see
and come to know some of these people, and I'm here to testify
that they have succeeded and others can too.   The heroes of past
and present have a common understanding that could be summarized
as CPS.<BR>

<P>
<H3>Challenging, Personal, and Spiritual</H3>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What's CPS? Compassion needs to be Challenging, Personal,
and Spiritual.  I hope it will become as well known as CPR.  
CPR can bring back to life a dying person; CPS can bring back
to life a dying American dream. &nbsp;&nbsp;People successfully
practiced CPS a century ago, and they are successfully doing it
right now.  There is compassion that is challenging, personal,
and spiritual at Clean and Sober Streets in Washington.  Leaders
there get people off drugs and alcohol by caring for them but
also imposing tough rules-one strike you're out-and sticking to
them. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There is compassion that is challenging, personal,
and spiritual at Teen Challenge sites in Texas and around the
country, where alcoholism is treated as a symptom, not the fundamental
problem.  Leaders there know that the basic problem is that people
have holes in their souls, holes that only God can fill.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There is compassion that is challenging, personal,
and spiritual at the Right Alternative center in Milwaukee. People
sometimes say that AFDC mothers will be stuck on the government
rolls for a life time, but at Right Alternative AFDC moms pledge
not to swear, not to shack up, not to do drugs.  Leaders there
challenge them to stick to their pledges, and when they do their
lives change:  They do get married.  They do get jobs. What works?
Challenging help... Personal help... Spiritual help. It worked
in the past.  It works now.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence of changed lives is accumulating. I'm
not saying it's easy.  I've personally seen successes over the
years. I've seen lives of pregnant unmarried women turned around.
I've seen abandoned children happily adopted.  I've also seen
failures:  Recently I was working with a homeless ex-con, and
I thought he was making good progress, but he slipped back into
irresponsibility.  He's currently in a jail facility near Fort
Worth, but he'll have another chance in several months.<BR>

<P>
<H3>Answering Five Criticisms</H3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't want anyone to go into poverty-fighting without
understanding the difficulties.  In fact, let me give you my responses
to five  criticisms of the generally optimistic message I'm offering
tonight. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;First-that history didn't happen.  Some say that when
I talk about the outpouring of charities in the past, I'm romanticizing.
That's easy to refute: It did happen. Read my footnotes.  The
times I describe were not the good old days.  They were bad in
many ways, but people refused to sit back and take it easy.  They
fought,  and they won. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the history happened but it is irrelevant
to our more complex society today.  That could be true-but when
you see what our predecessors did, you naturally ask yourself,
why not today?  I could go point by point through the comparison
of then and now and show the parallels.  But I'll just say here:
Overall, they had problems.  We have problems.  They dealt with
theirs.  We whine about ours. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A third criticism comes from members of the religious
left: They say the Bible requires government to transfer to the
poor whatever resources it can grab hold of because Jesus said
that &quot;Whatever you did to the least of these my brethren,
you did it to me.&quot;  I take that verse very seriously.  But
before we blindly use it to justify the welfare state, we need
to ask, who are the least of these in America?  What kind of help
is real help?  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, children threatened with death before birth
by abortion are among the least of these.   Women abandoned by
their husbands, and children who grow up without fathers, also
have it very rough.   But what about able-bodied homeless men?
Does irresponsibility qualify a person for the ranks of the least
of these?  And how does enabling mothers and fathers to desert
each other help children?  How does the fostering of fatalistic
attitudes help children?
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A fourth criticism goes like this:  Today,  money
to help the poor won't be forthcoming unless people are taxed
and Washington spends.  But we need to keep two thoughts in mind.
First, much welfare money today is wasted and worse than wasted,
since it actually does harm.   Second, we do need  a system of
tax credits by which taxpayers could send less to the government
and more to private and church charitable organizations that provide
assistance to the poor.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the place to get into a full-scale discussion
of tax credits, but the idea fits with the distinction I made
earlier between providing and promoting.  We're in our current
mess because the government has attempted to provide welfare rather
than promote civic action.  Tax credits such as those proposed
by  Senator Dan Coats (R-Indiana) and others would promote community-based
poverty-fighting charities by allowing taxpayers to send money
directly to those organizations and take the money off their taxes.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For each dollar taxpayers chose to allocate in this
way, their tax burden would be reduced by that amount-$500 or
$1000 in some plans, more in others.  The  amount of money allocated
to government welfare programs would also decrease, dollar for
dollar, as the private, taxpayer-chosen programs grew.  Tax credits
are a great mechanism for taking money off the top, from the governmental
superstructure, and sticking it back on the bottom, in private
and religious charities, where it can do the most good. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, I don't want to fall into the trap of thinking
that a particular piece of legislation is the solution. Tax credits
will work, but they are still just a mechanism, and they will
rust like other mechanisms unless hearts keep them lubricated.
 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That brings me to the fifth criticism of my testimony
to you: Some pundits say that most Americans just won't help others
anymore.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, people, ordinary people, are helping others
all over the country: Why can't more? I cannot prove that they
will. As long as government welfare remains, it leads potential
helpers to sit back, since they are paying for someone else to
do it.  We face a Catch-22: We won't have the alternatives until
we need them, but we won't get them as long as government programs
remain in place.  How do we break out of the trap?<BR>

<P>
<H3>Dreams Remembered</H3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people say that there's a public policy answer
here-and tax credits are a partial answer.  But the more time
I spend in Washington, the more I'm reminded of  the recommendation
from a junior high school science class: &quot;For a nosebleed,
put the nose much lower than the body until the heart stops.&quot;

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way to break through now is to go above and
beyond the call of economic logic-to remember dreams, and to be
moved by God to volunteer to bring them to life.  We need to knock
out the welfare establishment, but we will only be able to do
that if people around the country are able to demonstrate that
the alternatives do work.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to take large leaps, but change starts with
a single step-a single step that each person in this room, whether
you're a college student or whether you've been out in the community
for decades, can take, starting now. Taking that first step will
require an act of will and courage and faith on the part of each
individual.  For many of you with good but hectic jobs, it is
easier to send a check than to suffer with others-but it's that
personal involvement which is desperately needed. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not very comfortable talking about myself, but
my colleagues have told me that I need to tell people that I've
taken some steps before I ask them to take one themselves. &nbsp;&nbsp;I'll
quickly mention a few of the learning opportunities that God has
put in front of me. At various times my wife and I have been able
to give a room in our home to needy individuals, including a homeless
woman and a pregnant teenager. We've been able to tutor and to
coach kids in baseball, and to mentor many younger men and women.
We've been blessed with three children born to us, and we've been
able to adopt a fourth.  I recommend both methods of family expansion.
We should be doing more.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's a confession: I'm not a particularly hospitable
individual.  I'd rather spend time in libraries than on the streets.
And as I've been traveling so much this past year, I've fallen
into the trap that I tell others to avoid:  Maybe helping in little
ways here and there, but not following through consistently enough
with one poor individual. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But my failings lead me to think that if once in a
while, I can do something that's a little decent, why can't people
of much finer qualities do the same, or even more? I know very
well, from personal experience,  that many things, including some
good intentions, get in the way of personal involvement with others.
But I'll ask each of you the same question I ask myself:  Can't
we do something?  And why can't we do more? 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you try to picture in your mind's eye one poor
person whom you have directly helped during the past year, do
you see anyone? If you do, good-and can you do more?  If you can't
picture anyone, here's the hard question: Will you take a first
step? Will you tutor a child for one hour a week? Will you be
a big brother, a big sister, or a little league coach? Will you
volunteer at an organization in this metropolitan area that offers
true compassion-challenging, personal, and spiritual? Will you
provide biblical counsel to a young, unmarried pregnant woman?
If you are able to do this, will you give her a room in your
home? If you're able to, will you adopt a child? 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes the first step is hard.  But we are surrounded
by hundreds of thousands of people now, and millions over the
past two centuries, who have taken first steps, and many more.
Like you, I have moments of pessimism, but overall I am optimistic:
I am seeing a growing understanding around this country of what
effective compassion is.  First comes thought, then action: I
am hopeful that we will soon see an enormous outpouring of effective
voluntarism. It's as if we have been in a desert, and suddenly
the Red Sea is parted before us and we're beginning to walk through.
I've often wondered how astounded the Israelites must have been
as they walked through.  They must have been amazed-but there
were probably a few who kept muttering, &quot;It's all an optical
illusion.&quot; We're beginning to cross the Red Sea now.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I spent time last year in south central Los Angeles
and on the upper east side of Manhattan.  I talked with people
over lunches in dingy cafeterias and at a few fancy dinners. 
I can say, based on that experience,  that across America people
of many faiths, income levels, and races, are refusing to give
up on the dream of effective compassion. More people are capturing
the understanding  that the major flaw of the modern welfare state
is not that it is extravagant, but that it is too stingy.  It
gives the needy bread and tells them to be content with that alone.
More people are recapturing the optimism that a look at history
can provide.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;More people are saying, in the words of the Bible
that are inscribed on the famous bell in Philadelphia, &quot;Proclaim
liberty throughout  the land, and to all the inhabitants thereof.&quot;
Let's not settle for the new slavery of welfare.  Let's be agents
of change who proclaim liberty to all the inhabitants this nation.
With God's grace and your help, we can.<BR>

American Center in Paris: </FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Times New Roman">The Boh<B>e</B>n and 
Mellon Foundations and the Death of a Cultural Institution.</h2>

	On February 12th, 1996, the doors at the American Center at 51, rue de Bercy in the 12th arrondissement 
of Paris closed for the last time.  Eleven days had passed since the death of Gene Kelly, whose MGM film
 <I>An American in Paris</I> had inspired architect Frank Gehry in his design of the Center's new headquarters.
  A white limestone monument designed to resemble a dancer amid the rooftops of the French capital, the
 198,000 square foot structure was less than two years old.  Now it was closing.  The headline in<I> Le
 Monde</I> observed simply:  &quot;A  VENDRE&quot;  (for sale).  The American cultural institution, founded
 in 1931, was &quot;Trop grand, trop cher, trop tard&quot; (too big, too expensive, too late).<p>

	The American Center had suspended most of its operations in 1987, when the original building at 261
 Boulevard Raspail was sold for some $42 million dollars. Gehry's new structure had opened only in June 1994.
  It contained a 400-seat theatre, a 100-seat screening room, a dance studio, art galleries, classrooms and twenty-six 
apartments intended for visiting artists and intellectuals.  At a cost of between $27 and $42 million
 (the figure is disputed), the instant landmark figured to transform an otherwise drab neighborhood of wine
 warehouses east of the city center.<p>  	

	What had happened?  There was a grain of truth to the <I>Le Monde</I> description.  Parisians,
 with the naivete of the sophisticated, expected such follies of Americans.  But to insiders who were familiar
 with the American Center and its history, the closure reveals something more.  The story of how officials from
 two American philanthropic foundations appeared as &quot;White Knights&quot; to rescue a struggling
 cultural institution but stayed to liquidate its assets testifies to the perils of permitting funders to exert direct
 control over organizations.  It also reveals the arrogance of America's avant-garde arts establishment 
during a period of post-Cold War re-evaluation of the U.S. role in Europe.  Finally, it exposes the greed of
 foundation officials who put their private agendas ahead of a nonprofit organization's welfare.
  Ironically, the Bohen and Mellon foundation executives came to Paris not to praise the American Center,
 but to bury it.<P>

<H3>THE YANKS ARE COMING</H3>
	The closure and sale of the American Center brought to a distressing end a seven-year run of dreams gone
 awry.  In February, 1987 the original American Center headquarters closed.  Situated in Montparnasse, the Left
 Bank neighborhood which Hemingway and Fitzgerald had made their haunt, it had been a focal point for French
 and American artists and students still searching for the ghosts of the &quot;Lost Generation.&quot;  The Center
 site had been Chateaubriand's garden, and it still sheltered the oldest tree in Paris.<p>

	&quot;The American Students and Artists Center&quot; was founded in 1931 by Frederick Warren Beekman,
 the Dean of the American (Episcopal) Cathedral in Paris (and father-in-law of Presidential candidate Malcolm S. (Steve)
 Forbes, Jr., whose wife Sabina was raised in Paris). The Beekman family owned New York's Social Register (later sold
 to Malcolm S. Forbes) and catered to a striving social elite of expatriate Americans.  Beekman modelled his Center on
 the YMCA, for he intended it to offer an alcohol-free environment protecting Prohibition-era Americans from the
 temptation of cafes while encouraging them to &quot;come to France to partake of its unparalleled culture.&quot;<p> 

	He was immediately successful.  Americans in France formed a 150-member fundraising committee which
 raised $175,000 in Paris and an additional $200,000 in the United States.  Architect Welles Bosworth, brought to
 France by the Rockefeller family to help remodel Versailles, was commissioned to contruct the Center's headquarters,
 a  neo-classical palazzo which contained a swimming pool, gym, bowling alley, billiard room, auditorium, library,
 canteen, enclosed garden, and art studios.  The building was completed in 1934.<p>
<hr>
<a name="Paris"></a>
<H3>AN AMERICAN IN PARIS</H3>
	In the thirties and early forties, the Center was eminently respectable.  The American expatriate community
 enjoyed its events, and it was well-known for its teas, served to patrons in club chairs.  The expatriate American 
community which built the Center was also known for its other good works. It was instrumental in establishing
 an American Hospital, an American Church, and an American Library -- all independent and privately funded -- 
&quot;just as they would be in Minneapolis or Kansas City,&quot; in the words of Henry Pillsbury, heir to the
 Minnesota flour fortune and former executive director of the Center.<p>
	
	During World War II the building was commandeered by the Nazis.  But at war's end Beekman regained the
 building from the French Army and, after retiring as Dean of the Cathedral, became the Center's first executive
 director.  Once independent of the Cathedral, the Center became a venue for American artists in the 1950's and
 60s, sponsoring concerts, theatrical peformances, and exhibitions. In post-war Europe nonconformity became the
 Center's watchword as &quot;beatniks&quot; and avant-garde artists began to change what journalist Claire
 Downey, a reporter for <I>Paris City</I>, called its &quot;Ivy-League, clubby atmosphere.&quot;<p>  

	The Center became known for its bohemian charm and chance <I>rendevous</I> of French and American
 students.  An English language program was instituted, and poetry readings, art and music classes were offered.
  Open all night -- until 7 a.m. -- the Center attracted jazz musicians who would stop by after the French clubs shut
 their doors.  In time, eighty percent of the Center's expenses were paid for by tuition for classes and ticket sales.
 Some 5,000 art students and 3,000 English students enrolled in Center programs annually.  Downey refers to it as
 &quot;a commercial enterprise which supported an artistic agenda.&quot;  This was in keeping with American
 traditions of art and commerce.<p>

	But the Center was changing.  After the rebellious days of the 1968 student uprising, hippies, drugs, and
 theft came to the American Center -- as they did to America itself.  &quot;It was like a small Berkeley,
&quot; observed one-time student Jimmy Shuman.  In 1969 Pillsbury took over as executive director.  In what
 Shuman called &quot;a revolution from the inside,&quot; Pillsbury adopted a new, laid-back approach to
 managing the Center. &quot;He was like a camp counselor,&quot; said one longtime American Paris resident.<p>

	Pillsbury's expatriate American bohemianism was in many ways quite traditional and fundamentally non-political.
  Among some Parisian leftists there were rumors that the Center was involved with the CIA.  In fact, the Minneapolis
 native was simply an eclectic individualist devoted to the arts.  He had once been a theatre director and occasionally 
staged his own productions at the Center. <p> 

	Like his Center, Pillsbury was well-liked by many quite conservative Americans in Paris.  Jean Gerard, President
 Reagan's appointee as U.S. ambassador to UNESCO called him a &quot;fine fellow.&quot;  A &quot;gentleman
&quot; is how he is described by Judith Bingham, a prominent figure among Republicans residing abroad. 
 Pillsbury's devotion to the Center was also quite tangible.  He donated at least $1 million from his personal fortune
 to the Center, making up an annual budget deficit not covered by other revenues.<p>

	The governing board of the Center, made up of primarily expatriate Americans from the listings of Beekman's
 Social Register, had confidence in Pillsbury, who had a relatively free hand as executive director.  &quot;The old
 American Center was deeply loved by both Americans living in Paris and the French,&quot; noted Downey. &quot;It
 was a miracle,&quot; said Michel Reilhac, who later came to work for the Center as its highest-ranking French 
employee, &quot;living on a shoestring it had managed to be a major focus of cultural life in Paris without any means,
 compared to richer French insitutions, which had less cultural influence.&quot;<p>

	In 1977, Pillsbury was joined by Judith Pisar, who had moved to Paris with her husband, Auschwitz survivor
 Samuel Pisar, an international lawyer specializing in East-West trade who represented British publisher Robert Maxwell,
 among others.  A New York City fundraiser for the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Pisar soon became chairman of the
 Center's board after garnering increased contributions.<p>

	Pisar's personal connections helped the Center's fundraising and raised its public profile among the French 
and back home in the United States. Together, Pisar and Pillsbury set their sights on expanding the American Center
 as, in Pillsbury's words, &quot;a place where you can see, where you can learn, and where you can do.&quot;<p> 

	In 1979 Pillsbury and Pisar had secured Rockefeller Foundation funding which supported an &quot;artists
-in-residence&quot; program.  Over the next eight years it would sponsor 500 artistic performances, 350 workshops 
and 30 exhibitions.  Merce Cunningham, John Cage, and Philip Glass graced the Center's stage.  Sources in Paris
 say Pisar was quite close to Republican Senator Charles Percy, who, as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
 Committee, worked to better relations between the Center and the USIA and, as father-in-law to Senator John D.
 Rockefeller IV, helped with Center fundraising.<p> 
	
As the decade came to a close, the Center was still a proud and representative American institution in Paris,
 supported by the American establishment and the Franco-American public.<p>	

<hr>
<a name="Singing"></a>
<H3>SINGING IN THE RAIN</H3>
	In 1987, at the height of the Paris real estate boom, Pisar and Pillsbury accepted a fantastic bid of $42 million
 from the Banque Arabe d' Invetissement for the Center's property in Montparnasse.  At that time, the Center's annual
 budget averaged only about $500,000.  The National Endowment for the Arts had given $250,000 to the Center in 1985
 for its endowment fund.  But the enormous pool of new money, Pillsbury and Pisar said, meant that the Center could 
meet ever-rising public demands.  With help from the City of Paris, the Center acquired a huge plot of land in Bercy,
 just across the Seine from the new French library and near the &quot;Palais Omnisport,&quot; a sort of French
 Madison Square Garden.  With $42 million sitting in the Banque National de Paris, Pisar and Pillsbury took a gamble
 and built a monument.<p>
	
	The Center held spectacular fund-raising events in the late 80's and early 90's at such venues as the Theatre
 de le Rond Pont on the Champs Elysees.  They starred the likes of Gene Kelly and Leonard Bernstein, and celebrated
 the elegant fashions of Hubert de Givenchy.  But the eclectic bohemianism of the center was also maintained by
 showcasing avant-garde darlings such as Jean-Louis Barrault and Peter Brook.  During the next decade, Pisar and
 Pillsbury helped raise some $11 million -- in addition to the sale price of the building and accrued interest reaching 
10 percent annually -- including a $5 million dollar matching grant from Minneapolis native and pop art patron  Frederick
 R. Weisman.  Among other old-line donors, the Dillon Foundation and Rockefeller Brothers Fund each gave $100,000.
  Walter Annenberg also made a substantial contribution.  And French companies such as Yves St.Laurent and the 
Banque National de Paris contributed half a million dollars each.  Pisar received a Legion d'Honneur from the French 
government in recognition of her work promoting exchanges of Franco-American culture.<p>

<hr>
<a name="Deux"></a>
<H3>FOLIE A DEUX</H3>
	Unfortunately, the financial windfall for the American Center carried with it some severe problems.  
Freed from the fiscal constraints of the past, Pillsbury and Pisar succumbed to a culture of spending during the
 seven years between buildings.  They executed a series of false starts, made unfortunate staff choices, and relied on
 &quot;consultants&quot; who undermined the Center even as the foundations of its new headquarters were being laid.
<p> 
	
	Michel Reilhac, a French cultural administrator hired by Pillsbury as general manager in 1992, says the Center 
&quot;got trapped in the process of getting rich overnight after having been poor a long time.&quot;  As word spread
 that it had millions in the bank, &quot;a whole group of so-called consultants became attracted to this newly rich
 institution, people who are attracted to making money in this field.&quot;  Reilhac feels that &quot;Pillsbury and
 Pisar didn't know how to say 'No.'&quot;  The result, he argues, was that money began to hemmorhage from the
 Center faster than it could be raised.  It is estimated that some $2 million a year was spent on administration and
 that the projected operating budget for the building was $2 million for programs and $2 million for maintenence.<p>

	To save $5-6 million dollars in construction costs by scaling down the building design, Reilhac flew to
 Los Angeles to meet with the architect, Frank Gehry, whose original design was rejected by zoning officials for the
 City of Paris.  But on returning to Paris, Reilhac discovered that Pisar and Pillsbury had told Gehry to go ahead and
 spend the additional money.<p> 

	Meanwhile, the Center's artistic aspirations were becoming increasingly expensive.  The old American Center
 was a labor of love, but the new operation was paying premiums to its associates.  Pillsbury's friends Martin and
 Mickey Friedman of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis were among the new &quot;consultants.&quot;  They
 had recommended Gehry as architect and were now assigned to direct the artistic program and decorate the building
 on a retainer estimated by sources at between $10,000 and $20,000 per month.<p>

	To be curator for the Center's art exhibits, Pillsbury then hired Adam Weinberg.  He had worked for Friedman
 at the Walker Art Center before moving to New York City's Whitney Museum.Weinberg reportedly objected to the
 taint of Reilhac's attempts to raise money by renting space to commercial clients from a temporary Center classroom 
building constructed near the Gehry construction site.<p>

	Reilhac also says Weinberg began planning an exceptionally expensive opening exhibition called
 &quot;Landscape as Metaphor,&quot; with Friedman as curator.  Presented with a $1.5 million budget, Reilhac
 asked Weinberg to raise the money.  Friedman got some $500,000 from the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Foundation,
 but it was not enough.  In 1992, Pillsbury fired Weinberg, and Friedmansoon left.  Rumored cash settlements 
of $200,000 to Friedman further drained the Center's finances and negative press reactions crimped fundraising.
  &quot;I must say, I have no respect for the Friedmans,&quot; says Reilhac. &quot;They have no idea what
 international culture is about.&quot;<p>

	Soon after the debacle, Pillsbury met Bill Arnett, an Atlanta art collector who manages the career
 of Mississippi's Thornton Dial, an African-American painter and one of the most prominent &quot;Outsider
 Artists&quot; working today.  Pillsbury agreed to an American Center show of Dial's work.  Reilhac describes the
 planned exhibition as &quot;just beautiful work&quot; and Arnett agreed to secure the show's financing at no cost
 to the Center.  Surely the Parisian love affair with African-American culture, from Louis Armstrong and Josephine 
Baker to James Baldwin and Richard Wright, would be rekindled by Dial.<p>

	Whatever their missteps and foolishness, Pillsbury and Pisar had the Center's interests at heart.  It seems
 probable that the American Center could have overcome their <I>folie d'grandeur.</I>  Once the amazing new building
 opened, the Center could have recaptured its role as a vital American presence in France and served as a genuine
 artistic balance to the popular appeal of Euro-Disney. <p>

	The Thornton Dial show was the sort of project that could have led the Center out of the wildneress.  But it
 was not to be. Pillsbury and Pisar lost control of the Center in 1993 after the press stories of its problems reverberated
 through the philanthropic and art communities.  The Center's new leaders cancelled the exhibit of &quot;Outsider
 Art.&quot;  The successors to Pillsbury and Pisar were very much New York art world insiders.<p>
<hr>
<a name="Fou"></a>
<H3>L'AMOUR FOU</H3>
	The final chapter in the collapse of the American Center stars a new cast of characters who assumed center
 stage in 1993:  representatives of the Bohen and Mellon Foundations who took control of the Board of Directors.
  Their role in the destruction of an American cultural institution tells much about the new philanthropy of culture.<p>

	Incredibly, after only eighteen months of operation in its prize-winning building, Frederick Bohen Henry, the
 new Chairman of the American Center's Board of Directors, ordered the Gehry landmark closed and sold.  Henry, the
 president of the Bohen Foundation (assets $6 million), and Rachel Bellow, his partner in the Center's reorganized
 &quot;Office of the Director&quot; and a program officer for the Arts and Humanities at the Andrew G. Mellon 
Foundation (assets $2 billion) preferred to liquidate the American Center's assets.<p>

	This drama took place behind the scenes during 1993 and 1994, as Pillsbury and Pisar were shunted aside
 and a new &quot;special committee&quot; of twenty-five art world superstars shuttled back and forth between 
Paris and the United States prior to the June 1994 opening of the Center.  In Paris, they
 stayed at the fashionable Hotel d'Alembert.  Some reportedly flew first class, others preferred the Concorde. 
 According to sources, neither Henry nor Bellow resided in Paris, preferring to visit for a few days each month.<p>

	While the Center had a New York apartment for &quot;fundraising&quot; purposes, neither of the new leaders
 made a similar commitment to Paris.  This should have been the first sign that neither Henry nor Bellow had the
 interests of the American expatriate community at heart.<p>

	After cancelling the Thornton Dial show, Bellow and Henry cancelled the English classes that Reilhac had
 championed.  They rejected offers from Robert Altman to rent space to produce his film &quot;Pret-A-Porter
&quot; and from Voyager Videodiscs to headquarter its project to digitize the Louvre on CD-ROM.  They even
 turned down a local cafe proprietor who wanted to open a bistro<B>t</B>.  Bettina Zilkha Trink, heiress to a
 Franco-American banking fortune, resigned from the board in disgust.<p>

	Plans for the June, 1994 Center opening continued, and Pillsbury and Pisar agreed to stay on for the sake
 of appearances.  They have never spoken about the final days.  But interviews with their associates make clear 
that by January, 1994, they were mere figureheads and the institution was under the control of the visiting 
Americans.<p>

	Bellow explained her new approach to the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>:  &quot;First we will see how much 
money we can get, and then we'll decide what we are able to do with it.&quot;  One of her first decisions was to 
spend an estimated $500,000 on an opening party.  David Byrne, the former Talking Head, and a gospel group 
provided the music, the decorations were by Andre Puttnam, the liquor flowed, and there was dancing till dawn. <p>

	Among the curious expenses paid by Bellow and Henry was a confidential settlement of a harrassment 
complaint filed by superlawyer Eddie Hayes, current involved in the fight over the Andy Warhol estate and the
 fictionalized protagonist of Tom Wolfe's <I>Bonfire of the Vanities.</I>  Hayes represented an American woman
 hired by the Center to help with fundraising.  How much did her two-month &quot;development&quot; tenure 
cost the Center?  No one is talking, but Hayes did remark, &quot;They were very reasonable.&quot; Coming 
from a plaintiff's lawyer, one can only shudder at the implications.<P>

	Bellow and Henry replaced the no-cost Thornton Dial show with a $250,000 exhibit from Los Angeles'
 Museum of Contemporary Art called &quot;Pure Beauty.&quot;  (Richard Koshalek, the director of L.A. museum,
 was a member of Henry's &quot;special committee&quot;; Bill Arnett was not.)  The show was a flop.  Of &quot;Pure
 Beauty&quot; the <I>Wall Street Journal's</I> Judy Fayard wrote, &quot;Most of it is so hopeless, so lazy, so utterly
 lacking in rigor or vigor or vision, that even the cost of shipping the silly things over seems too much.&quot;<p>


	But the Center's changed tone was noted by the <I>Journal</I> reporter, who quoted Bellow's declaration
 that the Center would now become &quot;a meeting place for an international community of artists and 
performers...&quot; rather than a Franco-American institution.<p>

<hr>
<a name="Vanities"></a>
<H3>BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES</H3>
	In September 1994, the Center hired Marie-Claude Beaud as executive director. She was given a remodeled
 and furnished New York apartment, a travel allowance, and permission to hire her own staff.  Beaud was a French
 cultural bureaucrat, who had managed state-supported museums in Toulon and Grenoble before joining the Fondation
 Cartier, which was, according to <I>Apollo </I>magazine, &quot;better known for its gimmicks and parties than for any
 lasting contribution to modern art.&quot;  Beaud had &quot;never raised a sou&quot; according to one former
 Center employee.  A curious choice for an institution in financial crisis.<p>

	Although Beaud declared in public that she liked America, former Center employees say that in private she 
was &quot;clearly anti-American.&quot;  Soon after her arrival, what had been English and French-language press
 releases were issued only in French.  The policy was not reversed until a prominent American reporter stationed in
 Paris said she would not cover any event without an English-language press release.<p>
	
	Beaud's program decisions parody an NEA annual report:  They include Leon Golub and Nancy Spero's
 left-wing agitprop, &quot;video art&quot; by Nam June Paik and Bill Viola, a Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, and
 presentations by politically correct Nobel laureate Toni Morrison, dancer Bill T. Jones, and Living Theatre relic 
Judith Malina.  Others events included Larry Clark's film on teen sex, &quot;Kids,&quot; art exhibits by European
 artists Phillippe Boardas and Nicholas Bouvier and writers Cees Noteboom and Michel LeBris, and concerts by 
UNUN, with singers &quot;Helda...Thor Eldon, guitarist of the Sugarcubes (Bjork) and Dr. Gunni, an independent
 rock star in Iceland...&quot;  The Center's last cinema event honored the work of Jonas Mekas, whose grainy loops
 of 16mm self-indulgence have a decidedly limited appeal.<p>

	A cynic might conclude that Bellow and Henry must have encouraged such programs to justify their decision
 to sell the building.  Certainly there were alternatives to their selection of <B>Madame Beaud.  </B>Robert Fitzpatrick,
 a Center board member who had headed Euro-Disneyland, the California Institute of the Arts, and the highly 
successful 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Arts Festival expressed interest in the executive director's job.  Pillsbury
 himself had proposed his name.  With contacts in Europe and America and experience in promoting popular and
 high culture, Fitzpatrick could have raised the money and protected the center's mission.  Rebuffed, Fitzpatrick
 became Dean of the Arts at Columbia University.<p>

	Observers close to the scene have revealed to <I>Foundation Watch </I>that Henry and Bellow, who have
 jointly managed the Center's day-to-day affairs since 1994, are personally responsible for sealing its fate.  Depending
 on the sale price of the building, estimates of the potential future endowment range from $10 to $30 million.  Instead 
of raising the money to save what had been an important institution representing American culture to France, the new
 overseers are converting its assets into funds that will be distributed by a grantmaking foundation that will fund art 
from and for &quot;the international community.&quot; <p>

	On January 24, 1996, an American Center press release reported that after the sale of the Gehry landmark
 -- which still awaits a buyer -- and debt repayments including a reported $4 million owed the city of Paris, all remaining
 funds will go into an endowment to be directed by Marie-Claude Beaud, last director of the American Center.  Fred
 Henry will be Chairman of the Board of the newly reorganized fund.  Rachel Bellow announced that she is leaving 
the Mellon Foundation to become a &quot;consultant&quot; to arts organizations.  It was not disclosed whether the
 American Center fund will become her first client. <p>

<hr>
<a name="Deconstructing"></a>
<h3>DECONSTRUCTING THE AMERICAN CENTER</h3>
	The cultural outlook implied in the decisions Henry and Bellow are making derive from the modern-day
 detractors of all things genuinely cultural who currently dominate so much of the art world: the post-modernists
 and deconstructionists who substitute nihilism for aesthetic achievement.  They have little in common with the 
celebration of the buoyant and eclectic American culture usually championed by Pillsbury and Pisar.  Moreover,
 by choosing to redeploy the American Center's financial assets rather than supervise its mission to represent
 American culture, Henry and Bellow are redefining the purposes of philanthrophy. <p>

	How did they manage to takeover the American Center?  In retrospect, there were warnings that should
 not have gone unheeded.  Pillsbury's downfall commenced with his decision to hire Adam Weinberg, late of the
 Walker and Whitney Museums.  It was Weinberg who introduced him to Frederick Bohen Henry.  Henry, a New
 York City attorney and avid art collector, was born in Des Moines, the heir to the Meredith Publishing fortune.
  He remains on the board of the family business, currently valued at some $700 million.  Henry lists his occupation
 as Bohen Foundation president.  (The Bohen board also includes pollster Daniel Yankelovich, co-founder of the
 Public Agenda Foundation.   Bohen gave $125,000 to the Public Agenda Foundation in 1991-92.  See <I>Foundation
 Watch v.I, n.1</I> for more on Public Agenda.)  Most importantly, Henry was a member of the Board of Trustees of 
tNew York's Whitney Museum of American Art.  <p>

	Since the mid-1980s the Walker and Whitney museums have been models and mirrors of the decadence and
 fiscal irresponsibility pervading the American arts establishment.  Representatives of both institutions are
 on Henry's influential &quot;special committee.&quot;  These &quot;cutting edge&quot; venues for self-mutilation
 performances and exhibits of plastic puddles of excrement and vomit have been funded targets of the 
public's outcry against National Endowment for the Arts grants<B>.</B>  (The Walker Museum sponsored the 
HIV-positive artist Ron Athey, who hoisted towels smeared with his victim's blood over the 
heads of art patrons.  The Whitney Biennial featured the poop and puke).  In any future history of the NEA's demise,
 the Walker and the Whitney surely will be featured for their roles in destroying a once bipartisan congressional 
consensus in support of the arts. <p>

	Fred Henry was no stranger to the gross and disgusting.  His Bohen Foundation had been a sponsor of a
 Bruce Nauman exhibit that was shown at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and at the Smithsonian's Hirshorn
 Museum.  It featured neon signs blinking &quot;F--- and Die,&quot; &quot;S--- and Die,&quot; and depicted excited
 male sexual organs and a merry-go-round of slaughtered animals.<p>

	Henry began his courtship of the American Center with a Bohen Foundation donation to support &quot;public
 art&quot; for the park at Bercy.  Well connected in the art-world, he also helped the Center secure money from New 
York City's public art fund in 1989.  By 1990 Bohen was on the American Center's board of directors.  Pisar had stayed
 on as titular Chairman of the board, but Henry in 1992 became Chairman of its Executive Committee.  In that capacity 
he organized the &quot;special committee&quot; of top officials in prominent arts institutions who reported directly 
to him.<P>

	How was Henry able to oust Pillsbury and outmaneuver Pisar? The answer is simple.  He used the assets of
 the Bohen Foundation to increase his influence among the artistic avant-garde so that they would second his 
recommendations on the fate of the American Center. In confronting the troubled institution, Henry's
 aggressive tactics were not unlike those of a corporate takeover artist.  The American Center was a target.  It would
 be a fine institution to run -- or sell -- after a leveraged buyout.  To secure its assets, which were worth over $40 
million, Henry needed only to make investments (i.e. contributions) of mere hundreds of thousands of dollars to 
his allies and then push the old guard aside.<p>

	According to IRS records, in 1991-92 the Bohen Foundation reported a contribution of only $50,000 to the
 American Center in Paris. (Bohen would eventually give about $500,000, roughly half of Henry Pillsbury's personal
 contributions over the years).  More interesting were the Bohen Foundation's grants to other American cultural 
institutions:  $173,000 went to the Whitney Museum of American Art, whose curator of Film and Video, John 
Hanhardt joined the &quot;special committee&quot; of the American Center in 1992; $50,000 went to Social 
Policy Inc. -- The New Press, headed by editor Andre Schiffrin who also joined Henry's &quot;special committee
&quot; in 1992; and $110,000 was contributed to the Museum of Modern Art, whose director, Richard Oldenburg
, joined the &quot;special committee&quot; as well.  A grant of $15,000 went to the Dia Center for the Arts, a venue
 for the avant-garde where Henry was a board member.  Its director joined the &quot;special committee&quot; in 1992,
 as did Harvey Lichtenstein, director of the Brooklyn Academy of Music.  BAM received $57,000 from the Bohen 
Foundation.  Clearly, the members of Henry's &quot;special committee&quot; were aware of his contributions to
 their institutions and unlikely to resist his plans for the Center.<p> 

	In 1994, members of the special committee were invited to join Henry in what an American Center press
 release called &quot;a radical innovation in the management of nonprofit cultural institutions.&quot;  The special
 committee had been &quot;assembled to help formulate and implement the Center's diverse artistic and educational
 program&quot; in order to develop &quot;a new strategic alliance&quot; which &quot;may signal the development 
of a new model for securing international hubs of artistic activity and exchange.&quot;  By such cloudy jargon did the
 arts elite ratify Henry's intention to sell the American Center's new building.  And what justified the sale would be a
 major philanthropy's predatory concept of how nonprofit arts organizations should deploy their resouces.<p> 

<hr>
<a name="Boardroom"></a>
<h3>INSIDE THE BOARDROOM</h3>
		Where did Henry get his ideas about how to proceed in philanthropy?  Some clue may be found in
 <I>Inside the Boardroom</I> (John Wiley, NY, 1994), a new book by William G. Bowen, president of the Andrew 
A. Mellon Foundation.  In his book, Bowen argues that the boards of directors of nonprofit organizations should 
take a more direct role in the day-to-day management of their institutions.  Henry followed this advice when he 
placed himself in power.  But he also innovated.  By consolidating decision-making in an &quot;Office of the Director,
&quot; but then sharing that post with the Mellon Foundation's Rachel Bellow, Henry devised a novel experiment in 
organizational infrastructure.<p>

	Henry's reliance on his &quot;special committee&quot; perhaps reflects Bowen's endorsement of outside
 consultants as a highly desirable board practice.  Bowen, a former president of Princeton University who once
 managed the private trusts of the Rockefeller family (estimated by <I>Fortune</I> magazine in 1986 to be worth some
 $3 billion) argues that good management requires &quot;the board should have ready access to advice from
 accountants, compensation consultants, lawyers, and investment bankers who are chosen by the outside directors,
 not by management,&quot; (i.e. the American Center's case, not Pillsbury and Pisar).   <p>

		More importantly, in <I>Inside the Boardroom, </I>Bowen specifically credits Rachel Bellow, Mellon's
 program officer on the American Center board, for helping reconcile the Center to its own suicide.  Concludes Bowen:
  &quot;More thought needs to be given, in my view, to ways of allowing nonprofits to achieve 'death with dignity'
 when that is appropriate.  In theory, some nonprofits recognize that institutional demise can signal success, not failure.
 . .For example, my colleague, Rachel Bellow, has called my attention to the Free Southern Theatre in New Orleans. . .The
 theater staged a large funeral through the streets of New Orleans and artists from all over the country attended to 
celebrate the 'death' (read:success) of the theater.&quot;<p>  

	What occurred in New Orleans foreshadowed what followed in Paris.  By hiring Marie-Claude Beaud
 as Pillsbury's successor, Henry and Bellow selected more than a promoter of the international avant-garde. 
 The former curator at the Fondation Cartier dreamed about shutting down cultural institutions
</B>Beaud once actually once told a journalist that she would like to close Cartier's museum and sell its collection. 
 In September 1992 she declared to Elspeth Moncrieff of Britain's <I>Apollo</I> magazine: &quot;With the ease of
 modern-day travel it makes more sense for the Fondation to contribute to existing centres of excellence, rather than
 create another institution in a minor Parisian suburb...There is no point in continuing to build our own collection...
If you have a collection, you need a museum and curators.  Even lending the works involves a good deal of
 administration all of which eats into our grant.  If I had my way I would give away the Fondation's collection,
 with the exception of the works which hang in our corporate offices.&quot;  When she took over the American
 Center one could ask for no clearer statement of Beaud's philosophy.<p>

		In his new mission statement for the Center, Henry declared his constituency to be not Americans
 or the French, but &quot;an international community.&quot;  He promised &quot;an entrepreneurship of new 
expressions.&quot;  Henry had made sure that he was joined in his venture by the most powerful officials from 
America's private arts bureaucracy.  And to the modest assets of his Bohen Foundation he added the backing of
 William Bowen's Andrew Mellon Foundation, whose $2 billion in assets makes it the largest single grantmaker in
 the arts and humanities in the United States. <p>

		Rachel Bellow, the woman who advised Bowen on the successful death of the New Orleans theater,
 is a program officer in the arts and humanities at the Mellon Foundation.  Her division alone distributes some $20 
million annually.  Bellow is widely considered an expert on arts management.  She has served as a consultant to the
 NEA and is married to Adam Bellow, an important neoconservative editor at The Free Press who is the son of novelist
 Saul Bellow.  Like the other art world denizens selected by Fred Henry, Bellow had been invited to join his
 &quot;special committee&quot; in 1992 for a purpose.  She was given leave by the Mellon Foundation for her
 new assignment. By 1993 Bellow was Henry's full partner in the newly constituted &quot;Office of the Director.
&quot;  But what was her purpose?<p>

		Some might have supposed that the Mellon Foundation would open its deep pockets to the Center.  
Former Center staffers thought so.  In 1993, Bellow's division in the Mellon Foundation gave $15 million in a single 
grant to the National Gallery of Art.  But they would misjudge the intentions of Henry and Bellow.<p>

		Consider, for instance, the disposition of a $440,000 Mellon grant to the American Center in 1993
 which was personally approved by William Bowen.  Mellon's annual report claims the grant went &quot;to 
strengthen its [the American Center's] core programs, collaborations with smaller arts organizations and financial
 stability.&quot;  Did the report's bland prose admit of a new definition for the Center's &quot;core programs,
&quot; or was the report a misrepresentation to the Mellon Foundation's board?<p>

		Certainly, the Mellon Foundation could have rescued the American Center had Bowen wished it.
  Would Mellon's Board Chairman, John C. Whitehead, Deputy Secretary of State in the Reagan Administration 
and a former head of Goldman, Sachs, have permitted the sinking of a flagship American cultural institution?  
Indeed, Bowen's book quoted Whitehead's own personal observation that &quot;A for-profit board has an 
obligation to <I>get out</I> of a bad business while a nonprofit board may have an obligation to <I>stay in</I>,
 if it is to be true to its mission.&quot;  <p>

		The mystery is that Henry, Bowen and Bellow were indifferent to such basic obligations.  Should
 not Whitehead call them to account for their decision to kill the symbol of American culture in Paris?  After all, it
 was William Bowen himself who wrote in <I>Inside the Boardroom, &quot;Nonprofit boards are tremendously 
important.  They can have more impact on the success or failure of an organization than can most for-profit 
boards.&quot;</I><p>

<a name="Who Is"></a>
<h3>WHO IS WILLIAM BOWEN</h3>
	William Bowen is widely perceived as a mentor to University of Pennsylvania President Sheldon Hackney,
 the Clinton Administration's selection for Chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities.  A 1965 Bowen
 study laid much of the groundwork for the National Endowment for the Arts.<p>

***
<hr>
<a name="Never"></a>
<h3>	NEVER ASKED BOX</h3>
<b> 		Anne Radice, the first director of the National Museum of Women in the Arts (and acting chairman of
 the National Endowment for the Arts under President Bush) pointed out, she had built a new museum, with a new 
constituency, and an income-generating membership, with programs that required an annual operating budget of 
$6 million. And the National Museum of Women in the Arts did it without any endowment, and in a building which
 required monthly mortgage payments, and an initial $5 million renovation. <p>

		How did she do it? &quot;We were careful how we spent our money,&quot; Radice says. &quot;I
 wouldn't do an exhibit without underwriting. Never. We paid for everything before we did it. I never planned a budget
 on the receipt of grants.  And so we never had to fire people. Every night when I went to bed, I felt personally 
responsible for all of our employees. I would never have jeopardized their jobs.&quot;Clearly, had the American
 Center asked Radice, who has a MBA in addition to her doctorate in Art History (in Florentine art), and experience
 as an international cultural officer with USIA specializing in public diplomacy, she might have been able to help them
 out. The sad part is, as she notes, &quot;I was never approached.&quot;Ironically, Radice became available in
 November, 1992, when President Bush lost his bid for-re-election. Today she is involved with a different private
 foundation, not funding the arts.<p>

</B>(Architect Gehry disputes the figure, assigning a cost of $27 million, including architect's fees). 

 (Sadly, this relic was chopped down by the Fondation Cartier, the corporate foundation of the jewelry business, 
when it took over the site in 1990.)

<h3>MEMO -- FROM THE PRESIDENT'S DESK</h3>
<P>
TO: CRC FRIENDS
<br>
FR: <a href="/crc/about/people.html#scanlon">TERRY SCANLON</a>
<P>
RE: WHAT'S HOT AT CAPITAL RESEARCH CENTER
<P>
The record-breaking high temperatures that swept through the country
during July and August were matched by Capital Research Center.
We've been red-hot this summer.
<P>
Capital has added new staff, upgraded its technology, refurbished
its meeting facilities and taken on new projects. We have published
an annual report, distributed ground-breaking issues of our monthly
newsletters, and made substantial progress on our annual corporate
giving study and special reports scheduled for publication by
year's end.
<P>
The board elected a new director, the Hon. William E. Simon, former
secretary of the U.S. Treasury, past president of the U.S. Olympic
Committee, and chairman of William E. Simon &amp; Sons. But the
highlight of the summer was watching House Republicans reform
the federal grant system. All this and more is inside <I>Capital
Report</I>, so read on!
<P>
<a name="reform"></a>
<h3>Congress Reforms the Grant Process;</B> <B>Calls on CRC for
Help </h3>
<P>
Americans are becoming more and more aware of how federally-funded
nonprofits use taxpayer money to influence public policy. Tax-exempt
advocacy groups get almost <B>$40 billion</B> a year in federal
grant money, and much of it goes directly or indirectly to lobbying
for even more tax dollars. Ending this unethical use of taxpayer
money has long been Capital Research Center's goal. For 11 years,
CRC has monitored the flow of government and private funds to
nonprofits and researched how that money was used. We believe
a nonprofit organization should deliver services to those in need
-- not use taxpayers' forced charity to lobby the government for
higher taxes, increased spending, more regulations -- and additional
money for an organization itself. Capital spreads this message
in its publications and public statements. For instance, CRC Research
Director Robert Huberty discussed the issue this summer as a panelist
during a Heritage Foundation seminar.
<P>
This was about the time Congress addressed the problem of charities
soliciting government welfare for their lobbyists. CRC President
Terry Scanlon testified before a U.S. House of Representatives
subcommittee in June about how to stop tax-exempt special interest
groups from using tax dollars to promote their own public policy
agendas. His message: break this vicious circle.
<P>
&quot;Federal agencies go to Congress asking for more money while
funding the groups that lobby for more government funding. Having
become accustomed to receiving their treasury checks, these groups
have a vested interest in the perpetuation of the status quo.
It is a vicious circle,&quot; Scanlon told the House National
Economic Growth, Natural Resources and Regulatory Affairs Subcommittee.
<P>
In August, the House passed legislation by Republican Reps. David
McIntosh (IN), Ernest J. Istook, Jr. (OK) and Robert L. Ehrlich,
Jr. (MD) that goes a long way toward restoring integrity to the
federal grant process. Using information developed in part by
CRC, House reformers won support for a law prohibiting tax-supported
charities from using any federal grants for lobbying purposes
and to make them accountable if they spend their non-federal dollars
on advocacy. The legislation provides for auditing and reporting
how grant money was used and how much advocacy is practiced. The
House approved the legislation as part of the Labor/Health and
Human Services appropriation. The Senate, which earlier passed
legislation regarding nonprofits in its lobbying reform bill,
will take up the Labor/HHS appropriation in the fall.
<P>
&quot;Nonprofit advocacy groups who rely on federal grants must
realize that government money is not necessary to amplify their
appeals for charity. Until they realize this, every organization
that criticizes the McIntosh legislation should be obligated to
disclose how much government money they accept and how much they
lobby.&quot; Scanlon said. Of course, CRC does not solicit nor
accept any government money.
<P>
<a name="scanlon"></a>
<B>A Plan for Reform</B> 
<P>
The practice of nonprofit advocacy groups lobbying for public
policy changes that benefit themselves is a vicious circle that
Congress has recognized must be broken. The scope of the problem
is broad. For instance, the American Association of Retired Persons
receives about one-quarter of its budget ($85.9 million) from
the federal government. The National Council of Senior Citizens,
a charitable lobbying group, gets 96 percent of its budget (almost
$70 million) from the federal cash cow.
<P>
CRC President Terry Scanlon testified before Congress in June
and recommended that leaders enact a four-part plan to show it
is serious about reforming the federal grant process and to preserve
the independence and integrity of the nonprofit sector. Scanlon
suggested Congress:
<OL>
<LI>Break the circle. Congress should enact legislation severely
capping the amount of non-government dollars that charities accepting
federal grants can spend on advocacy. Of course, the ideal solution
would be to bar nonprofit advocacy groups from receiving <U>any</U>
taxpayer funds.
<LI>Don't let them launder their money. The law should extend
the cap on advocacy to affiliate organizations. If Congress skips
this step, grant recipients will set up affiliates and subsidiary
organizations -- often run out of the same office -- to engage
in lobbying activities.
<LI>Let the sun shine in. Agencies should be required to provide
the public, on a regular basis, detailed information about its
grantmaking. Government officials should name and describe the
organizations that receive their grants, the size and purpose
of the grants, and what kind of lobbying a grantee has performed.
Furthermore, committee and subcommittee chairmen should require
panelists testifying at congressional hearings to reveal the amount
of taxpayer dollars their organization has received during previous
years.
<LI>Give the law sharp teeth. The law should contain an effective
enforcement mechanism that will levy steep fines on officials
who break the rules and retrieve the grant from government-funded
nonprofits that violate the advocacy restrictions. Also, groups
that break the law should be ineligible for future government
grants or contract.
</OL>

<P>
The House recently passed legislation that closely mirrors Scanlon's
recommendations. The Senate was scheduled to consider the bill
after the August recess.
<P>
<a name="advice"></a>
<B>Scanlon Advice Hits Home</B> 
<P>
Republicans hadn't held the majority for forty decades when the
tidal wave class of 1996 allowed it to take control of the 104th
Congress. Unfortunately, the party was a bit rusty when it came
to the hearing process. In many cases, members were absent, inattentive
or unprepared for hearings. Chairmen failed to invite key conservative
witnesses to testify and allowed Democrat members to interrupt
their testimony with patronizing dismissals, sarcastic rebuttals
and blatant attempts to intimidate.
<P>
CRC President Terry Scanlon, former chairman of the Consumer Product
Safety Commission under Ronald Reagan, knows what it was like
to face a well-organized congressional committee. That's why he
penned an op-ed for <I>The Washington Times</I> that advised the
new Republican chairmen to control the selection and questioning
of witnesses to present their causes in the best possible light.
<P>
After the piece appeared, Republicans made efforts to tighten
up their hearings. House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-TX) distributed
the op-ed to all committee chairmen. First-termer Rep. Bob Barr
(R-GA) passed it out at a freshman class meeting. And after the
Whitewater and Waco hearings, which were widely seen as a fumbled
opportunity for the majority, the leadership developed a two-page
primer on how to conduct hearings. When Congress returns from
the August recess they will have another opportunity to enact
the public agenda that votes supported last November.
<P>
<a name="lacey"></a>
<B>CRC Researcher <a href="/crc/about/people.html#lacey">Lacey</a> Testifies about Americorps</B> 
<P>
When the Republican House began reviewing the effectiveness of
Americorps, the President's expensive and faulty attempt to invigorate
the spirit of service, they turned to Capital Research Center
for information. Rep. Christopher Shays (R-CT), House Human Resources
and Intergovernmental Relations Subcommittee chairman, invited
<I><a href="/crc/books/pcs/">Philanthropy, Culture and Society</a></I> Editor Jill Lacey to
testify at a May hearing.
<P>
Lacey gave Congress an eye-witness account of the Georgia Peach
Corps, a $2.8 million Americorps demonstration project she visited
last year. She outlined on the obviously discernible problems
of the program: the teenagers not being volunteers (they were
paid $4.25 an hour plus a $5,000 tuition grant); the grossly under-estimated
cost (the Georgia program's high drop-out rate rocketed the cost
per graduate to $35,000 a year); and the marginal value of their
projects to the community (because by law Americorps cannot displace
any government workers).
<P>
&quot;We often hear that Americorps is 'making a difference.'
But the phrase is an empty one. Everything we do makes a difference
-- even spending money foolishly makes a difference. The question
is: What kind of difference?&quot; Lacey asked the subcommittee.
<P>
The answer exposes as flawed the very premise for Americorps.
While the idea of volunteering is to help others, Lacey said,
Americorps focuses more on the volunteer -- not the populations
they purportedly serve.
<P>
&quot;Continual pulse-taking in the form of rap sessions, journaling
exercises and self evaluation sends this message loud and clear:
self esteem, not self sacrifice, is the order of the day,&quot;
Lace observed. This summer, the House zeroed out Americorps' appropriation.
<P>
<a name="growth"></a>
<h3>CRC: GROWING BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS</h3> 
<P>
As Capital's work becomes more prominent and effective, the think
tank is called on to accomplish more and more. The result is Capital's
evolution into a more comprehensive and efficient operation.
<P>
After 11 years of steady growth, CRC's profile has risen high
enough to warrant an in-house communications department. Natasha
L. DeWees joined Capital's staff as director of communications
on May 30 to get this operation up and running. Communications
services were previously provided by Hugh C. Newton and Associates.
<P>
DeWees is former press secretary for U.S. Rep. Porter J. Goss
(R-FL). She has two degrees in journalism, including a master's
from the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University
in Evanston, Ill. The communications position was funded for two
years by a donor who wishes to remain anonymous.
<P>
One major emphasis of CRC's new communications department is to
reach the enormous audience of talk radio. In June, DeWees attended
the annual convention of the National Association of Radio Talk
Show Hosts in Houston. She introduced hosts and producers to CRC's
mission and promoted the center's latest studies. The event enabled
CRC to build a network of radio contacts throughout the nation.
Capital Research associates have already been invited to speak
on radio shows around the country, most recently in Seattle, Salt
Lake City and Detroit.
<P>
<U><I>Facilities Upgrade</I></U> 
<P>
CRC's external growth has prompted comprehensive internal improvements
in our facilities, from upgraded computers to our new E.L Wiegand
conference room.
<P>
Thanks to a new computer system installed in May, CRC's staff
now has access to two new research tools: the Federal Awards Assistance
Data System (FAADS) and Nexis. Nexis is a private database of
national and international news and information on politics, business
and industry. FAADS is a federal database that documents the thousands
of groups that receive millions of taxpayer dollars through the
federal grant process. Using this information, CRC can track organizations
that might use government money to influence public policy.
<P>
Equally impressive is CRC's refurbished conference room. The room's
new paint, trim, carpet, furniture and fixtures provide a more
professional and comfortable environment for meetings and special
projects. Both the computer system and the new conference room
were made possible through the kind generosity of the E. L . Wiegand
Foundation.
<P>
<B>CRC Appoints New Patterns Editor</B> 
<P>
New to the CRC roster is <a href="/crc/about/people.html#Fulk">Austin Fulk</a>, a Little Rock native who
will serve as principal researcher and author of the ninth annual
edition of <I><a href="/crc/patterns/">Patterns in Corporate Philanthropy</a></I>. A 1992<B>
</B>graduate of John Hopkins University, Fulk has considerable
experience in the Washington policy community, serving most recently
the 104th Congress as press aide to freshman Rep. George Radanovich
(R-CA). Fulk's experience includes an internship with U.S. Rep.
Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA).
<P>
Fulk replaces Stuart Nolan, who will attend law school at the
Catholic University of America. Nolan will continue to share with
us his extensive knowledge of corporate philanthropy as a CRC
adjunct fellow.
<P>
<B>Interns Gain Big Experience</B> 
<P>
Capital Research Center was fortunate this summer to have three
dedicated student interns. Jennifer J. Waite, a political science
major at Georgetown College in Kentucky, served a six-week internship
with CRC's new communications department. We are grateful to the
Fund for American Studies which supported her internship with
us. We are equally grateful to the Charles Koch Foundation for
providing CRC with two of its Koch Fellows. Eliot Jamison, an
economics and philosophy major at Columbia, and Boris Shor, an
international affairs major at Princeton, ably assisted our research
staff in preparing our annual <I>Patterns in Corporate Philanthropy</I>
and a forthcoming book on environmental groups. Each also authored
an independent study for future CRC publications. Jamison's study
examines the effect of the proposed flat tax on charitable giving.
Shor's study explores the impact of consumer advocacy groups on
international trade issues.
<P><a name="heats"></a>
<B>CRC <a href="/crc/about/pubs.html">Publications</a> Hot Off the Presses</B> 
<P>
Capital's efforts to affect more responsible philanthropy made
dramatic headway this summer. Monthly newsletters set the tempo
for many public policy debates in the media and in Congress. We
expect these studies to become even more effective, because we
began distributing them to all conservative members of Congress.
And as always, Capital's single-subject books continue to provide
in-depth coverage of the forces influencing the nation's social
philosophy. (Already in the first seven months of 1995 our book
sales have exceeded 1994 sales.) Here are the some of the highlights
of the summer's publications.
<P>
The July <I><a href="/crc/trends/">OT</a></I> looked at the heavily politicized agenda of
an organization that ought to be a model of nonprofit community
service -- the National Trust for Historic Preservation. In recent
years, however, the organization has dramatically changed and
expanded its activities to promote political advocacy of public
policies at odds with a free society. The National Trust fights
legal and public relations battles against commercial expansion
that creates jobs and builds the tax base for local communities.
And it does this with the help of taxpayer dollars. In an unprecedented
challenge to the Trust's appropriation of federal funds (which
accounts for 20 percent of its $33 million budget), the House
this summer voted to phase-out funding for the trust over two
years.
<P>
Professor James T. Bennett continued his expos&eacute; of the
American Cancer Society in the July <I><a href="/crc/ap/">Alternatives</a></I>. The report
revealed how ACS utilizes federal funds to lobby for higher taxes
on tobacco, rather than educate smokers about health risks. The
report also related financial mismanagement by the society's state
officials. Weeks after this newsletter hit the streets, several
of the officials spotlighted by <I>Alternatives</I> were reassigned,
and another was arrested for forgery.
<P>
Last spring CRC released <I><a href="/crc/books/neighbor.html">The Rise of the Nanny State</a></I>, visiting
fellow Tom Holt's history of the consumer movement. The report
is a startling account of how Ralph Nader's organizations form
an iron triangle with trial lawyers and federal agency bureaucrats
to put a choke-hold on consumer choice and individual responsibility.
Holt shows how this relationship has turned America into a &quot;nanny
state.&quot; The author appeared on many talk shows to discuss
how the federal government interferes with Americans' lives, and
he often debated representatives of the consumerists movement
that he profiled. During one memorable appearance, Holt coaxed
a US PIRG representative to agree that it is a good idea to make
public the financial relationships among these three groups.
<P>
Clinton administration officials at the U.S. Information Agency
(USIA) carefully read CRC's report on the federal government's
academic exchange program, <I><a href="/crc/books/fulbrit.html">The Fulbright Program After 50 years.</a></I>
Facing intense pressure from congressional budget-cutters, USIA
officials convened several formal meetings to discuss what they
called &quot;The Gayner Report,&quot; CRC author Jeffrey Gayner's
recommendations for reduced U.S. funding and increased private
and foreign support for the student and scholar exchange program.
The death of former Arkansas Sen. J. William Fulbright one week
before the report was released also heightened interest in the
study.
<P>
Finally, the business community sat up and took notice of <I>Patterns
VIII</I> after House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-TX) wrote CEOs
of the Forbes 250 companies we study and questioned whether their
corporate giving was indeed pro-business. The side effects of
the Leader's much-publicized letter generated a remarkable amount
of publicity and howls of protest from Ralph Nader, <I>The Washington
Post</I>, Hillary Clinton and liberal members of Congress. We
knew we had hit our target! Since then there has been an increase
in cooperation from corporations releasing their giving information
to us. Several of the companies and advocacy groups have even
asked CRC how they can reform their giving practices and improve
their rating. American Airlines and the Nature Conservancy are
among those who have contacted CRC.
<P>
<a name="lagacy"></a>
<B>Provide a Legacy for Enlightened Giving</B> 
<P>
One of Capital Research Center's best selling books, <I><a href="/crc/books/pdi.html">The Great
Philanthropists and the Problem of Donor Intent</a>
</I>, studies how
the last wishes of yesterday's great philanthropists are less
and less a factor in the giving philosophy of their foundations
today. Careful estate planning, however, can ensure that a donor's
intentions will be honored.
<P>
By carefully thinking through giving objectives, pre-determined
gifts to groups like CRC can benefit donors as much as the beneficiary.
Such a gift to Capital accomplishes several worthwhile objectives.
Not only does it ensure that your bequest will be used as you
wish, but it provides resources enabling Capital to promote informed
giving practices; educate policy makers and opinion leaders about
nonprofit advocacy groups; and highlight the real achievements
of individual charity and the liabilities of much professional
philanthropy. Further, such a gift reduces your estate tax burden
by providing a charitable deduction equal to the value of the
bequest at the time of your death.
<P>
<I>Types of Bequests</I> 
<P>
Bequests are provision made in your will or living trusts that
specifically set forth the portion or actual dollar amount that
you wish transferred to a charity after death.
<P>
A <B>general bequest</B> is a gift that is payable from the general
assets of your estate. The usual general bequest directs that
a certain sum of money be paid to Capital Research Center.
<P>
A <B>specific bequest</B> gives a particular item or real or personal
property to CRC. For example, &quot;I direct that 5,000 shares
of XYZ Corporation stock be transferred to Capital Research Center.&quot;
<P>
A <B>residuary bequest</B> provides CRC with the remainder of
your estate after all of your debts, expenses and taxes have been
paid and all general and specific bequests satisfied. For example,
&quot;I direct that all (or a specific percent) of the rest, residue
and remainder of my estate be given to Capital Research Center.&quot;
<P>
A <B>contingent bequest</B> makes CRC a beneficiary of you estate
only when designated beneficiaries fail to survive you. For example,
&quot;If any of the above-named beneficiaries should predecease
me or no longer exist, I direct that the share of the beneficiary
be transferred to Capital Research Center.&quot;
<P>
A <B>bequest by codicil</B> allows people who have completed their
will to make a bequest to CRC without rewriting the entire will.
For example, &quot;I, (your name), a resident of (your address),
make this codicil to my last will and testament executed by me
on (date). I hereby modify and amend my last will and testament
as follows: (enter a type of bequest as suggested above). Except
as my last will and testament is expressly modified or amended
by the codicil, I ratify and reaffirm my last will and testament
in its entirety.&quot; This codicil then must be signed by you
and witnessed in accordance with the laws of your state.
<P>
These are just a few of the possible choices available to individuals
who want to continue to help causes they believe worthy. All of
the above examples and suggested language are provided by CRC
for informational purposes only. But you can learn more by contacting
Capital's Director of Development Julie Taylor at 202-393-2600.

&quot;The Nature Conservancy looks like a good and genuine environmental
organization and some years ago I joined it. Then I saw that they
sell most of their lands to the government and left. 'The Nature
Conservancy: Sell It to the Feds' is an article...confirming them
as collection agents for the government.&quot;

&quot;Before sending another dollar to the United Way or health
charities such as American Lung Association, American Cancer Society

Philanthropy' and has found that American corporations are politicking
